25|$|In {{the quarterfinals}} at Knott Arena on March 4, the Mountaineers lost 73–58 to Saint Francis (PA), the No. 5 seed, and were {{eliminated}} from the tournament. It marked only the third time Mount St. <b>Mary's</b> <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> NEC Tournament game at home, {{and the first time}} since 2006.

50|$|Stewart {{was born}} Isidore Steinberg in Brooklyn, New York to Jacob and Dora Steinberg, who were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Russia. He {{changed his name}} to Bob Stewart after he <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> in television believing that it was because he was Jewish.|$|R
5000|$|On {{his death}} John Gawsworth became both his {{literary}} executor and his appointed {{heir to the}} [...] "kingdom". Gawsworth took the legend of Redonda to heart. He never <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to further elaborate the tale and spread the story to the press.|$|R
60|$|It {{was thus}} that Bucklaw, in the {{perturbation}} of his embarrassment upon this critical occasion, forgot the just apprehensions he had entertained of Lady Ashton's overbearing ascendency over her daughter's mind, and <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of ascertaining, {{by his own}} investigation, the real state of Lucy's feelings.|$|R

60|$|Tarzan on {{his part}} never <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to show that he}} fully {{reciprocated}} his foster father's sentiments, and whenever he could safely annoy him or make faces at him or hurl insults upon him from the safety of his mother's arms, or the slender branches of the higher trees, he did so.|$|R
50|$|She {{competed in}} the 2002 European Athletics Championships and 2006 European Athletics Championships, but did not advance.

60|$|He {{seemed to}} be unwilling to accept the invitation--then altered his mind, and {{followed}} Francine. She had visited Emily; she was perhaps in a fair way to become Emily's friend.

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{compromise}} worked out by Ghanouchi and Beji Caid Essebsi, the party (or at least its leader), has been complimented for it willingness to compromise, protecting Tunisia's democracy and civil peace from Egyptian style violence.

50|$|Being one of {{the most}} charismatic players in Europe he {{attracted}} a number of offers from the biggest European clubs. Yet in the early 1990s - prior to the implementation of the ECJ's Bosman ruling - when Juventus and Fiorentina had offered him a contract, Panathinaikos' chairman Yiorgos Vardinogiannis rejected the transfers - Saravakos thus <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to continue his successful career in Serie A.|$|R
60|$|The moonshee {{shook his}} head. Between these two a {{perpetual}} feud had existed, {{ever since the}} native had arrived at Arcot, {{to take his place}} as a member of Charlie's establishment.

[...] "And as for those catalogues of theirs, they're the Avonlea girls' Bible now, that's what. They pore over them on Sundays instead of studying the Holy Scriptures." ...|$|R

25|$|Guderian’s army seized more {{important}} bridgeheads at Lubny and Lokhvitsa, the latter by the 3rd Panzer Division. The 38th Army’s attempt {{to prevent this}} was a disaster.

German fighters established an air umbrella over the First Panzer Army under Ewald von Kleist as he moved rapidly north to meet Guderian.|$|R

50|$|According to James Butts, he <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for <b>a</b> {{basketball}} {{scholarship to}} go to Cal State-Los Angeles in his youth, due to an injury. To pay for college, he worked part-time at the Inglewood Police Department as the division's second African American cadet. It later turned into a full-time job. Butts earned an MBA degree from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and a Bachelor of Science from California State University, Los Angeles.|$|R

2500|$|In 1803 Phoebe was sailing out of [...] Malta. At some point, perhaps {{during the}} summer, her boats {{participated in a}} {{disastrous}} attack on two French privateers off Civitavecchia. The privateers repulsed the British, who lost eight men killed and wounded. On 1 August, Phoebe captured two settées, which a French squadron recaptured. In recapturing the settees, the French squadron involved <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to capture Phoebe, though they did capture the schooner [...] and a transport.|$|R
50|$|The city of Kano {{is renowned}} for being very {{politically}} active and cosmopolitan {{and its people}} reputed for both political and business acumen. This holds true in Bashir’s case, as {{not only did he}} become involved in politics at a rather young age, but also began his foray into business and profit-making at an even younger age. As a child Bashir never <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to make <b>an</b> income, buying and selling items from and to youngsters his age.|$|R

60|$|Longueville {{remained}} there {{staring at the}} view but not especially seeing it. He {{felt as if he}} had at once enjoyed and <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity.</b> After <b>a</b> while he tried to make a sketch of the old beggar-woman who sat there in a sort of palsied immobility, like a rickety statue at a church-door. But his attempt to reproduce her features was not gratifying, and he suddenly laid down his brush. She was not pretty enough--she had a bad profile.|$|R
40|$|The Urbani Code {{has pursued}} two goals: {{to be an}} {{operational}} tool to defend and to valorise the Italian cultural heritage; to arrange the interaction between National and Regional Governments. Libraries and Archives are also placed in this framework but Urbani Code considers them as "storage places" more than research tools: libraries and archives are "sons of a minor god". In conclusion, the article points that the Urbani Code has <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to recognize the status of "cultural heritage" for libraries and archives, too...|$|R
5000|$|The Pheu Thai Party {{lamented the}} decision, {{stating that the}} country had <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to move on and}} that the court had {{established}} an [...] "infamous standard" [...] by which an entire election can be overturned because of disruptions at some polling stations. Opposition MP Chuwit Kamolvisit issued a similar statement: [...] "court has set a standard {{that if you want to}} overturn an election, you just find someones to block a few polling stations....Just do this and you can make the whole election void." ...|$|R
25|$|Instead, Dubreton led {{a masterful}} defense, thwarting Wellington's assaults time after time. The British commander's hopes were blasted when his {{attempts}} to contain the twin French counteroffensives failed. With large French relief armies approaching Burgos from the northeast and Madrid from the southeast, the British commander withdrew to the west, abandoning large areas of Spain that had been recently liberated. That fall the French <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to defeat Wellington's army. Nevertheless, during the withdrawal to Portugal the Anglo-Portuguese army lost many men to pursuing French cavalry and starvation.|$|R
6000|$|My attendants had {{pitched the}} Gurgi or hut: the Hammal and Long Guled were, however, sulky {{on account of}} my absence, and the Kalendar {{appeared}} disposed to be mutinous. The End of Time, who never <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to make mischief, whispered in my ear, [...] "Despise thy wife, thy son, and thy servant, or they despise thee!" [...] The old saw was not wanted, however, to procure for them a sound scolding. Nothing is worse for the Eastern traveller than the habit of [...] "sending to Coventry:"--it does away with all manner of discipline.|$|R
60|$|On that night, {{as it may}} be imagined, {{the gates}} of the Castle of Cleves were not shut. Everybody was free to come in. Wine-butts were {{broached}} in all the courts; the pickled meat prepared in such lots for the siege was distributed among the people, who crowded to congratulate their beloved sovereign on his victory; and the Prince, as was customary with that good man, who never <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of giving <b>a</b> dinner-party, had a splendid entertainment made ready for the upper classes, the whole concluding with a tasteful display of fireworks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Afterwards, {{while you}} were trying hard to open, undetected, the sealed history of my early life, I was warily {{discovering}} from Margaret all that I desired to know. I say 'warily,' but the word poorly expresses my consummate caution and patience, at that time. I never put myself in her power, never risked offending, or frightening, or revolting her; never <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of bringing {{her back to her}} old habits of familiarity; and, more than all, never gave her mother <b>a</b> single <b>opportunity</b> of detecting me. This was the sum of what I gathered up, bit by bit, from secret and scattered investigations, persevered in through many weeks.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{understood}} as a victory of carriers, Midway showed up deficiencies in Japanese operational planning. Yamamoto, considering his battleships the most valuable units, kept them far to the rear, in line with traditional practice. This placed them {{too far away to}} assist Nagumo (and they would have been too slow to keep up with him in any case). Yet, when Nagumo's carriers were sunk, Yamamoto <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to salvage something. Carriers, for all their evident potency, were virtually defenseless at night, and Fletcher might have been dealt a crushing blow on Yamato the night of 6-7 June, had Yamamoto stayed closer.|$|R
5000|$|After Čabrinović's bomb {{missed the}} Archduke's car, four other conspirators <b>lost</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to attack {{because of the}} heavy crowds and the high speed of the Archduke's car. To avoid capture, Čabrinović {{swallowed}} a cyanide capsule and jumped into the River Miljacka {{to make sure he}} died. The cyanide pill was expired and made him sick but failed to kill him, and the River Miljacka was only 10 cm deep. A few seconds later he was hauled out and detained by police. As he was taken away, he supposedly was heard saying [...] "I am a Serb hero." ...|$|R
