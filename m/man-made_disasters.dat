5|$|As governor, Carroll {{increased}} funding {{for public education}} and promoted the use of coal {{as a means of}} alleviating the 1973 energy crisis. He also oversaw a major reorganization of the state's judicial system following voters' approval of a constitutional amendment in 1975. Many natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> occurred during his term in office, including the Great Blizzard of 1978 and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire, leading to better safety practices and stricter law enforcement in the state. When Carroll left office, both he and his predecessor were under the cloud of an investigation for an alleged insurance kickback scheme, but Carroll was not convicted of any wrongdoing. In 2004, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky Senate. Re-elected in 2008 and 2012, he won a fourth term without opposition in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters.</b> Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters.</b> In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} air pollution, mass demonstrations protesting unhealthful {{conditions}} {{were held in}} cities such as Yerevan in the Armenian SSR. Official reports confirmed that more than 100 of the largest Soviet cities registered air quality indexes ten times worse than permissible levels. In one of the most publicized cases, the inhabitants of Kirishi, a city not far from Leningrad, succeeded in closing a chemical plant whose toxic emissions were found to be harming—and in some cases killing—the city's residents. Finally, separate, highly publicized cases of <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters,</b> the most prominent of which was the Chernobyl' nuclear power plant accident in 1986, highlighted the fragility of the manproduction -nature relationship in the Soviet Union and forced a reconsideration of traditional attitudes and policies toward industrialization and development.|$|E
40|$|Aims. To {{examine the}} {{lifetime}} prevalence {{and risk of}} psychiatric disorders associated with natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> exposure in Australia. Methods. We utilised data from a nationally representative population survey (N = 8841) which were analysed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression {{in order to examine}} the full spectrum of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) affective, anxiety and substance use disorders associated with exposure to natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster.</b> Results. <b>Man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> exposure was primarily associated with an increased lifetime risk (odds ratio (95 % CI)) of alcohol abuse disorder 2. 29 (1. 56 – 3. 37), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 2. 27 (1. 36 – 3. 79), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) 1. 95 (1. 08 – 3. 51) and major depressive disorder 1. 69 (1. 01 – 2. 85). Multiple natural disaster exposure was associated with an increased lifetime risk of panic disorder 2. 26 (1. 11 – 4. 61). Among the broader disorder spectrum examined, alcohol abuse disorder accounted for the single greatest increase in lifetime disorder prevalence associated with <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> exposure, and the greatest number of natural or <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> exposed individuals who had developed a lifetime psychiatric disorder. Despite the relatively greater disorder risk associated with manmade disaster, natural disaster exposure was associated with more cases of psychiatric disorder, likely due to the frequency with which these events occur in Australia. Conclusions. Notwithstanding the inability to draw causal inferences from cross-sectional survey data, populationbased analyses provide a comprehensive and consistent method to ascertain the population imprint of psychiatric disorder and disaster exposure. Mental health policy and services should be targeting a range of psychiatric disorders in disaster contexts in addition to the usual focus on PTSD and depression, including alcohol abuse, panic disorder and OCD. Despite the relatively greater disorder risk associated with <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> exposure, the national burden of psychiatric disorder in natural disaster contexts is particularly high.

25|$|The {{expansion}} of these roles have culminated in assisting {{the creation of}} a society where NGOs serve as important players in the global arena in regards to maintaining human security. Due to this increasing influence and the emergence of growing natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters,</b> NGOs now are contracted by governments in order to adequately respond to crises, as well as assist individual or collectivised groups of citizens in lobbying their interests; thus culminating in the ability to enact, influence and change government agendas. However, NGOs are still largely dependent on certain levels of government funding, hence critics may argue that NGOs pose the ability to potentially damage issues of human security due to this financial dependence. Despite these critiqes, the focus, expertise and infrastructure developed by NGOs through their activities linked with human development and human rights allow them to make unique contributions to human security provision.|$|E

2500|$|The Encyclopedia {{databases}} {{are much}} about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on feedback loops {{has proven to be}} an important feature of the Encyclopedia, and a program has been carried out to identify [...] "vicious problem loops". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain. [...] Here is an example: <b>Man-made</b> <b>disasters,</b> Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, <b>Man-made</b> <b>disasters.</b> Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.|$|E
