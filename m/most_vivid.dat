25|$|According to Woolf's memoirs, her <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> {{childhood}} memories were not of London but of St Ives, Cornwall, {{where the family}} spent every summer until 1895. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, looked out over Porthminster Bay, and is still standing, though somewhat altered. Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years, most notably To the Lighthouse. She describes why she felt so connected to Talland House in a diary entry dated March 22, 1921.|$|E
5000|$|Terrestrial mole {{salamanders}} are identified by having wide, protruding eyes, prominent costal grooves, and thick arms. <b>Most</b> have <b>vivid</b> patterning on dark backgrounds, with marks ranging from deep blue spots to large yellow bars {{depending on the}} species. Terrestrial adults {{spend most of their}} lives underground in burrows, either of their own making or abandoned by other animals. Some northern species may hibernate in these burrows throughout the winter. They live alone and feed on any available invertebrate. Adults spend little time in the water, only returning to the ponds of their birth to breed.|$|R

5000|$|Michael Brooke of Sight & Sound commented, [...] "Although it’s {{easy to see}} why it was pigeonholed as {{a horror}} film, its first half {{presents}} what {{is still one of the}} <b>most</b> viscerally <b>vivid</b> portraits of a disintegrating relationship yet committed to film, comfortably rivalling Lars von Trier’s Antichrist, David Cronenberg’s The Brood and Ingmar Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage." [...] Reviewing the Blu-ray release of the movie in 2013 Michael Dodd of Bring The Noise UK was similarly impressed with what he called [...] "an intense exploration of marital breakdown". He argued that this made Possession [...] "one of the few horror films that successfully builds a back story for its main characters".|$|R

In the days before television's broadcasting of proceedings in Parliament, accounts of exactly what happened vary but the <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> image portrayed Heseltine seizing the Mace and brandishing it towards Labour left-wingers who were celebrating having won the vote and singing The Red Flag. The Speaker suspended the sitting.|$|E
25|$|Casualty {{rates were}} the <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> sign of this disaster. Already, {{by the end}} of 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained {{recruits}} had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917.|$|E
25|$|The Laas Geel cave {{paintings}} {{are thought to}} be some of the <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> rock art in Africa. Among other things, they depict cattle in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans, who are believed to have been inhabitants of the region. The necks of the cattle are embellished with a kind of plastron. Some of the cattle are also portrayed wearing decorative robes. Besides long-horned cattle, the rock art also shows an image of a domesticated dog, several paintings of canidae as well as a giraffe. The site is excellently preserved due to the location of the paintings which are covered by the granite overhangs.|$|E

25|$|The Black Death ravaged Ireland 1348–49. One of the <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> {{accounts}} of the plague was written by Friar John Clyn at Kilkenny, who thought that all mankind might die. He reports that particularly in the months of September and October, 1348, people came from all over Ireland to St. Mullins, County Carlow, including many no doubt from County Wexford, out of fear, to seek divine protection from the 'pestilence' {{as he calls it}} – as it was then very prevalent. He comments on how it was rare for only one member of a family to die, but that usually the entire family was wiped out. John Clyn himself is believed to have died in 1349 from the plague.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} Soviet times Russia has {{experienced}} another wave of Western cultural influence, {{which led to}} the development of many previously unknown phenomena in the Russian culture. The <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> example, perhaps, is the Russian rock music, which takes its roots both in the Western rock and roll and heavy metal, and in traditions of the Russian bards of Soviet era, like Vladimir Vysotsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Saint-Petersburg (former Leningrad), Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk) and Omsk became the main centers of development of the rock music. Popular Russian rock groups include Mashina Vremeni, Slot, DDT, Aquarium, Alisa, Kino, Nautilus Pompilius, Aria, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, Splean and Korol i Shut. At the same time Russian pop music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as estrada into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining international recognition, like t.A.T.u. in the West, who have been said to be the most influential artists to ever come out of Russia, or Vitas in China.|$|E

5000|$|For most of {{his artistic}} life Chetkov painted in {{isolation}} as his work did not conform with Communist-approved Socialist Realism. However, despite difficult early experiences and an almost total lack of recognition, he never lost his [...] "irrepressible strength of spirit", and it comes across in his paintings, which are for the <b>most</b> part <b>vivid</b> in palette and vital in execution. He returned to certain genres again and again: still life, landscape, equine art, abstract expressionism, portraiture and music, continuously experimenting with new colour palettes and media. Chetkov was also influenced by nostalgia for his early childhood experiences on his grandfather's farm, frequently harking back to an idealised, pre-Stalin version of country life in glass works and in his genre and landscape paintings.|$|R

500|$|Along {{with the}} 12th-century Ban Kulin, Queen Catherine {{is one of}} the two princely personages who entered Bosnian folk tradition. As such, she is {{traditionally}} referred to as [...] "the last Queen of Bosnia" [...] – erroneously, as her stepdaughter-in-law both replaced her as queen and outlived her. The cult of Queen Catherine, who was first mentioned as beatified in the Paris-published Martyrologium franciscanum in 1638, originated in the Franciscan province of Bosna Argentina during the Ottoman rule. Following the Ottoman conquest, a majority of Bosnians converted to Orthodoxy or Islam, and the Franciscans started promoting Catherine as a symbol of Bosnia's statehood and of its pre-Ottoman Catholic identity. This is particularly evident in Central Bosnia, where folk tradition concerning Catherine is <b>most</b> <b>vivid.</b>|$|E

One of her {{earliest}} memories was her father reading to her The Song of Hiawatha, at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe. She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which she kept well into adulthood until [...] "some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back".

500|$|Among Waters' Victorian-set novels, {{depictions of}} sexual {{encounters}} are also, according to Palmer, the <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> in Tipping the Velvet. A review in The Advocate calls the book [...] "riotously sexy", and The Seattle Times suggests {{the scene where}} Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of Tom Jones. This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians. Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour, or employed it as an erotic element controlled by, and for the benefit of, men. Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes, [...] "Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed. It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers. We don’t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us." ...|$|E
500|$|Bondfield {{joined a}} drapery and {{embroidery}} business in Church Road, Hove, where the young apprentices {{were treated as}} family members. Relations between customers and assistants were cordial, and Bondfield's later recollections of this period were uniformly happy. Her apprenticeship complete, {{she worked as a}} living-in assistant in a succession of Brighton drapery stores, where she quickly encountered the realities of shop staff life: unsympathetic employers, very long hours, appalling living conditions and no privacy. Bondfield reported on her experiences of living-in: [...] "Overcrowded, insanitary conditions, poor and insufficient food were the main characteristics of this system, with an undertone of danger... In some houses both natural and unnatural vices found a breeding ground". She found some relief from this environment when she was befriended by a wealthy customer, Louisa Martindale, and her daughter Hilda. The Martindales, socially conscious liberals and advocates for women's rights, found Bondfield a willing learner, and lent her books that began her lifelong interest in labour and social questions. Bondfield described Mrs Martindale as [...] "a <b>most</b> <b>vivid</b> influence on my life... she put me in the way of knowledge that has been of help to many score of my shop mates".|$|E
