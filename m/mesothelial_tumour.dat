In selected cases, fibre concentrations and dimensions were also measured with the electron microscope. All but two subjects died with a <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumour.</b> Fibre concentrations ranged from 7 x 10 (4) to almost 10 (9) fibres/g dry weight.

40|$|Well-differentiated {{papillary}} mesothelioma (WDPM) {{is a rare}} <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumour</b> affecting {{mostly the}} peritoneum of women in their reproductive age, but it may occur also at other sites, including the pleura. It is considered a specific pathological entity different from diffuse malignant mesothelioma as it displays a characteristic histological pattern and {{is associated with a}} slowly progressive clinical course. We report the case of a 79 -year-old man with a history of right pleural WDPM at age 64, which was successfully treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and talc pleurodesis. Thirteen years after the first diagnosis, he presented with mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis and with an extremely rare pattern of tracheal and bronchial infiltration that was detected at bronchoscopy. Biopsy samples revealed loss of histological differentiation of the neoplastic cells. This case report highlights that WDPM is a tumour of uncertain malignant potential that may undergo transformation over many years. Finally, the role of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of WDPM and the possible mechanisms leading to this unique way of metastatisation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{accumulated}} data on deaths from <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> among cohorts {{of male and}} female factory workers at a London asbestos textile factory, the mortality from this cause up to the year 2000 AD has been predicted.

40|$|The {{mortality}} of 3000 male factory workers, 1400 laggers, and 700 women factory workers in east London has been studied. The men were first employed between 1933 and 1964, the women between 1936 and 1942. Textiles were produced {{until the late}} 1950 s {{as well as other}} asbestos products. Laggers were employed on contract in increasing numbers in later years. Crocidolite asbestos was used until the late 1950 s as well as asmosite and chrysotile. Exposure of workers was graded according to the job into two categories, low/moderate and severe, and subdivided by duration of employment up to two years or longer. <b>Mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> accounted for 7. 5 % of the total mortality in men, and 9 % in women with their longer follow up period. Lung cancer accounted for 20 % of deaths in men and 14 % in women. Both <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> and lung cancer showed a dose response relationship. Histopathological examination of a series of predominantly postmortem specimens showed 22 % of adenocarcinomas of lung among men and 21 % in women. There was an excess of gastrointestinal tumours but no dose response relationship could be shown. Among severely exposed male factory workers there was an excess of deaths from cancer of the larynx and among severely exposed women of carcinoma of the breast and ovary. Twenty four deaths (2 %) were due to asbestosis. There is an indication that the incidence of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> is declining but a further period of observation is required for confirmation...|$|R
40|$|The ploidy of {{a series}} of pleural lesions [...] {{reactive}} proliferations, malignant mesotheliomas and metastatic tumours [...] was measured on a Leitz Miamed DNA image analyser using Feulgen-stained slides. The technique successfully recognized all the metastatic tumours as malignant; this corresponds to previous work. However, it was not successful in classifying mesothelial lesions as benign or malignant, resulting in a very high false-negative rate and a moderately high false-positive rate. Mesothelial lesions appear to have a wide range of ploidy values irrespective of their biological behaviour. Thus, for primary <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours,</b> the ploidy value cannot be used as a reliable diagnostic index...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs) of {{the nose}} and {{paranasal}} sinuses are extremely rare. These were originally described as neoplasms of the pleura originating from spindle cells. It is further sub-classified as a benign type of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumour.</b> Its occurrence in many extra pleural sites have been reported earlier, mainly in the liver, parapharyngeal space, sublingual glands, tongue, parotid gland, thyroid, periorbital region, and very occasionally in the nose and  paranasal sinus area.   Case Report: A 28 -year-old man with a 6 month history of persistent progressive left nasal obstruction and watering of the left eye is reported. Further imaging by CT and MRI revealed a large, left-sided, highly vascular, nasal cavity mass (Fig 1, 2, 3, 4) pushing laterally on the medial wall of the maxilla. The patient underwent a lateral rhinotomy, which proceeded with the excision of the mass. Histopathological analysis of the specimen was consistent with SFT.   Conclusion:  This case is reported to develop insights regarding diagnosis and management of such rare tumours...|$|E
40|$|Intraperitoneal (i. p.) {{injection}} of crocidolite asbestos {{was used to}} induce mesotheliomas in rats. The morphological changes of the mesothelial cells were studied by light and electron microscopy and by cytologic examination of peritoneal washings. After injection, the asbestos fibres stimulated an acute inflammatory response and were rapidly phagocytosed by the mesothelial cells and incorporated into the submesothelial tissues. At 7 days, the normal microvillous surface of the mesothelium was replaced with a syncytium of proliferating mesothelial cells showing extensive loss of microvilli. Nine months or so later, multifocal mesothelial tumours arose within the peritoneal cavity. The surface thermodynamic properties of normal, asbestos-stimulated mesothelial cells and of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumour</b> cells in culture were studied using an aqueous two-phase system containing 4 % Dextran T- 2000 and 4 % poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) w/w. After asbestos stimulation, {{there was a significant}} (P < 0. 01) increase in contact angle between the dextran-rich phase and the. mesothelial cell surface. These changes were even greater for the mesothelial tumours. The results indicate that the work of adhesion for asbestos-stimulated mesothelial cells and mesothelial tumours is lower than in normal tissue. These findings may be relevant to the process of tumour spread in the serosal cavities and to the development of distant metastases...|$|E

30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> described in the literature that can present in the peritoneal cavity. These are ademantoid tumours, benign cystic mesothelioma, and malignant mesothelioma [3]. All three types {{are known to be}} very rare. Malignant mesothelioma occurs at an incidence of 0.9 to 1.0 per million persons per year [4]. Ademantoid tumours are rare tumours occurring mostly in the genital tract. The type found in this study was a benign cystic mesothelioma (BCM). Only about 140 cases of BCM have ever been reported in the literature [3]. BCM occurs predominantly (84 % of cases) in young or middle-aged women with the mean age being 37  years and 10  months [5, 6].|$|R
40|$|Personnel {{records of}} over 1000 welders and electricians but only 235 caulkers and 557 platers {{employed}} at a shipyard in NE England between 1940 and 1968 were obtained and the mortality followed up to December 1982. The observed {{number of deaths}} (13 from <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours,</b> nine among the electricians) were compared with the number to be expected in the Newcastle connurbation. Welders and caulkers were most exposed to welding fumes, electricians to asbestos.

40|$|Abstract—This is a {{study of}} workers at a {{friction}} materials factory founded in 1898. Crocidolite was used only during two well defined periods before 1945. Apart from this, only chrysotile asbestos has been used. The mortality study dates from 1942 and extends to 1979. Over 99 % of the population have been traced. Ten deaths from <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> occurred. An analysis contrasting the observed number of deaths with those to be expected showed a significant excess of deaths from cancer of the lung and pleura in those employed before 1942. Among these deaths were seven from pleural mesothelioma. A case control study of the ten workers dying from pleural mesothelioma showed that {{all but two of}} these had definite exposure to crocidolite asbestos. Allowing for concomitant exposure to chrysotile asbestos among both cases and controls, the evidence of an association of the deaths from pleural mesothelioma with an exposure to crocidolite asbestos had a statistical significance level of 0. 06...|$|R
40|$|Chrysotile {{asbestos}} was leached in N {{hydrochloric acid}} for varying times {{to produce a}} range of magnesium-depleted samples. The protein adsorptive capacity, the haemolytic activity, {{and the capacity to}} cause selective release of acid hydrolases from macrophages were measured for the various samples in vitro. The carcinogenicity of the same materials was determined following intrapleural inoculation in rats. The adsorptive capacity for albumin decreased linearly with magnesium removal. The haemolytic activity also declined until about half the magnesium had been removed, after which there was little further change. The selective release of acid hydrolases from macrophages in culture increased up to the point at which half the magnesium had been removed but by 90 % depletion had declined rapidly. The carcinogenicity of 50 % -depleted chrysotile was similar to that of intact, but at 90 % depletion the incidence of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> had fallen considerably. There was no evidence that the leached samples fragmented more than the unleached in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations {{and length}} {{distributions}} of uncoated and coated amphibole-type fibres in samples of human lung taken at necropsy were measured by optical microscopy using the membrane filter technique that enables fibres with diameters {{down to about}} 0. 2 micron to be detected. The subjects included 10 who died with <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours,</b> three with lung cancer, and eight of other causes. Measurements of fibre concentrations are {{compared with those of}} other workers. It can be deduced from the length distributions that fibres less than 5 microns long are cleared from the lung more efficiently than longer ones. The clearance of short fibres appears to be inhibited in subjects with asbestosis, however. The length distributions of uncoated and coated fibres were dissimilar. In general, few fibres less than 10 microns in length were coated and few greater than 40 microns in length were uncoated. The probability of a fibre of given length, however, becoming coated varied considerably from subject to subject. Possible reasons for this are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{meeting had}} as its theme the {{importance}} of good communications between workers in different disciplines. Papers and demonstrations were presented {{on a range of}} topics as apparently unrelated as the intraocular pressure, the tension of nitrogen in blood, and the experimental production of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours.</b> In his introduction Dr J C Gilson showed how these were some recent end-products of research into pneumoconiosis. The work of the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit was centred round the properties of airborne dust and the acute and long-term effects of its inhalation. Studies ranged from the immunological responses of coal workers to surveys of men in some of the world's major asbestos fields; the latter were selected on account of the exposure to dust differing from that of workers in the UK in being confined to a single type of fibre. One link between the different studies was the features of the chest radiographs. For rounded opacities these were now read using the ILO Classification which was largely developed at the Unit; Dr Gilson demonstrated a recent extension to include the irregular opacities which are associated with exposure to asbestos...|$|R
40|$|A {{cohort of}} 406 men {{employed}} before 1963 {{for at least}} one year in a vermiculite mine in Montana was followed up until July 1983. The vermiculite ore as fed to the mill contained 4 - 6 % of amphibole fibre in the tremolite series. Vital status was established in {{all but one of the}} 406 and death certificates were obtained and coded for 163 of the 165 men who died. Compared with white men in the United States, the cohort experienced excess mortality from all causes (SMR 1. 17), respiratory cancer (SMR 2. 45), non-malignant respiratory disease (SMR 2. 55), and accidents (SMR 2. 14). Four deaths were from malignant mesothelioma (proportional mortality 2. 4 %). Compared with Montana death rates, the SMR for respiratory cancer was somewhat higher (3. 03). Man-year analyses of respiratory cancer and estimated cumulative exposure gave a relation that did not depart significantly from linearity. The results of this and case-referent analyses indicate an increased risk of mortality from respiratory cancer in this cohort of about 1 % for each fibre year of exposure. In relation to estimated exposure the mortality experienced by the cohort from both lung cancer and <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> was higher than in chrysotile mining...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Primary {{malignant}} <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> {{were recognized}} by pathol-ogists before asbestiform minerals (chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite) were mined commercially. The discovery, 40 yrs ago, of a causal link with crocidolite and the wide-ranging epidemiological studies which followed {{are the subject}} of this review. Early case-control and descriptive surveys, supplemented by cohort studies in insulation workers and chrysotile miners, quickly demonstrated major occupation-al and geographical differences, with high risk in naval dockyard areas and in the heating trades. In the 1980 s, reliable cohort surveys showed that in mining and in the manufacture of asbestos products the mesothelioma risk was much higher when exposure included crocidolite or amosite than chrysotile alone. However, qualita-tive and quantitative information on exposure was too often inadequate for this evi-dence to be conclusive. Well-controlled lung fibre analyses have reduced these deficiencies and demonstrated the probable implications of the greater biopersis-tence of amphibole fibres. Chrysotile for industrial use often contains low concen-trations of fibrous tremolite, which may well explain the few cases of mesothelioma associated with this type of asbestos. Progress in this field has been much retarded by controversy, for which the 20 year gap between the availability of reliable estimates of risk for the mining of chrysotile and that for crocidolite or amosite may have been largely responsible...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{explosion}} oxyacetylene cylinders are filled with a spongy mass, acetone is added to saturate the mass, and acetylene is pumped into the cylinder. The first cylinders manufactured before 1936 used a kapok filling topped off with about 16 oz of crocidolite asbestos, with a metal gauze thimble inserted to reduce risk of flash back. Cylinders must be examined annually. The use of crocidolite ceased in 1972 and other fillings have been adopted since 1970; kapok cylinders now constitute less than 5 % of the total stock. To assess possible hazards, a mortality study of workers first employed between 1935 and 1975 and followed up to December 1984 was undertaken. Simulation tests showed low concentrations of asbestos in the air even in the earliest period. The population studied consisted of 370 workers at the Bilston plant in the West Midlands, 611 at the 14 other plants in England and Wales, and 120 in Scotland. No deaths occurred from <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> but there was an excess of deaths from cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancer of the stomach, and cancer of the pancreas, the latter accounting for eight deaths. Risks appeared to be concentrated at the Bilston plant. The importance of these findings is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Newhouse, M. L., and Wagner, J. C. (1969). Brit. J. industr. Med., 26, 302 - 307. Validation {{of death}} {{certificates}} in asbestos workers. The Registrar General has supplied the certified {{cause of death}} of 436 past workers in an asbestos factory. An {{attempt was made to}} follow up the 301 (69 %) deaths which had occurred in hospital or had been the subject of an inquest or coroner's post-mortem examination. Necropsy reports were obtained for 158 (52 %) of this group and histological material was reviewed in 84 (28 %). The additional information, particularly that obtained from review of the histology, led to the revision and extension of the diagnosis suggested by the certified cause of death in a number of cases. The incidence of carcinoma of the bronchus had not been grossly underestimated, four additional tumours of this type were identified by scrutiny of the necropsy reports, and a further four by review of histological sections. The incidence of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumours</b> was underestimated, endothelioma or mesothelioma was the certified cause of death in four of the series, and a further 15 mesotheliomata were identified by review of histological material. Five patients with pleural mesotheliomata had been certified as dying of carcinoma of the lung or pleura. Ten deaths from peritoneal mesotheliomata had been attributed either to carcinomatosis without mention of a primary tumour or to cancer of the gastro-intestinal tract. Lung sections were submitted for review in 67 of the series; some degree of asbestosis was found in all but seven. Asbestosis graded as either moderate or severe was found in all the confirmed cases of carcinoma of the lung...|$|R
40|$|This study reports {{attempts}} to culture tumour cells from 51 malignant effusions using standard tissue culture techniques. Cultures proliferating {{for more than}} one month were derived from 42 effusions including 24 / 32 from breast cancer patients and 5 / 6 from colon carcinomata. The morphology of these cells and their culture characteristics were compared with that of cells derived from a benign effusion. A common cell type [...] believed to be of mesothelial origin [...] was found in all cultures. In addition, fibroblastic cells were common and smaller pleomorphic cells, possibly tumour cells, were found in many effusions. The mesothelial cells were often multinucleated and grew for long periods. Although the tumour cells grew in conjunction with the mesothelial cells, all attempts at separation have failed. These studies indicate that cells derived from malignant effusions may be largely of <b>mesothelial</b> origin although <b>tumour</b> cells may also be present. The use of short-term cultures of malignant effusions as the source of cells for use as target cells in cytotoxicity tests and in chemotherapy assays is disscussed...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether or not the glomeruloid implants (GI) composed of papillary cores within clear spaces lined by <b>mesothelial</b> cells or <b>tumour</b> cells located in superficial or deep peritoneal tissue in ovarian serous borderline tumours (SBTs) are invasive. Methods and results: We examined the differences in incidence, histological and immunohistochemical findings among three groups: 100 GI with mesothelial cells lining clear space (type I), 100 GI with tumour cells lining clear space (type II), and 100 invasive implants with clefts but no lining cells from 30 cases of SBT with peritoneal implants. The type I lesion had characteristics of non-invasive implants with a tendency for smooth contours (100 / 100), superficial location (71 / 100), absence of desmoplasia (100 / 100) and absence of surrounding destructive invasion (100 / 100), In contrast, type II GI had irregular contours (67 / 100), deep location (93 / 100), presence of desmoplastic reaction (100 / 100) and presence of destructive invasion (12 / 100). Immunohistological studies suggested intermediate forms between the two types of lesions. Conclusions: Type I GI are non-invasive implants, whereas type II GI are invasive implants and it is important to evaluate the presence and nature of cells lining the clear space in determining whether implants associated with ovarian SBTs are invasive or not...|$|R
