500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a complex issue {{because there are many}} biofuel options which are available.

Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and claim that {{in some parts of the}} world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare {{effects of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) cotton, <b>maize</b> and <b>sugar</b> beet regimes practiced in Greece after its 1981 entry into the European Union. These markets are considered as horizontally related because there are usually the same farmers that use the same areas to produce various combinations of the relevant products. We use bootstrap techniques to conduct a statistical analysis of the estimated welfare measurements. The welfare analysis indicates that the income amounts transferred to farmers rose significantly in the period between 1981 and 1992. The 1992 CAP reform slowed down this trend, and transfers have remained at an almost statistically constant level since 1992. welfare analysis, Common Agricultural Policy, bootstrapping, Greek cotton, <b>maize</b> and <b>sugar</b> beet production., Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{potential impact}} of the South African bioethanol blend mandate on South African Customs Unions (SACU) member states' <b>maize</b> and <b>sugar</b> production, trade and welfare outcomes. This impact is simulated using the GTAP 7 model and database. It is run through an artificial decrease in <b>maize</b> and <b>sugar</b> cane output in South Africa due to their diversion to bioethanol production. Results show that South African production of bioethanol from cereal and sugar cane, and its blending with fuel, will not result in major negative welfare changes in South Africa. However, production of bioethanol from maize negatively affects the rest of SACU member states in terms of overall welfare outcome and cereal prices, thus threatening sustainable access to staple food. Production of bioethanol from sugar cane improves welfare {{in the rest of}} SACU region, such welfare gain accumulating most to Swaziland, the region's major low-cost sugar producer. bioethanol blend mandate; GTAP 7; welfare outcomes; sustainable development; sustainability; sustainable access; staple food; South Africa; regional markets; agricultural markets; agriculture; biofuels; South African Customs Union; SACU countries; <b>maize</b> production; sugarcane; <b>sugar</b> production; trade; Botswana; Lesotho; Namibia; Swaziland; cereal prices...|$|R
