50|$|Giant {{tortoises}} {{are among}} the world's longest-living animals, with an average lifespan of 100 years or more. The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> Tu'i Malila was 188 at death in Tonga in 1965. Harriet (initially thought {{to be one of}} the three Galápagos tortoises brought back to England from Charles Darwin's Beagle voyage but later shown to be from an island not even visited by Darwin) was reported by the Australia Zoo to be 176 years old when she died in 2006. Also, on 23 March 2006, an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita died at Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata. He was brought to the zoo in the 1870s from the estate of Lord Clive and is thought to have been around 255 years old when he died. Around the time of its discovery, they were caught for food in such large quantities that they became virtually extinct by 1900. Giant tortoises are now under strict conservation laws and are categorised as threatened species.|$|E
50|$|The LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles), {{which opened}} in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and {{terrestrial}} arthropods. Guests first pass through the Oak Woodland Pond, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the 6000 sq ft main building where the Damp Forest houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, Betty's Bite and Squeeze Room, named after GLAZA co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the Behind the Glass room. The Care and Conservation Room showcases Gray's monitor and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is Arroyo Lagarto, a set of outdoor exhibits for <b>Madagascar</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Madagascar spider tortoise, desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A 2000 sq ft secondary building, the Desert LAIR, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with Crocodile Swamp, an outdoor exhibit home to false gharials.|$|E
50|$|On 20 March 2016, the Custom {{officials}} at Mumbai airport seized 146 tortoises from a mishandled baggage of a Nepal citizen. This bag {{was said to}} belong to a transit passenger, who arrived from Madagascar and flew to Kathmandu leaving this bag behind. Out of the 146 <b>tortoises,</b> 139 were <b>Radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Astrochelys radiata) and seven were angonoka tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora), both critically endangered tortoise species of <b>Madagascar.</b> Two <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> were found dead with broken shell.|$|R
5000|$|Madagascar, {{opened in}} 2008, is a {{walk-through}} exhibit which {{draws attention to}} the plight of endangered lemur species. The mixed exhibit features ring-tailed lemurs, collared lemurs, mongoose lemurs, crowned sifaka, <b>Madagascar</b> teal and <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> are also on show, and were brought into the collection especially for [...] "Madagascar". The breeding record of the lemur collection is very good with the ring-tailed lemurs giving birth regularly since their introduction in 2009, and the red bellied lemurs also having bred successfully. Lemur feeding and talk is held daily at 12 noon.|$|R

5000|$|The {{carapace}} of the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is brilliantly {{marked with}} yellow lines radiating {{from the center}} of each dark plate of the shell, hence its name. This [...] "star" [...] pattern is more finely detailed and intricate than the normal pattern of other star-patterned tortoise species, such as G. elegans of India.The <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> is also larger than G. elegans, and the scutes of the carapace are smooth, and not raised up into a bumpy, pyramidal shape as is commonly seen in the latter species. There is slight sexual dimorphism. Compared to females, male <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> usually have longer tails and the notches beneath their tails are more noticeable.|$|R

50|$|No {{estimates}} of wild populations are available, but {{their numbers are}} declining, and many authorities see {{the potential for a}} rapid decline to extinction in the wild. In the North American studbook, 332 specimens are listed as participating in captive-breeding programs such as the Species Survival Plan. Captive breeding has shown great promise as in the captive breeding program for the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> at the New York Zoological Society's Wildlife Survival Center.

40|$|Abstract. Chelonian intranuclear {{coccidiosis}} {{has been}} reported once, in two <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Geochelone radiata), and is apparently rare. We describe intranuclear coccidiosis diagnosed histologically in two <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises,</b> three Travancore tortoises (Indotestudo forstenii), two leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis), one bowsprit tortoise (Chersina angulata), and one impressed tortoise (Manouria impressa). Infection was systemic and involved alimentary, urogenital, respiratory, lymphoid, endocrine, and integumentary systems. Trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, macrogametocytes, microgametocytes, and nonsporulated oocysts were seen histologically or by electron microscopy. Intracytoplasmic and extracellular stages of parasite development also were identified histologically. Sequencing of a coccidial 18 S rRNA consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product revealed a novel sequence that provided phylogenetic information and may be useful for further diagnostic test design. Intranuclear coccidiosis was associated with variable degrees of inflammation in all cases, was considered {{the cause of death}} in six tortoises, and was a substantial contributing factor to the cause of death in two tortoises...|$|R
50|$|As the <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises</b> are herbivores, grazing {{constitutes}} 80-90% {{of their}} diets, while they also eat fruits and succulent plants. A favorite {{food in the}} wild is the Opuntia cactus. They are known to graze regularly in the same area, thus keeping the vegetation in that area closely trimmed. They seem to prefer new growth rather than mature growth because of the high-protein, low-fiber content.|$|R
50|$|Madagascar is a stronghold {{for a wide}} {{diversity}} of endemic species of chameleons and is considered the radiation point for day geckos. The two genera of iguanas present have a basal relationship to other iguanas and {{are believed to have}} been present on the island since it separated from Africa. The Madagascar big-headed turtle, spider tortoise, flat-backed spider <b>tortoise,</b> <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoise</b> and ploughshare tortoise are endangered species.|$|R
25|$|The African Savannah {{replaced}} {{a variety}} of barred cages, and was the largest construction project undertaken at the zoo when it was created. The exhibit recreates the African savannah, and includes African painted dogs, African lions, cheetahs, Grant's zebras, hamadryas baboons, meerkats, <b>radiated</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Rothschild's giraffes, spotted hyaenas and southern white rhinoceroses. Visitors view the animals from a path that simulates a dry riverbed running through the savannah.|$|R
