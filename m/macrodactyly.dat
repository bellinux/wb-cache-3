40|$|A case of Proteus {{syndrome}} in a 13 -year-old {{boy with}} <b>macrodactyly,</b> hemihypertrophy, exostosis of the skull, epidermal naevi, palmar and plantar masses, and scoliosis is reported. <b>Macrodactyly</b> involving the left thumb was treated surgically.

40|$|<b>Macrodactyly</b> {{is a rare}} {{family of}} {{congenital}} disorders characterized by the diffuse enlargement of 1 or more digits. Multiple tissue types within the affected digits are involved, but skeletal patterning and gross morphological features are preserved. Not all tissues are equally involved and there is marked heterogeneity with respect to clinical phenotype. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these growth disturbances offer unique insight into normal limb growth and development, in general. To date, no genes or loci have been implicated {{in the development of}} <b>macrodactyly.</b> In this study, we performed the first transcriptional profiling of <b>macrodactyly</b> tissue. We found that pleiotrophin (PTN) was significantly overexpressed across all our <b>macrodactyly</b> samples. The mitogenic functions of PTN correlate closely with the clinical characteristics of <b>macrodactyly.</b> PTN thus represents a promising target for further investigation into the etiology of overgrowth phenotypes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Macrodactyly</b> is a {{discrete}} congenital anomaly consisting of enlargement of all tissues localized to the ter-minal portions of a limb, typically within a ‘nerve territory’. The classic terminology for this condition is ‘lipo-fibromatous hamartoma of nerve ’ or Type I <b>macrodactyly.</b> The peripheral nerve, itself, is enlarged both in circumference and in length. It {{is not related}} to neurofibromatosis (NF 1), nor is it associated with vascular malformations, such as in the recently reported CLOVES syndrome. The specific nerve pathophysiology in this form of <b>macrodactyly</b> has not been well described and a genetic etiology for this specific form of enlarge-ment is unknown. To identify the genetic cause of <b>macrodactyly,</b> we used whole-exome sequencing to iden-tify somatic mutations present in the affected nerve of a single patient. We confirmed a novel mutation in PIK 3 CA (R 115 P) present in the patient’s affected nerve tissue but not in blood DNA. Sequencing PIK 3 CA exons identified gain-of-function mutations (E 542 K, H 1047 L or H 1047 R) in the affected tissue of five addition-al unrelated patients; mutations were absent in blood DNA available from three patients. Immunocytochemistry confirmed AKT activation in cultured cells from the nerve of a <b>macrodactyly</b> patient. Additionally, we found that the most abnormal structure within the involved nerve in a macrodactylous digit is the perineurium, with additional secondary effects on the axon number and size. Thus, isolated con-genital <b>macrodactyly</b> is caused by somatic activation of the PI 3 K/AKT cell-signaling pathway and is genetic-ally and biochemically related to other overgrowth syndromes...|$|E

30|$|<b>Macrodactyly</b> of {{the foot}} is an {{uncommon}} congenital malformation in which enlargement of bones and surrounding soft tissues {{of the foot}} is observed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The deformity is often progressive with less neural involvement than in hand <b>macrodactyly</b> [7]. Barsky [6] made the distinction between two types of macrodactyly: the static type, which does not grow disproportionately, and the progressive type, which enlarges {{at a faster rate}} {{than the rest of the}} foot. This second type is more frequent in the foot [6, 7].|$|E
30|$|<b>Macrodactyly</b> of {{the foot}} is usually {{isolated}} [2]. Because the number of affected digits and growth and extent of the overgrowth varies, treatment decisions {{have to be made}} individually. The goal of treatment is to obtain a pain-free, functional foot that can accommodate normal shoes [4, 10]. Treatment of <b>macrodactyly</b> of the first ray generates numerous difficulties since ray resection, which has been recommended for other toes as a means of shortening and narrowing the foot, cannot be performed [2, 3]. In addition to this, cosmetic results are better if the nail is preserved [3].|$|E
40|$|Neural {{fibrolipoma}} is {{an uncommon}} tumor-like lesion {{that involves the}} upper extremity and usually arises in the median nerve.

Clinical examination revealed <b>macrodactyly</b> of two fingers of the right hand and three fingers of the left. Surgical reduction was performed and microscopy of the biopsy specimen established the diagnosis of neural fibrolipoma.

40|$|Fibrolipomatous hamartoma {{of nerve}} (neural fibrolipoma) is a tumor-like lipomatous process principally {{involving}} young persons. The median nerve is most commonly affected.

40|$|Congenital <b>macrodactyly</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} malfor-mation characterised by progressive {{enlargement of}} all mesenchymal elements of a digit. The present study {{is an attempt to}} draw the attention towards the similarities and differences between <b>macrodactyly</b> of the hand and foot. Radiographical, operative findings and histopatho-logical examination of five cases are included in the present study. Emphasis was given to know the pos-sible basic lesion. Radiographic findings, which dif-ferentiate this entity from other forms of local gigan-tism, were also analysed. The most characteristic finding noted was excessive overgrowth of fibro-fatty tissue with unusually large fatty lobules, apparently fixed by a mesh of dense fibrous tissue. Hypertrophy and tortuosity of the dig-ital nerve, a striking feature in <b>macrodactyly</b> of the hand, was notably absent in cases affecting the foot. None of the patients had any other associated con-genital anomalies. Neither the patients nor any of their family members had any stigmata of neurofi-bromatosis. Chromosomal study was normal in all of them. We conclude that in <b>macrodactyly</b> of the foot, exces-sive proliferation and accumulation of adipose tissue was the basic lesion, whereas involvement of the nerve might be the fundamental lesion in gigantism of the hand. Furthermore, whatever be the basic lesion, the final pathway must be either the local defi-ciency of a growth inhibiting factor or local expres-sion of a basic intrinsic factor, leading to excessive growth of all elements of the digit...|$|E
30|$|A 6 -year-old female was {{evaluated}} in our clinic.

There were no signs of Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome or neurofibromatosis, which led us to diagnose isolated <b>macrodactyly</b> of the foot. The child had trouble with shoe wear and cosmetic issues.

40|$|Proteus {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital condition with various clinical features such as hemihypertrophy, <b>macrodactyly,</b> subcutaneous masses, brain-like hyperplasia of the soles and/or palms, epidermal naevi and scoliosis with other mesodermal malfor-mations. Multifocal overgrowth can affect various tissues causing severe functional and cosmetic dis-ability, but intellectual and language development are mostly normal. Orthopaedic problems include <b>macrodactyly,</b> hindfoot deformity, limb length inequality, genu valgum and scoliosis.

40|$|Herein, {{we present}} {{the case of}} a patient who had {{complaint}} suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome due to fibrolipoma of the median nerve and <b>macrodactyly.</b> 32 -year-old male patient has <b>macrodactyly</b> of the right index finger and coarse skin lines and hyperkeratosis on the volar aspect of the index finger. The patient reported numbness and tingling sensation in his right hand that have woken him at night for 10 years. Electromyography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right hand and diagnostic biopsy were performed to the patient. Sensory action potential of the right median nerve was absent. The median motor study on the right showed low amplitude of the compound muscle action potential with a markedly prolonged distal latency. MRI scan demonstrated a lesion that extended from the palm to the forearm and gave cable-like appearance to the median nerve which is pathognomonic for lipofibroma. Biopsy result was consistent with fibrolipoma. Neural fibrolipoma is a rare benign tumor of the median nerve. MRI is the best method for observing the involvement of the nerve. In one-third of the cases, <b>macrodactyly</b> is associated with neural fibrolipoma. In the differential diagnosis of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms, fibrolipoma of the median nerve should also be kept in mind. (Archives of Neuropsychiatry 2011; 48 : 155 - 7...|$|E

30|$|In our opinion, {{an island}} nail transfer, along with {{additional}} surgeries, obtains excellent results in first ray <b>macrodactyly.</b> The toe can be shortened as needed since the nail complex, {{along with a}} portion of the distal phalanx, can be moved freely as desired.
