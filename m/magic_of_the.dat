25|$|While {{powerful}} in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin {{walls in the}} lifter valleys promoted cracking. The <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.|$|E
50|$|A {{primary focus}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot is upon <b>the</b> five <b>magics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> title: Thaumaturgy, Alchemy, Magic, Sorcery, and Wizardry.

50|$|All Fey wield {{one or more}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four Elemental <b>magics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World and {{the mystic}} Spirit, though with varying degrees <b>of</b> mastery. <b>Magic</b> is spun as threads which are woven into a pattern.

Fivefold weaves, which combine all four elementals and the one mystic controlled by the Fey, are extremely powerful, and the only defense against demons.|$|R

25|$|The Azoëtia and Chumbley's {{subsequent}} writings {{demonstrate his}} familiarity {{with a broad}} range of Western esoteric doctrines including Qabalah, Enochian Magic, the <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Thelemic school of Aleister Crowley. Another influence was the neo-Sufi author Idries Shah, particularly his theories concerning possible connections between witchcraft and various near-eastern cults such as the Yezidi, Mandaeans, Sufis and Zoroastrians. Chumbley addressed these themes, citing Shah's work, in his book Qutub: The Point (1995).|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to {{the arrival}} of French {{children}} in Quebec in 1634, measles was also brought along with them, which quickly spread among the Native American people. Jesuit priest Jean de Brébeuf described the symptoms as being severe. Brebeuf stated that the Native American's fearlessness towards death upon this disease made them perfect candidates for conversion to Christianity. The Native Americans believed that if they did not convert to Christianity, they would be exposed to the evil <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> priests that caused the illness.|$|E

25|$|Rydberg's next work, Medeltidens Magi (The <b>Magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages) 1865 is an {{exposition}} of the magical practices {{and beliefs of}} the Medieval period. According to Rydberg, the contemporary Church was still driven by {{the ideology of the}} Dark Ages, and its dualistic notions of good and evil, represented by God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, contributed towards the horror of the witch-hunts in Europe and America in the recent past. From this point forward, Rydberg was economically successful as a writer.|$|E
25|$|Webb co-devised {{and starred}} in The <b>Magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Musicals, a UK concert tour {{featuring}} songs from musical theatre, opposite Opportunity Knocks winner Mark Rattray. The show toured in 1991, before two follow up tours in 1992. The gold-selling album of the show was co-produced by Webb's former husband, sound engineer, Tom Button. A performance at the Bristol Hippodrome was also filmed and broadcast on BBC Television. This was followed in 1993 by a North American and Canadian tour and numerous UK versions in the following years, in which Rattray was succeeded by Dave Willetts, Robert Meadmore and most recently Wayne Sleep. The outfits for the tour were designed by Bruce Oldfield.|$|E
25|$|Eragon reworks the <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} pact between Riders and dragons {{to include}} both Dwarves and Urgals, allowing the dragon eggs to hatch {{for members of}} their races. Eragon, coming {{to the conclusion that}} there is no safe place to raise the dragons and train new Riders in Alagaësia, begins planning transport of the Eldunarí and the eggs to a region far from Alagaësia, save for two eggs which are kept in Alagaësia: one is to be sent to the dwarves, and the other to the Urgals. Those future Riders will travel to Eragon's new home for training, while new eggs will be sent back to Alagaësia to hatch for new Riders.|$|E

25|$|Cyborg, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn {{return to}} the Batcave to free Brother Eye from Brainiac's control and {{coordinate}} civilian evacuation efforts. Wonder Woman takes Supergirl to Metropolis, and openly challenges Batman's plan. When she comes close to killing Cheetah and Harley Quinn, Supergirl stops her and heads to the Fortress of Solitude to confront Superman on the matter, learning the truth of her cousin's tyranny. With several of Earth's cities abducted, Brainiac prepares to eradicate the planet. The alliance attempts to take on Brainiac's ship, but his shields are too strong and he seemingly kills Superman in the process. They concoct a plan to weaken Brainiac's shields by using Aquaman's trident as a conduit for the <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock of Eternity.|$|E
25|$|Roh {{used this}} term to {{describe}} painting that signaled {{a return to}} realism after expressionism's extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, {{and in doing so}} the spirit, or <b>magic,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic {{all the way back to}} the 15th century. Flemish painter Van Eyck (1395–1441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer's interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.|$|E
25|$|In the {{background}} of the series, the Children of the Forest fought a series of wars against the First Men (a civilization of primitive warriors wielding bronze weapons and riding horses), until the Pact of the Isle of Faces, wherein the First Men obtained control of the open lands and the Children that of the forests. The Pact was weakened after four thousand years by the emergence of the Others, who were vanquished by the combined use of obsidian, fire, the <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old gods, and the building of the Wall. In the following centuries the Children gradually disappeared, and it was presumed that they left Westeros or became extinct. Little of their legacy is present in the series beyond their worship of nameless gods, still practiced by some in the North, and the remaining Weirwoods through which the Children communicated telepathically.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} again {{looked to}} its past to reverse its fortunes {{and brought back}} Johnny Majors, who had recently resigned from Tennessee after a successful 16-year tenure there. However, recruiting had fallen off significantly under Hackett, {{and the quality of}} Pitt's football facilities had fallen behind those of its competition. Over the next four years, Majors tried to recreate the <b>magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1976 season but achieved little success. His final campaign in 1996 resulted in a 4–7 record which included several humiliating defeats. A new chancellor, Mark Nordenberg, brought in athletic director Steve Pederson in 1996 to resurrect the program. The move facilitated Majors' retirement from coaching following the 1996 season, although he continued to serve the university in the position of Special Assistant to the Athletic Director and Chancellor until the summer of 2007.|$|E
25|$|Rufus Scrimgeour {{serves as}} the Minister for <b>Magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, {{succeeding}} Cornelius Fudge who was ousted by the wizarding community for his failure to announce the return of Voldemort, discrediting Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore, and allowing Dolores Umbridge to become Headmistress of Hogwarts, from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince {{until his death in}} the following book. He is described as looking like an old lion with tawny hair and bushy eyebrows, yellow eyes and wire-rimmed spectacles. Before being selected as minister, Scrimgeour headed the Auror Office of the Ministry and he is heavily battle-scarred from his years of service as an Auror, giving him an appearance of shrewd toughness. As minister, he visits the Muggle Prime Minister with Fudge, now an advisor, to inform him about recent wizarding events, crucial to internal security.|$|E
25|$|Following her graduation, Ellis became first {{understudy}} to Marti Webb in a UK concert tour of The <b>Magic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Musicals in 1998, {{required on}} several occasions in Webb's absence, yet took a hiatus in 1999 to board cruise ship MS Voyager of the Seas, employed as lead vocalist in the ship's entertainment staff. After nine months traveling across the Caribbean, she left the ship in Los Angeles, spent three months travelling across the US until her visa ran out, {{and then returned to}} understudy in the UK concert tour. By November 1999, she had made her first television appearance on Children in Need for their special Pudsey the Musical and was featured in a jingle for Capital FM. Following this, she appeared as the title role in a Gary Griffin-directed workshop production titled Helen of Troy and played the role of Mary in Merrily We Roll Along at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre.|$|E
