40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} reaction conditions for deposition of SiO 2 nanoparticles {{on the surface}} of cellulose fibers and their influence on moisture adsorption of the hybrid organic–inorganic material formed. SiO 2 nanoparticle deposition was carried out with the sol–gel process testing four reaction times (2, 12, 18, and 24 h) and three contents of the tetraethyl-orthosilicate (TEOS) precursor (1. 9, 4. 2 and 8. 4 gg− 1 of cellulose fiber). Modification time and TEOS content directly influence the amount of Si deposited on the fiber surface, nanoparticle diameter distribution, thermal stability, and resistance to moisture adsorption. There is a tendency of slight increase of nanoparticle size and the amount of Si deposited with increasing reaction time. SiO 2 nanoparticles were bonded {{on the surface of}} the cellulose fibers and are able to improve thermal stability of the material, increasing onset degradation temperature.

40|$|Objective. High-viscosity {{hydroxypropylmethylcellulose}} (HV-HPMC) is a <b>modified</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fiber</b> {{that produces}} a viscous gel in the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical trials demonstrate that consumption of HV-HPMC significantly lowers cholesterol, but limited information has been available {{on the influence of}} HV-HPMC on postprandial insulin and glucose responses. The objective of this investigation was to assess the influence of HV-HPMC on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in overweight and obese men and women. Research Design and Methods. Participants were 31, overweight or obese men and women without diabetes who underwent 3 breakfast meal tests in random order, separated by ≥ 72 hours. Test meals contained 75 g carbohydrate plus 4 g or 8 g HV-HPMC, or control (8 g cellulose), delivered in a double-blind fashion. Results. Peak glucose was significantly lower (p < 0. 001) after both HV-HPMC-containing meals [7. 4 mmol/L (4 g) and 7. 4 mmol/L (8 g) ] compared to the control meal (8. 6 mmol/L). Peak insulin concentrations and the incremental areas for glucose and insulin from 0 - 120 min were also significantly reduced after both HV-HPMC doses vs. control (all p < 0. 01). Conclusions. These findings indicate that HV-HPMC consumption reduces postprandial glucose and insulin excursions, which may favorably alter risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease...|$|E

The chemical and morphological structures of <b>modified</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> were investigated with X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectra, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). The crystalline conformations of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> were slightly changed in polymerization and crosslinking process.

Polymer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) was employed as matrix in to composites, which were prodUced by mixing high density polyethylene with cellulose (10 %) and Cell/ZrO(2) center dot nH(2) O (10 %), using an extruder and hydraulic press. Tensile tests showed that the Cell/ZrO(2) center dot nH(2) O (10 %) /HDPE composites present better tensile strength than cellulose (10 %) /HDPE composites. Cellulose agglomerations were responsible for poor adhesion between fiber and matrix in cellulose (10 %) /HDPE composites. HDPF/natural fibers composites showed also lower tensile strength in comparison to the polymer. The increase in Young`s modulus is associated to fibers reinforcement.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Polysaccharides were {{modified}} with selected polymers via the grafting technique. Both anionic and cationic polysaccharides were prepared. Random and crosslinked graft copolymers {{were also}} prepared. The percentage grafting {{was determined by}} gravimetric analysis and results were confirmed by cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance microscopy (CP/MAS 13 C NMR). These modified biodegradable polymers were then used to flocculate precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). The effects of pH, percentage grafting, crosslinker concentration and polysaccharide concentration on PCC flocculation were evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of anionic and cationic starch, either added to PCC sequentially or simultaneously, on PCC flocculation were also investigated. Generally, anionically modified starch showed excellent flocculation properties, which are desirable for the end application of PCC retention. The effect of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylamide (PAM) <b>modified</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> on calcium carbonate crystal nucleation and growth modification was investigated. When the heterogeneous crystallization of CaCO 3 {{was carried out in}} the presence of <b>modified</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> the CaCO 3 crystals were found to be residing {{on the surface of the}} fibers. The morphologies of the crystallized CaCO 3, polymorph and fiber surface coverage were different for cellulose materials grafted with polymers of different functionalities, meaning that there is interaction between the crystal growth modifier and the growing nuclei. The effect of the modified starch on the crystallization of calcium carbonate gave useful insight into designing CaCO 3 filler morphologies. It was found that the filler size, morphology and surface properties of fillers can be tailor-made by choosing suitable CaCO 3 crystallization conditions as well as a suitable crystal growth modifier. The crystallized CaCO 3 had a negatively charged surface. Results of fluorescence studies showed that the PAA modified starch (polymeric additive used) resided on the surface of the crystals. Thus the presence of the polysaccharide on the surface of a filler could be advantageous for strengthening fiber–filler bonding in paper applications. Anionic starch materials were also used to prepare anionic-starch-coated starch particles. Both the anionic starch and anionic-starch-coated starch particles were evaluated for PCC retention and other properties of hand sheets. When anionic-starch-coated starch particles were used there was generally an improvement in the PCC retention, while the other paper properties remained desirable. The success achieved with the use of anionic-starch-coated starch particles now opens the way for the further preparation and testing of various modified starch particles, for optimization of filler retention...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest to replace fossil-based materials with renewable alternatives. Cellulose fibers/nanofibrils (CNF) are sustainable options since they are biobased and biodegradable. In addition, they combine low weight with high strength; making them suitable to, for example, reinforce composites. However, {{to be able to}} use them as such, modifications are often necessary. This study therefore aimed at <b>modifying</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers,</b> model surfaces of cellulose and CNF. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> and CNF were thereafter incorporated into composite materials and evaluated. Surface-initiated ring-opening polymerization (SI-ROP) was performed to graft ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) from <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers.</b> From these fibers, paper-sheet biocomposites were produced that could form laminate structures without the need for any addition of matrix polymer. By combining ROP and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), diblock copolymers of poly(2 -dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and PCL were prepared. Quaternized (cationic) PDMAEMA, allowed physical adsorption of block copolymers onto anionic surfaces, and, thereby, alteration of surface energy and adhesion to a potential matrix. Furthermore, the architecture of block copolymers of PCL and PDMAEMA was varied to investigate effects on morphology/crystallinity and adsorption behavior. In addition, poly(butadiene) was also evaluated as the hydrophobic block in the form of cationic and anionic triblock copolymers. Polystyrene (PS) was covalently grafted from CNF and used as reinforcement in PS-based composites. In an attempt to determine stress transfer from matrix to CNF, a method based on Raman spectroscopy was utilized. Covalent grafting and physical adsorption of PCL from/onto CNF were compared by incorporating modified CNF in PCL matrices. Both approaches resulted in improved mechanical properties compared to unmodified CNF, but even at low amounts of modified CNF, covalent grafting gave tougher materials and indicated higher interfacial adhesion.

This study presents an analysis of the kinetics of modified starch adsorption onto <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> via the application of the modified Langmuir adsorption theory (i. e. the collision theory). A model based on this theory was used to describe the kinetics of starch binding, and to obtain the adsorption rate constant under different process conditions, which closely correspond to the conditions commonly encountered in industrial production of paper and board. The model predictions were then correlated with the experimental data. The adsorption of modified starch was found to increase by increasing the fiber consistency, shear forces (via stirring frequency) and the refining degree of fibers.

40|$|Applications {{that require}} {{electrical}} energy storage {{are becoming increasingly}} diverse. This development {{is caused by a}} number of factors, such as an increasing global energy demand, the advent of electric vehicles, the utilization of intermittent renewable energy sources, and advances in disposable and organic electronics. These applications will set different demands on their electrical energy storage and, thus, there will be no single technology used for all applications. For some applications the choice of energy storage materials will be extremely important. Conventional batteries and supercapacitors rely on the use of nonrenewable inorganic materials mined from depleting ores, hence, requiring large amounts of energy for their processing. Such materials also add a significant cost to the final product, making them less attractive for large scale applications. Conducting polymers, on the other hand, constitute a class of materials {{that can be used for}} organic matter based energy storage devices. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the use of a composite consisting of the conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy) and cellulose derived from Cladophora sp. algae for electrical energy storage. The polymer was coated onto the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> by chemical polymerization resulting in a flexible material with high surface area. By using this composite as electrodes, electrochemical cells consisting of disposable and non-toxic materials can be assembled and used as energy storage devices. The resistances of these prototype cells were found to be dominated by the resistance of the current collectors and to scale with the thickness of the separator, and can hence be reduced by cell design. By addition of nanostructured PPy, the weight ratio of PPy in the composite could be increased, and the cell voltages could be enhanced by using a carbonized negative electrode. Composites of cellulose and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) could also be synthesized and used as electrode materials. The porosities of the electrodes were controlled by mechanical compression of the composite or by coating of surface <b>modified</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibers</b> with additional PPy. Finally, the self-discharge was studied extensively. It was found that oxygen was responsible for the oxidation of the negative electrode, while the rate of self-discharge of the positive electrode increases with increasing potential. Through measurements of the charge prior to and after self-discharge, as well as with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, it was found that the self-discharge of the positive electrode was linked to an exchange of the counter ions by hydroxide ions. It is also demonstrated that the self-discharge rate of a symmetric PPy based device can be decreased dramatically by proper balancing of the electrode capacities and by reducing the oxygen concentration. The results of this work are expected to contribute towards future industrial implementation of electric energy storage devices based on organic materials...|$|R
