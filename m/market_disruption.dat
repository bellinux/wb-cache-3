Predrag Dukic, senior equity sales trader at CM Capital Markets Bolsa, wrote: [...] "The independence movement seeks to paralyze the region with strikes, disobedience, etc., a nightmare scenario for what until yesterday seemed a strong Spanish economic recovery." [...] Markus Schomer, chief global economist at PineBridge Investments, suggested that the uncertainty both in and outside of Spain has made it hard to price the scenarios into final markets so far. Further he commented a strong approval could result in a euro 0.0255% sell off, just as {{in the aftermath of the}} German federal election the previous week. [...] "I don’t think there is an immediate change coming from that referendum. It'll take quite a bit longer to assess where this is going and what this will mean, how the EU will react, how the Spanish government will react. So I don't think you'll see people adjusting their portfolios on Monday, but you could get the classic knee-jerk, risk-off reaction." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{financial}} crisis of 1998, many hedge funds that were engaged in arbitrage strategies experienced heavy losses and had to scale down their positions. The resulting price movements accentuated the losses and triggered further liquidations. Moreover, there was contagion, in that price movements in some markets induced price movements in others.

5000|$|Philippe Delacote {{points out}} that a problem {{contributing}} to a generally low probability of success for any boycott {{is the fact that}} the consumers with the most power to cause <b>market</b> <b>disruption</b> are the least likely to participate; the opposite is true for consumers with the least power. Another collective behavior problem is the difficulty, or impossibility, of direct coordination amongst a dispersed group of boycotters. Yuksel and Mryteza emphasize the collective behavior problem of free riding in consumer boycotts, noting that some individuals may perceive participating to be too great an immediate personal utility sacrifice. They also note that boycotting consumers took the collectivity into account when deciding to participate, that is, consideration of joining a boycott as goal-oriented collective activity increased one’s likelihood of participating. A corporation-targeted protest repertoire including boycotts and education of consumers presents the highest likelihood for success.|$|E
5000|$|Direct {{market access}} (DMA) {{is a term}} used in {{financial}} markets to describe electronic trading facilities that give investors wishing to trade in financial instruments a way {{to interact with the}} order book of an exchange. Normally, trading on the order book is restricted to broker-dealers and market making firms that are members of the exchange. Using DMA, investment companies (also known as buy side firms) and other private traders utilize the information technology infrastructure of sell side firms such as investment banks and the market access that those firms have, but control the way a trading transaction is managed themselves rather than passing the order over to the broker's own in-house traders for execution. Today, DMA is often combined with algorithmic trading giving access to many different trading strategies. Certain forms of DMA, most notably [...] "sponsored access," [...] have raised substantial regulatory concerns because of the potential for a malfunction by an investor to cause widespread <b>market</b> <b>disruption.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The risk of Deutsche taking large losses if the {{collateral}} was {{wiped out in}} a crisis was called the gap option.

In October 2008 they stopped modelling the gap option and just bought S&P put options to guard against further <b>market</b> <b>disruption,</b> {{but one of the}} whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{factors associated with}} social movements ’ abilities to disrupt corporate targets. I identify two kinds of disruption: <b>market</b> <b>disruption</b> and mediated disruption. <b>Market</b> <b>disruption</b> deters {{the ability of the}} corporate target to effectively accrue and use market resources, while mediated disruption occurs as a tactic communicates a movement’s claims about the target through third party intermediaries, like the media, thereby disrupting the target’s image and reputation. Using data on corporate boycotts in the United States from 1990 to 2005, the analyses assess the extent to which movement characteristics or target characteristics cause stock price declines of boycotted companies—i. e., market disruption—and the frequency of national media attention given to boycotts—i. e., mediated disruption. The analyses indicate that target characteristics matter more in shaping a boycott’s initial market disruption; however, both movement and target characteristics affect mediated disruption. Certain movement characteristics, like social movement organization (SMO) formality, public demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements, enable mediated disruption but have no effect on <b>market</b> <b>disruption.</b> A firm’s size makes it vulnerable to both market and mediated disruption, while slack resources help a firm avoid <b>market</b> <b>disruption.</b> A target’s reputational ranking initially buffers it from <b>market</b> <b>disruption</b> but increases its vulnerability to mediated disruption. The results indicate that the two kinds of disruption are interrelated. <b>Market</b> <b>disruption</b> has a marginal effect on the intensity of subsequent media coverage and ongoing media attention accentuates further <b>market</b> <b>disruption...</b>|$|E

It is known that implementation of formal sustainability programs of most fashion companies relate a lot to their resource management as well as supply chain structure. A natural question on "how the formal sustainability program affects the fashion enterprises under the market disruption" hence arises.

To be specific, we compare the business performances of the fashion groups with and without formal sustainability programs {{before and after the}} <b>market</b> <b>disruption.</b> We find some statistically significant results which reveal that fashion enterprises which have not established formal sustainability programs perform relatively well under the <b>market</b> <b>disruption.</b> After that, we drill deeper and show that the "fashionable" fashion groups (SFFGs) which have developed sustainability programs suffer a drop in ROE and there is no enhancement in any other dimensions.
