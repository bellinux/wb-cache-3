2500|$|Although this {{technique}} is rather simple, it represents an enormous fabrication problem. A new kind of cell pattern potentially introduces as much as twice the amount of fabrication cost and infrastructure; the number of possible quantum dot locations on an [...] grid is doubled and an overall increase in geometric design complexity is inevitable.

50|$|The type {{of power}} dissipation, whether {{continuous}} or pulsed, affects the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>temperature,</b> due to thermal capacitance characteristics; in general, {{the lower the}} frequency of pulses for a given power dissipation, the higher maximum operating ambient temperature, due to allowing a longer interval for the device to cool down.
