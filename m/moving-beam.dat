In the building moving, {{the design of the}} underpinning joints {{is one of the key}} problems. As to the frame structure, the most widely used method is the double beam underpinning system. Our research group has conduct 16 underpinning joints tests considering the different influential factors to study the mechanical performance of it. This paper first introduces the experiment briefly. And then make finite element analysis on the mechanical behavior of the column underpinning joints using the software ABAQUS as the platform. In the finite element analysis, the solid element is adopted and the master-slave contact surface is used to simulate the interaction between the column and the underpinning beams. The results show that the failure of the <b>moving-beam</b> is ahead of the coupling-beam and the bending-shear failure occurred in the <b>moving-beam.</b> As to the interface between the column and the beam, the lower part of the contact failed and the gaps can be seen. From the analysis results, the contact stress on the column is not uniformly distributed and larger in the upper part of the contact surface which is accord to the test results...|$|E

Fabricated nanopatterned surfaces (fNPS) derived by characterization of these wings have also shown superior bactericidal activity [2]. However bactericidal NPS topologies vary in both geometry and chemical {{characteristics of the}} individual features in different insects and fabricated surfaces, rendering it difficult to ascertain the optimum geometrical parameters underling bactericidal activity. This situation calls for the adaptation of new and emerging techniques, which are capable of fabricating and characterising comparable structures to nNPS from biocompatible materials. In this research, CAD drawn nNPS representing an area of 10 μm x 10 μm was fabricated on a fused silica glass by Nanoscribe photonic professional GT 3 D laser lithography system using two photon polymerization lithography. The glass was cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol thrice and a drop of IP-DIP photoresist from Nanoscribe GmbH was cast onto the glass slide prior to patterning. Photosensitive IP-DIP resist was polymerized with high precision to make the surface nanopatterns using a 780 nm wavelength laser. Both <b>moving-beam</b> fixedsample (MBFS) and fixed-beam moving-sample (FBMS) fabrication approaches were tested during the fabrication process {{to determine the best}} approach for the precise fabrication of the required nanotopological pattern. Laser power was also optimized to fabricate the required fNPS, where this was changed from 3 mW to 10 mW to determine the optimum laser power for the polymerization of the photoresist for fabricating FNPS [...] ...|$|E
