50|$|Closed-loop: Motor-return is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the low pressure side, the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the low pressure side. Closed-loop circuits are generally used for hydrostatic transmissions in mobile applications. Advantages: No directional valve and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump swivel angle covers {{both positive and negative}} flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and filtering. The flush valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at <b>maximum</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed.</b> The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using hydrostatic transmissions at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended.|$|E

40|$|Road {{vehicles}} {{tend to be}} {{more vulnerable}} to accidents especially at motorway <b>speeds.</b> Commercial <b>vehicles</b> in particular are more prone to overturning accidents due to adverse conditions like cross winds and abrupt acceleration/braking conditions. Thus, it is essential to investigate vehicle stability under various conditions of manoeuvring, cross winds and on inclined ground planes. This work presents a methodology of determining rollover stability of road vehicles. A wide range of destabilising factors have been investigated. These include the longitudinal and lateral inclination of the ground plane, road surface curvature; acceleration and braking effects; centrifugal cornering effects as well as the aerodynamic effects of cross winds at various wind speeds and angles of attack. These destabilising factors have been described in detail, with a description of associated variables that influence vehicle stability. A four-equation model has been proposed to evaluate the vertical ground reaction forces at each wheel, based on the force-moment system created by the above-mentioned destabilising factors. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the influence of various parameters on the overall stability of the vehicle. It is noted that higher magnitude of wind velocities cause a reduction in the <b>maximum</b> safe <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds.</b> Moreover, for high magnitude of wind speeds, it is also seen that for some vehicles wind angles as low as 5 ° can cause overturning accidents, even at low <b>vehicles</b> <b>speeds</b> of 15 m/s (33. 5 mile/hour, 54 km/hour). Additionally, the influence of acceleration, braking, turning and road surface curvature has been investigated. An increase in vehicle mass is seen to be beneficial as it increases the <b>maximum</b> safe <b>vehicle</b> <b>speeds</b> for a given set of wind conditions, thus making the vehicle more stable.

In order to unlock widespread applicability of these platforms, {{they need to be}} capable of operating under a variety of environmental conditions.

40|$|Modern {{trains are}} {{equipped}} with different braking systems, between which the braking effort can be distributed. Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. Tread brake systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, <b>maximum</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed,</b> deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed.

Perhaps the most challenging mobility hazard is the 2 ̆ 2 negative obstacle 2 ̆ 2, such as a hole or ditch. These hazards are difficult to see from the ground, limiting <b>maximum</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed.</b> From the air, however, these obstacles are often far easier to detect.

This concept is shown in Figure 1. The FE can be considered a longer-range “scout” to explore terrain before the UGV must traverse it, allowing the UGV to avoid certain areas entirely because of hazards or cul-de-sacs detected by the FE.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} {{specific aspects of}} human factors involved in driving a vehicle with a modified Drive-by-Wire (DBW) control system. A DBW system is an electro-mechanical system which controls the primary operations of a vehicle such as steering, acceleration, and braking using a controller such as a joystick. Designing a human interface system for a DBW system involves three main phases in the human factors design process namely user centric/ergonomic design conception, building a prototype and validating the prototype based on human factor considerations. The main objective and focus {{of this research is}} to conceptualize a more ergonomic DBW control interface based on human participant evaluations completed in a virtual reality driving simulator equipped with DBW controls. A secondary consideration is the gathering of data for the preparation of a future driver training course. The driving characteristics of 30 participants consisting of 3 different groups, ages 18 - 64, ages 65 +,and people with disabilities were evaluated while driving with three different controllers: a joystick, a reduced effort steering wheel plus gas-brake lever combination (GB), and conventional vehicle controls (no Drive-by-Wire or NDBW), which included foot pedals and a steering wheel. The participants were required to drive through different scenarios such as mountain, city, and highway roads, in order to obtain user capabilities related to the steering, accelerating, braking, and compliance with traffic rules. To examine the steering lane data obtained from the simulator, percent error in lane deviation was calculated and presented against time. The results indicated that the joystick was the most difficult to drive on a straight road. The GB controller was easier to control on straight path maneuvers than the joystick, but it had an over-steering tendency at curves while the joystick was better at curves. To examine group differences of different variables, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Results showed that lane position variation, reaction time to brake, reaction distance and stopping distance had significance among variables such as <b>maximum</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed,</b> improper space cushions, and missed turn signals, etc. Understanding the above characteristics can largely help {{in the development of a}} DBW interface system that heavily weighs human factors...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{simulation}} model is presented that enables {{a comparison of}} different hybrid topologies, with respect to fuel consumption, emissions and performance. The obtained results stress {{the properties of the}} different topologies and form a foundation for the choice of hybrid topology. The simulation models included in this thesis are the result of collaboration with Petter Strandh at the Division of Combustion Engines, Department of Heat and Power Engineering, Lund University. The studied hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are restricted to those with an internal combustion engine (ICE), an electrical energy storage and at least one electric machine in the driveline. The goal with the work presented in this thesis is to: # 1. Model hybrid topologies as comparable as possible regarding motor models, battery models, control laws, major energy converters and relevant limitations due to speed and torque. # 2. Compare the number of possible topologies, which increase drastically when adding more clutches, electric machines and other components. Therefore only four, however essential, topologies are chosen for the comparison. The four topologies that have been selected are series, parallel, strigear and power split hybrid. The hybrid topologies have been simulated in two different cycles, the demanding highway cycle US 06 and the slower urban cycle ECE 15 with its much smoother accelerations. The reference vehicle in the simulations has been a Toyota Prius, an electric hybrid family car, which is available on the market today. As input for the ICE, measured values from a SAAB naturally aspirated gasoline engine has been used, but scaled to better correspond to the ICE in the real Prius. There are many possible parameters in the simulation models, that are adjustable; vehicle chassis parameters, engine, electric machine(s) and battery size and types, losses models, charging strategies and driver behaviour etc. To investigate all of them is possibly interesting but not realistic in this survey. It is not the aim and the result flow would be overwhelming. Therefore six key parameters are chosen and thereafter adjusted one by one. The chosen ones are ICE dynamic response time constant, battery inner resistance, ICE charging gain, engine and motor sizes and finally <b>maximum</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed.</b> The work presents a limited number of results. The results presented have been chosen to illustrate the impact the individual parameter has to the behaviour of the single topology. The results of the simulated topologies have been compared with measurements made by MTC in Sweden and EPA in USA on a Toyota Prius. The received results can be evaluated with the help of different criteria. Two different criteria are shown {{as an example of how}} the chosen criteria influence the results; the price of fuel consumption and produced emissions respectively a mutual comparison using weight factors. The results from the simulations made, show that the parallel topology is the most efficient alternative. It is also the topology with the lowest complexity. It should be observed that the differences between the strigear and the parallel hybrid do sometimes not exist or turn to be of advantage to the strigear. The parallel topology however turns to be the preferred choice due to its lower complexity...|$|E
