5|$|Bayern and Baden were {{regarded}} as exceptional sea boats by the German navy. Bayern and her sisters were stable and very maneuverable. The ships suffered slight speed loss in heavy seas; with the rudders hard over, the ships lost up to 62% speed and heeled over 7degrees. With a <b>metacentric</b> <b>height</b> of , larger than that of their British equivalents, the vessels were stable gun platforms for the confined waters of the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large <b>metacentric</b> <b>height,</b> which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} ship’s {{parametric}} roll. In particular, {{a series of}} controlled experiments have been performed {{in order to obtain}} repeatable results both for the inception and the roll amplitude in parametric roll condition for tumblehome geometry. The tests have been carried out in the INSEAN basin n. 2, that is 220 m long, 9 m wide and 3. 5 m deep and equipped with a flap-type wave maker at the basin end. The model was tested in regular head waves in 3 DoF condition, being roll, pitch and heave motions free and surge, sway and yaw restrained. For the restrained motions, forces and moment were measured, in order to complete the dataset. Tests were carried out for three different <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> in a range of speeds. Parametric roll excitation has been observed for different <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights,</b> wave steepness and Froude number with high repeatability. This allows us to promote the collected dataset as a reliable benchmark for both CFD codes and theoretical models. The experimental work, which is the subject of the present paper, is part of cooperative research project between the IIHR (Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research), the University of Trieste and the Italian ship model basin (INSEAN) [1, 2], while the validation of the CFD (U-RANS) and theoretical models results will be the subject of a future work, which is at present in preparation and involves other international collaborations beyond the ones listed here...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the roll behaviour of ships with significant restoring nonlinearities in beam waves. A simplified 1 -DOF roll dynamical model {{based on a}} relative angle approach for the restoring term is described and employed. A more widely used model based on an absolute angle modelling for the nonlinear roll restoring, and a model with linear restoring are also considered {{in order to provide}} a ground for comparison. The relative angle modelling is qualitatively discussed to show the possibility that the frequency mixing induced by nonlinearities of restoring, which apply directly to the forcing, could create forcing terms falling close to the roll resonance frequency. Numerical simulations are performed for a hull with hardening restoring and relatively low <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights.</b> Two cases are considered in the simulations: an archetypal two-harmonics forcing and the case of irregular waves. In both cases it will be shown that nonlinearities of restoring are responsible for the creation of indirectly excited harmonic components of roll motion close to the roll natural frequency. Interesting additional nonlinear effects are highlighted, in particular in case of irregular sea excitation...|$|R

The simulation combines nonlinear equations for roll and surge motions with a linear treatment of heave, pitch, sway, and yaw, using the strip method. The rate of inflow and outflow of water through the damage openings is estimated form {{the motions of}} the internal and the external water surface relative to the openings, so that the volume of water in each damaged compartment and on the vehicle deck is corrected at each time step. Special {{emphasis was placed on}} simulating realistically the motion of water on deck. For three ships, and with different subdivisions on the ro-ro deck, damage positions, trims and drafts, the limit between safe and unsafe damaged <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> is determined by performing the simulation with different KG values. The simulation method was comprehensively validated by comparison with model tests. A series of parameter investigations was carried out, including damaged freeboard, damage location, vehicle deck subdivisions, sheer of vehicle deck, down-flooding, transient flooding, encounter angle of seaway and speed of ship, with the view to identifying the more significant parameters influencing the survivability of a damaged ro-ro ship.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Perturbations vary in {{period and}} amplitude, and {{responses}} to unavoidable perturbations depend on response time and scale. Disturbances due to unavoidable perturbations occur in three translational planes and three rotational axes during forwards and backwards swimming. Stability depends on hydro-dynamic damping and correcting forces, which may be generated by propulsors (powered) or by control surfaces moving with the body (trimming). Hydrostatic forces affecting body orientation (posture) result in negative <b>metacentric</b> <b>heights</b> amplifying rolling disturbances. The ability to counteract perturbations and correct disturbances is greater for fishes with more slender bodies, which appears to affect habitat choices. Postural control problems are greatest at low speeds, and are avoided by some fishes by sitting on the bottom. In currents, body form and behavior affect lift, drag, weight, and friction and hence speeds to which posture can be controlled. Self-correcting and regulated damping and trimming mechanisms are most im-portant in stabilizing swimming trajectories. Body resistance, fin trajectory, multiple propulsors, and long-based fins damp self-generated locomotor disturbances. Powered control using the tail evolved early in chordates, and is retained by most groups, although fishes, especially acanthopterygians, make greater use of appendages. As with most areas of stability, little is known of control costs. Costs and benefits of low-density inclusions and hydrodynamic mechanisms for depth control vary with habits and habitats. Control may make substantial contributions to energy budgets...|$|R
