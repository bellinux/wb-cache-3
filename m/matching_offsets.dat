40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A {{metallic}} inlay implant (HemiCAP) with 15 offset sizes {{has been}} developed {{for the treatment of}} localized osteochondral defects of the medial talar dome. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the following hypotheses: (1) a <b>matching</b> <b>offset</b> size is available for each talus, (2) the prosthetic device can be reproducibly implanted slightly recessed in relation to the talar cartilage level, and (3) with this implantation level, excessive contact pressures on the opposite tibial cartilage are avoided. METHODS: The prosthetic device was implanted in 11 intact fresh-frozen human cadaver ankles, aiming its surface 0. 5 mm below cartilage level. The implantation level was measured at 4 margins of each implant. Intraarticular contact pressures were measured before and after implantation, with compressive forces of 1, 000 - 2, 000 N and the ankle joint in plantigrade position, 10 dorsiflexion, and 14 plantar flexion. RESULTS: There was a <b>matching</b> <b>offset</b> size available for each specimen. The mean implantation level was 0. 45 (SD 0. 18) mm below the cartilage surface. The defect area accounted for a median of 3 % (0. 02 - 18) of the total ankle contact pressure before implantation. This was reduced to 0. 1 % (0. 02 - 13) after prosthetic implantation. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the implant can be applied clinically in a safe way, with appropriate offset sizes for various talar domes and without excessive pressure on the opposite cartilag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A smart {{temperature}} sensor in 0. 7 m CMOS is ac-curate to within 0. 1 C (3) over the full military temperature range of 55 C to 125 C. The sensor uses substrate PNP transis-tors to measure temperature. Errors resulting from nonidealities in the readout circuitry {{are reduced to}} the 0. 01 C level. This is achieved by using dynamic element matching, a chopped current-gain independent PTAT bias circuit, and a low-offset second-order sigma-delta ADC that combines chopping and correlated double sampling. Spread of the base-emitter voltage characteristics of the substrate PNP transistors is compensated by trimming, based on a calibration at one temperature. A high trimming resolution is ob-tained by using a sigma-delta current DAC to fine-tune the bias current of the bipolar transistors.

30|$|The {{concept of}} low-to-zero flow at subauroral latitudes {{has been applied}} to mapping {{electrostatic}} potential patterns derived from ion drift and electric field measurements from satellites. In deriving large-scale statistical convection patterns from Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) ion drift data, Rich and Hairston (1994) developed a detailed algorithm for setting the electrostatic potential to zero just equatorward of the auroral oval. They characterized the location of the subauroral region based on the observation of a constant near-zero ion flow in both the along-track and cross-track directions having a sufficiently small standard deviation located equatorward of 65 ° magnetic latitude (MLAT). The potential calculated at the located end point was used as an offset to correct the potential calculated along the entire high-latitude portion of the satellite pass. Weimer (1995) also pointed out the need to correct for unknown offsets in Dynamics Explorer 2 (DE 2) electric field data. For each satellite pass he identified reference points, chosen to be the low-latitude boundary of the convection zone, where the potential should be the same. If reference point potentials did not <b>match,</b> <b>offsets</b> were introduced into the electric field data to ensure a match. Similar techniques are applied by Hairston and Heelis (1990) for DE 2 data and by Hairston and Heelis (1995) for DMSP data. Zeroing the potential at the low-latitude convection zone boundary, according to Weimer (1995), allows one to isolate the solar wind-driven component of the potential pattern. It should be noted that zeroing the potential at lower latitudes is equivalent to applying an offset to the velocity data to set it to zero.|$|R

Current trends show {{increased}} interest in printing fine art books on digital presses. It is necessary to understand {{the extent to which}} digital printing systems are capable of accurately rendering fine-art reproductions. This research analyzed paper properties that maximize image quality and preference for digitally printed fine art reproductions. Four images, representing four art media, were printed on twelve papers using two digital presses. The twelve papers represented different combinations of color, print-show-through, roughness and gloss. A psychophysical experiment was conducted in which observers ranked the twelve papers for each image on the basis of image quality, color rendering quality, and surface appearance quality. The results were analyzed and a model was developed to predict the probability that a paper was ranked in the top three. Paper color (coolness), basis weight, roughness, and gloss were model parameters. Unlike gloss, roughness, and print-show-through, there was no previous metric for quantifying coolness. Therefore, an additional experiment was conducted to develop a model to predict the perception of coolness using colorimetry. An alternative experiment model was also developed that included parameters such as caliper, print gloss, line raggedness, and dot circularity. The resulting models allowed for the optimization of paper parameters that maximize the probability a paper will produce preferred and high quality images. It was concluded that the probability a book was judged as having high image quality was optimized for papers with high coolness, low roughness and low gloss. Neither print show-through, line raggedness, nor mottle were significant factors. An additional lexical analysis was performed for observer descriptions of their ranking behavior.

These differences can also be described as “financial balances”. Thus, if a sector is spending less than its income it must be accumulating (net) claims on other sectors. The crucial point is that, since sectoral balances must sum to zero, a rise in the deficit of one sector must be <b>matched</b> by an <b>offsetting</b> change in the others.

Since 2007, 8 patients have received CT-based, 3 D-planned conformal CSI in our Institute. Patient immobilization was made in prone position in a vacuum bed, using skull and pelvis masks. Organ-at-risk (OAR) contours were made by radiographers. PTV was contoured by radiation oncologists. The prescribed dose to the PTV was 36 Gy with 1. 8 Gy dose per fraction. In the planning process the following aspects were taken under consideration: all points of the PTV had to receive at least 95 % of the prescribed dose (according to ICRU 50, 62); at junction field edges the overlapping parts were eliminated using a multisegmental technique, where the adjacent segment ends of the neighbouring fields were shifted two times 2 cm, so that the three equally weighted segments used in one field had 2 - 2 cm distance from each other. In the CSI planning {{the shape of the}} patient and so the length of the PTV has made a big emphasis on determining the number of field matching. Thus in some cases instead of two, only one field matching was sufficient - this could be achieved by increasing the source-to-skin distance (SSD) of the fields. The verification made with a solid-water phantom justified the precision of the field <b>matching.</b> The <b>offset</b> used at junction field edges in between one treatment facilitates the verification of field matching - and so the patient positioning. Thus the possibility of having overdosed regions could be reduced, which was very important from a radiation biological point of view. Peer reviewe...|$|R
