5000|$|One {{key point}} of the {{documentary}} is the link between Vergès and François Genoud. It shows <b>that</b> <b>Vergès</b> and Genoud were friends from the 1960s to the 1990s and <b>that</b> <b>Vergès</b> defended in court militant groups and individuals whose defense was funded by Genoud, including the FLN, Carlos, Barbie, Bruno Bréguet and Magdalena Kopp.|$|R

50|$|Fukuhara's {{voice was}} {{classified}} as Spinto lirico soprano <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> to Lyric Soprano with three octave vocal range (from a low C3 up to soprano high D6).

5000|$|... "Spontaneous in his approach, Day {{utilizes}} various bits {{of visual}} information: tables, lists, Shakespeare quotes, typography <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on concrete poetry … it sounds messy, but the connection and slippages of these digression make for an intoxicating and dissonant piece of prose." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If O'Brien's poems have a sameness of diction {{and rhythm}} <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on {{monotonous}} and impersonal, it's the same sameness of heartbeat and breath, prayer and meditation. It's a poetry that asks for patient attention, and gives {{back all the}} void's abundance." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{occasional}} {{poems that}} Mickiewicz {{wrote in his}} final decades {{have been described as}} [...] "exquisite, gnomic, extremely short and concise".

"Ay, my good Parker," [...] {{interrupted}} the rear-admiral, [...] "and they who {{have ever known}} them, know their emptiness; most especially as they approach <b>that</b> <b>verge</b> of existence whence the eye looks in a near and fearful glance, over the vast and unknown range of eternity." ...|$|R
50|$|Melampus' {{reputation}} as a seer spawned myths <b>that</b> <b>verge</b> on anecdote, to account for his gift, the offering of serpents. In one, as a young boy, he told his servants not to kill two snakes. Grateful, the snakes gave Melampus the ability to speak with animals.|$|R
5000|$|John Clute {{writes that}} [...] "McIntosh never lost the vivid {{narrative}} skills {{that made him}} an interesting figure of 1950s sf, but his failure to challenge himself or his readers in his later career led to results <b>that</b> <b>verged</b> on mediocrity. His early work warrants revival".|$|R

30|$|If the Crocker fault {{system is}} the {{expression}} of a bending-moment fault above a tectonically driven thrust fault <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> into Sabah’s offshore faults, the potential for even larger earthquakes sourced from the underlying thrust fault would exist. This connection is so speculative, however, that we do not consider scenarios for such earthquakes.|$|R
5000|$|Although much of {{her work}} deals with serious issues, Albarracín populates her artistic vision {{so that it is}} [...] "full of parodies and tragi-comedies <b>that</b> <b>verge</b> on cathartic paryoxysm."

5000|$|Rockwall House, {{which is}} still well-known, is located at Rockwall Crescent that is the well-preserved Regency house <b>that</b> <b>Verge</b> {{designed}} for John Bushby.

5000|$|Rebecca Bowden of Yahoo! {{said that}} she [...] "absolutely loves the late night 'Hollyoaks' episodes and {{although}} they can often be filled with plotlines <b>that</b> <b>verge</b> precariously on the unbelievable side, they are also always packed full of drama, emotion and more explosive content than can be broadcast during the show's usual earlier weekday slot".|$|R

50|$|The Weekly World News was {{a largely}} fictional news tabloid {{published}} in the United States from 1979 to 2007, renowned for its outlandish cover stories often based on supernatural or paranormal themes and an approach to news <b>that</b> <b>verged</b> on the satirical. Its characteristic black-and-white covers have become pop-culture images widely used in the arts. It ceased publication in August 2007.|$|R
50|$|Panare is best {{classified}} as a heavy-agglutinating language <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on polysynthesis. Many of its morphemes can be clearly identified by roots that remain isolated across inflectional processes, and inflection by multiple affixes is usually light. Words can grow long and complicated, but they can usually be rooted in one firm idea, rather than something akin to a process-based sentence.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} in the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan {{described}} Red Corner as a [...] "sluggish and uninteresting melodrama that is further hampered by the delusion that it is saying something significant. But its one-man-against-the-system story is hackneyed and the points it thinks it's making {{about the state of}} justice in China are hampered by an attitude <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on the xenophobic." ...|$|R
50|$|The former story {{revolves}} around Abel (played by Bong Revilla) {{as a single}} father and secret agent who handles cases <b>that</b> <b>verge</b> on the paranormal, and Candy (played by Rufa Mae Quinto) as a witch who renounces her powers to live among mortals. Sometime in 2006, the show {{has been turned into}} a game show-like reality sitcom, but the cast had retained their original roles.|$|R
5000|$|McMahon's {{early work}} was characterised by a quick, {{spontaneous}} approach <b>that</b> <b>verged</b> on the messy. His figures were lean and loose, his pen lines thrown down with verve and energy, and hatching {{was done with}} a fully charged brush. He drew {{the bulk of the}} first long-form Judge Dredd story, [...] "The Cursed Earth", with the slower, more meticulous Brian Bolland contributing occasional episodes.|$|R
50|$|Graphic {{and plastic}} arts are {{essentially}} {{limited to the}} adornment of utilitarian objects and the masks and other items used by the various societies. In the past, the Ragbenle masks, especially, were many and varied. The verbal arts are stressed, and Temne use riddles and proverbs in instruction, engage in storytelling <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on dramatic performance, and employ vocal music and drumming on various occasions. Jewelry is becoming more popular.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{opened to}} {{negative}} reviews in April 2015, with a critic from The Hindu noting it [...] "is an outdated film <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on the obscene" [...] and that [...] "its plot, its setting, its pace, its depiction of women — is dated". Likewise, a critic from The Times of India noted [...] "the whole enterprise feels like some badly made TV serial", particularly criticizing the film's depiction of women.|$|R
5000|$|Bridges {{was named}} [...] "Best Advertising Auteur" [...] by Connoisseur Magazine in 1989, inspiring the {{magazine}} to write, [...] "Whenever {{you see an}} ad <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on art, {{chances are good that}} Bridges had a hand in it--as either director, editor or graphic designer." [...] "...The techniques he pioneered as a backlash to formulaic commercials are now staples of the industry, as well as hallmarks of countless Hollywood feature films aiming for 'realism.'".|$|R
50|$|Goff was {{reassigned to}} the 75th Ranger Regiment as a Special Operations Medical Sergeant in 1993, and was {{attached}} to 3rd Ranger Battalion as part of Task Force Ranger for the operation in Mogadishu, Somalia.

Bishophouse Junction to Sunbeck Junction was not opened until 9 October 1871, when the Gilling and Pickering (G & P) route opened up to traffic.|$|R
5000|$|... "Birthday Sex" [...] has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from critics. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{called it a}} [...] "fantastic single", while comparing it to songs by R.

40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the paradoxes {{of the complex}} and highly redundant genomes. The central theses developed are that: (1) the distinctive feature of complex genomes is the existence of epigenetic mechanisms that permit extremely high levels of both tandem and dispersed redundancy; (2) the special contribution of transposable elements is to modularize the genome; and (3) the labilizing forces of recombination and transposition are just barely contained, giving a dynamic genetic system of ever increasing complexity <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on the chaotic...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} an optimum {{configuration}} for {{the components of}} an automated stereophotogrammetry system involves careful selection of system parameters against application criteria such as field of view, desired depth accuracy and available cam-era system constraints. Here, {{we focus on the}} desired accuracy in measurements within a scene and treat other system parameters as constraints on obtainable ac-curacy. We show <b>that</b> <b>verging</b> axis optical systems provide better accuracy- at the expense of some additional computational complexity in the scene reconstruction calculation. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick awarded the album 2½ stars stating [...] "One of the {{earliest}} recordings to embody what would {{come to be known}} as the ECM sound, Red Lanta is a series of piano/reed duets that have a Scandinavian starkness offset, somewhat unfortunately, by a soft sentimentality <b>that</b> <b>verges</b> on kitsch... this general approach proved extremely popular in the ensuing years, and devotees of ECM's later years will want to hear one of its points of germination".|$|R

But {{even in the midst}} of the babbling moan of fevered weakness, there was half a smile as of pleased surprise, and an evident craving for the strong support of his brother's arm, and by-and-by Jock looked up with meaning and recognition in his eyes, though quite unable to speak, in that faint and exhausted state indeed <b>that</b> <b>verged</b> nearer to death after every attack.|$|R
30|$|The 13 - to 14 -km {{depth of}} the Mt.

Further tests of the hypothesis could include comparison of the modern rates of convergence and extension across the offshore and onshore zones of convergence and extension, and geophysical analysis of the crustal-scale structural geometry of northwestern Sabah.|$|R
