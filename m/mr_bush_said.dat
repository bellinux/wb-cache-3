During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the Clinton administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>said</b> he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E

5000|$|... ==Reform {{within the}} {{framework}} of Iranian constitution== ===Criticism=== Khatamis desire to not make reforms out of the framework of Islamic Republic constitution, caused many people to question the outcome of his programs in areas such as implementation of a democratic society or womens rights. He has received criticism inside and outside the Islamic Republic. During a speech at Tehran University, a group of his former supporters who had grown disillusioned with him chanted, [...] " [...] No more lies! [...] ". Many of them had gotten physically beaten by police and other security forces before the meeting and were frustrated with Khatamis lack of action. According to Khatami,"The reforms should come from within the regime. I consider the Islamic Republic to be a great achievement of the most popular revolution in my lifetime." [...] Many of his supporter misunderstood this idea. With regard to those that were disillusioned with the epic of 23 May 1997, Khatami denounced a group that caused violence in the Iran student riots, July 1999 because of [...] "their envy" [...] and that they [...] "created obstacles to implementation of the will of the people" [...] referring to his opponents within the political establishment of the country. [...] Additionally, he asserted, [...] Rest assured that beyond the Islamic Republic {{there will not be a}} democratic regime in the true sense of the word. [...] In the same vein, he has ridiculed the idea of [...] "exporting" [...] Western-style democracy in the Middle East, Its a great joke - the greatest joke that <b>Mr</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>said,</b> that he would like to [...] "export" [...] democracy to the Middle East to the fact that because of different cultural and historical backgrounds, democracy can only be achieved through a process unique to each culture and is therefore not something that can be exported. It seems that Khatami had commitment to reforming the systems. He tries to change the political currents of the country. At the same time he wants to add new controversial dimensions to the public discussions. Of course his administrations could not provide the wide range of social and political reforms promised[...] The movement of 2nd khordad showed the last thread of ideology of Islamic republic in politics. This movement also insisted on the policymaking that Rafsanjani’s state has established.|$|E

40|$|The New York TimesAs the Bush {{administration}} considers how {{to proceed}} on Iraq, it has to confront a growing contradiction in its public pronouncements. For months, President Bush has insisted that Baghdad allow United Nations inspectors complete and unfettered access to sites where they suspect weapons are being stored or produced. At the same time, American officials have made clear that Mr. Hussein's regime represents an unacceptable threat that must be removed, by force if necessary. But what if Mr. Hussein lets United Nations inspectors back in and gives them complete access? Would the administration still insist on his removal? Yes, according to Secretary of State Colin Powell. "Even then," he told CNN last month, "the United States believes the Iraqi people would still {{be better off with}} a new kind of leadership that is not trying to hide this sort of development activity on {{weapons of mass destruction and}} is not of the despotic nature that the Saddam Hussein regime is. " Recently, President Bush was even more direct in putting the focus on Saddam Hussein himself, rather than on his weapons.
