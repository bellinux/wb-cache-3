40|$|Barium <b>metazirconate</b> (BaZrO 3) fine powder {{has been}} {{produced}} by thermally decomposing a molecular precursor, barium bis(citrato) oxozirconate(IV) tetrahydrate at about 700 -degrees-C. The precursor, Ba[ZrO(C 6 H 6 O 7) 2]. 4 H 2 O (BZO) has been synthesized and characterized by employing {{a combination of}} spectroscopic and thermoanalytical techniques. The precursor undergoes thermal decomposition in three major stages: (i) dehydration to give an anhydrous barium zirconyl citrate, (ii) decomposition of the anhydrous citrate in a multistep process to form an ionic oxycarbonate intermediate, Ba 2 Zr 2 O 5 CO 3, and (iii) decomposition of the oxycarbonate to produce BaZrO 3 fine powder. The particle size of the resultant BaZrO 3 is about 0. 2 mum, and the surface area {{is found to be}} 4. 0 m 2 g- 1...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and {{the thermal}} {{decomposition}} behavior of new molecular precursors, strontium, and calcium zirconyl citrates are presented. The pathway to the <b>metazirconate</b> formation {{has been found}} to proceed through a multistep process. The precursors yield SrZrO 3 and CaZrO 3 fine powders at temperatures as low as 650 degrees C. Physico-chemical, spectroscopic, thermoanalytical, and microscopic techniques have enabled the identification of the sequence of events leading to the perovskite formation and proposition of a thermolysis scheme. Retention of the molecular level mixing of the metal ions {{during the course of the}} precursor decomposition is supported by these techniques. Prior to the formation of MZrO 3 (M = Sr and Ca) an ionic oxycarbonate, M 2 Zr 2 O 5 CO 3 (M = SI. and Ca), intermediate is produced by the thermal decomposition of the citrate precursors...|$|E
40|$|Lithium <b>metazirconate</b> (Li{sub 2 }ZrO{sub 3 }) is a {{promising}} tritium breeder material for fusion reactors {{because of its}} excellent tritium release characteristics. In particular, for water-cooled breeding blankets (e. g., ITER), Li{sub 2 }ZrO{sub 3 } is appealing from a design perspective because of its good tritium release at low operating temperatures. The steady-state and transient tritium release/retention database for Li{sub 2 }ZrO{sub 3 } is reviewed, along with conventional diffusion and first-order surface resorption models which {{have been used to}} match the database. A first-order surface resorption model is recommended in the current work both for best-estimate and conservative (i. e., inventory upper-bound) predictions. Model parameters we determined and validated for both types of predictions, although emphasis is placed on conservative design predictions. The effects on tritium retention of ceramic microstructure, protium partial pressure in the purge gas and purge gas flow rate are discussed, along with other mechanisms for tritium retention which may not be dominant in the experiments, but may be important in blanket design analyses. The proposed tritium retention/release model can be incorporated into a transient thermal performance code to enable whole-blanket predictions of tritium retention/release during cyclic reactor operation. Parameters for the ITER driver breeding blanket are used to generate a numerical set of model predictions for steady-state operation...|$|E
40|$|A {{quadrupole}} {{mass spectrometer}} system was redesigned with pulse counting electronics and a resistively heated, high-temperature furnace. This system was employed in Knudsen effusion experiments to investigate the high temperature thermodynamics of strontium oxide, strontium <b>metazirconate,</b> strontium metahafnate, and three phases in the Ir-Al phase diagram. The strontium oxides were vaporized from thoria Knudsen cells and no container-sample reactions were observed. The enthalpy of formation of SrO(g) and the dissociation energy of this molecule were calculated from the measured third law enthalpy of the congruent vaporization reaction. These values were ΔfH 298 SrO(g) = 1. 8 ± 0. 9 kcal/mol and D 0 ∘ = 96. 2 ± 0. 9 kcal/mol. The enthalpy of formation of SrZrO 3 (s) was also determined from a congruent vaporization reaction. The third law enthalpy of formation was calculated to be ΔfH 298 SrZrO 3 (s) = - 405. 7 ± 4. 5 kcal/mol. Strontium metahafnate vaporized noncongruently in the temperature range 2280 - 2380 K. The third law heat of formation calculated from the measured vaporization enthalpy was ΔfH 298 SrHfO 3 (s) = - 426. 8 ± 1. 6 kcal/mol. The three phases in the Ir-Al phase diagram which were investigated may be represented as IrAl 3 + IrAl 2. 7, IrAl 2. 7 + IrAl, and Ir 0. 5 Al 0. 5. Aluminum vaporized noncongruently from these phases. The Al vaporization reactions in the two-phase regions may be written 3 IrAl 3 (s) → Ir 3 Al 8 (s) + Al(g) and Ir 3 Al 8 (s) → 3 IrAl(s) + 5 Al(g), respectively. The second law reaction enthalpies for these reactions were determined to be ΔrH 298 = 60. 7 kcal/mol and ΔrH 298 = 224. 5 kcal/mol, respectively. From the lines drawn through the ln a Al vs 1 /T plots, the activities of aluminum at 1500 K were calculated to be 0. 36, 0. 11, and 0. 0061, respectively...|$|E
