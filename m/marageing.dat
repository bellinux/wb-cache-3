40|$|Austenitic and {{martensitic}} steels age-hardened {{and with}} a low content of molibdenum are studied. The purpose is to study the possibility of various thermomechanical treatments to increase the ductility and the tougness of high-strength steels having an austenitic-martensitic structure and age-hardened. The features of the precipitation during ausageing {{and the effect of}} the precipitated phase on <b>marageing</b> are determined. The conditions for the increase of the ductility and the tougness by the structure modification resulting from the thermomechanical treatment are determined. The heat and thermomechanical treatment conditions allowing the sheets H 26 M 2 T 4 and H 26 M 2 T 4 U 2 to attain the high hardness and strength are developed. The thermomechanical treatment conditions allowing after standard <b>marageing</b> to increase a ductility and tougness factor of the sheets H 15 F 26 M 5 K 10 and H 12 M 6 K 12 X 4 T of 2 - 4 when the high strength retains are developedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} steels which are {{stronger}} than 2000 MPa, with toughness values exceeding 100 MPa m 1 / 2 and which have been in commercial service for many decades. Examples include the <b>marageing</b> alloys and carbide–free bainitic steels. By contrast, welding consumables with a proof strength in excess of 1000 MPa {{are few and far}} between. This is because whereas wrought steels can be thermomechanically processed to optimise their performance, most weld metals have to used in the as–cast condition and with impurity concentrations which are greater than is desirable. The weld metal can readily be made strong but without an accompanying ability to absorb energy during fracture, it cannot be used in practice. A variety of experimental and theoretical approaches towards stronger weld metals are assessed here. The modern trend has been towards low-carbon mixed microstructures of bainite and martensite. This is because none of the other phases such as allotriomorphic ferrite and Widmanstätten ferrite are capable of the required strength. Conventional wisdom that the toughness of martensite can be enhanced by increasing the nickel concentration has in general proved to be unreliable. Nickel is effective only when the manganese concentration is kept to a minimum. The mechanism of the synergy between manganese and nickel is discussed in the light of recent high–resolution experiments conducted at Chalmers University and ESAB in Sweden...|$|E
25|$|<b>Marage</b> {{made his}} debut for the Italian {{national}} {{team at the}} 2013 WCL Division Three tournament in Bermuda. On debut against Oman, he opened the batting with Damian Fernando, a former Chilaw Marians teammate. <b>Marage</b> made 19 runs from 25 balls (including two sixes) in that match, and took 1/18 from five overs while bowling. His other matches at the tournament were less successful – he made a three-ball duck against the United States and a golden duck against Bermuda, and failed to take a wicket in either match. The next major tournament for <b>Marage</b> and Italy was the 2013 European T20 Championship in England. He played in all seven matches, and his 276 runs was the most for Italy (and behind only Denmark's Frederik Klokker and Guernsey's Jeremy Frith overall). He topscored in three matches, with innings of 65* against Gibraltar, 107 against Norway, and 42 against Jersey. His innings against Norway, made in only 62 balls, was the first century in the tournament's history.|$|R
25|$|Born in Colombo, <b>Marage's</b> first {{recorded}} matches {{at a high}} level came during the 2001–02 season, when he played several games for Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club in an under-23 tournament. He made his first-class debut in November 2001, aged 20, playing for Chilaw Marians in the Premier Trophy. <b>Marage</b> finished his 2001–02 season with 107 runs and five wickets from seven Premier Trophy matches, as well as 61 runs and two wickets from six appearances in the Premier Limited Overs Tournament. His highest score, 42, came in the last fixture of the season, a Premier Trophy game against Moratuwa Sports Club.|$|R
25|$|By {{winning the}} European T20 Championship, Italy {{qualified}} for the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier, where matches had full Twenty20 status. <b>Marage</b> played in only five of Italy's games at the tournament – four out of seven group games (one being abandoned) and the quarter-final against Scotland. He had little success, making only five runs from three batting innings and conceding 44 runs (without taking a wicket) from five overs bowling. In an earlier warm-up game against the Netherlands he had been bowled by Tim Gruijters from the first ball of the match. <b>Marage</b> finished third in both runs scored and wickets taken for Italy at the 2014 WCL Division Four tournament in Singapore. His two best performances there both came against Denmark – {{a man of the}} match 82 in a group-stage match (including a 150-run opening partnership with Andrew Northcote), and then 4/33 in the third-place playoff. <b>Marage</b> has since been named in Italy's squad for its next major tournament, the 2015 European T20 Championship in Jersey.|$|R
25|$|<b>Marage</b> again {{appeared}} {{regularly for}} Chilaw Marians during the 2002–03 season, with {{nine out of}} a possible eleven Premier Trophy games. Against Ragama Cricket Club, he made what was to be his highest first-class score, 47 from eighth in the batting order. After his last match for Chilaw Marians in February 2003, <b>Marage</b> did not appear again at a high level until June 2004, when he played in an under-23 tournament for Saracens Sports Club. His 2004–05 senior season, his last in Sri Lanka, was spent with Panadura Sports Club, and consisted of six games in both the Premier Trophy and its limited-overs equivalent, as well as a single game in the knockout Twenty20 Tournament (the inaugural season of that format in Sri Lanka).|$|R
25|$|Dinidu Asanka <b>Marage</b> (born 24 September 1981) is an Italian cricketer of Sri Lankan origin. A {{right-handed}} leg spinning all-rounder, {{he played}} in high-level Sri Lankan domestic competitions for Chilaw Marians Cricket Club and Panadura Sports Club early in his career. After emigrating to Italy, he made his debut for the Italian national side in April 2013, at the 2013 World Cricket League Division Three tournament.|$|R
50|$|Scott de Martinville {{managed to}} sell several phonautographs to {{scientific}} laboratories {{for use in}} the investigation of sound. It proved useful in the study of vowel sounds and was used by Franciscus Donders, Heinrich Schneebeli and Rene <b>Marage.</b> It also initiated further research into tools able to image sound such as Koenig's manometric flame. He was not, however, able to profit from his invention and spent the remainder of his life as a librarian and bookseller at 9 Rue Vivienne in Paris.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a report of a survey {{conducted}} in Iran in September 2014 of archaeological sites from the Ilkhanate period. The Ilkhanate initially established its capital at <b>Marage,</b> subsequently relocating it to Tabriz and then to Soltaniyeh. In these cities, architectural ruins {{dating back to the}} period of Mongol rule have been preserved to this day, but are not widely known in Japan. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce the Ilkhanate-period sites remaining in Iran, with the hope of contributing to future research on this subject...|$|R
