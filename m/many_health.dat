5|$|According to an Iranian {{radio station}} report, 200 villages {{sustained}} severe damage or were totally destroyed. The United States Geological Survey estimated that 10,533houses were destroyed; an additional 5,474 homes sustained {{varying degrees of}} damage. Fifty thousand people were left homeless. Local officials initially estimated {{the cost of the}} damage at $67million 1997 US$ (roughly 89.5million 2008 USD). The estimate was later raised to 100million 1997 USD (roughly 133.6million 2008 USD). One hundred schools and <b>many</b> <b>health</b> centers in the stricken areas were discovered to be in need of repair work.|$|E
5|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} the influx of visitors during the summer. The High Street {{has a variety of}} shops and services, and there are a small number of factories. The elderly population has led to <b>many</b> <b>health</b> and social care jobs at local care homes. At the 2001 UK census, 6.9% of the population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E

5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as <b>many</b> <b>health</b> services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience <b>many</b> <b>health</b> problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to <b>many</b> <b>Health</b> and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E
