40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the ability of}} equity style to predict future movement of composite leading economic index in a multivariate Granger causality framework. By comparing the ef fi cacy of information transmission between equity style <b>index</b> and Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> Industrial <b>Index,</b> our results {{show that there is}} unidirectional causality from growth style to leading economic index. Second, there is also unidirectional fl ow from growth style to Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> Industrial <b>Index.</b> Third, there is a bidirectional relationship between growth style and KLCI broad market index. Finally, there is bidirectional causality between both growth style and value style. Further analysis from cross-correlation function reveals that growth style index is better than Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> Industrial <b>Index.</b> The former provides accurate and stronger cross-correlation with leading economic index. From these empirical evidences, it can be concluded that growth style index is a leading indicator which has more economic content than stock market index. It is better than stock market index in its ef fi cacy of information transmission.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{influence}} of a company 2 ̆ 7 s level of earnings and growth opportunities in determining the dividend policy choice of Malaysian-listed firms. The analysis is based on a sample of 136 firms listed on the Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> <b>Index</b> over a period of six years, from 1990 to 1996. The evidence suggests that the payers are more profitable than non-payers. Likewise, investment opportunity, which is measured by (∂At /At- 1) and (Vt /At), differed for both payers and non-payers. The regression estimates from Logit model suggest that the average coefficient for EATA is a significant determinant for firm 2 ̆ 7 s dividend policy choice in Malaysia. This is consistent with the supposition that profitable firms are more likely to pay dividends than less profitable firms. Although investment opportunities, the firm 2 ̆ 7 s size and leverage were not found to be statistically significant, they provided some explanation for the dividend policy choice. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) in the context of Malaysian listed firms between year 2014 and 2016. Summary This paper analysed the ROE and Tobin’s Q between CSR and Non-CSR firm in the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) between 2014 and 2016 to test for the presence of a bidirectional relationship between CSR and CFP as per literature. The KLCI firms were segregated into CSR and Non-CSR by consulting the FTSE 4 Good Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> <b>Index</b> (FBMI). Among the methods used to test this relationship were Student’s t-test, multivariate and logistic regression. Bootstrap confidence intervals of the regression coefficients were further used to determine the strength of the relationship. Conclusions This study found that there is a positive and significant relationship between CSR and CFP in that CSR one year lagged is followed by improved CFP in the financial year. CFP one year prior, however, does not seem to lead to decisions to engage in CSR. Therefore, this study proposes that Malaysian listed firms should engage in CSR as it forms a viable part of the strategy of a firm...|$|R

Furthermore, the paper argues that although MWI projected to increase about 1. 7 % per year with estimated growth of 5 - 6 % every year from 2016 - 2020, some challenges are expected to undermine the target set by Economic Planning Unit (EPU) if not given a proper attention. Furthermore, the study shared few wellbeing indicators that used internationally, which only concerned about material aspects and outcomes without looking into the spiritual part of wellbeing.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{asymmetric}} recognition of good and bad news on reported earnings of Malaysian-listed firms. The study uses both descriptive and regression analyses to ascertain whether there is a contemporaneous relationship between news (good and bad) and reported earnings. The analysis is based on a sample of 150 firms listed on the Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> <b>Index</b> over a period of 10 years, from 1990 to 2000. Two regression models were adopted based on Basu (1997) and Giner and Rees (2001). The first model aims to capture asymmetric recognition of good and bad news into reported earnings while the latter model is developed to capture both asymmetric recognition of information shock and permanent earnings effect on contemporaneous earnings. The evidence from this study reported the steady increase in earnings per share till 1997. However, a drastic decline was observed for the period 1997 to 1999 because of Asian financial crisis. The findings from the regression model one suggested that the asymmetric recognition of good news was more prominent during the good time compare to bad time and vice versa. The findings from model two also suggested that autoregressive effect of permanent effect was very prominent both for crisis and non crisis periods. <br /...|$|R

40|$|An {{increase}} in corporate {{failure in the}} global market resulted in an {{increase in}} demand on risk disclosure by the market participants. Owing to the rule of full disclosure in Islamic accounting, Shari'ah compliant companies need to increase the quality of corporate disclosure to maintain investors' confidence towards the benefits of Shari'ah principles in protecting their investment returns that include information on business risks. For Shari'ah compliant companies, Shari'ah stock screening criteria involves investment screening based on qualitative and quantitative tools that will result in the selection of Shari'ah compliant companies and removal of Shari'ah non-compliant companies. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the influence of corporate risk disclosure on companies' performance. The second objective is to examine the moderation effect of the screening criteria (FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS Shari 'ah Index and FTSE Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> Hijrah Shari'ah <b>Index)</b> on the relationship between CRD and companies' performance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contemplate}} the degree to which technical expertise in Malaysian Big 4 auditing practice survives periods of material regulatory inflexion sufficiently to underpin quality financial reporting outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – The adoption of IAS in Malaysia in 2006 introduced a highly technical standard (financial reporting standards – FRS 136) which impacted not only preparers but also auditors of financial statements. This transition period represents a unique opportunity to interrogate the content of financial statements drawn up under new and complex standards, with a view to gaining insight into the quality of oversight offered by the audit profession. Findings – Contrary to the view within the extant literature that there is homogeneity in audit quality among Big 4 firms, this paper reports substantial cross-sectional variation among the sample of Big 4 Malaysian audit firms and reports on distinctly poor compliance levels. Research limitations/implications – The research focuses on compliance with various requirements under FRS 136 – Impairment of Assets among a sample of first-time adaptors drawn from the FTSE Bursa <b>Malaysia</b> <b>Index</b> whose 2006 financial accounts have been audited by a Big 4 auditor. Practical implications – The results raise questions about audit quality among the sample firms and the robustness of regulatory oversight institutions operating within Malaysia. Originality/value – This research illustrates a novel approach to examining the issue of audit quality by introducing a compliance quality approach focusing on note-form disclosures. 19 page(s...|$|R

The listed companies were screened using those criteria. An equally weighted portfolio was created using the screened companies and their one-year and two-year returns calculated. The returns were compared to the market return. Hypotheses of this research were tested using t-test statistic to determine the significance of the data. This research found that most of the screening criteria used generated returns that were higher than the market return in almost every year they were tested in.
