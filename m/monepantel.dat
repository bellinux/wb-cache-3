40|$|<b>Monepantel</b> is a {{recently}} developed anthelmintic {{with a novel}} mode of action. Parasitic nematodes with reduced sensitivity to <b>monepantel</b> {{have led to the}} identification of MPTL- 1, a ligand-gated ion-channel subunit of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, as a potential drug target. Homomeric MPTL- 1 channels reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes are gated by µM concentrations of betaine and mM concentrations of choline. Measurement of reversal potentials indicated that the channel has a similar conductance for Na(+) and K(+) ions and does not permeate Ca(2 +). Concentrations of <b>monepantel</b> (amino-acetonitrile derivative [AAD]- 2225) > 0. 1 μM, but not its inactive enantiomer AAD- 2224, induced channel opening in an irreversible manner. Currents elicited by <b>monepantel</b> alone were larger than the maximal current amplitudes achieved with betaine or choline, making <b>monepantel</b> a superagonist. Currents elicited by betaine or choline were allosterically potentiated by nM concentrations of <b>monepantel</b> and to a much smaller degree by AAD- 2224. We have also reconstituted the Caenorhabditis elegans homomeric ACR- 20 receptor in Xenopus oocytes. The acr- 20 sequence has higher similarity to mptl- 1 than acr- 23, the primary target for <b>monepantel</b> mode of action in C. elegans. The ACR- 20 channel is gated similarly as MPTL- 1. <b>Monepantel,</b> but not AAD- 2224, was able to induce channel opening in an irreversible manner at similar concentrations as for MPTL- 1. Interestingly, the allosteric potentiation measured in the presence of betaine was much smaller than in MPTL- 1 receptors. Together, these results establish the mode of action of <b>monepantel</b> in H. contortus and contribute {{to our understanding of the}} mode of action of this anthelmintic...|$|E
40|$|<b>Monepantel</b> is {{a member}} of the {{recently}} identified class of anthelmintics known as the amino-acetonitrile derivatives (AADs). <b>Monepantel</b> controls all major gastro-intestinal nematodes in sheep including those that are resistant to the classical anthelmintics. Previous studies have shown that the Caenorhabditis elegans acr- 23 and the Haemonchus contortus Hco-mptl- 1 genes may be prominent targets of <b>monepantel.</b> With this discovery it became possible to investigate the mode of action of <b>monepantel</b> in nematodes at the molecular level. In the present study, we show that a C. elegans mutant acr- 23 strain is fully rescued by expressing the wild-type acr- 23 gene. Moreover, we present a new mutant allele, and characterize acr- 23 alleles genetically. We also show that acr- 23 is expressed in body wall muscle cells, and provide therefore a possible explanation for the paralysis caused by <b>monepantel.</b> Furthermore, genetic evidence suggests that the chaperone RIC- 3 is required for expression of full <b>monepantel</b> resistance. Finally, we present reconstitution of the C. elegans ACR- 23 receptor in Xenopus laevis oocytes and provide direct evidence of its modulation by <b>monepantel.</b> Conversely, co-injection of the chaperone RIC- 3 had no impact for channel reconstitution in X. laevis oocytes.

40|$|<b>Monepantel</b> is {{the first}} drug of a new family of anthelmintics, the amino {{acetonitrile}} derivatives (AAD), presently used to treat ruminants infected with gastrointestinal nematodes such as Haemonchus contortus. <b>Monepantel</b> shows an excellent tolerability in mammals and is active against multidrug-resistant parasites, indicating that its molecular target is (i) absent or inaccessible in the host and (ii) {{different from those of}} the classical anthelmintics. Genetic approaches with mutant nematodes have suggested acetylcholine receptors of the DEG- 3 subfamily as the targets of AADs, an enigmatic clade of ligand-gated ion channels that is specific to nematodes and does not occur in mammals. Here we demonstrate direct interaction of <b>monepantel,</b> its major active metabolite <b>monepantel</b> sulfone, and other AADs with potential targets of the DEG- 3 subfamily of acetylcholine receptors. Haemonchus contortus DEG- 3 /DES- 2 receptors were functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes and found to be preferentially activated by choline, to permeate monovalent cations, and to a smaller extent, calcium ions. While <b>monepantel</b> and <b>monepantel</b> sulfone did not activate the channels by themselves, they substantially enhanced the late currents after activation of the channels with choline, indicating that these AADs are type II positive allosteric modulators of H. contortus DEG- 3 /DES- 2 channels. Interestingly, the inactive, R enantiomer of <b>monepantel</b> inhibited the late currents after stimulation of H. contortus DEG- 3 /DES- 2 receptors with choline.

40|$|Anthelmintics {{have been}} used for the control of {{gastro-intestinal}} nematodes of sheep for more than 70 years with considerable development of anthelmintic resistant populations being an unfortunate consequence. The discovery of the amino-acetonitrile derivatives (AADs) brings a new hope to sheep farmers in the fight against resistance. Judicious and responsible use of this new class is warranted to slow the emergence of parasites resistant to it. The literature review discusses the research and development of the AADs from the perspectives of chemical optimisation, biological activity and safety, and the selection of the molecule, <b>monepantel</b> as the first development candidate. Comparisons are made with the older broad-spectrum anthelmintics. Pharmacokinetic and efficacy data from formulation optimisation and dose determination studies suggested that a solution formulation of <b>monepantel</b> provided a better option for development than a suspension formulation (of the composition tested) and a 2. 5 mg/kg dose was considered an appropriate minimum dose for the control of gastro-intestinal nematodes of sheep. Some of the nematode isolates used in these studies were known to be resistant to some of the older anthelmintics and therefore provided further evidence that <b>monepantel</b> would effectively control nematodes resistant to these older classes. A series of controlled efficacy studies was used to confirm the overall efficacy of <b>monepantel</b> administered at 2. 5 mg/kg against fourth larval and adult stages of nematodes infecting sheep in Australia and New Zealand. The efficacy of <b>monepantel</b> against fourth-stage larvae was > 95 % for most parasites. Efficacy against the adult nematodes was invariably high and in most cases > 99 %. <b>Monepantel</b> was tested in two extensive field efficacy and safety studies in Australia and New Zealand. Efficacy was determined by faecal nematode egg count reduction. <b>Monepantel</b> at the minimum dose of 2. 5 mg/kg was highly effective (generally > 97 %, often > 99 %) against mixedgenus natural infections of nematodes infecting the sheep, including populations resistant to {{one or more of the}} older broad-spectrum anthelmintics and combinations of these. There were no apparent treatment related adverse events in the approximately 600 sheep treated with <b>monepantel.</b> Factors that could potentially influence the efficacy of <b>monepantel</b> were examined. Shortterm fasting did not appear to affect the drug’s efficacy and while in a second study, the slight potential for an unfavourable effect on efficacy against several nematode species was identified as a consequence of rumen bypass following oral treatment, this should be countered if <b>monepantel</b> is administered at its recommended dose using a good drenching technique. An analysis of the influence of sheep breed and gender on the pharmacokinetics of <b>monepantel</b> and its primary metabolite, <b>monepantel</b> sulfone, and the influence of breed, age and gender on the efficacy of <b>monepantel</b> against adult and fourth-stage larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes was completed. While further investigation of the interaction of breed, age and gender on pharmacokinetics and efficacy is warranted, treating sheep at the recommended dose of 2. 5 mg/kg appears to mitigate any associated risk. This analysis highlighted the huge importance of correct dosing for any anthelmintic, which will also help to avoid the selection of drug-resistant parasites. Finally, a pooled analysis of efficacy encapsulating the studies discussed in the thesis is presented followed by a general discussion of potential strategies (largely developed using mathematical models) on how best to use <b>monepantel</b> in sustainable parasite control programs in Australia and New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|Background: Few {{effective}} {{drugs are}} available for soil-transmitted helminthiases and drug resistance is of concern. In the present work, we tested {{the efficacy of the}} veterinary drug <b>monepantel,</b> a potential drug development candidate compared to standard drugs in vitro and in parasite-rodent models of relevance to human soil-transmitted helminthiases. Methodology: A motility assay was used to assess the efficacy of <b>monepantel,</b> albendazole, levamisole, and pyrantel pamoate in vitro on third-stage larvae (L 3) and adult worms of Ancylostoma ceylanicum, Necator americanus and Trichuris muris. Ancylostoma ceylanicum- or N. americanus-infected hamsters, T. muris- or Ascaris suum-infected mice, and Strongyloides ratti-infected rats were treated with single oral doses of <b>monepantel</b> or with one of the reference drugs. Principal Findings: <b>Monepantel</b> showed excellent activity on A. ceylanicum adults (IC 50 = 1. 7 mg/ml), a moderate effect on T. muris L 3 (IC 50 = 78. 7 mg/ml), whereas no effect was observed on A. ceylanicum L 3, T. muris adults, and both stages of N. americanus. Of the standard drugs, levamisole showed the highest potency in vitro (IC 50 = 1. 6 and 33. 1 mg/ml on A. ceylanicum and T. muris L 3, respectively).

After decades without the discovery of new drug types, a new class of anthelmintics, called aminoacetonitrile derivatives, represented by <b>monepantel,</b> was released on the market. In order to evaluate a report of low efficacy of <b>monepantel</b> on a sheep farm in the municipality of Taiúva, state of São Paulo, Brazil, fecal egg count reduction and critical tests were performed on a Haemonchus contortus strain collected from this farm. To this end, ten animals were experimentally infected with 5000 H. contortus third-stage larvae, and these animals were divided into two groups, control and treated, according to the treatment with <b>monepantel.</b> The parameters evaluated were reduction in fecal egg counts on post-treatment days (PTD) 0, 2, 4, 7 and 14, and the therapeutic efficacy {{at the end of this}} period. Egg count reduction was observed starting on PTD 2, with a maximum reduction of 32. 89 % recorded on PTD 14. The critical test revealed 24. 65 % efficacy, indicating resistance to the active ingredient <b>monepantel.</b> The ineffectiveness of <b>monepantel</b> may be associated with the excessive use of the anthelmintic, which the farmer administered at intervals of less than one month, without technical guidance or a defined criterion. Given that the anthelmintic was used on this farm for less than one year, according to the farmer, it can be inferred that H. contortus develops resistance to <b>monepantel</b> in a few generations if the product is used incorrectly...|$|E
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{investigated the}} influence of breed and gender on the pharmacokinetics of <b>monepantel,</b> and influence of breed, age, and gender on its efficacy against gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep. In a comparison of pharmacokinetic profiles from two studies, Merino lambs had significantly greater maximum concentrations of <b>monepantel</b> and <b>monepantel</b> sulfone, and faster times to reach these concentrations than Dorset cross lambs. Males had a statistically greater area under the curve (0 - 504 h) than females for <b>monepantel</b> sulfone. The biological relevance of these relatively small differences is unclear because efficacy was not evaluated in these studies. For efficacy, a breed effect existed for some nematodes when sheep were treated at a sub-optimum dose (1. 25 mg/kg). There were no gender effects between sheep infected with adult parasites and treated at 1. 25 mg/kg but there were differences between females and males treated at this dose when infected with fourth-stage larvae of Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, and Cooperia curticei. There were no breed or gender differences for sheep treated at the recommended dose (2. 5 mg/kg). There was a potential trend for declining efficacy with increasing animal age for fourth-stage Trichostrongylus axei. This analysis demonstrated that, similarly to what is observed with other anthelmintics, the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of <b>monepantel</b> can vary with factors like breed, age, and gender. Identifying these covariates is important for understanding inter-individual variability in drug response. While further investigation is warranted, correctly treating sheep at the recommended dose of 2. 5 mg/kg appears to mitigate any associated risk...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>monepantel,</b> a developmental compound from the amino-acetonitrile derivative class of anthelmintics, against field infections of gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep. Procedures: Comparisons of efficacy (using standard faecal worm egg count reduction tests) and safety (on the basis of visual observations) were made in a large-scale field study in Australia, between groups of sheep treated with either an oral solution of <b>monepantel</b> or a registered anthelmintic. The sheep were naturally infected with the major gastrointestinal nematode genera present in Australia. Results: The post-treatment efficacy results for <b>monepantel</b> were: at 7 days (± 1 day) efficacy was > 98 %; at 14 days (± 1 day) it was generally close to or > 99 %; and at 21 days (± 1 day) efficacy was consistently > 99 %. A high proportion of the targeted nematode populations were confirmed as being resistant {{to one or more}} of the currently available anthelmintic classes. Conclusions: <b>Monepantel</b> when used under field conditions at a minimum dose rate of 2. 5 mg/kg was highly effective against mixed-genus natural field infections of the major gastrointestinal nematode genera including Haemonchus, Teladorsagia (Ostertagia), Trichostrongylus, Nematodirus, Chabertia and Oesophagostomum. This result included efficacy against some populations resistant to the currently available broad-spectrum anthelmintics. Few Cooperia spp. were present to allow confirmation of efficacy against this genus. On no occasion after treatment did any commercial anthelmintic-treated groups have significantly lower faecal egg counts than the monepantel-treated groups. <b>Monepantel</b> was safe for the target animals and human operators when used in a field situation.

Currently, the control of these two parasites relies heavily on the use of anthelmintics and grazing management.

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} risk of {{different}} treatment scenarios on selecting for anthelmintic resistance on Australian sheep farms. Design A computer simulation model predicted populations of Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Haemonchus contortus or Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta, {{and the frequency of}} anthelmintic resistance genes. Method Nematode populations and the progression of drug resistance for a variety of treatment options and management practices in sheep-rearing areas of Western Australia (WA), Victoria (VIC) and New South Wales (NSW) were simulated. A scoring system was devised to measure the success of each option in delaying resistance to each anthelmintic and in controlling nematode populations. Results The best option at all sites was combining the new anthelmintic (<b>monepantel)</b> with a triple mixture of benzimidazole, levamisole and abamectin (COM). The next best option was: in NSW, rotation at each treatment between <b>monepantel,</b> moxidectin and COM; in VIC, rotation at each treatment between <b>monepantel</b> and COM; and in WA, rotation at each treatment between <b>monepantel</b> (used in winter) and COM or moxidectin (used in summer-autumn). In WA, rapid selection for resistance occurred as a consequence of summer-autumn treatments; however, if a small percentage of adult stock were left untreated then this selection could be greatly reduced. Despite purposely assuming relatively high resistance to benzimidazole and levamisole, COM was still effective in controlling worms and delaying resistance.

New anthelmintics are urgently needed for both the control of infections with multi-resistant nematodes in areas where classical anthelmintics are no longer effective, and the prevention of the spread of resistance {{in areas where the}} problem is not as severe. Recently, two new active ingredients became commercially available for the treatment of nematode infections in sheep, <b>monepantel</b> (Zolvix®) and derquantel, the latter used only in a formulated combination with the macrocyclic lactone, abamectin (Startect®). In order to assess the potential of the new actives for the control and prevention of spread of anthelmintic resistance, two characterized multi-resistant field isolates from Australia were used in a GLP (good laboratory practice) conducted efficacy study in sheep. Eight infected sheep in each group were treated orally according to the product labels with 2. 5 mg/kg body weight <b>monepantel,</b> 0. 2 mg/kg abamectin, or with the combination of 2. 0 mg/kg derquantel and 0. 2 mg/kg abamectin.

40|$|To {{determine}} how far management practices on small ruminant dairy flocks in southern Italy {{have influenced the}} development of anthelmintic resistance (AR), faecal egg count (FEC) reduction tests were run on 54 sheep farms using the FLOTAC technique with a sensitivity of 2 eggs per gram of faeces. Tests were run on groups of sheep (12 - 20 animals per group) using six anthelmintics administered orally: levamisole on 8 farms, ivermectin (half and full dose) on 8 farms, moxidectin on 3 farms, <b>monepantel</b> on 8 farms, netobimin on 22 farms (pooled samples) and albendazole on 5 farms (pooled samples). Different formulae and statistics were used to calculate FEC reductions and confidence intervals based {{on the presence of}} a control group and/or the use of pooled samples. A very high average efficacy was obtained with all anthelmintics tested as follows: levamisole 99. 3 % (range across farms 98 - 100 %), ivermectin half dose 99. 5 % (98. 0 - 100 %), ivermectin full dose 99. 9 % (99. 3 - 100 %), moxidectin 100 % (99. 9 - 100 %), <b>monepantel</b> 99. 4 % (97 - 100 %), netobimin 99. 1 % (92 - 100 %) and albendazole 100 %.

In the present study, the effectiveness of this nematode control scheme was evaluated after 5 years by FECRT, larval development test (LDT), and a molecular test to assess the development of levamisole resistance in Haemonchus contortus. Animals were submitted to treatments with albendazole, levamisole, closantel, ivermectin, moxidectin, and <b>monepantel.</b> Eggs per gram of feces (EPG) counts and fecal cultures were performed, and anthelmintic efficacy was calculated by the RESO 4. 0 program. The helminths of the flock (GIN Embrapa 2014) were compared to susceptible (McMaster) and resistant (Embrapa 2010) H. contortus isolates in the LDT to estimate the LC 50 and LC 90 of levamisole and in a molecular test to evaluate the 63 -bp indel in the acr 8 gene associated with levamisole resistance. In the FECRT, parasites were susceptible to <b>monepantel</b> (99. 6 %) and closantel (98. 3 %), but resistant to moxidectin (93. 8 %), levamisole (70. 4 %), ivermectin (48. 1 %), and albendazole (0 %). In the coproculture on D 14, and the control group presented 80 % H. contortus and 20 % Trichostrongylus sp., while in the <b>monepantel</b> group L 1 were observed as well as Oesophagostomum sp. L 3. LDT and resistance factors provided good separation between susceptible and resistant parasites. The genotypic frequencies of the 63 -bp insertion in the acr 8 gene in H. contortus were 11. 9, 6. 7, and 0 % in GIN Embrapa 2014, Embrapa 2010, and McMaster isolates, respectively. After 5 years of exclusive use, the nematodes developed resistance to levamisole, detected by FECRT and by increase in LC 50 and LC 90 for levamisole in the LDT. The 63 -bp indel was not confirmed as a molecular marker of levamisole resistance in our isolates. The target selected treatment scheme was effective to control helminths in the sheep flock for 5 years, when levamisole?s inefficacy was perceived because of no change in the clinical situation of treated animals. Through this scheme, it was possible to promote reversion towards susceptibility or increase of efficacy for other chemical classes. Thus, this is a valid recommendation to control worms and to delay the development of resistance, preserving other anthelmintic classes for future use. 201...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{the prevalence of}} anthelmintic resistance in ovine gastrointestinal nematodes in southern Queensland. Design An observational parasitological study using the faecal egg count reduction test. Methods Sheep farms (n = 20) enrolled in this study met the twin criteria of using worm testing for drench decisions and having concerns about anthelmintic efficacy. On each farm, 105 sheep were randomly allocated to one of six treatment groups or an untreated control group. Faecal samples were collected on day 0 and days 10 – 14 for worm egg counts and larval differentiation. Single- and multi-combination anthelmintics, persistent and non-persistent, oral liquid or capsule, pour-on and injectable formulations were tested. <b>Monepantel</b> was not tested. Farmers also responded to a questionnaire on drenching practices. Results Haemonchus contortus was the predominant species. Efficacy < 95 % was recorded on 85 % of farms for one or more anthelmintics and on 10 % of farms for six anthelmintics. No resistance was identified on three farms. The 4 -way combination product was efficacious (n = 4 farms). Napthalophos resistance was detected on one farm only. Resistance to levamisole (42 % of farms), moxidectin injection (50 % of farms) and the closantel/abamectin combination (67 % of farms) was identified. Moxidectin oral was efficacious against Trichostrongylus colubriformis, which was predominant on only one farm. Of the farms tested, 55 % ran meat breeds, 60 % dosed more than the recommended dose rate and 70 % always, mostly or when possible practised a ‘drench and move’ strategy.

All seven metallocenyl derivatives prepared (4 a/b, 5 a/b, 6 a/b and 7) were isolated as racemates and characterized by (1) H, (13) C and (19) F NMR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy and elemental microanalysis. The molecular structures of four compounds (4 a/b, 6 a and 7) were further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The biological activities of the organometallic intermediates (4 a/b) and organometallic derivatives of <b>monepantel</b> (5 a/b, 6 a/b and 7) were evaluated in vitro using parasitic nematodes of major importance in livestock, namely Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Two ferrocenyl compounds (4 a and 6 a) showed nematocidal activity, while the analogous ruthenocenyl compounds (4 b and 6 b) were not active at the highest concentration tested (10 μg mL(- 1)). In order to obtain insight into the difference in activity between ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl derivatives, {{the potential of the}} compounds for reactive oxidative species (ROS) production in live cells was assessed. Interestingly, neither the ferrocenyl nor the ruthenocenyl compounds (4 a/b and 6 a/b) produced significant ROS in HeLa cells when checked after 22 h, potentially indicating a redox-independent activity of 4 a and 6 a on the parasites. The selectivity of the compounds on parasites was confirmed by investigating their cytotoxicity profiles. None of these compounds was toxic either to HeLa or MRC- 5 cells. Thus, 4 a and 6 a could be considered as interesting leads for further development of new classes of anti-parasitic agents...|$|E

40|$|<b>Monepantel</b> (MPL) {{is a novel}} {{anthelmintic}} drug from a {{new class}} of synthetic chemicals known as Amino-Acetonitrile Derivatives (AADs). As a nematicide, it acts through a nematode-specific nicotinic receptor subtype, which explains its exceptional safety in rodents and mammals. In the present study, we evaluated its potential as an anticancer agent. In vitro treatment of ovarian cancer cells with MPL resulted in reduced cell viability, inhibition of cell proliferation and suppression of colony formation. Proliferation of human ovarian surface epithelial cells and other non-malignant cells were minimally affected. MPL-induced inhibition was found to be independent of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor (nAChR) indicating that, its target in cancer cells is probably different from that in nematodes. Analysis of MPL treated cells revealed G 1 phase cell cycle arrest with reduced levels of cyclins D 1 and A and their related cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) 2 and 4 whereas cyclin E 2 expression was enhanced. Consistently, expression of CDK inhibitor p 27 kip 1 and p 53 were increased. Moreover, MPL suppressed cellular thymidine incorporation thus impairing DNA synthesis and inducing cleavage of PARP- 1. To investigate the mechanism of MPL cytotoxic effect on ovarian cancer cells a panel of tests used for the detection of apoptosis and au¬tophagy. MPL did not activate caspases 3 or 8, and it failed to cause DNA laddering. Furthermore, the inability of z-VAD-fmk to block the MPL antiproliferative effects led to the ruling out of apoptosis as the mechanism behind MPL-induced cell death. On the other hand, accumulation of acidic vacuoles with distinct chromatin morphology and an increase in LC 3 B-II along with changes in the expression of SQSTM 1 /p 62 were all indicative of MPL-induced autophagy. Consistent with this, our findings provide the first evidence to show that MPL triggers autophagy through the deactivation of mTOR/p 70 S 6 K signalling pathway. A significant finding of this study was that MPL reduced growth of human ovarian tumor xenografts in immune-compromised mice, consistent with same mechanism, while it was well tolerated and determined to be nontoxic to vital organs compared to control.

40|$|The filarial parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, infects {{dogs and}} canids in warm and {{tropical}} {{areas of the}} globe. Located in the right pulmonary arteries, the heartworm infection is a severe and potentially fatal disease; caused mainly by the adult worm stages. The zoonotic roundworm is transmitted by various mosquitoes, Culicidae. Currently, control measures are based on monthly prophylaxis with macrocyclic lactones (MLs). The only adulticide treatment is melarsomine dihydrochloride injected intramuscularly which can cause complications. Resistance is emerging against the MLs, increasing the necessity to find novel anthelmintics. The recently discovered class of anthelmintics, amino acetonitriles derivatives (AADs), with a new mode of action brought hope {{in the battle against}} helminth parasites. The aim of this thesis was to find candidate targets of AADs and other potential anthelmintics in D. immitis genome that could be used as therapeutic targets. The first chapter discusses the possible mechanisms of antiparasitic drug action and selectivity. The second chapter tests and confirms the efficacy of AADs against D. immitis in vitro. This suggests the presence of receptor(s) to AADs in the heartworm, a hypothesis which can be tested by genome sequencing. The third chapter narrates the story of the genome project of the heartworm; de novo sequenced with Illumina HiSeq and assembled with Abyss and Velvet. This did not indicate that there is an AAD receptor (DEG- 3 -subfamily), to Caenorhabditis elegans and Haemonchus contortus in D. immitis genome. In fact, D. immitis does not appear to possess a single gene of the DEG- 3 subfamily of acetylcholine receptors, the targets of <b>monepantel.</b> However, in-depth studies of the genome through exclusion criteria established a list of novel potential drug targets. The fourth chapter further investigates the presumed loss of the DEG- 3 -subfamily in D. immitis and relates this finding to the sensitivity against both <b>monepantel</b> enantiomers in vitro and in vivo. The fifth chapter picks up some of the newly identified candidate drug targets. It tests the predicted targets against the heartworm with known inhibitors. This thesis presents a genomic approach to identify potential targets and new anthelmintics.

Acetylation of this monoterpene has been proposed as a potential way to reduce the toxicity and enhance the pharmacological effects of carvacrol. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of carvacryl acetate (CA) using in vitro and in vivo assays with gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants. The egg hatching test (EHT), larval development test (LDT) and adult worm motility (AWM) assessment were conducted to evaluate the effect of the acetylated product and pure carvacrol on Haemonchus contortus eggs, larvae and adults. The structural changes induced in adult H. contortus were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). CA and carvacrol acute toxicity was evaluated in mice. Finally, the efficacy of 250 mg/kg CA and 2. 5 mg/kg <b>monepantel</b> (positive control) were evaluated in 30 sheep naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes by the fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). In vitro tests were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by comparison with Tukey’s test. The efficacy was calculated by the Boot Street program using the arithmetic average. The number of eggs in feces (epg) of the groups were transformed to log (x+ 1) and subjected to ANOVA to compare differences among the groups by Tukey’s test. The level of significance was P< 0. 05. CA and carvacrol inhibited larval hatching by 89. 3 and 97. 7 % at doses of 8. 0 and 1. 0 mg/ml, respectively. At the concentration of 2 mg/ml, CA and carvacrol inhibited 100 % of larval development. At a concentration of 200 μg/ml, CA and carvacrol inhibited the motility of adult worms by 100 % and 58. 3 % at 24 h post-exposure, respectively. CA caused cuticle and vulvar flap wrinkling and bubbles to emerge from the tegument. Carvacrol caused more discreet effects on the cuticle and vulvar flap.

The most common species affecting humans are Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus Ancylostoma duodenale, Trichuris trichiura and Strongyloides stercoralis. More than 1 billion people are infected globally. Most at risk are the 3 billion poorest {{people of the}} world, particularly children. Heavy infections cause iron-deficiency anemia to growth stunting and intellectual retardation. STHs occur often concomitantly with other infections such as malaria. Currently, STHs morbidity control relies on only five drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin). These present limited efficacies, especially when administered in single dose against T. trichiura and hookworm infections. Although anthelmintic drug resistance has not yet appeared as a major public health problem, emergence of drug resistance may be inevitable. The situation is precarious and new drugs are urgently needed. In addition, existing tools for in vitro drug sensitivity testing {{are based on a}} viability assessment assay which lacks convenience and hinders high-throughput screening rates. Also, the lack of accurate diagnostic tools to detect STHs and malaria infections hampers an optimal management of these diseases. This work aimed first to set up nematode-rodent models at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH), improve drug screening assays and evaluate potential new treatments for human STHs. Prior to this thesis, <b>monepantel</b> (AAD 1566), tribendimidine, nitazoxanide and oxantel pamoate had been identified as potential drug candidates for STHs. Secondly, we aimed to strengthen our understanding of the impact of a murine malaria and hookworm co-infection on the host’s metabolism and explore the potential of metabolic profiling as multiplexing diagnostic tool. Once the animal models corresponding to human helminthiases have been established, (Ancylostoma ceylanicum, N. americanus and Trichuris muris), the Alamar Blue, the MTT and the acid phosphatase assays, as well as the xCELLigence System, isothermal microcalorimetry, and the feeding-inhibition assay (A. ceylanicum only) were tested and compared to the current assay of choice, the motility assay. For T. muris, the Alamar Blue assay compared most favorably to the motility assay since it is precise and cost-effective. For A. ceylanicum, no alternative assay was found better than the motility assay for testing on L 3, whereas the xCELLigence System was found accurate and convenient for adult worms.
