6000|$|There {{had ever}} been a mystery {{about the life of}} the Onondago. If any one of our set {{had ever been}} acquainted with the facts, it was Andries Coejemans, a half-uncle of <b>my</b> dear <b>grandmother,</b> a person who has been known among us by the sobriquet of the Chainbearer. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that [...] "uncle Chainbearer," [...] as we all called the old relative, did know about Susquesus, in his time--the reason why he had left his tribe, and become a hunter, and warrior, and runner among the pale-faces--and that he had always said the {{particulars}} did his red friend great credit, but that he would reveal it no further. So great, however, was uncle Chainbearer's reputation for integrity, that such an opinion was sufficient to procure for the Onondago the fullest confidence of the whole connection, and the experience of fourscore years and ten had proved that this confidence was well placed. Some imputed the sort of exile in which the old man had so long lived to love, others to war, and others, again, to the consequences of those fierce personal feuds that are known to occur among men in the savage state. But all was just as much a mystery and matter of conjecture, now we were drawing near {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, as it had been when our forefathers were receding from the middle of the eighteenth!

40|$|It was a June {{evening in}} Bhubaneswar in 1993. My {{children}} {{asked me to}} tell them a story, so I started narrating the well-known story “The Old Tiger and the Golden Bangle ” about how an old tiger could not catch prey, so he cleverly promised to give golden bangles to anyone who would take {{a dip in the}} nearby pond. None but the greedy Brahmin believed it, and when he was taking a dip, the tiger ate him. No sooner was the story completed than <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> “Don’t you know, my boy, that if the Brahmin had made the tiger to take a vow before entering the pond, it would not have eaten him up. ” I was a bit puzzled to hear this misrepresentation of a well-structured Sanskrit tale. Why should the Brahmin have taken a vow from the tiger? My grandmother explained that tigers like any other creatures follow the truth. To this point, she in turn related the story of “Baula the Cow”...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The lure {{of gold in}} {{the great}} reefs of Johannesburg {{near the end of}} the 19 th century not only {{attracted}} the famous mining barons such as Cecil John Rhodes, Alfred Beit and Barney Barnato: working men also came from far and wide to feed their families with their labour. Among them was my great-grandfather, the miner from the Isle of Man, William Cogeen. He arrived via the tin mines of Cornwall and the silver mines of Colorado, and was among those Uitlanders who flocked in those early days to the Transvaal as skilled artisans - wheelwrights, farriers, bricklayers and, especially, experienced hard-rock miners. It was their labour, as well as of black tribesmen from all over southern Africa, that laid the financial foundation for what became the rich city of Johannesburg. It was also their influx that was the excuse that precipitated the Anglo-Boer War. His wife and daughters joined him in what was still a rough boom town, and they stayed on, until forced to flee as refugees from Johannesburg at the start of the war in 1899. Intrigued by the stories <b>my</b> mother and <b>grandmother</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> as a child, I began to research my family’s history and travelled to the Isle of Man, Cornwall and Colorado to trace their origins - and my own. This is the remarkable story of what happened to an ordinary working-class family who lived in extraordinary times, and my journey in their footsteps...|$|R
40|$|When I {{was young}} I {{was obsessed with}} {{collecting}} photos my family had because I knew that the moment wouldn’t last forever, if we didn’t have those photos we would be left with nothing to hold onto. After time has passed, I look back at these photographs and notice nothing is always how I remember it, yet I do not wish the images to be anything else. It is this change am confronting. It is the distortion of both the image and memory that I am confronting. I {{have always been a}} bit of a control freak. I want to maintain my family. I want to keep us together. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she wondered {{what would happen to the}} family after she and Joe Joe passed; I wonder/ed that too. They were the glue that held us together. How would we still be connected? I took this on as a personal responsibility, to maintain our connection, which why I have saves materials and images of us, in order to preserve our memories. There is no clear way to preserve the past, and because of this a layer of separation forms when the memories are no longer the same. Documentation photography tries to control how you view something. It makes an effort to show the truth of a moment/memory, but in its efforts to do so, it too, is confronted with change. Time doesn’t wait for any of us; it always changes the way you look at something, or the way it looks. Because time distorts both the physical image and the imagery within our mind this layer of separation forms again, between reality and the imagery, and thus creates a feeling of dissociation. This is what I am interested in, the layer of separation one feels from a memory after time takes its course. I show this by rephotographing photographs to amplify the reprocessing that occurs in our minds, and that also occurs in the distortion of an image. In my sculpture I also show this reproduction of memory by repurposing both personal and universal symbols/materials like: dryer lint, birthday cakes, fabric, headstones, flowers, etc. I have a connection to all of the materials I use, but they are such familiar objects that people can connect with them as well. With these symbols/materials I create artificial monuments that stand in for the image home. By making these artificial stand ins for the home I’m eluding back to the separation that forms around a memory over time. How I create this artificial look is by distorting the functionality of the symbols/materials used in the sculpture. I also use video or sound to help amplify the distortion of the piece. An artist who I’ve been looking at recently is Jennifer Loeber, specifically her project “Left Behind” which she paired old photographs of her mom, who recently passed, with photographs of items of hers she kept. There is the presence of time as the two photographs differ in look. The way she uses saved materials and photographs to talk about a loss of a loved one is what started me to think about the connection between the two...|$|R

We breakfasted at nine and dined at four and it was considered self-indulgent to eat anything between meals; and once an aunt <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I had reined in my pony and struck it at the same moment that I might show it off as I rode through the town, and I, because I had been accused of what I thought a very dark crime, had a night of misery.

I have grown happier with every year of life as though gradually conquering something in myself, for certainly my miseries were not made by others but were a part of my own mind.|$|R
40|$|The {{interviewee}} is my mother, Mrs. Li. My {{mother was}} born in Hong Kong in 1952. She is now 47 years old. Her early childhood was in a mainland city - Chaochow, located in the southeast coastal area of mainland China. She came back to Hong Kong when she was around 8. She can 2 ̆ 7 t recall clearly about the exact period being in Chaochow. As my mother <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> the world economy was in recession in 50 s to 60 s and the situation in Hong Kong was also poor. My grandparents had a big financial difficulty for living in Hong Kong. Then <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> brought <b>my</b> mother back to my grandfather 2 ̆ 7 s mother town - Chaochow - to count on my grandfather 2 ̆ 7 s family. My grandfather {{got a job as}} a mariner. So he didn 2 ̆ 7 t come back to his mother town with his wife and his daughter and he only came back to Hong Kong once or twice a year. In the 7 -year Chaochow life, my mother only lived with her mother and her sister whom {{was born in}} Chaochow and she is 1. 5 year younger than my mother. She was not that happy in her childhood owing to lack of parental care. In Chaochow, under the old Chinese family, <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> brought up with my mother and my aunt as only 3 ladies in the room. My grandfather has 4 brothers, and so, 5 families and my grandfather 2 ̆ 7 s mother were living together in a big traditional Chinese-style house. My grandfather 2 ̆ 7 s brothers also lived in such big family. However, owing to my grandfather 2 ̆ 7 s job, he could not stay with my mother and hwas only twich a year to see them only. Lacking father 2 ̆ 7 s protection, <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> and her 2 daughters were looked down by the other families. My mother was always being alonw with her sister and her cousins got used to leave her alone. As my mother <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> moreover, <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> didn 2 ̆ 7 t treat her fairly. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> thought <b>my</b> mother brought bad luck to the family as my grandparents lost their job and could not find any way to support the living after my mother was born. Even my mother reached to the age of having education in Chaochow, <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> did not give her chance to have regular education. But <b>my</b> great <b>grandmother</b> requested to <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> that all her grandchildren, including my mother, had to receive education in their childhood. So my mother had had 2 -year education in Chaochow. She was back to Hong Kong when she was 9. According to my mother 2 ̆ 7 s memory, her life in Chaochow was not very clear, but basically, she can 2 ̆ 7 t say that is a very happy memory. My aunt isn 2 ̆ 7 t born in Hong Kong, so she has no certificate of birht. That is the main reason why they had to stay in Chaochow for long because my aunt needed to get the permission for getting into Hong Kong which was registered by the Chinese Government. My mother came back to Hong Kong when she was around 8. 3 of them rented a room in Shamshuipo and my grandfather was still working overseas as a mariner. The room which they were living was divided from a big apartment. 8 independent rooms were divided for 8 families. So there was very crowded. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> went out to work from early morning to deep night. So, there was only my mother and my aunt in the room only. They went to school themselves, made meal themselves, and took care of themselves. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> only left some money for the sisters 2 ̆ 7 daily use. My mother lacked parental care in her childhood. She only played with the neighbor kids. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> doesn 2 ̆ 7 t like my mother since she was born. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> wanted <b>my</b> mother want out to get a job rather than continuing the studies. So <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> always kept the school fees till to the deadline. What my mother only could do was begging and entreating day by day. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> though women should not have any education as they would be married one day. Education was a kind of waste in her mind. My mother kept begging <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> for the school fees from primary 1 to secondary 5 but she could get the fees finally. My mother studeid in a secondary school which was run by left wing people, i. e. the supporters of the Chinese Communist party. During the 5 -year education, the students were imbuned with the idea of communism. Mostly, they needed to have a discussion about the Chinese political issues or hold the activities to back up the pro-China political parties. Teaching English was regarded as a kind of colonialism in these schools. But under the regulation of Education Department, teaching English was a must. So the school authority decided using the English version of Mao 2 ̆ 7 s ideolog, the little red book, as the English teaching material. After graduation, my mother found that the political teaching was not appropriate. All of those activities only slowed down the study process and she would rather not let her children to enter such school for studies...|$|R
