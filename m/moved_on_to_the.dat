They played in Philadelphia and Chicago, where word arrived of an opportunity to take over Poole's, Heine having <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Thalia. Adler returned to New York, where he managed also to win Mogulesko and Kessler away from Heine.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} of the mission departed, Peierls, Kurti and Fuchs {{remained}} in New York, where they worked with Kellex. They were joined there by Tony Skyrme and Frank Kearton, who arrived in March 1944. Kurti returned to England in April 1944 and Kearton in September. Peierls <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Los Alamos Laboratory in February 1944; Skyrme followed in July, and Fuchs in August.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Northrop Grumman {{proposed}} a YF-23-based bomber {{to meet a}} USAF need for an interim bomber, for which the FB-22 and B-1R were also competing. Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 {{to serve as a}} display model for its proposed interim bomber. The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Next-Generation Bomber program.|$|E

5|$|The {{writers of}} Saturday Night Live clashed with Henson's {{vision for the}} program. Michael O'Donoghue, Alan Zweibel, and Al Franken often tried to avoid writing the weekly sketches. Henson felt {{they were trying to}} write for {{situational}} comedy rather than staying within his intended story. Frank Oz eventually agreed the partnership between Henson's team and the show's writers was imperfect, and was thankful they <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Muppet Show.|$|E

5|$|After basic {{education}} in Greek with a tutor known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in Romanian Cyrillic (reportedly {{by studying the}} Alexander Romance {{with the help of}} his father's Oltenian servants). He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in Gârbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by Caragea's plague). After 1813, the teenaged Rădulescu was a pupil of the Orthodox monk Naum Râmniceanu; in 1815, he <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greek school at Schitu Măgureanu, in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the Saint Sava School, where he studied under Gheorghe Lazăr's supervision.|$|E

5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hanford site. It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it {{was turned over to}} research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was kept}} under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost {{thirteen}} years old. Private tutors taught him German and French. Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, {{which he did not}} enjoy, Edward <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.|$|E
5|$|Fifty minutes later, {{the lead}} {{elements}} of the 2/48th Battalion entered the main mission complex, which {{was found to be}} quite badly damaged. Finally, at 10:00am, upon the insistence of the 2/48th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ainslie, Derrick was given the honour of raising the Australian flag over the mission, signifying that the battle had come to an end. Shortly after this, the tanks finally reached the 2/24th Battalion, and the 2,200 feature was also captured. Upon completion of the flag-raising ceremony, a company from the 2/48th <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 3,200 feature, which had also been abandoned, while further to the west, the 2/23rd, along with the 2/4th Commando Squadron cleared Mararuo and in the process found evidence that the Japanese had withdrawn towards Wareo.|$|E

In the Dayton Regional, seventh-seeded Mississippi upset second-seeded Maryland, and followed that with an upset of third-seeded Oklahoma, but in the regional final faced top-seeded Tennessee, who went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> beat Mississippi by 36 points, and <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Final Four.|$|R
5|$|Finucane <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, {{but with}} low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; {{and in the}} written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E

Federer then <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, and John Isner in the final. Federer won the title for a record fourth time, and, in doing so, equalled Rafael Nadal's record of 19 ATP Masters 1000 titles.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E

5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E

The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E
