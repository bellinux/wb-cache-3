5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand.</b> In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> was significantly more effective.|$|E
5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to each leg.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Hitachi {{company had}} a {{conflict}} with Appliance Corporation of America, the American distributor of its products including the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand.</b> The device ceased being sold briefly in the United States. In June 2000, Hitachi reached {{a deal with the}} sex toy distributor company Vibratex located in California to sell the device in the U.S. Vibratex has continued to sell the device in the U.S. through 2014. Urologist and specialist in sexual dysfunction Jed Kaminetsky told The New York Observer in 2000 that the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> had a renowned reputation. He stated he recommended the device to female patients with difficulty achieving orgasm to use in masturbation. Kaminetsky observed that the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> provided an extremely successful manner in which to masturbate and was among the preeminent vibrators available.|$|E
5|$|Many {{academics}} {{have discussed}} {{use of the}} <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder. A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Paula Kamen, {{author of}} Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution, placed the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> as an influential factor in the sexual revolution which took place {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E
5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the vibrator and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had {{found it to be}} an assured way to reach orgasm. McKinnis {{recommended the}} <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded vibrators in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand.</b> A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping tried the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> for relief of lumbar discomfort and were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> in sexual activity for people with disabilities. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson.

5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand,</b> which they bought through Vibratex. They set the <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief.

Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a <b>Magic</b> <b>Wand</b> to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E
