30|$|Brindley (1984) was {{the first}} one to report that intracavernosal {{injection}} of <b>metaraminol</b> causes shrinkage of the penis. He described that the alpha-adrenergic receptor existed in the cavernous smooth muscle and penile arteries. Intracorporeal instillation of <b>metaraminol,</b> which is an alpha-adrenergic agent, contracts penile arteries and the arterial flow in the corpus cavernosum decrease, and thus effective to priapism. This method was then widely practiced in impotent patients who develop priapism as a complication of pharmacologically induced penile erection (Brindley 1986). Then, Tsai and Hong found that intracavernosal injection of 10 – 25  pg <b>metaraminol</b> is a simple, effective and safe method for immediate relief of intraoperative penile erection. It can be used in patients with either regional block or general anaesthesia (Tsai and Hong 1990). Koga et al.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of the}} use of the <b>metaraminol</b> bitartarate to blockade the decrease of the blood pressure produced by levomepromazine HCL in dogs. To this 20 crossbreed adult dogs, males and females, with average weight from 8 to 12 kg, were separated in two groups with 10 dogs each (GI and G 1 I). To the GI was administered, intravenously, 2 mg/kg of levomepromazine. Fifteen minutes after was administered, by the same way, 0. 5 ml of saline solution (0. 9 %). The systolic blood pressure (PA), heart rate (FC), respiratory frequency (FR), body temperature (T) and eletrocardiographic analysis (Dll) was evaluated before and after the administration of the levomepromazine at 15 minutes of intervals, during 60 minutes.

Three patients received intravenous isosorbide dinitrate and two received streptokinase as the initial therapy. The mean ST segment elevation was significantly reduced (from 4. 94 ± 1 to 0. 5 ± 0. 7 [p < 0. 0001]) after <b>metaraminol</b> infusion was initiated. The average T wave height also decreased (from 6. 8 ± 2 to − 1. 3 ± 2. 5 mm [p < 0. 0005]).

40|$|Because of an {{increasing}} incidence of poisoning with the newer organophosphorus anticholinesterase insecticides, these compounds have been reviewed {{in terms of}} their history and pharmacology, relationship with other drugs, factors affecting toxicity, mechanism of action, toxic signs and treatment. The modern organophosphorus pesticide requires metabolic conversion before toxicity develops. Insects have a greater propensity for this conversion than humans. Nevertheless, this conversion does occur in humans and can be potentiated by other drugs. Toxicity also varies with age, sex, route and frequency of administration, and previous exposure. The mechanism of toxicity is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, causing an intoxicating build-up of acetylcholine. Signs and symptoms consist of the clinical manifestations of unopposed parasympathetic and central activity. Treatment must be initiated early. Respiration must be maintained and the effects of acetylcholine must be counteracted by massive doses of atropine. <b>Metaraminol</b> enhances the antagonistic action of atropine against acetylcholine and may also be given.
