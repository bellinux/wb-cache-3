50|$|When {{filtration}} occurs {{the local}} concentration of rejected material at the membrane surface increases and can become saturated. In UF, increased ion concentration can develop an osmotic {{pressure on the}} feed side of the membrane. This reduces the effective TMP of the system, therefore reducing permeation rate. The increase in concentrated layer at the <b>membrane</b> <b>wall</b> decreases the permeate flux, due to increase in resistance which reduces the driving force for solvent to transport through membrane surface. CP affects almost all the available membrane separation process. In RO, the solutes retained at the membrane layer results in higher osmotic pressure {{in comparison to the}} bulk stream concentration. So the higher pressures are required to overcome this osmotic pressure. Concentration polarisation plays a dominant role in ultrafiltration as compared to microfiltration because of the small pore size membrane. It must be noted that concentration polarization differs from fouling as it has no lasting effects on the membrane itself and can be reversed by relieving the TMP. It does however {{have a significant effect on}} many types of fouling.|$|E
50|$|Generation of {{interstitial}} fluid is {{regulated by the}} forces of the Starling equation. Hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels tends to cause water to filter out into the tissue. This leads to a difference in protein concentration between blood plasma and tissue. As a result, the colloidal or oncotic pressure of the higher level of protein in the plasma tends to draw water back into the blood vessels from the tissue. Starling's equation states that the rate of leakage of fluid is determined by {{the difference between the two}} forces and also by the permeability of the vessel wall to water, which determines the rate of flow for a given force imbalance. Most water leakage occurs in capillaries or post capillary venules, which have a semi-permeable <b>membrane</b> <b>wall</b> that allows water to pass more freely than protein. (The protein is said to be reflected and the efficiency of reflection is given by a reflection constant of up to 1.) If the gaps between the cells of the vessel wall open up then permeability to water is increased first, but as the gaps increase in size permeability to protein also increases with a fall in reflection coefficient.|$|E

Motivated by these applications, a radially averaged model for fluid and solute transport in a tube with thin porous walls is derived by developing the classical ideas of Taylor dispersion. The model includes solute diffusion and advection via both radial and axial flow components, and the advection, diffusion, and uptake coefficients in the averaged equation are explicitly derived. The effect of wall permeability, slip, and pressure differentials upon the dispersive solute behaviour are investigated.

40|$|A dynamic {{gasifier}} model including slag flow behavior simulation {{was established}} to simulate {{a new type of}} oxygen-staged gasifier recently developed in China. A reactor network model (RNM) is used to simulate the internal gas-solid reaction zone of the gasifier, in which the reactor is divided into several zones based on the understanding of the flow characteristics in the gasifier, with each zone represented by either a plug-flow reactor or a well-stirred reactor. This space division concept can provide a more reasonable temperature distribution prediction than one-dimensional models, without costing too much computational expense. In addition, a widely accepted slag layer model is used to simulate the time-varying slag accumulation and flow on the wall and the heat transfer process through the wall. Using the developed model, two kinds of oxygen-staged gasifiers were simulated: the refractory wall gasifier and the <b>membrane</b> <b>wall</b> gasifier. The RNM predictions were compared with industrial data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model results, and good agreement has been observed. The temperature distribution simulation results also showed that staged oxygen feeding can reduce the temperature near the main burner significantly, therefore extending the lifetime of the burner compared with that of without staged oxygen feed. Dynamic simulation results suggest that the dynamic response of the refractory wall gasifier is much slower than that of the <b>membrane</b> <b>wall</b> gasifier. In the <b>membrane</b> <b>wall</b> gasifier, the dynamic response of the syngas temperature and composition is rather fast compared to that of the wall temperature.

The presence of G. homari walls during this process affected {{the synthesis of}} both SDS-soluble (nascent) and SDS-insoluble PG. At two cycles the synthesis of SDS-soluble PG decreased by 70 %, whereas that of SDS-insoluble PG increased sevenfold when compared with membranes reactivated {{in the absence of}} walls but assayed in the presence of walls. Moreover, at six cycles the lag time for the synthesis of SDS-insoluble PG decreased from 15 min to 5 to 7 min. Walls from G. homari could not be replaced with walls from Bacillus megaterium or cellulose. In addition to these effects, the presence of walls from G. homari or B. megaterium or of cellulose during the incubation of membranes freeze-thawed in the absence of walls increased twofold the amount of SDS-insoluble PG.

The equipment is located at Chalmers University of Technology in Goteborg. A method for measuring the local suspension temperature with a shielded thermocouple in the combustion chamber of a fluidized bed combustor is described. Two major sets of heat transfer experiments were conducted. The first concerned temperature measure me nts close to the wall. In these experiments, temperature distributions were measured at different heights above the distributor plate for different operating conditions. It was found that the thermal boundary layer thickness decreases with increasing su pe rficial gas velocity, but is less affected by the bulk bed temperature. The aim of the second set of experiments was to measure the local time-averaged heat transfer coefficients at the <b>membrane</b> <b>wall</b> of the combustor.

40|$|Microstructured membrane-assisted {{fluidized}} bed reactors {{have been proposed}} for hydrogen production as an efficient solution to strongly reduce bed-to-membrane mass transfer limitations (concentration polarization) adversely affecting other types of membrane reactors while maximizing the volumetric production capacity. In a previous work it has been demonstrated that a microstructured membrane-assisted {{fluidized bed}} can be successfully operated with state-of-the-art membranes in the turbulent fluidization regime with significantly reduced formation of densified zones. The effect of the particle size and the reactor size on the hydrodynamics of these novel reactors is not well understood. In this paper, the fluidization behavior of beds with different reactor sizes employing different particle sizes has been investigated using particle image velocimetry coupled with an advanced digital image analysis. It {{has been found that}} a bed with small width can be operated in the turbulent regime already at relatively low fluidization velocities. Also for reactors with a small bed width the extraction of gas via membranes results in the formation of densified zones close to the <b>membrane</b> <b>walls,</b> while the addition of gas results in an inversion of the solids circulation pattern. However, compared with bigger reactors, the influence of gas permeation via the membranes on the solids circulation patterns as well as bubble size and its distribution is much less pronounced in reactors with a smaller bed width.
