40|$|The Neotropical genus Borojoa Cuatrec. (Rubiaceae) is now {{considered}} a synonym of Alibertia A. Rich. ex DC. Consequently, three species named in Borojoa and found in Costa Rica and Panama are transferred to Alibertia with these corresponding nomenclatural changes: the new combination A. atlantica (Dwyer) Delprete & C. H. Perss. is based on B. atlantica Dwyer, the new name A. dwyeri Delprete & C. H. Perss. is provided for B. panamensis Dwyer, and the new combination A. patinoi (Cuatrec.) Delprete & C. H. Perss. is provided for B. patinoi Cuatrec. Additionally, the species A. premontana C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> is reduced {{to a variety of}} A. (quits (Rich.) A. Rich. ex DC., as A. edulis var. premontana (C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor)</b> Delprete & C. H. Perss. A lectotype is selected for A. edulis. The recent publication of Arachnothryx chimalaparam Lorence ex Borhidi designated a holotype deposited at MO, but no such specimen has been located; a lectotype is here chosen based on a duplicate of the holotype deposited at MEXU. The new species Notopleura recondita Hammel & C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> of the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica can be distinguished from polyphlebia (Donn. Sm.) C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> by its leaf blades with the secondary veins plane on the adaxial surface and its short cymose or paniculiform inflorescences. The new species Palicourea matamana C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> of premontane forests of central-eastern Costa Rica can be separated from P. orosiana C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> by its larger stipules, longer calyx lobes, and hirsute pubescence. The new species P. providenciana J. Sanchez-Gonz. & C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> of montane forests in south-central Costa Rica can be separated from P. hammelii C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> by its longer lanceolate stipule lobes, dark purple or yellow-flushed inflorescences, and shorter calyx lobes. The Panamanian plants treated previously as Psychotria acuminata subsp. boraginoides Dwyer are here considered to differ at the species level from P. acuminata Benth., and accordingly the new combination P. boraginoides (Dwyer) C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> is here published for this species. Clarification of the identity of Cephaelis croatii Dwyer shows that it is a distinct species of Psychotria, and the new combination P. croatii (Dwyer) C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> is published here for this species. The new species P. herrerana C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> of central Costa Rica can be recognized by its combination of large, sessile, elliptic leaves, its large paniculiform inflorescences, and its relatively small corollas. Study of the Costa Rican plants previously called Rudgea thyrsiflora Donn. Sm. shows that these do not have the characters of Rudgea, but are similar to Psychotria racemosa Rich, and better included in this latter genus; the new name P. tsakiana C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> is here published for this species. The new combination Simira panamensis (Dwyer) C. <b>M.</b> <b>Taylor</b> is published here based on the name Bathysa panamensis Dwyer, which has priority over the name S. darienensis Dwyer; both of the names Dwyer published are based on the same type specimen, thus the later name S. darienensis is illegitimate...|$|R

50|$|The {{school was}} started in 2002 as a half day {{specialty}} school called Jefferson Parish School for Science and Technology (JPSST). Students attending {{public schools in the}} parish would enroll in JPSST - they would attend their home-based school half a day and JPSST half a day - they were transported between their home-based school and JPSST by bus daily to attend either the morning or afternoon session (morning transportation there or afternoon transportation home were arranged or provided by students' parents). Starting off with only two grades (7th and 8th), the school soon became a full day magnet school by the 2005 - 2006 school year and was renamed Patrick F. Taylor Science and Technology Academy (PFTSTA), after Patrick F. Taylor, an oil business tycoon famous for creating the TOPS program (which helps pays college tuition for students who attain a minimum GPA and ACT score). Patrick Taylor's widow, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Taylor,</b> continues to play a close {{role in the development of}} the school. At the time, the school included 6th - 9th grade and was located in the Jefferson Parish Public School System special services building, occupying the entire second floor of the building. On August 29, 2005, only a few weeks into the school year, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, causing evacuations and New Orleans school closures. Students were able to keep in touch with their teachers and one another via internet using the discussion forums set up on the school's eBoard. The rest of the 2005 - 2006 school year continued with a smaller amount of students, but still successfully.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} three schools with Multi-Age Cluster Classes in Vancouver, British Columbia {{administered}} by the Vancouver School Board (VSB). The two Vancouver schools currently offering English MACC programs are Tecumseh Elementary School, with Ms. Cantelon and a grade 5/6/7 split and Sir William Osler Elementary School, with Mr. Webb teaching a 4/5 split and <b>Ms.</b> <b>Taylor</b> teaching a 6/7 split. Additionally, Kerrisdale Elementary School currently offers a 5/6/7 split french Immersion MACC program (FI MACC) with Madame Barber. The FI MACC was previously at General Gordon Elementary School. There were previous incarnations of MACC at Lord Nelson Elementary School, Queen Mary Elementary School, and David Livingstone Elementary School, but the program has shrunk slightly and relocated to its current base schools over the years due {{to a combination of}} VSB cutbacks, seismic upgrades, and perceived population shifts. In addition, there are other MACC programs outside Vancouver, such as Berkshire Park Elementary School (North Surrey), Hyland Elementary School (Central Surrey), Bayridge Elementary School (South Surrey), and Crescent Park Elementary School (South Surrey), in Surrey, which is in the Lower Mainland region. All four Surrey programs are grades 5-7. Surrey is currently in consideration of adding a high school program. There also used to be a high school MACC program in Kitsilano Secondary School. The vast majority of Vancouver MACC graduates currently attend competitive mini-school programs at a variety of area high schools. The Tri-Cities (Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, Port Moody) has three MACC equipped schools, namely Citadel Middle School, Hillcrest Middle School, and Kwayhquitlum Middle School. As of 2016 the Teachers at [...] "Kway" [...] are Mr. Cupit, Mrs. Stoffberg and Mr. Ellis. The students are part of the Thunderbird and Bears teams respectively, and are well-known throughout the school for their band, choir, athletics, leadership, speech-writing and mathematics competition efforts. In 2014, two MACC sites were added in Burnaby (School District 41) at Capitol Hill Elementary School. There are currently two classes (Grade 4 & 5 and Grade 6 & 7) and the Burnaby School District is planning to add one more MACC site in south Burnaby, if possible, in the fall of 2015.|$|E
