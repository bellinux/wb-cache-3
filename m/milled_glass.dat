Second, the silver concentration in ion-exchanged glasses is more homogeneous. Obviously, this effects an even silver precipitation and wafer etching which reduces shunting effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of sintered glasses and glass-ceramics, glass matrix composites and glass-bounded ceramics or pastes is often affected by gas bubble formation. Against this background, we studied sintering and foaming of barium silicate glass powders used as SOFC sealants using different powder milling procedures.

Foaming increased significantly as milling progressed. For moderately <b>milled</b> <b>glass</b> powders, subsequent storage in air could also promote foaming. Although the powder compacts were uniaxially pressed and sintered in air, the milling atmosphere sig¬ni¬ficantly affected foaming. The strength of this effect increased in the order Ar  N 2 < air < CO 2. Conformingly, VHE studies revealed that the pores of foamed samples predominantly encapsulated CO 2, even for powders milled in Ar and N 2. Results of this study thus indicate that foaming is caused by carbonaceous species trapped on the glass powder surface.

40|$|AbstractGlass Fiber Reinforced Polymer(GFRP) rebars {{are easily}} {{deteriorated}} by concrete alkalinity. This paper {{focuses on the}} improvement of durability of newly developed GFRP rebars exposed to chemical attack in the alkaline environment of concrete. The milled E-glass fibers which are mixed in surfaace resin can increase bond strength between GFRP rebars and the concrete. In this study, the effect of milled alkali-resistant glass fibers (milled AR glass) and milled E-glass in the ribs on the durability of GFRP rebar is investigated through short span shear tests and moist absorption tests of the baare rebar. To accelerate {{the effect of the}} alkalinity, aging procedures were applied to test specimens. According to thhe test results, lower mix ratio of milled fibers in the ribs contribbuted to more durability than if higher mix ratio was used. This was due to more voids and defects in ribs with high mix ratio of milled fibers. GFRP rebars with milled AR glass fibers did not show great improvement in ISS strength compared to those with milled E-glass fibers. These results indicate that the <b>milled</b> <b>glass</b> fibers works as a reinforcing material, but optimum mix ratio to minimize causing of defects and voids in the manufacturing proccess should be determined...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Employment of rotary {{ultrasonic}} machining (RUM) technique to <b>mill</b> <b>glass</b> material was attempted in this research.

The challenge of the attempt {{in the present study}} {{had to do with the}} fact that the direction of RUM tool oscillation was inherently perpendicular to the direction of milling. The RUM apparatus employed for the study comprised a computerized feeding system, a drive control system and an ultrasonic oscillation system. The RUM system was also characterized by having a feeding system fit for a PC-controlled stepping motor. It was found that the oscillation associated with the RUM milling was effective in reducing the machining resistance encountered during milling process, making it possible to increase the feed rate and thus the material rate, as well. However, the increased milling depth and feed rate would have an adverse effect on the tool life in terms of more breakage of grinding grits on the tool, thus resulting in faster wear rate of the milling tool...|$|R

40|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{a separation}} process which {{plays a major}} role in the mining industry. It is essentially employed to recover a vast array of different valuable commodities such as rare earth minerals essential to the manufacture of high-tech products. Owing to its simplicity, the process is also widely used for the de-inking of recycled paper fibres and for the removal of pollutants from waste water. The flotation process essentially relies on the attachment of solid particles on the surface of gas bubbles immersed in water. The present study seeks to investigate the effect of the particle shape on the attachment mechanism. Using an in-house optical micro-bubble sensor the approach, the sliding and the adhesion of micron <b>milled</b> <b>glass</b> fibres on the surface of a stationary air bubble immersed in stagnant water is thoroughly investigated. The translational and rotational velocities were measured for fibres of various aspect ratios. The results are compared with a theoretical model and with experimental data obtained with spherical glass beads. It is found that the fibre orientation during the sliding motion largely depends on the collision area. Upon collision near the upstream pole of the gas bubble the major axis of the fibre aligns with the local bubble surface (tangential fibre alignment). If collision occurs at least 30 ° further downstream only head of the fibre is in contact with the gas–liquid interface (radial fibre alignment) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} impact of adding <b>milled</b> <b>glass</b> fibers and nanoparticles at different mass fractions to low-density (relative density < 0. 2) polyurethane (PU) foams is investigated. Tensile, compressive, and shear stress–strain curves are {{measured in the}} plane parallel to the foam-rise direction and the in-plane components of the elastic modulus are determined {{in order to assess}} the mechanical anisotropy of the foams. Power-law relationships between the moduli and apparent density are established for pure PU foams and used as a baseline to which the properties of composite foams are compared. Cellular mechanics models based on both rectangular and Kelvin unit-cell geometries are employed to estimate changes in the cell shape based on the mechanical anisotropy of composite foams, and the model results are compared with direct observations of the cellular structure from microscopy. A single measure of foam stiffness reinforcement is defined that excludes the effects of the apparent foam density and cell shape. The analysis reveals the large impact of cell shape on the moduli of the glass-fiber and nanocomposite foams. Nanocomposite foams exhibit up to an 11. 1 % degree of reinforcement, and glass-fiber foams up to 18. 7 % using this method for quantifying foam reinforcement, whereas a simple normalization to the in-plane modulus components of the pure PU foam would indicate from ? 40. 5 % to 25. 9 % reinforcement in nanocomposite foams, and ? 7. 5 to 20. 2 % in glass-fiber foams...|$|E
40|$|Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Polyurea is a block {{copolymer}} {{that has been}} widely used in the coating industry as an abrasion-resistant and energy-dissipative material. Its mechanical properties can be tuned by choosing different variations of diamines and diisocyanates {{as well as by}} adding various nano- and micro-inclusions to create polyurea-based composites. Our aim here is to provide the necessary experimentally-based viscoelastic constitutive relations for polyurea and its composites in a format convenient to support computational studies. The polyurea used in this research is synthesized by the reaction of Versalink P- 1000 (Air Products) and Isonate 143 L (Dow Chemicals). Samples of pure polyurea and polyurea composites are fabricated and then characterized using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Based on the DMA data, master curves of storage and loss moduli are developed using time–temperature superposition. The quality of the master curves is carefully assessed by comparing with the ultrasonic wave measurements and by Kramers–Kronig relations. Based on the master curves, continuous relaxation spectra are calculated, then the time-domain relaxation moduli are approximated from the relaxation spectra. Prony series of desired number of terms for the frequency ranges of interest are extracted from the relaxation modulus. This method for developing cost efficient Prony series has been proven to be effective and efficient for numerous DMA test results of many polyurea/polyurea-based material systems, including pure polyurea with various stoichiometric ratios, polyurea with <b>milled</b> <b>glass</b> inclusions, polyurea with hybrid nano-particles and polyurea with phenolic microbubbles.
