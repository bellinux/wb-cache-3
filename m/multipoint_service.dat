50|$|In PBB and PBT {{switches}} at {{the edge}} of the carrier network encapsulate customer traffic within an 802.1ah frame. The carrier network core is only responsible for transporting frames from an edge device to another, alleviating Q-in-Q’s issue of forwarding table scalability. The same feature - assigning a MAC address per edge device, not per service - creates a scalability issue for <b>multipoint</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Multipoint</b> <b>services</b> require full mesh connectivity between edge devices, a very inefficient method as all frames are duplicated at the root nodes, rather than at the optimal point as in VLAN connectivity. Moreover, the need to create forwarding entries for each unicast connection within the full mesh (as opposed to a single VLAN forwarding tree in the case of VLAN connectivity) will quickly become unsustainable as <b>multipoint</b> <b>services</b> become predominant in the near future.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Upcoming {{broadband}} networks offer a bearer service suitable for modern distributed applications. High bandwidth capacity and low transfer delay are two characteristics of such communication services. Beside these performance-oriented parameters, many applications have additional requirements {{in respect to}} quality of the used communication service. Computer Supported Cooperative Work, distributed parallel processing and virtual shared memory, for example, depend on error-free data exchange among multiple computer systems. Additional problems occur {{for the provision of}} a reliable <b>multipoint</b> <b>service,</b> where errors are more likely and the sender has to deal with numerous receivers. In order to meet the required reliability, powerful and scalable error control mechanisms are essential.

40|$|WEBGOP is a {{programming}} architecture for collaborative Web services using graph-oriented programming. The {{motivation for}} the project comes from {{the realization that the}} integration of collaborative Web services lacks support. The aim of WEBGOP is to extend the Web from a client-server system to a structured multipoint system. A graph abstraction of the network provides the structure for the integration of Web services and facilitates their configuration and programming. Using WEBGOP, a logical graph representing a virtual-overlay network over the Internet is created to link up collaborative Web services. Web services are individually or jointly invoked through either unicast or multicast messages within the overlay network. All messages are based on the simple-object access protocol (SOAP). This forms an extension of the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to support the distributed invocation of Web services. The Web services on different servers work collaboratively for a multipoint network application. This project provides a structured integration of Web services by extending the support of intermediary processing in a <b>multipoint</b> <b>service.</b> It also provides a rich network-programming interface for a new class of integrated Web applications while retaining the use of the Internet protocol and HTTP.

40|$|Workgroup {{multimedia}} {{applications such}} as videoconference, teleteaching or CSCW demand <b>multipoint</b> <b>service</b> from Telecommunication Networks. This {{is not just a}} broadcast service but it is a service where N sites transmit traffic to N sites. This service requires that the network support a large number of work-groups with few (5 - 20) participants together with low delay, low delay jitter, high throughput and a con-nection-less service in a wide area. The service of required by each of these workgroups is what we call Virtual LAN-WAN (VLW). At present, most of these multimedia applications have been developed over the IP protocol. Asynchro-nous Transfer Mode (ATM) will be the technology of the future Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN), so ATM Networks must provide a framework for the development of multimedia applications based on IP protocols. In fact, the integration of IP over ATM Networks is as subject of intense work in standardization bodies. Within this effort, the ATM Forum and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) have achieved some results in the provision of LAN service based on IP over ATM. This paper shows the problems of supporting a VLW service based on IP protocol over ATM Networks. We summarize the ATM Forum model based on LAN Emulation Specification (LANE) and the work in progress of the IETF on this subject. Pros and cons of every solution are described, and a model consid-ered to provide cost-effective performance is proposed. Finally, we present a case study that has been tested in a European scale. This case study is a distributed conference based on the ATM paneuropean pilot interconnecting ten sites in seven countries.

40|$|Emerging {{applications}} mostly require both, {{high performance}} {{as well as}} support {{of a wide variety}} of communication services. For example, audio, video, and data transmission may require highly different services, e. g., guaranteed delay, jitter, or bandwidth. An additional challenge arises by the growing demand for <b>multipoint</b> communication <b>services.</b> ATM networks are capable of satisfying the basic application requirements by providing <b>multipoint</b> bearer <b>services</b> with data rates exceeding a gigabit per second. However, current communication subsystems (including higher layer protocols) that provide reliable services are not able to deliver the available network performance to the applications. In order to provide the required high performance services to the applications, new protocols as well as high-performance implementation architectures for the communication subsystems need to be designed. Dedicated VLSI components should be used in flexible implementation platforms used for time-critical processing tasks in order to provide high performance.
