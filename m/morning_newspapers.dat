25|$|The {{first major}} Swedish {{newspaper}} {{to leave the}} broadsheet format and start printing in tabloid format was Svenska Dagbladet, on 16 November 2000. As of August 2004, there were 26 broadsheet newspapers in total, with a combined circulation of 1,577,700 and 50 newspapers in tabloid with a combined circulation of 1,129,400. On 5 October 2004, the <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> Göteborgs-Posten, Dagens Nyheter, Sydsvenskan and Östersunds-Posten all switched to tabloid, thus making it the leading format for <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> in Sweden by volume of circulation. Most other broadsheet newspapers have followed since. The last daily Swedish newspaper to switch to tabloid was Jönköpings-Posten, 6 November 2013.|$|E

25|$|When MacNeill {{learned from}} Vol. Patrick Whelan that the arms {{shipment}} had been lost, he reverted to his original position.

25|$|In June 1994, {{the family}} lived at 65 Every Street, Andersons Bay, Dunedin. The house {{was old and}} 'semi-derelict'. At this time Robin and Margaret were estranged. Robin was {{initially}} sleeping {{in the back of}} his van at Taieri, but more recently in the schoolhouse three nights a week. He returned to the family home at weekends but slept in a caravan in the back garden. David was studying music and classics at Otago University and had a part-time job delivering <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers.</b> Arawa was attending a teachers' training college and Stephen was at high school. Laniet had a part-time job in Dunedin and lived away from home, but had returned to the family residence on the Sunday evening of 19 June to attend a family meeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window {{at the opposite end of}} the corridor. A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{was soon}} hired {{to write the}} {{screenplay}} for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film The Painted Veil for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage {{on the front pages}} of the <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework East Side Story and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for The King and I, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of The Painted Veil replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Horace Avory {{became a}} judge. Hastings first found {{out when he}} read the report in the <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and was dismayed that he would again have {{to search for a}} tenancy at another {{chambers}}. He instead had the idea that he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money. Despite Avory's reputation as [...] "cold and hard" [...] he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} the first event of any kind to take place at Wembley Stadium, which had not been due to open until 1924 but was {{completed}} ahead of schedule. [...] After sub-capacity crowds had attended the first three finals after the First World War at Stamford Bridge, The Football Association (The FA) was unconvinced that the match could fill the large capacity of the new stadium and undertook a major advertising campaign, for fans to attend. Despite these fears, the new national stadium, which had been advertised as the greatest venue of its kind and had an unprecedented capacity of 125,000, {{proved to be a}} great lure and drew a large number of casual observers. [...] The fact that a London-based team was competing meant that many football fans {{from all parts of the}} city chose to attend. The <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> on the day of the match reported that around 5,000 fans were travelling from Bolton and that they were expected to be joined by [...] "at least 115,000 enthusiasts from London and other parts of the country". The easy accessibility of the stadium by public transport and the fine weather were also factors which contributed to the enormous crowd.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1948 season started, team {{president}} Bill Veeck doubled Lemon's contract amount. It would be Lemon's first full {{season as a}} pitcher. Lemon was the Indians' number-two pitcher in the starting rotation, behind Bob Feller. On June 30, 1948, Lemon pitched a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers in a 2–0 win, earning his 11th win and fifth shutout of the season. He became the ninth Indians pitcher to record a no-hitter and ended the season with an AL-best 20 complete games. His ten shutouts on the season were {{the most in the}} majors. [...] Lemon would go on to win the 1948 AL Pitcher of the Year Award. [...] With three games remaining in the regular season, 20-game winner Lemon started the first game of their final series against Detroit. Lemon allowed three runs on seven hits and the Indians lost the game. Cleveland lost two games of the three-game series, forcing a one-game playoff with the Boston Red Sox. Speculation built up around which Indians pitcher Boudreau would send to the mound against the Red Sox on October 4; the choices were largely narrowed down to Lemon and Satchel Paige. Lemon was listed as Cleveland's [...] "probable pitcher" [...] by United Press International in <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> the day of the game, even though he would be working on two days of rest. Instead, Boudreau went with Gene Bearden, who would be pitching on one day of rest, and the choice was solidified when veteran second baseman Joe Gordon spoke up in support of Boudreau at a team meeting. The Indians won the game at Fenway Park by a score of 8–3 and prepared to face the Boston Braves in the World Series.|$|E
500|$|By 1895, the Mr. Dooley columns had {{attracted}} a large following in Chicago, though {{because he did}} not sign them, few knew the name of the author outside the newspaper trade. The two Democratic <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> in Chicago at that time were the Herald, owned by James W. Scott, and the Times, which like the Post was owned by Walsh. In early 1895, Scott bought Walsh's two papers, and merged the Times and Herald. The new Times-Herald promised to be a powerful progressive force, with the Post its afternoon auxiliary; but Scott almost immediately died. Both the Post and the merged paper were bought by H. H. Kohlsaat. One of the main supporters of the campaign of Ohio Governor William McKinley, a Republican, for the presidency, Kohlsaat soon announced a new editorial policy: the papers would be strictly nonpartisan, except that they would be for McKinley, for protectionism (which McKinley supported), [...] "and for anything he wants". The new policy cramped Dunne's style not only in his editorial writing, but in the Mr. Dooley pieces as well. Both major candidates, McKinley and Democrat William Jennings Bryan, were the butts of Mr. Dooley's wit about equally, and the bartender noted with regret the partisan anger that filled the nation. That rancor led to the effective end of McKenna's role in the column, as he (a Silver Republican) differed with McKinley over the gold standard, and as its opponent would not let his name be used in a paper that backed it. The fictional Malachi Hennessy, more typical of Bridgeport than McKenna as a rolling mill worker with a large family (McKenna was a bachelor), became his replacement. Hennessy had first appeared in the column on June 22, 1895, making an ill-fated decision to umpire a baseball game, and had been brought back in June 1896 as a Democrat and a [...] "free silver" [...] supporter, a foil to McKenna, who was depicted as backing the gold standard. McKenna regretted his decision, but was infrequently mentioned thereafter. Hennessy, stolid, patient, and not very bright, was often the butt of Dooley's jokes, but Dunne dedicated his third collection of Dooley stories [...] "To the Hennessys of the world who suffer and are silent." ...|$|E

The Post also printed a photo of Eagles QB Michael Vick and two dogs superimposed on Giants players' faces behind him. It was also discussed on morning news shows, including American Morning. Commentators in both New York and Philadelphia also held up the <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> in their cities, both of which had the headline about the Eagles beating the Giants.|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles woke {{up early}} on 5 July in {{readiness}} for their flight to Delhi in India. After their requests for room service had gone unanswered, Evans {{went down to}} reception and found that all security protection inside the hotel had disappeared. The <b>morning</b> <b>newspapers</b> carried front-page stories condemning the Beatles for their failure to attend the engagement at Malacañang Palace. The tour party faced further intimidation initiated by Marcos loyalists. The Inland Revenue presented a tax bill on the band's concert earnings, which were still held by Ramos; this was despite a stipulation in NEMS' contract with Cavalcade that any such tax would be paid by the local promoter. All assistance from the hotel staff was withdrawn, as was any police escort through the city traffic, leaving Epstein to call ahead and plead with the pilot of their KLM flight to delay his takeoff.
