50|$|Firesteel was {{the only}} coal mining {{community}} in South Dakota. The first coal was found in 1907 or 1908 by W. Benoist and A. Traversie in a prairie dog town. A commercial coal mine was opened in 1911. Because of the expensive cost of a railroad, the mine was locally operated until World War I, when the railroad costs dropped and wider markets opened. In 1929, a new dragline was purchased by Firesteel Coal Company, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> was made possible. In 1933, the State Relief Agency opened a new mine about 3/4 of a mile southwest of the town to provide more fuel for people struggling through the Great Depression. However, this mine closed on March 17, 1934, when the government realized that purchasing coal was cheaper than mining it. Runkel Coal was founded by L. P. Runkel in 1935. The company's peak years were May 1941 to April 1942, when 51,743 tons of coal were sold. During this time, 30 truckers were paid 35 cents per ton to load and haul the coal from pits to the railcars. In 1947, Ben Dollarhide bought out the Runkel Company and formed the Dewey County Coal Company. Dollarhide added a large tipple to speed loading. In one day, 552 tons of coal were pushed through the tipple.|$|E

Chloroplast (CF 0 F 1) ATP synthases were reconstituted into liposomes. Liposomes were adsorbed on a mica surface where they spread and formed lipid bilayers containing CF 0 F 1 ATP synthases which could be imaged. From these reconstituted CF 0 F 1 ATP synthases, the CF 1 part could be removed either by application of a chemical denaturant or less efficiently by <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> with the AFM tip. Embedded in the lipid bilayer were seen ring-like structures with a central dimple with outer diameters of 20 +/- 3 nm (chemical denaturant) and ca. 7 nm (<b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping),</b> respectively. Ring-like structures were also observed in a protein-free lipid bilayer. These had diameters of 30 +/- 5 nm and could be clearly distinguished from the structures observed after <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping.</b> Hence, the ring-like structures observed after <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> might represent the intrinsic membrane domain CF 0 or the oligomer of its subunit III.

30|$|Bamboo is a {{composite}} material reinforced axially by fibers called vascular bundles. In this paper, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> method was used to isolate vascular bundles from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), China’s most important commercial bamboo species. The paper focuses on analyzing the suitability of this method for measuring the mechanical properties of single vascular bundles {{with respect to their}} location within a bamboo culm. Using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and video extensometry testing technique, we found that the tensile mechanical properties of vascular bundle can be determined with great accuracy. The method relies on <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> to prepare samples at a length scale from individual bamboo, which traditionally increases the difficulty of conducting tests. Therefore, to determine the elastic modulus of vascular bundle material, video extensometry was used for efficient strain detection in tensile experiments. This type of sample preparation minimizes the usual problems encountered when mounting samples. The cross-sectional area of the vascular bundle was determined by CLSM measurement using an ultramicrotome as a cutting tool. Applying this method, the elastic modulus and tensile strength of the vascular bundle of moso bamboo were measured to be ~ 44.67  GPa and ~ 709.96  MPa, respectively. It is noteworthy that the tensile mechanical properties of the fibrous sheath areas are higher than those observed over the whole area.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study into the tensile strength and fatigue properties of uncoated optical glass fibres containing Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The protective polymer coating of the optical fibres {{must be removed}} by chemical or <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> methods to produce the Bragg gratings in the fibre core. This paper investigates the effects of chemical or <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> on the sensor integrity, operating life and damage mechanisms of the fibres when {{they have not been}} recoated after producing the Bragg gratings. The fatigue properties of the chemically or mechanically stripped fibre sensors were evaluated under cyclic tension¿tension loading when externally bonded to carbon fibre-epoxy substrates representative of aircraft composite structures. The tensile strength of the mechanically stripped fibre was lower than the chemically stripped fibre because larger surface flaws were created during removal of the polymer coating. Tension fatigue life (S¿N) curves of the chemically and mechanically stripped fibres were measured, and the fatigue life and signal quality of the FBG sensors decreased rapidly with increasing maximum fatigue strain. The signal quality of the FBG sensors degraded with increasing number of load cycles due to the formation of sub-critical cracks within the fibre by stress-corrosion. The fatigue life and sensor performance under cyclic loading was superior for the chemically stripped sensors. The S¿N curves exhibit a fatigue endurance limit (at 106 load cycles), below which chemically and mechanically stripped fibres have an infinite fatigue life and there is no degradation to the FBG sensor signal quality...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{develops}} {{an analytical}} {{model for the}} conductive cracks in piezoelectric ceramics under electromechanical cycling. An electrical yielding <b>strip</b> and a <b>mechanical</b> yielding <b>strip</b> are assumed to develop at the crack tips when the medium is subjected to external electromechanical loads. The yielding strip is assumed to have constant stress and constant electric field. Based on these assumptions and extending the accumulated plastic displacement criterion for crack propagation in traditional structural materials to piezoelectric ceramics, a fatigue crack growth law is derived. The law, similar to the well known Paris law, is a fourth-power function of the effective stress intensity factor. Graphical results for the effect of electric load on the effective crack tip stress intensity factor and crack growth rate are provided. The law is given in closed-form so {{that it might be}} used in the future for the fatigue and reliability analysis and design of piezoelectric materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the interfacial shear strength between the glass fiber and primary coating in double-coated optical fibers on humidity and temperature is experimentally investigated. The interfacial shear strength is determined from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> force. The effect of humidity on the interfacial shear strength is governed by the diffusion of water vapor through the polymeric coatings to the interface between the glass fiber and primary coating. After several days, the diffusion of water vapor reaches a steady state. The degradation of the interfacial shear strength is unrelated to {{the total amount of}} water vapor in the polymeric coatings, does depend on the amount of water vapor on the glass/polymer interface. Consequently, the degradation of interfacial shear strength caused by the humidity is proportional to the squared cube-root of the water vapor pressure. Results of this study demonstrate that the relationship between the fiber strength and the humidity resembles that between the interfacial shear strength and the humidity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

Two hundred mini-implants were divided into 4 groups with 50 screws equally distributed in five diameters (1. 3 to 1. 7 [*]mm) : control group (CG) : unused mini-implants, G 1 : mini-implants inserted in pig iliac bone and removed, G 2 : same protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning and autoclave sterilization, and G 3 : same insertion protocol of group 1 followed by sonication for cleaning before and after sandblasting (Al 2 O 3 - 90 [*]µ) and autoclave sterilization. G 2 and G 3 mini-implants were weighed after recycling process to evaluate weight loss (W). All the screws were broken to determine the fracture torque (FT). The influence of recycling process on FT and W was evaluated by ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results. FT was not influenced by recycling protocols even when sandblasting was added. Sandblasting caused weight loss due to abrasive <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> of screw surface.

The basic criterion that motivated us to use lasers to clean Roman coins was the requirement of pulsed emission, in order to minimize heat-induced damages. In fact, the laser interaction with the coins has to be short enough, to produce a fast removal of the encrustation, avoiding heat conduction into the substrate.

The strongest signal observed by western blot was detected in colon epithelium correlating with the immunofluorescence localization. The faint signal {{might be due}} to contamination of smooth muscle samples with epithelial cells after <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping,</b> or the presence of Mecp 2 expressing cell types like those of the enteric nervous system or macrophages that can be present in the smooth muscle layer [4, 19]. MECP 2 expression in the intestine has been previously documented in human, rat, and mouse tissues, and the different results obtained might reflect not only species differences but also handling of samples and heterogeneity of technics used for MECP 2 detection. For example, western blot analysis of adult mouse tissues showed Mecp 2 expression in the colon [20], and the same authors detected northern blot signal for Mecp 2 in the colon but not in the small intestine from humans. Nevertheless, expression of Mecp 2 mRNA has been detected in epithelial cells of the small intestine of adult rats [21], and other immunodetection studies of MECP 2 distribution determined that the protein is expressed in the smooth muscle [22] and in cells of the enteric nervous system of the mouse intestine [19]. Our immunofluorescence experiments showed no signal for MECP 2 on the smooth muscle layer. We tested the specificity of the antibody in the colon tissue from the Mecp 2 -null mouse and no signal was detected in both the mucosa and smooth muscle.|$|E

40|$|Personnel from Coastal Environments, Inc. (CEI), Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC), and the University of Mississippi {{conducted}} archaeological and geophysical investigations at {{the locations}} of two proposed safety rest areas {{on opposite sides of}} Interstate Highway (IH) 10 in Chambers County, Texas. The research was carried out from late August 2006 until late February 2007, under contract to the Environmental Affairs Division of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). MAC archaeologists had previously examined the two rest area tracts in 2001. Their research indicated that the north tract contained a late-nineteenth- through early-twentieth-century cemetery, identified as the Broussard Cemetery site (41 CH 370). Buried within the cemetery are the remains of several members of the locally prominent White family and relatives. The south tract included the remains of a below-ground cistern that likely marked the location of the main house associated with the homestead and ranch of James Taylor White II. It was estimated that this house location, labeled the White Family Cistern site (41 CH 371), was occupied from ca. 1854 until sometime in the early 1900 s. The field investigations examined three specific areas within the two tracts: (1) A small 20 -by- 45 -m area situated about 10 m north of the Broussard Cemetery site where a truck-entrance road is to be built. It was considered possible that unmarked graves located outside the cemetery proper might be present in that area. (2) A 40 -by- 40 -m area within the south tract where MAC personnel had located a piece of whiteware during their earlier investigations. It was thought that a possible outbuilding related to the White homestead might be present in that area. (3) A 110 -by- 115 -m area in the south tract where the main house and most of the White family occupation occurred. The area in the north tract was examined by ground-penetrating radar, resistivity surveys and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> of anomalies recognized by the geophysical research. The small square area in the south tract was examined by systematic shovel tests. The large area in the south tract was investigated by systematic shovel tests, a metal detector survey, a geophysical search that included magnetometer and electromagnetic susceptibility surveys, a limited ground-truth assessment of selected anomalies that had been identified by the geophysical surveys, <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> of other anomalies recognized by the geophysical research, plus the controlled excavation of a few small units in locations where the stripping uncovered potential cultural features. Overall, the various investigations identified the location, orientation, and dimensions of the White family house and its associated kitchen, a rich sheet midden situated {{to the rear of the}} house, and several possible outbuildings located to the sides of the structure. Numerous artifacts indicative of the period of suspected occupation were collected, including hundreds of pieces of metal, ceramic fragments, and glass. A few animal bones and plant remains also were obtained. Although the present study did not call for a detailed analysis of these items, such should prove useful in the future. Given these results, it is clear that site 41 CH 371 is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Additional archaeological investigations at selected portions of the site are recommended, along with further archival and historical research. Accordingly, construction of the rest area in the south tract should be delayed until the recommended investigations are completed. The small area examined in the north tract near site 41 CH 370 failed to yield any evidence of burials. Since the cemetery itself will be avoided during construction, no further archaeological work is considered necessary in the north tract. Thus, construction of the rest area within the north tract may proceed as planned...|$|E

The work was performed under Antiquities Permit 2694 with William E. Moore the Principal Investigator. This study involved <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> of an area with a gradall to expose the subsurface where pre- 1870 historic features might be present. The potential of such features is based on the presence of a 19 th century structure on the property that may have been constructed between 1867 and 1870. This investigation revealed the presence of "plow scars. " These scars were observed to be oriented at 40 degrees east of north, a pattern not consistent with the current orientation of the city block as currently platted. This indicates that the area was cultivated prior to platting at the City of Bryan and prior to construction of the original John W. Coulter residence in the 19 th century. One historic feature, a small, amorphous trash dump containing glass, metal, ceramics, brick, and animal bone was observed as a result of this investigation. The artifacts in this shallow, amorphous deposit date to the early 20 th century. They were not collected. It is concluded that the area examined was probably used as a pasture throughout the occupation of this site. This use, apparently post-dating cultivation of the tract, is confirmed by a verbal description of the block by an earlier resident of the area. This informant stated that part of the current project area was used as pasture for a cow. There was a small pond in the pasture area, but its location has not been identified.

40|$|Purpose: was to {{investigate}} impact of cold forming and annealing on microstructural and mechanical propertiesof HSLA steel. Design/methodology/approach: Testing of Nb-V-Ti microalloyed strip steel {{was based on a}} combination ofcold rolling, recrystallization annealing, mechanical testing, metallography and TEM. Findings: It was confirmed that by a suitable combination of size of previous cold reduction size and parametersof the following annealing it is possible to influence considerably a complex of <b>mechanical</b> propertiesof particular <b>strips.</b> Strength as well as plastic properties depended on the course of recrystallization andprecipitates’ coarsening during annealing. Research limitations/implications: The experiment should be supplemented by the more detailed analyses ofmicrostructure. Practical implications: The results may be utilized for optimization of terms of heat treatment in a cold rollingmill, especially in accordance with specific requirements for a relation between plastic and strength propertiesof the investigated steel. Originality/value: Research possibilities of VSB-TUO in the sphere of cold rolling of Nb-V-Ti HSLA steelwere introduced in combination with the complex approach to processing of the obtained results...|$|R
40|$|The Fish Creek Slough site (41 DL 436) {{is a well}} stratified, multi-component, open {{campsite}} {{situated on}} an alluvial terrace {{on the west bank}} of Fish Creek in Dallas County, Texas. Discovered in 2005, the site contains an abundance of faunal material, charcoal, and burned clay within multiple, discrete stratified zones. The site was evaluated by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Because the site was within the right-of-way for a planned road and bridge construction project, and as directed by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, TxDOT elected to undertake archaeological data recovery excavations to mitigate adverse effects to the site. In October of 2010, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. conducted archaeological data recovery excavations at the site under TxDOT contract no. 579 - 09 -SA 006. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> was conducted within a 6 x 20 -m trench in 3 – 5 -cm cuts down to 200 centimeters below the modern ground surface and exposed 43 burned zones, other features, and artifact concentrations. In addition to 285 cubic meters of soil removed mechanically, an additional 17. 75 cubic meters was excavated within 107 hand-dug units. Collected and analyzed items included more than 8, 700 faunal specimens, 43 pieces of chipped stone, and 206 fire-cracked rocks. Samples were collected for macrobotanical, magnetic susceptibility, pH, carbon, and malacology, pollen, diatom, phytolith, and ostracod assays and selected specimens of fire-cracked rock were analyzed for the presence of starches and lipids. Thirty-nine radiocarbon dates accepted as valid helped define four discrete occupational components with the earliest occupation probably occurring as early as AD 1025, and the last occupation probably as late as AD 1865. Geoarchaeological analyses show that the stratigraphic sequence accumulated rapidly, separating and preserving the discrete occupations in good context. Analysis of the exceptionally robust and well-preserved faunal assemblage provides evidence for interpretation of change through time in social structure, site spatial occupations, and diet and subsistence. Of special note, within the occupation zones dating to the Protohistoric and Historic periods, metal cut marks on bone suggest an increased reliance on European-introduced technology...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{of common}} {{practice}} {{to say that}} land development is a significant threat to our cultural heritage. Even if this heritage is protected thanks to different laws in constant evolution, but also framed at a European level by various conventions, a mass destruction of this heritage was and is still ongoing, more specifically for the part which is buried below the Earth surface. Only recently, thousands of sites have been systematically excavated before their complete destructions and this inflation of scientific data derived from their study (compared to the more traditional excavations done by researchers) has completely changed {{our view of the}} past. If we focus only for France, the total area impacted by development works is of the order of 60 000 ha per year. This represents 165 ha per day or 7 ha by hour! Among these 7 ha/hour, only about 1, 5 ha is checked by archaeologists (evaluation trenches with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping).</b> Even if the ratio of evaluated areas seems low (circa 15 %), over one year (2012), this represents an area of 15000 ha and indeed a unique opportunity for archaeologists. These figures are now lowering due to the impact of the economical situation. It {{is important to note that}} in France the cost of archaeological evaluation/excavation is supported at 100 % by the developer. Rescue Archaeology has grown up in Europe due to the awareness of the value of buried heritage first by some amateurs, but also by the public and specifically into the historical districts of the towns. In France and in other countries like England, Ireland, Italy, scandals due to the voluntary destruction of archaeological remains is at the origin of the development of specific regulations and entities in Archaeology. Generally, this period is coincident with first, the post-reconstructions of big town centers throughout Europe, and then with the development of big infrastructures like motorways (France, Hungry, Ireland) and railways lines during the economical expansion (TGV in France). It is significant to note that the term 'Archéologie de sauvetage' (Salvage Archaeology) first given to this type of Archaeology...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the quality of PostScriptgenerated four-color halftones to halftones {{produced}} by traditional high-end color systems. The quality issue is one that must be addressed before a decision can be made to move magazine production onto a complete desktop publishing platform. In moving layout and design functions onto a desktop publishing platform, publishers can take advantage of PostScript as a page-description language to electronically create complete pages. Electronic assembly would eliminate the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stripping</b> step, allowing great reductions in prepress manufacturing costs. There are two routes that can be taken to output these electronic pages. First, the pages can be output via the traditional high-end color systems, like those marketed by companies such as Dupont Imaging Systems and Scitex. These systems, though expensive to purchase and maintain, are proven in terms of quality for four-color output. The alternative to the high-end method is to output pages through device-independent PostScript-driven imagesetters, like those marketed by companies such as Agfa and Linotype. These devices are low-cost in comparison to the high-end systems. The quality, however, is the subject of debate. To highlight the differences in quality, the same continuous-tone data generated from a high resolution scanner was sent for halftone film output through both a high-end imagesetter and a PostScript-driven imagesetter. The images were shown to two groups of viewers: professionals (from the printing and publishing industry) and non-professionals. The viewers were then asked questions pertaining to the sharpness, detail, contrast, tonal range, and overall pleasing color of the two sets of images. For each group, the responses were analyzed statistically to determine if there was a perceived difference between four-color images generated from a high-end color system and those generated from PostScript-driven output devices. In addition, the responses of the two groups were compared statisticaUy to determine if there was a difference between the way the professionals viewed the two images and the way non-professionals viewed them. It was determined that within the group of professionals, there was no statistically meaningful difference perceived between the high-end color and the PostScript color. The same was found to be true for the non-professionals. However, when comparing the responses of professionals to non professionals, it was found that there was a statistically meaningful difference in the pattern of their responses, or in the way they viewed the imagesthough within each of these two groups, there was no statisticaUy apparent agreement on the preferences...|$|E
40|$|The module is {{made out}} of four 6 cm x 6 cm single sided Si {{microstrip}} detectors. Two detectors are butt glued to form a 12 cm long <b>mechanical</b> unit and <b>strips</b> of the two detectors are electrically connected to form 12 cm long strips. The butt gluing is followed by a back to back attachment. The module in this note is the R{phi} module where the electronics is oriented parallel to the strip direction and bonded directly to the strips. This module concept provides the maximum signal-to-noise ratio, particularly when the front-end electronics is placed near the middle rather than at the end. From the noise analysis, it is concluded that the worst-case {Delta}ENC (far-end injection) between end- and center-tapped modules will be 120 to 210 el. rms (9 to 15 %) for a non-irradiated detector and 75 to 130 el. rms (5 to 9 %) for an irradiated detector, for a metal strip resistance of 10 to 20 {Omega}/cm...|$|R
40|$|Increased intraluminal {{pressure}} of the rat portal vein in vivo causes hypertrophy and altered contractility in 1 to 7 days. We have used organ cultures to investigate mechanisms involved in this adaptation to <b>mechanical</b> load. <b>Strips</b> of rat portal vein were cultured for 3 days, either undistended or loaded by a weight. Length-force relations were shifted toward longer length in stretched cultured veins compared with freshly dissected veins, whereas the length-force relations of unstretched cultured veins were shifted in the opposite direction. This occurred after culture either with or without 10 % FCS to promote growth. The wet weight of loaded veins increased by 56 % {{in the presence of}} FCS, whereas that of undistended control veins increased by 24 %. No weight increase was seen in serum-free culture. The dry/wet weight ratio decreased during culture with FCS but was not affected by stretch. Electron microscopy revealed increased cell cross-sectional area in stretched relative to unstretched veins, and protein contents were greater, as were [(3) H]thymidine and [(3) H]leucine incorporation rates. Growth responses were associated with the activation of stretch-sensitive extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and were inhibited by herbimycin A and PD 98059, inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. The results demonstrate that by culture of whole vascular tissue, smooth muscle cells are maintained in the contractile phenotype and respond to stretch with a physiological adaptation involving hypertrophy/hyperplasia and remodeling of the contractile system, similar to that in vivo. Mechanical stimulation and growth factors are both required for functionally significant growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the two-aisled houses of Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age has been scarce in the Norwegian archaeological record. After {{the introduction of the}} large-scale <b>mechanical</b> topsoil <b>stripping</b> method in Norway in the 1980 ’ies, more and more traces of the oldest prehistoric houses are revealed. This article looks into the two-aisled houses of Norway, with main focus on the houses found in the county of Rogaland. Only the houses with traces of the walls are discussed here. The nine two-aisled houses from Rogaland are found at Voll, Rennesøy (1), Talje, Finnøy (1), Jåttå, Stavanger (1), Kvåle, Time (2), Skeie, Stavanger (3) and Røyneberg, Sola (1). Similar houses are also found both in the northwestern and eastern part of the country. The transition to sedentary farming in Neolithic Norway is accompanied by an established two-aisled building construction similar to the contemporaneous two-aisled houses found in Denmark and Sweden. The similarity and simultaneous emergence of these two-aisled constructions over a huge geographic area in Norway indicate mobility and wide contacts between Neolithic Norway and the neighbouring areas. So far the number of two-aisled houses in Norway are very few, both compared to the number of Norwegian Bronze Age and Iron Age houses, and compared to the Danish and Swedish material. In view of the increasing number of Norwegian finds of two-aisled buildings just in the recent years, we will most likely see more of them in the coming years as the archaeological experience for finding them increase...|$|R
