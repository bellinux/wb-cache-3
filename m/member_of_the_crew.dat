5|$|In Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet, {{astronaut}} Thomas David Jones recounts {{his experiences}} studying the Earth {{during his first}} mission with the United States space agency NASA. Jones' space mission lasted eleven days. Jones was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which left Earth in April 1994. The mission was intended to provide the Space Radar Lab {{with a view of}} the planet. By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet. The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees. Another purpose of the mission was to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by carbon monoxide.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> Age <b>of</b> Sail, shore leave {{was often}} abused by <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> {{who took it}} as a prime {{opportunity}} to drink in excess, indulge in other pleasures denied to them aboard the solely masculine ships, and desert. Many captains were forced to take on new <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> to replace <b>the</b> ones lost due to shore leave.|$|R
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at {{the roots of the}} blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E
5|$|On 3October Speedy, while sailing {{once again}} off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships {{coming out of}} Algeciras, gunboats {{apparently}} attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing. Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On Speedys approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. Speedy approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, {{it was impossible to}} get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, Speedy was standing off Europa Point when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the Unity, was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of Speedy, but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the Unity when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. Speedy suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to Tétouan Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of Speedy. When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General Charles O'Hara, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.|$|E
