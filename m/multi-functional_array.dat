40|$|Next {{generation}} 5 G mobile architectures {{will take}} advantage of the millimeter-wave spectrum to deliver unprecedented bandwidth. Concurrently, {{there is a need to}} consolidate numerous disparate allocations into a single, <b>multi-functional</b> <b>array.</b> Existing arrays are either narrow-band, prohibitively expensive or cannot be scaled to these frequencies. In this paper, we present the first ultra-wideband millimeter-wave array to operate across the six 5 G and ISM bands spanning 24 - 71 GHz. Critically, the array is realized using low-cost PCB. The design concept and optimized layout are presented, and fabrication and measurement considerations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} system PALES is described: a <b>multi-functional</b> <b>array</b> antenna in the X {{band with}} broadband beamforming by a Rotman lens. Studies {{that have been}} conducted about possible broadband antenna elements have implied the use of flared-notch antennas (Vivaldi antennas), which are specified in the paper. A short description of the Rotman lens design used is given. The receiver branch of the PALES system, the applied signal model, and different broadband array-processing methods, which {{can be applied to}} the received signals of a multibeam system, are discussed. To separate broadband signals with a small angular separation, the ICA (independent component analysis) method shows superior performance compared to ML (maximum likelihood) estimation, based on superresolution by the STCM (steered covariance matrix) method...|$|E

A method for reducing the coupling across the pin diode switches is explored, yielding a noticeable improvement in the isolation characteristics between ports. Strategic feeding of the patch antenna ports results in significantly improved radiation patterns, making the system suitable for multi-modal <b>multi-functional</b> phased <b>array</b> operations...|$|R
40|$|A novel Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based Multi-User Detector (MUD) is {{designed}} for the synchronous <b>Multi-Functional</b> Antenna <b>Array</b> (MFAA) assisted Multi-Carrier Direct-Sequence Code-Division Multiple-Access (MC DS-CDMA) uplink (UL), which supports both receiver diversity and receiver beamforming. The ACO-based MUD aims for achieving a bit-error-rate (BER) performance approaching that of the optimum maximum likelihood (ML) MUD, without carrying out an exhaustive search of the entire MC DS-CDMA search space constituted by all possible combinations of the received multi-user vectors. We will demonstrate that regardless {{of the number of}} the subcarriers or of the MFAA configuration, the system employing the proposed ACO based MUD is capable of supporting 32 users with the aid of 31 -chip Gold codes used as the T-domain spreading sequence without any significant performance degradation compared to the single-user system. As a further benefit, the number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS) imposed by the proposed ACO-based MUD is a factor of 108 lower than that of the ML MUD. We will also show that at a given increase of the complexity, the MFAA will allow the ACO based MUD to achieve a higher SNR gain than the Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) MC DS-CDMA system.

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Over {{the past}} several decades, {{parasitic}} array antennas {{have been widely used}} in the long distance wireless communications applications due to the simple structure and high gain achievement. Recently, small yet multi-functional antennas have become an increasing demand for modern wireless communications devices. The traditional parasitic array antennas, however, are not suitable for modern wireless systems because of various disadvantages such as single band operation, narrow bandwidth, large physical size, and linear polarized radiation. This thesis examines new designs of <b>multi-functional</b> parasitic <b>array</b> antennas {{to meet the demands of}} current wireless systems. First, as a ground work, designs of compact-sized, multi-band parasitic array antennas with the use of helical-shaped directors are investigated. Then additional functionality, frequency tunability is demonstrated. In addition, electrically small and printable parasitic array antennas with dual bands capability are proposed. Finally, aside from the multi-band antenna, an electrically small, circularly polarized parasitic array antenna is explored...|$|R
40|$|A high {{resolution}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) experimental system called phased <b>array</b> <b>multi-functional</b> imaging radar (PAMIR) is currently under development at FGAN-FHR. This system uses a very high bandwidth and performs a coherent integration along a large synthetic aperture to achieve a very {{high resolution}} {{in the order of}} one decimeter. PAMIR covers a large angular sector and operates in sophisticated modes using multi-channel signal processing. This variety of tasks can be fulfilled only by use of a wideband phased array antenna. The need for a large bandwidth rises a lot of specific problems which have to be solved in conjunction with it. Now the phased array antenna and the system has come to a first stage allowing gathering radar data using a 24 column element array...|$|R
40|$|Networks of {{phased array}} radars are {{generally}} {{able to provide}} better counter stealth target detection and classification. Each radar sensor (or node) generates information which requires transmission to a central authority that is able to evaluate the information. This requires a communications network to be established to allow transmission of information to and from any node. Each radar node is limited by range and degree and relies on {{the formation of a}} multi-hop network to facilitate these transmissions. This paper presents a model whereby the radar beam itself is used in the formation of a multi-hop network. The phased <b>array’s</b> <b>multi-functional</b> nature allows rapid switching between communications and radar function. A model of how the communication system could operate is presented, and an evolutionary optimisation algorithm based upon the concept of Pareto optimality is used for the topological design of the network. Finally, a simulation environment is presented to show the simulated performance of the communication model and designed networks...|$|R
40|$|Reduced-complexity near-maximum-likelihood Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) {{assisted}} Multi-User Detectors (MUDs) {{are proposed}} and investigated. The exhaustive search {{complexity of the}} optimal detection algorithm may be deemed excessive for practical applications. For example, a Space-Time Block Coded (STBC) two transmit assisted K = 32 -user system has to search through the candidate-space for finding the final detection output during 264 times per symbol duration by invoking the Euclidean-distance-calculation of a 64 -element complex-valued vector. Hence, a nearoptimal or near-ML MUDs are {{required in order to}} provide a near-optimal BER performance at a significantly reduced complexity. Specifically, the ACO assisted MUD algorithms proposed are investigated {{in the context of a}} Multi-Carrier DS-CDMA (MC DS-CDMA) system, in a <b>Multi-Functional</b> Antenna <b>Array</b> (MFAA) assisted MC DS-CDMA system and in a STBC aided DS-CDMA system. The ACO assisted MUD algorithm is shown to allow a fully loaded MU system to achieve a near-single user performance, which is similar to that of the classic Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detection algorithm. More quantitatively, when the STBC assisted system support K = 32 users, the complexity imposed by the ACO based MUD algorithm is a fraction of 1 × 10 ? 18 of that of the full search-based optimum MUD. In addition to the hard decision based ACO aided MUD a soft-output MUD was also developed,which was investigated in the context of an STBC assisted DS-CDMA system using a three-stage concatenated, iterative detection aided system. It was demonstrated that the soft-output system is capable of achieving the optimal performance of the Bayesian detection algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is to develop a new type of antenna, called reconfigurable antenna, which can replace multiple antennas required to enhance the effectiveness of a robust communication system. A recongurable antenna integrated with switching elements can dynamically change its properties, namely, frequency of operation, radiation pattern (the three-dimensional coverage of antenna), and polarization (the electrical orientation of the antenna). Depending on the requirement, a single antenna can function as multiple an- tennas, therefore, the name Multi-functional Recongurable Antenna (MRA). United States (US) Public Safety (PS) responders (police, re-ghters, emergency medical services, etc.) can effectively respond to human-made or natural catastrophies if they are equipped with robust communication systems supported by MRA. Wireless implementations of computer accessories (wireless HDMI, wireless storage to external hard-drive, etc.) that require high speed data communication are supported by 60 GHz communications. Equipping these devices with MRA could further increase the speed of communication, thereby resulting in a robust communication. In this work, pin-diodes and Micro Electro Mechanical Switches (MEMS) are integrated on the MRAs to reconfigure (dynamically change) its properties namely frequency and radiation pattern. An MRA capable of operating over 220, 470, 800, 4900 MHz PS bands is designed, manufactured, tested, and characterized. Another MRA capable of changing its radiation pattern over 4. 94 - 4. 99 GHz band is designed, manufactured, tested, and characterized. The design of radiation pattern recongurable MRA and <b>Multi-functional</b> Reconfigurable Antenna <b>Array</b> (MRAA) for 60 GHz communication is also accomplished. The MRAA is designed in order to enhance the MRA 2 ̆ 7 s capability to receive or transmit more power...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2013. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Heiko O. Jacobs. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 84 pages. This thesis focuses on nanomanufacturing processes for the heterogeneous integration of nanomaterials and molecules. We demonstrate and discovered a novel gas phase method to control material flux at specific points on a surface {{which is based}} on the interplay of high mobility gas ions and lower mobility nanoparticles and molecules {{in the presence of a}} patterned substrate. The thesis is divided into two parts describing applications of the discovered process for the localized deposition of (A) metallic and semiconducting particles producing functional nanostructured deposits including multimaterial sensor arrays and nanostructured electrodes for photovoltaic applications and, (B) molecules for gas sensor application demonstrating improved collection efficiencies and sensitivity over previously methods. Section (A) begins with the description of an arc discharge based method to produce a flux of charged nanoparticles (< 5 nm particles Au, Ag, Pt, W, TiO 2, ZnO and Ge) which are characterized using various methods. It then describes a process to locally deposit the charged particles into extended two and three dimensional metallic and semiconducting nanostructured deposits. The thesis describes the use externally-biased electrodes to achieve an electronic shutter to turn ON/OFF the deposition in selected domains. Subsequently it explores and describes the use of patterned dielectrics whereby the patterned dielectrics are charged to define arrays of electrodynamic lenses. Incorporation of these lensing structures was found to enable nanostructured deposits with sub 100 nm lateral resolution. The utility of the discovered processes are demonstrated in two areas. For the first application, semiconducting nanomaterial are sequentially deposited on the same substrate to fabricate a multi-material / <b>multi-functional</b> sensor <b>array</b> on a single substrate in a single deposition process. The process eliminates critical alignment and masking steps and has a higher material efficiency when compared with traditional vapor deposition methods. In the second application, we demonstrate the fabrication of 3 D nanostructured electrodes for photovoltaic application. The second application adjusts the material flux in selected domains to identify nanostructures and device metrics in a combinatorial way. Section (B) applies the process to the localized collection of airborne molecules. The goal was to determine if the process can be scaled to particles with molecular dimensions. This turned out to be the case. As an application we demonstrate enhanced collection efficiencies of molecular species in gas sensor applications. The research recognizes that various nanostructured sensor designs currently aim to achieve or claim single molecular detection by a reduction of the active sensor size. However, a reduction of the sensor size has the negative effect of reducing the capture probability considering the diffusion based analyte transport commonly used. Specifically, we applied the discovered localized programmable electrodynamic precipitation concept to collect, spot, and detect airborne species in an active-matrix array-like fashion. The method is tested using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The process can produce hybrid molecular arrays on a single chip over a broad range of molecular weights including small molecules or large macromolecules. From a gas sensor system point of view it was possible to improved collection efficiencies and sensitivity over previously method...|$|R
40|$|Antenna {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components in wireless systems since signal transmission and reception are conducted through the antenna interface. Therefore, the signal quality is highly affected by the properties of the antenna. Traditional antennas integrated in devices such as laptops or cell phones have fixed radiation properties and can not be changed to adapt to different environments. Thus the performance of thefwhole system will be negatively affected since the antenna will not operate in the optimum status in different environments. To solve this problem, reconfigurable antenna, which can dynamically change its operation frequency, radiation pattern, and polarization, has gained a significant interest recently. Recongurable antennas are considered smart antennas, and can maximize the capacity of the wireless system. This dissertation focuses upon the theoretical analysis and design of smart antennas with recongurable radiation properties. The presented multi-functional reconfigurable antennas (MRAs) are aimed to applications in WLAN (wireless local area network) systems. The theoretical analysis of the MRA was rst investigated to validate the design concept, and then applied for practical applications. The <b>multi-functional</b> recongurable antenna <b>array</b> (MRAA), which is a new class of antenna array, is also created as a linear formation (4 1) of MRA, with theoretical analysis and design of the MRAA fully described. This work developed three MRA(A) s for practical implementation in WLAN systems. The rst design is the MRA operating in 802. 11 b/g band (2. 4 - 2. 5 GHz), with nine beam steering directions in a parasitic layer-based MRA structure. The second is a MRA operating in 802. 11 ac band (5. 17 - 5. 83 GHz) with three beam steering directions in a simplied parasitic layer-based MRA structure. The third is a MRAA extension of the second design. The design process of these MRA(A) s is realized with the joint utilization of electromagnetic (EM) full-wave analysis and multi-objective genetic algorithm. All three MRA(A) designs have been fabricated and measured. The measured and simulated results agree well for both impedance and radiation characteristics. These prototypes can be directly employed in a WLAN system since practical limits have been taken into account with real switches and components implemented. Finally, this dissertation work concludes with plans for future work, which will focus on development of MRA(A) s with dual-frequency operation...|$|R
