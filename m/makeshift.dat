5|$|A {{black-and-white}} photo of Adenhart {{along with his}} name and number {{was added to the}} center field fence at Angel Stadium. A <b>makeshift</b> shrine, dedicated to Adenhart, was established outside the home plate gates to Angel Stadium. The <b>makeshift</b> shrine was maintained by Angels personnel until its removal in December 2009. The Angels do not have any plans to create a permanent memorial.|$|E
5|$|Moe - (Unlockable) Moe {{is one of}} {{the faster}} {{characters}} who relies on fighting dirty. To that end, he carries a lot of <b>makeshift</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's <b>makeshift</b> second opener, but made only one, and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it must be}} so," [...] {{returned}} Captain Carbonel, [...] "but I {{hate the}} idea of <b>makeshifts</b> and having imperfections concealed." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The men I might {{perhaps have}} liked were poor. Father would, no doubt, think it my natural perversity, or our bad luck; but I don't believe in luck. It's {{an excuse for}} weak <b>makeshifts</b> and futilities; one can conquer bad fortune if one is resolute." ...|$|R
5|$|Following the Union {{defeat at}} Bull Run, panicked {{efforts were made}} to {{strengthen}} the forts built by Barnard in order to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. Many of the <b>makeshift</b> trenches and blockhouses that resulted would later be renovated and expanded into permanent defenses surrounding Fort Runyon.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{construction}} of the new $36,000,000 Half Moone Cruise Terminal was completed downtown adjacent to the Nauticus Museum, providing a state-of-the-art permanent structure for various cruise lines and passengers wishing to embark from Norfolk. Previously, <b>makeshift</b> structures were used to embark/disembark passengers, supplies, and crew.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, Montgomery's army disembarked {{from their}} <b>makeshift</b> fleet {{just south of}} St. Jean, and sent out John Brown with a {{detachment}} to block the road going north from the fort to Montreal. A small flotilla of armed boats guarded the river against the possibility of Royal Savage attacking the army as it landed.|$|E
50|$|Bird Feeder: Each {{crew member}} will {{put on a}} chicken suit and grab a mouthful of bird feed and meal worms and deposit it into a tube <b>makeshifted</b> {{in the shape of}} a chick. The team that has the most grams of bird feed wins the challenge. Challenge from the The Inferno.|$|R
25|$|In retirement, Leach {{published}} his memoirs entitled Endure no <b>Makeshifts.</b> He involved himself in several charitable organisations and acted as President of the Sea Cadet Association from 1983 to 1993. He was the Chairman of the Council of the King Edward VII Hospital {{as well as}} being a chairman of the Royal Navy Club of 1765 & 1785 (United 1889).|$|R

5|$|That {{night the}} brigade {{made the first}} attempt to get men of the Polish Parachute Brigade across the Rhine. Under the command of Captain Harry Brown of the brigade's {{engineer}} squadron, fifteen men with a <b>makeshift</b> fleet of six boats, managed to transport fifty-five Poles across the river.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so he was unable to bat in Australia's first innings. In the second innings, Australia's <b>makeshift</b> openers Harvey and Sam Loxton chased down the 122 runs for victory to {{complete}} a 10-wicket win in less than an hour.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{headed to}} Headingley in Leeds for the Fourth Test. Harvey {{came in for}} the injured Barnes, joining Loxton in the middle-order. Brown was not {{recalled}} to join Morris {{at the top of}} the order; instead, Hassett was promoted as a <b>makeshift</b> opener.|$|E
50|$|Now is {{the winter}} of our discontent made glorious summer! Long years of hopes deferred, <b>makeshifts</b> and {{overcrowding}} have made of the proposed new school an elusive will o’the wisp, subject for cynical jest, yet the gleam was pursued and at last shines clearly before us, beacon of the promised land! Moreover, the name of our founder will be retained {{in the title of}} ‘The Johnston Grammar Technical School’.|$|R
60|$|By {{a sudden}} turn of fortune's wheel the three heroines {{of this story}} are brought down from a {{household}} of lavish comfort to meet the incessant cares and worries {{of those who have}} to eke out a very limited income. And the charm of the story lies in the cheery helpfulness of spirit developed in the girls by their changed circumstances; while the author finds a pleasant ending to all their happy <b>makeshifts.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I never realized," [...] said Maud, delightedly, [...] "what a {{strictly}} modern, professional hospital ship Uncle John has made of this, until {{we put it}} to practical use. I am sure it is better than those <b>makeshifts</b> we observed at Calais, and more comfortable than those crowded hospitals on land. Every convenience is at our disposal and if our patients do not recover rapidly {{it will be because}} their condition is desperate." ...|$|R
5|$|The two armies met on {{opposite}} {{banks of the}} River Bug. Yaroslav's forces may have taken position with archers covering the crossing points. Bolesław {{seems to have taken}} his time, allowing his army to rest, and started work on <b>makeshift</b> bridges. The Battle of the River Bug finally occurred around July 23.|$|E
5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a <b>makeshift</b> position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack.|$|E
5|$|A dropship {{delivers}} the {{expedition to the}} surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find <b>makeshift</b> barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt, the sole survivor, who used the extensive ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.|$|E
6000|$|I {{warned him}} that I had no {{experience}} of a lost rudder at sea, and gave him two classical examples of <b>makeshifts</b> out of a text-book. In exchange he described to me a jury-rudder he had invented himself years before, when in command of a 3000-ton steamer. It was, I declare, the cleverest contrivance imaginable. [...] "May be of use to you some day," [...] he concluded. [...] "You will go into steam presently. Everybody goes into steam." ...|$|R
60|$|The Ancestor of this Baireuth Prince Friedrich,--as readers knew once, but doubtless have {{forgotten}} again,--was a Younger Son; and for six generations so it stood: not till the Father of this Friedrich was of good age, and only within these few years, did the Elder branch die out, and the Younger, {{in the person}} of said Father, succeed to Baireuth. Friedrich's Grandfather, as all these progenitors had done, lived poorly, like Cadets, on apanages and <b>makeshifts.</b>|$|R
60|$|There are snug {{chambers}} {{in those}} Inns where the bachelors live, and, for the desolate fellows they pretend to be, {{it is quite}} surprising how well they get on. John was very pathetic {{on the subject of}} his dreary life, and the deplorable <b>makeshifts</b> and apologetic contrivances it involved, but he really seemed to make himself pretty comfortable. His rooms were the perfection of neatness and convenience at any rate; and if he were anything but comfortable, the fault was certainly not theirs.|$|R
5|$|After World War II, {{the vacant}} {{site of the}} former synagogue {{was used as a}} <b>makeshift</b> volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a {{prefabricated}} department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier ideas about a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a <b>makeshift</b> studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} <b>makeshift</b> prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E
50|$|San Mateo Municipal High School was {{converted}} to a National High School under the management of Ms. Juana M. Garrovillas {{who served as the}} principal from 1988-2000. Apparently within her term, she was able to transpire physical improvements of the school facilities {{to meet the demands of}} the growing population. <b>Makeshifts</b> and 2 Ynares buildings were constructed through her consistent follow up at the municipal and provincial offices. Until then, Computer Room, Science Building, H.E. Room and Library were made possible for quality service.|$|R
60|$|The {{contrasting}} of the {{two girls}} was inevitable. Like father like daughter. Mary {{was no more than}} a pale camp-follower of a gorgeous, conquering general. Frederick's thrift had been sorely educated in the matter of clothes. He knew just how expensive Mary's clothes were, yet he could not blind himself to the fact that Polly's vagabond <b>makeshifts,</b> cheap and apparently haphazard, were always all right and far more successful. Her taste was unerring. Her ways with a shawl were inimitable. With a scarf she performed miracles.|$|R
60|$|A {{single family}} {{has no more}} right to build itself a temple of that sort than to erect a Tower of Babel. Such a {{habitation}} is not decent for a mere mortal man. But, after all, I suppose poor Carabas had no choice. Fate put him there as it sent Napoleon to St. Helena. Suppose it had been decreed by Nature that you and I should be Marquises? We wouldn't refuse, I suppose, but take Castle Carabas and all, with debts, duns, and mean <b>makeshifts,</b> and shabby pride, and swindling magnificence.|$|R
5|$|Among other memorials: {{when the}} Safeway store reopened after the shooting, the staff erected a <b>makeshift</b> memorial; at the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Giffords' intern, Daniel Hernandez Jr., was {{accompanied}} {{onto the field}} by {{the families of the}} shooting victims, and threw the ceremonial first pitch; and for the 2011 State of the Union Address, Senator Mark Udall of Colorado proposed that members of both houses sit together regardless of party, with one seat left empty in honor of Giffords.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the well}} {{can still be}} seen locked inside a red-brick {{enclosure}} with a steel gate, and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building. Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a <b>makeshift</b> shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E
5|$|Back at his apartment, Willard {{creates a}} <b>makeshift</b> sex object, which the duck eats. Shortly after, Willard discovers that Duck is a she, and has sex with her. The {{following}} morning, Willard and the duck go to Willard's job, where Willard has sex with his female boss and quits his job shortly after. Willard and the duck leave, {{and the movie}} ends with Willard saying that Duck was a good duck after all.|$|E
60|$|Everybody {{knew now}} how poor the Old Lady really was. She let slip all the jealously guarded secrets of her existence, except her old love for Leslie Gray. Even in {{delirium}} something sealed her lips as to that. But all else came out--her anguish over her unfashionable attire, her pitiful <b>makeshifts</b> and contrivances, her humiliation over wearing unfashionable dresses and paying only five cents where every other Sewing Circle member paid ten. The kindly women who waited on her {{listened to her}} with tear-filled eyes, and repented of their harsh judgments in the past.|$|R
60|$|It was misspelled; it was unpunctuated; it {{was almost}} illegible; it was fretful in tone, and selfish in sentiment. It was not, I fear, even {{original}} {{in the story of}} its woes. It was the harsh recital of poverty, of suspicion, of mean <b>makeshifts</b> and compromises, of low pains and lower longings, of sorrows that were degrading, of a grief that was pitiable. Yet it was sincere in a certain kind of vague yearning for the presence of the degraded man to whom it was written,--an affection that was more like a confused instinct than a sentiment.|$|R
5|$|Stevens {{played a}} major part in {{the passage of the}} Legal Tender Act of 1862, when {{for the first time the}} United States issued {{currency}} backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early <b>makeshifts</b> to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short. In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, that required that banks limit their currency issues to the amount of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century, until supplanted by the Federal Reserve System in 1913.|$|R
