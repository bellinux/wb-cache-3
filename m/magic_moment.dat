2500|$|Easterbrook {{has written}} three novels: This <b>Magic</b> <b>Moment</b> (1986), The Here and Now (2002) and The Leading Indicators (2012). [...] This <b>Magic</b> <b>Moment</b> {{is a love}} story {{as well as a}} {{philosophical}} work about the meaning of life. The second novel (The Here and Now) was called [...] "moving" [...] by both the New York Times Book Review and the Los Angeles Times, and tells a [...] "satisfying tale of disillusionment and redemption" [...] in the opinion of the San Francisco Chronicle. [...] According to Kirkus Reviews, The Leading Indicators provides social commentary in the form of literary fiction, filtering [...] "leveraged buyouts, derivatives marketing and multimillion-dollar CEO bonuses through the lens of one … family." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band soon {{recorded}} a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement {{and handed it}} to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis, and had also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, [...] "Raised in the City", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. [...] "If I've ever had a <b>magic</b> <b>moment</b> in my life, it was popping that tape in", said Jesperson. [...] "I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode".|$|E

60|$|They {{were all}} in the major's {{workroom}} before Allan had the chance of trying a more attractive subject. There, {{on the top of a}} rough wooden case, which evidently contained the machinery, was the wonderful clock. The dial was crowned by a glass pedestal placed on rock-work in carved ebony; and on the top of the pedestal sat the inevitable figure of Time, with his everlasting scythe in his hand. Below the dial was a little platform, and at either end of it rose two miniature sentry-boxes, with closed doors. Externally, this was all that appeared, until the <b>magic</b> <b>moment</b> came when the clock struck twelve noon.|$|E
