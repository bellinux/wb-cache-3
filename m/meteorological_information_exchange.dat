40|$|PurposeClimate change affects {{human health}} and calls for health {{meteorological}} services. The {{purpose of this study}} is to find the significant predictors for the demands of the health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> MethodsThis study used a descriptive design through structured self-report questionnaires. Data from 956 participants who were at least 18 years old and living in Busan, Korea, were collected from June 1 to July 31, 2009. The data was analyzed using a decision tree method, one of the data mining techniques by SAS 9. 1 and Enterprise Miner 4. 3 program. ResultsTwo hundred and ninety participants (30. 3 %) demanded the information, and 505 of them (52. 8 %) perceived the necessity of health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> From the decision tree method, the predictors related to the demands of the health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> were determined as “the perception of the necessity of health meteorological information,” “the coping to the weather warnings” and “the importance of the weather forecasting in daily life. ” In Particular, the significant different variables in the perception of the necessity of health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> were “female,” “aged over 40 ” and “environmental diseases. ” Thus, the model derived in this study is considered for explaining and predicting the demands of health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> ConclusionsIt can be effectively used as a reference model for future studies and is a suggested direction in health <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> service and policy development. We suggest health forecasting as a nursing service and a primary health care network for healthier and more comfortable life...|$|R

40|$|<b>Meteorological</b> <b>information</b> has obvious spatial-temporal characteristics. Although it is {{meaningful}} {{to employ a}} geographic information system (GIS) to visualize and analyze the <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> for better identification and forecasting of meteorological weather so as to reduce the meteorological disaster loss, modeling <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> based on a GIS is still difficult because meteorological elements generally have no stable shape or clear boundary. To date, there are still few GIS models that can satisfy the requirements of both meteorological visualization and analysis. In this article, a spatial lattice model based on sampling particles is proposed to support both the representation and analysis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> In this model, a spatial sampling particle {{is regarded as the}} basic element that contains the <b>meteorological</b> <b>information,</b> and the location where the particle is placed with the time mark. The location information is generally represented using a point. As these points can be extended to a surface in two dimensions and a voxel in three dimensions, if these surfaces and voxels can occupy a certain space, then this space can be represented using these spatial sampling particles with their point locations and <b>meteorological</b> <b>information.</b> In this case, the full meteorological space can then be represented by arranging numerous particles with their point locations in a certain structure and resolution, i. e., the spatial lattice model, and extended at a higher resolution when necessary. For practical use, the meteorological space is logically classified into three types of spaces, namely the projection surface space, curved surface space, and stereoscopic space, and application-oriented spatial lattice models with different organization forms of spatial sampling particles are designed to support the representation, inquiry, and analysis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>information</b> within the three types of surfaces. Cases studies are conducted by (1) performing a visualization of radar data that is used to describe the reflectivity factor of a raindrop and the pressure field information acquired from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and (2) taking cutting analysis as another example where advanced meteorological analysis is performed. The results show that the proposed spatial lattice model can contribute to the feasible and effective analysis of <b>meteorological</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> are required to enhance supply chain performance.
