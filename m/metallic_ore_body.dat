40|$|Hydrothermal {{circulation}} at the crests of mid-ocean ridges {{plays an}} important role in transferring heat from the interior of the Earth 1, 2, 3. A consequence of this hydrothermal circulation is the formation of <b>metallic</b> <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> known as volcanic-associated massive sulphide deposits. Such deposits, preserved on land, were important sources of copper for ancient civilizations and continue to provide a significant source of base metals (for example, copper and zinc) 4, 5, 6. Here we present results from Ocean Drilling Program Leg 169, which drilled through a massive sulphide deposit on the northern Juan de Fuca spreading centre and penetrated the hydrothermal feeder zone through which the metal-rich fluids reached the sea floor. We found that the style of feeder-zone mineralization changes with depth in response to changes in the pore pressure of the hydrothermal fluids and discovered a stratified zone of high-grade copper-rich replacement mineralization below the massive sulphide deposit. This copper-rich zone represents a type of mineralization not previously observed below sea-floor deposits, and may provide new targets for land-based mineral exploration...|$|R
30|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>ore</b> minerals, such as {{iron and}} copper sulphides, can produce high {{electrical}} conductivity (100 ohm-m) at mid-crustal depths, while they often occur in discrete <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> and also disseminated {{over a large}} volume (Li et al., 2003). A large-scale mineral deposit would probably produce detectable gravity and magnetic anomalies. However, {{in the absence of}} evidence for the occurrence of such large-scale mineral deposits in the study area, we can rule out this factor as a reason for the high electrical conductivity in the NSL zone.|$|R

Geologists and engineers drill core samples and conduct surface surveys searching for specific compounds and ores. For example, a mining engineer and geologist may target <b>metallic</b> <b>ores</b> such as galena for lead or chalcopyrite for copper. A mining engineer may also search for a non-metal such as phosphate, quartz, or coal.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in the detecting of <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> in tropical environments is the discrimination between iron-rich surfaces, originated from the supergenic alteration of the sulphides (gossans), and generic lateritic crusts, also rich in iron, however, unrelated to <b>metallic</b> <b>ores.</b> This paper aims to integrate plan-altimetric, magnetometric and multispectral remote sensing data (i. e., Landsat- 7 ETM+) in a GIS environment, in order to decrease the ambiguity involved in mapping of genuine gossans and to incorporate new tools to the prospecting of sulphides bodies. The results achieved in this work suggest that the areas that simultaneously comprise spectral iron anomalies and both magnetic and topographic highs {{are directly related to}} Pb-Zn occurrences documented in the region.

Lode gold <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> at Renco Mine, in the Limpopo Belt, Zimbabwe, occur as siliceous breccias and mylonites within amphibolite facies shear zones that dip either gently or steeply. The {{two sets of}} <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> formed synchronously from hydrothermal fluids. The <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> are oblate, but have well-defined long axes. Larger <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> are more oblate. High-grade gold ore shoots have long axes that plunge down dip; this direction is perpendicular to the long axes of the low-grade <b>ore</b> <b>bodies.</b> The centres of the high-grade <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> align within the low-grade <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> along strike in both gently and steeply dipping groups. The range of sizes and shapes of the <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> are interpreted as a growth sequence. Geometrical models are proposed for the gently and steeply dipping <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> in which individual <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> grow with long axes plunging down dip, and merge to form larger, more oblate <b>ore</b> <b>bodies.</b> The models show that when three or more <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> coalesce, the long axis of the merged <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> is perpendicular to the component <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> and that <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> in the deposit may {{have a range of}} shapes due to both growth of individual <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> and their coalescence. The long axes of the high-grade <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> are parallel to the shear directions of both the gently and steeply dipping dip slip shear zones, which were the directions of greatest permeability and fluid flow.

50|$|The Bouguer {{anomalies}} {{usually are}} negative {{in the mountains}} because they involve reducing out the attraction of the mountain mass, by about 100 milligals per kilometre of mountain height. In large mountain areas, they are even more negative than this because of isostasy: the rock density of the mountain roots is lower, compared with the surrounding earth's mantle, causing a further gravity deficit. Typical anomalies in the Central Alps are ‚àí150 milligals (‚àí1.5 mm/s¬≤). Rather local anomalies are used in applied geophysics: if they are positive, this may indicate <b>metallic</b> <b>ores.</b> At scales between entire mountain ranges and <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> Bouguer anomalies may indicate rock types. For example, the northeast-southwest trending high across central New Jersey (see figure) represents a graben of Triassic age largely filled with dense basalts. Salt domes are typically expressed in gravity maps as lows, because salt has a low density compared to the rocks the dome intrudes. Anomalies can help to distinguish sedimentary basins whose fill differs in density {{from that of the}} surrounding region - see Gravity Anomalies of Britain and Ireland for example.|$|R
40|$|With a {{focus on}} bronze {{production}} in the south-central Andes during the Middle Horizon, this study reports the first archaeological use of lead isotope analysis to investigate <b>metallic</b> <b>ores</b> and metal artifacts in the Andean zone of South America. Because {{the vast majority of}} metal deposits in the Andean cordillera formed in a convergent plate boundary setting, lead isotope compositions of most Andean ore sources are not unique. Lead isotope ratios of central and south-central Andean ores define four geographically distinct ore lead isotope provinces, oriented and elongated parallel or sub-parallel to the trend of the Andean cordilleras. Consequently, ore lead isotope ratios vary strongly from west to east along transects through the coast, highlands, and altiplano, but they exhibit much less variation from north to south. The strong west-to-east variation in ore lead isotope signatures allows discrimination between <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> and ultimately between metal artifacts, as a function of macro-ecozone location: coast, junga-qiswa, puna, and altiplano. We present the most up-to-date database of ore lead isotope signatures for the south-central Andes including those determined for ores we sampled over an approximate 250, 000 -km[superscript 2] region within Bolivia, northern Chile, and northwest Argentina. Lead isotope signatures of Cu-As-Ni bronze artifacts from Tiwanaku (altiplano capital) and San Pedro de Atacama (desert oasis entrep√¥t) establish that altiplano and high sierra <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> provided the metal for both assemblages.
