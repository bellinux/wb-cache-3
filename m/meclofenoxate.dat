5000|$|In elderly patients, <b>meclofenoxate</b> {{has been}} found {{clinically}} to improve memory, have a mentally stimulating effect, and improve general cognition. [...] <b>Meclofenoxate</b> also increases cellular membrane phospholipids. Although <b>meclofenoxate</b> is {{generally considered to be}} a dietary supplement, in some European countries, such as Germany, Hungary, and Austria, as well as Japan, it is a prescription drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meclofenoxate,</b> {{as well as}} DMAE, {{have been}} found to {{increase}} the lifespans of mice by 30-50%, and thus may be anti-aging drugs/supplements.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Lucidril, <b>meclofenoxate</b> {{has also been}} marketed under the brand names Amipolen, Analux, Brenal, Cellative, Centrophenoxin, Cerebron, Cerutil, Closete, Helfergin, Lucidryl, Lutiaron, Marucotol, Proserout, Proseryl, and Ropoxyl.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meclofenoxate</b> (INN, BAN) (brand name Lucidril), {{also known}} as centrophenoxine, is a {{cholinergic}} nootropic used as a dietary supplement and drug {{in the treatment of}} symptoms of senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease. It is an ester of dimethylethanolamine (DMAE) and 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (pCPA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Meclofenoxate</b> is {{considered}} to be very safe and high in tolerability. However, possible side effects may include, rarely, insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, muscle tremor, depression, nausea, muscle tension, and headache; these side effects may be due to overdosage and may indicate the need for the dosage to be reduced.|$|E

Alkoclar has won the case againist Sopharma; a reputable Bulgarian pharmaceutical company and lawfully forced the company to cease <b>meclofenoxate</b> production.|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{study of the}} effects of <b>meclofenoxate</b> on memory performance of fit, able, elderly subjects was carried out. A number of performance measures, designed to measure various aspects of memory function were employed. These revealed that <b>meclofenoxate</b> appears to increase the consolidation of new information into long-term memory, but does not affect other aspects of remembering. It was also found that significantly more of the subjects receiving <b>meclofenoxate</b> reported an increased level of mental alertness...|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} {{investigating}} {{the role that}} phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) content plays in modulating the solubility of the Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. One enzyme that synthesizes PE is the conserved enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd 1 /yeast; PSD- 1 /worms), which is lodged in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We previously found that decreasing the level of PE due to knockdown of Psd 1 /psd- 1 affects the homeostasis of α-syn in vivo. In S. cerevisiae, the co-occurrence of low PE and α-syn in psd 1 Δ cells triggers mitochondrial defects, stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, misprocessing of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, and a 3 -fold {{increase in the level}} of α-syn. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify drugs that rescue this phenotype. We screened the Prestwick library of 1121 Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs using psd 1 Δ + α-syn cells and identified cyclosporin A, <b>meclofenoxate</b> hydrochloride, and sulfaphenazole as putative protective compounds. The protective activity of these drugs was corroborated using C. elegans in which α-syn is expressed specifically in the dopaminergic neurons, with psd- 1 depleted by RNAi. Worm populations were examined for dopaminergic neuron survival following psd- 1 knockdown. Exposure to cyclosporine, <b>meclofenoxate,</b> and sulfaphenazole significantly enhanced survival at day 7 in α-syn-expressing worm populations whereby 50 - 55 % of the populations displayed normal neurons, compared to only 10 - 15 % of untreated animals. We also found that all three drugs rescued worms expressing α-syn in dopaminergic neurons that were deficient in the phospholipid cardiolipin following cardiolipin synthase (crls- 1) depletion by RNAi. We discuss how these drugs might block α-syn pathology in dopaminergic neurons...|$|E
40|$|A novel voltammetric sensor {{based on}} gold {{nanoparticles}} (GNPs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) composite was developed. The nanocomposite modified electrode was characterized using atoms force microscope (AFM). The electrochemical behavior of <b>meclofenoxate</b> hydrochloride (MFX) was investigated on this sensor. The {{results indicated that}} the GNPs/SWNTs modified electrode exhibited efficient electrocatalytic oxidation for MFX with relatively high sensitivity, and stability. Using square wave voltammetry (SWV), the GNPs/SWNTs modified electrode exhibited a linear voltammetric response for MFX in the concentration range of 5. 0 × 10 – 7 – 2. 0 × 10 – 5 mol·L– 1 , with the limit of detection (LOD) of 1. 0 × 10 – 7 mol·L– 1 . The sensor was applied to determine MFX in finished drug with a satisfactory result...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} cholinergic drugs {{in the treatment of}} neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) by a systematic review of the literature on the following agents: choline, lecithin, physostigmine, tacrine, 7 -methoxyacridine, ipidacrine, galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, arecoline, RS 86, xanomeline, cevimeline, deanol, and <b>meclofenoxate.</b> All relevant randomized controlled trials, without any language or year limitations, were obtained from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group 2 ̆ 7 s Register of Trials. Trials were classified according to their methodological quality. For binary and continuous data, relative risks (RR) and weighted or standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated, respectively. Eleven trials with a total of 261 randomized patients were included in the meta-analysis. Cholinergic drugs showed a minor trend for improvement of tardive dyskinesia symptoms, but results were not statistically significant (RR 0. 84, 95...|$|E
40|$|Procaine, adiphenine, drofenine, nafronyl, tetracaine, and <b>meclofenoxate</b> {{and their}} {{degradation}} products {{were separated by}} reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Spherisorb ODS 2 columns (125 or 350 x 4 mm). The mobile phase {{was a mixture of}} acetonitrile or methanol and a buffer solution (pH= 4. 5) of sodium acetate (0. 02 M) and acetic acid. Seven amines with different chemical structures were added respectively into the buffer solution in order to modify the peak tailing and retention behavior of the compounds analyzed. Significant improvement in peak shape and retention time of basic drugs was observed by adding some amines, while in the case of their degradated acids these properties were not modified. Triethylamine was chosen to analyze all the pharmaceuticals studied in this work except for drofenine where di-n-butylamine appeared the best amine...|$|E
