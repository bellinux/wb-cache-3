2500|$|Class 2 {{capacitors}} {{are made}} of ferroelectric materials such as barium titanate (...) and suitable additives such as aluminium silicate, <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate</b> and aluminium oxide. These ceramics have high to very high permittivity (200 to 14,000), which depends on the field strength. Hence the capacitance value of class 2 capacitors is nonlinear. It depends on temperature and voltage applied. Additionally class 2 capacitors age over time.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Okuchi {{obtained}} magnetite {{and iron}} hydride by reacting <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate,</b> magnesium oxide, silica and water with metallic iron in a diamond cell at 2000 C. [...] Okuchi argues {{that most of}} the hydrogen accreted to Earth should have dissolved into the primeval magma ocean; and if the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} magma was 7.5 GPa or more, then almost all of that hydrogen would have reacted with iron to form the hydride, which then would have sunk to the core where it would be stabilized by the increased pressure. Moreover, it appears that at those pressures iron binds hydrogen in preference to carbon.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicates</b> as {{sintering}} promoters in porcelain stoneware tiles {{was investigated}} {{in order to understand}} their effect on technological properties and firing behaviour. Three formulations were designed, replacing sodic feldspar with 3 % wt talc or chlorite in a reference porcelain stoneware body, and experimented at a laboratory scale simulating the industrial tilemaking cycle. The occurrence of <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicates</b> does not affect the technological properties of semi-finished products, but it influences remarkably the firing behaviour. Bodies containing talc or chlorite exhibit a faster densification kinetics, with slightly larger firing shrinkages, due to their larger amount of glassy phase, which appears to be less viscous than the reference one. On the other hand, the addition of <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicates</b> brings about a slightly lower bulk density, basically due to a larger amount of closed porosity, being water absorption negligible over 1160 ?C. Notwithstanding the different porosity, porcelain stoneware bodies containing talc or chlorite present just a moderate decrease of mechanical strength...|$|R

5000|$|Excellerator is a {{co-product}} of downstream {{stainless steel}} furnace slag that undergoes proprietary aging processes, fine grind pulverizing, and extensive metal separation to remove impurities.

50|$|Natural {{formation}} of MgH happens in stars, brown dwarfs, and large planets, where {{the temperature is}} high enough. The reaction that produces it is either 2Mg + H2 → 2MgH or Mg + H → MgH. Decomposition is by the reverse process. Formation requires the presence of magnesium gas. The amount of magnesium gas is greatly reduced in cool stars by its extraction in clouds of enstatite, a <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate.</b> Otherwise in these stars, below any <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate</b> clouds where the temperature is hotter, the concentration of MgH {{is proportional to the}} square root of the pressure, and concentration of magnesium, and 10−4236/T.

A 1931 paper published the absolute magnitude, based on observations to date, as 9.24, slightly {{brighter than the}} present value of 9.45. Ganymed is an S-type asteroid, meaning that it is relatively reflective and composed of iron and <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicates.</b> Spectral measurements put Ganymed in the S (VI) spectral subtype, indicating a surface rich in orthopyroxenes, and possibly metals (although if metals are present they are covered and not readily apparent in the spectra).|$|R
50|$|Additional studies, {{conducted}} with lasers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{and at the}} OMEGA laboratory at the University of Rochester show that the magnesium-silicate internal regions of the planet would undergo phase changes under the immense pressures and temperatures of a super-Earth planet, and that the different phases of this liquid <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate</b> would separate into layers.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{minerals}} and mineral-like materials reversibly bind CO2. [...] Most often, these minerals are oxides, {{and often the}} CO2 is bound as carbonate. Carbon dioxide reacts with quicklime (calcium oxide) to form limestone (calcium carbonate), in a process called carbonate looping. Other minerals include serpentinite, a <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydroxide, and olivine. Molecular sieves also function in this capacity.|$|E
50|$|The above {{effects are}} typical of attack by {{solutions}} of sodium sulfate or potassium sulfate. Solutions containing magnesium sulfate are generally more aggressive, for the same concentration. This is because magnesium also takes part in the reactions, replacing calcium in the solid phases {{with the formation of}} brucite (magnesium hydroxide) and <b>magnesium</b> <b>silicate</b> hydrates. The displaced calcium precipitates mainly as gypsum.|$|E
