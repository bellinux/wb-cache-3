The general research {{purpose of the}} present study is to investigate the communicative strategies individuals use to maintain exclusively Internet-based friendships and the extent to which cultural, relational and channel-related factors may affect the use of these strategies. A total of 136 Chinese Internet users and 134 American Internet users completed an online survey that measured <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> that they used for sustaining a friendship that they had developed on the Internet, their online friendship relational experience (relational and partner certainty and relational equity), and communication channel-related variables (perceived social presence of the Internet and anticipation of face-to-face interactions in the near future). Participants were also asked to think of an offline “real-life” friendship and to answer questions about relational <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> used for sustaining this friendship. The results suggested that overall people use more prosocial relational <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> in their offline friendships than in their online friendship. However, this pattern was moderated by friendship status. The gap of frequencies of relational <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> in online and offline friendships was particularly large for casual friendships. With regard to antisocial <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies,</b> participants reported more coercion/criticism in offline friendships but more deception in online friendships. Consistent with the prior findings concerning cultural variations in relational maintenance, the current study found that the American participants more frequently used prosocial <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> than did the Chinese participants in both online and offline friendships. On the other hand, the Chinese participants were more likely to use all types antisocial <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> than their American counterparts in both online and offline friendships. The result of the current study confirmed that varied degrees of relational uncertainty and relational equity are associated with the use of relational <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies.</b> The findings also indicated the impact of communication channel-related factors on online friendship <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies.</b> In sum, the findings of this cross-cultural study lent credence to the view that meaningful relationships are maintained via CMC.

40|$|The {{approaches}} to the system reliability evaluation {{with respect to the}} cases, where the components are independent or the components have interactive relationships within the system, were proposed in this paper. Starting from the higher requirements on system operational safety and economy, the reliability focused optimal models of multiobjective <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> were built. For safety-critical systems, the pessimistic <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> are usually taken, and, in these cases, the system reliability evaluation has also to be tackled pessimistically. For safety-uncritical systems, the optimistic <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> were usually taken, and, in these circumstances, the system reliability evaluation had also to be tackled optimistically, respectively. Besides, the reasonable <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> and their corresponding reliability evaluation can be obtained through the convex combination of the above two cases. With a high-speed train system as the example background, the proposed method is verified by combining the actual failure data with the maintenance data. Results demonstrate that the proposed study can provide a new system reliability calculation method and solution to select and optimize the multiobjective operational strategies with the considerations of system safety and economical requirements. The theoretical basis is also provided for scientifically estimating the reliability of a high-speed train system and formulating reasonable <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R

In the last decades, an increased awareness {{of the impact of}} human living on the environment has emerged in the world. The importance of developing renewable energy is today highly recognized and energy policies have been adopted towards this development. Wind energy has been the strongest growing renewable source of energy this last decade. Wind power is now developing offshore where sites are available and benefits from strong and steady wind. However, the initial investments are larger than onshore, and operation and maintenance costs may be substantially higher due to transportation costs for maintenance and accessibility constrained by the weather. Operational costs can be significantly reduced by optimizing decisions for <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> and <b>maintenance</b> planning. This is especially important for offshore wind power systems to reduce the high economic risks related to the uncertainties on the accessibility and reliability of wind turbines.

5000|$|Maintaining the {{relationship}} between superior and subordinate will differ greatly, depending on {{the expectations of the}} individual parties. Some will settle for nothing less than a close friendship with their superior, others may be just focused on maintaining a professional relationship, while those may not get along with their superiors may be focused on just maintaining a civil relationship. The unusual relationship between superior and subordinates requires specific maintenance strategies since some typical ones, like avoidance, are unacceptable. There are four common types of relationship maintenance strategies for this variation of relationship. First there are informal interactions, such as joking and non-work related conversations that emphasize creating a friendship. There are also formal interactions, such as politeness and respect for the superior's authority, that help to create a professional superior-subordinate relationship.

50|$|Reliability {{needs to}} be {{evaluated}} and improved related to both availability {{and the cost of}} ownership (due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks etc.). Often a trade-off is needed between the two. There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership. Testability of a system should also be addressed in the availability plan as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategy</b> can influence the reliability of a system (e.g. by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability. So, Maintainability and Maintenance strategies influences the availability of a system. In theory this can be almost unlimited if one would be able to always repair any fault in an infinitely short time. This is in practice impossible. Repair-ability is always limited due to testability, manpower and logistic considerations. Reliability is not limited (Reliable items can be made that outlast the life of a machine with almost 100% certainty). For high levels of system availability (e.g. the availability of engine trust in an aircraft), the use of redundancy may be the only option. Refer to reliability engineering.|$|E
50|$|The nymphs {{emerge in}} large numbers about the same time, {{sometimes}} more than 1.5 million individuals per acre (>370/m²). Their mass emergence is a survival trait called predator satiation: {{for the first week}} after emergence, the periodical cicadas are an easy prey for reptiles, birds, squirrels, cats, and other small and large mammals. Early ideas maintained that the cicadas' overall survival mechanism was simply to overwhelm predators by their sheer numbers, ensuring the survival of most of the individuals. The emergence period of large prime numbers (13 and 17 years) was hypothesized to be a predator avoidance strategy adopted to eliminate the possibility of potential predators receiving periodic population boosts by synchronizing their own generations to divisors of the cicada emergence period. Another viewpoint holds that the prime-numbered developmental times represent an adaptation to prevent hybridization between broods with different cycles during a period of heavy selection pressure brought on by isolated and lowered populations during Pleistocene glacial stadia, and that predator satiation is a short-term <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategy.</b> This hypothesis was subsequently supported through a series of mathematical models, and stands as the most widely accepted explanation of the unusually lengthy and mathematically precise immature period of these insects. The length of the cycle was hypothesized to be controlled by a single gene locus, with the 13-year cycle dominant to the 17-year one, but this interpretation remains controversial and unexplored at the DNA level.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reliability}} program plan {{may also}} be used to evaluate and improve availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability & maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability. Maintainability estimates (repair rates) are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, they are likely to dominate the availability calculation (prediction uncertainty problem), even when maintainability levels are very high. When reliability is not under control, more complicated issues may arise, like manpower (maintainers / customer service capability) shortages, spare part availability, logistic delays, lack of repair facilities, extensive retro-fit and complex configuration management costs, and others. The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the [...] "domino effect" [...] of maintenance-induced failures after repairs. Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough. If failures are prevented, none of the other issues are of any importance, and therefore reliability is generally regarded as {{the most important part of}} availability. Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks, etc. But, as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered, TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers' personal bodily risks. Often a trade-off is needed between the two. There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership. Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan, as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategy</b> can influence the reliability of a system (e.g., by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.|$|E

40|$|The {{aging of}} bridges and traffic volume {{increase}} result in deterioration of bridge conditions and consequently increased risks to bridges and users. Highway {{agencies in the}} United States face challenges {{because of lack of}} sufficient resources to maintain bridges in good conditions. Current bridge management practices use cost as the main factor for determining <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> for bridges. Bridge management methods that identify bridges based on risk considerations and produce cost-effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> are needed to best utilize limited resources for reducing risks associated with bridge conditions. This dissertation proposes and demonstrates a methodology for defining bridge <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> based on risks associated with conditions of bridge elements and costs needed to improve these conditions. The methodology is a systematic approach for assessing risks to bridge elements based on their failure probabilities and consequences and managing associated risks using cost-effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies.</b> The proposed methodology defines maintenance scenarios, optimal policies that minimize cost of maintenance and risks to elements, and optimal timing for implementing or deferring maintenance policies. The element-level maintenance policies in the proposed methodology are integrated with bridge-level priority ranking to define practical <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> for an inventory of bridges. The bridges are prioritized for maintenance according to their risk values and risk-reduction effectiveness of their maintenance policies based on benefit-cost analysis. The proposed methodology builds on existing bridge management methods, and allows for the use of risks associated with bridge conditions to assist in making risk-informed decisions for allocating limited resources for cost-effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>strategies</b> of bridges most in need. The study showed that risk is a viable tool for managing the maintenance of bridges in a cost-effective manner.
