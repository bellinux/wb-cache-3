2500|$|Another {{drive was}} the [...] "bi-polar" [...] system, {{in which the}} <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> was the axle itself, the frame and field {{assembly}} of the motor being attached to the truck (bogie) in a fixed position. The motor had two field poles, which allowed {{a limited amount of}} vertical movement of the armature. This system was of limited value since the power output of each motor was limited. The EP-2 bi-polar electrics used by the Milwaukee Road compensated for this problem by using a large number of powered axles.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{important}} factor when traction motors are designed or specified is operational speed. The <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> has a maximum safe rotating speed {{at or below}} which the windings will stay safely in place.|$|E
50|$|When braking, {{the motor}} fields are {{connected}} across either the main traction generator (diesel-electric locomotive) or the supply (electric locomotive) and the <b>motor</b> <b>armatures</b> are connected across either the brake grids or supply line. The rolling locomotive wheels turn the <b>motor</b> <b>armatures,</b> {{and if the}} motor fields are now excited, the motors will act as generators.|$|R
50|$|During braking, the {{traction}} motor connections are altered {{to turn them}} into electrical generators. The motor fields are connected across the main traction generator (MG) and the <b>motor</b> <b>armatures</b> are connected across the load. The MG now excites the motor fields. The rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the <b>motor</b> <b>armatures,</b> and the <b>motors</b> act as generators, either sending the generated current through onboard resistors (dynamic braking) or back into the supply (regenerative braking). Compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes, braking with the {{traction motor}}s can be regulated faster improving the performance of wheel slide protection.|$|R
50|$|For a given {{direction}} of travel, current {{flow through the}} <b>motor</b> <b>armatures</b> during braking will be opposite to that during motoring. Therefore, the motor exerts torque {{in a direction that}} is opposite from the rolling direction.|$|R
50|$|To {{translate}} {{this model}} to a rotating motor, one can simply attribute an arbitrary diameter to the <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> e.g. 2 meters and assume for simplicity that all {{force is applied}} at the outer perimeter of the rotor, giving 1 meter of leverage.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{overload}} protection relays measure motor current and can estimate motor winding temperature using a [...] "thermal model" [...] of the <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> {{system that can}} be set to provide more accurate motor protection. Some motor protection relays include temperature detector inputs for direct measurement from a thermocouple or resistance thermometer sensor embedded in the winding.|$|E
5000|$|As {{traction}} motors use a reduction gear setup to transfer torque from the <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> to the driven axle, the actual load {{placed on the}} motor varies with the gear ratio. Otherwise [...] "identical" [...] {{traction motors}} can have significantly different load rating. A traction motor geared for freight use with a low gear ratio will safely produce higher torque at the wheels {{for a longer period}} at the same current level because the lower gears give the motor more mechanical advantage.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum speed}} of an EF-1 as built was 35 mph. Higher speeds led to {{excessive}} {{strain on the}} traction <b>motor</b> <b>armatures.</b> The rebuilding programme of the 1950s raised this to 45 mph to help maintain faster schedules.|$|R
2500|$|Dynamic braking takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} traction <b>motor</b> <b>armatures</b> are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a generator by separately exciting the field winding. [...] When dynamic braking is utilized, the traction control circuits are configured as follows: ...|$|R

50|$|Figure A. shows a {{cross-sectional}} {{view of a}} two pole DC shunt <b>motor.</b> <b>Armature</b> windings (A), field windings (F) and compensation windings (C) use the dot and cross convention where a circle with a dot is a wire carrying current out of the figure and a circle with a cross is a wire carrying current into the page. For each wire in the armature that is next to the field pole face plate there is a wire in the face plate carrying current in the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|In {{the design}} of the Lynch <b>motor</b> <b>armature,</b> the iron {{laminations}} are made from individual thin rectangular pieces slotted together to form a full circular ring. Because magnetic flux passes sideways through the laminations along one axis only, it is possible to use grain-oriented material normally used in large transformers. This has much better magnetic properties along the grain orientation but worse properties in other directions. In a traditional electric motor it gives little or no benefit, but in the Lynch motor leads to higher efficiencies.|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, {{the source}} of the energy {{dissipated}} in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction <b>motor</b> <b>armatures.</b> [...] Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake. [...] As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16km/h (10mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and axles.|$|R

5000|$|Having {{already found}} {{success with the}} world's first main line {{electrification}} project in Baltimore in 1895, ALCO and General Electric were tasked with designing a new locomotive for the project with Alco building the engine and GE supplying the electrical equipment. The initial prototype locomotive, delivered as Class L #6000, was in the 1-D-1 configuration with 4 gearless [...] "bi-polar" [...] type traction motors which used the axle shaft as the <b>motor</b> <b>armature.</b> Between October 1904 and July 1906 #6000 racked up 50,000 miles in test on a track near both Alco and GE plants in Schenectady, New York.|$|E
5000|$|Direct-drive {{turntables}} {{drive the}} platter directly without utilizing intermediate wheels, belts, or gears {{as part of}} a drive train. The platter functions as a <b>motor</b> <b>armature.</b> This requires good engineering, with advanced electronics for acceleration and speed control. Matsushita's Technics division introduced the first commercially successful direct drive platter, model SP10, in 1969, which was joined by the Technics SL-1200 turntable, in 1972. Its updated model, SL-1200MK2, released in 1978, had a stronger motor, a convenient pitch control slider for beatmatching and a stylus illuminator, which made it the long-standing favourite among disc jockeys (see [...] "Turntablism"). By the beginnings of the 80s, lowering of costs in microcontroller electronics made direct drive turntables more affordable.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the Lynch <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> is {{significantly}} different compared to other types of motor. The armature coils are formed from insulated copper strips each in a 'U' shape (like a tuning fork). One leg is then bent 45 degrees clockwise, while the other leg is bent 45 degrees anticlockwise. Each coil leg contains several bends before reaching {{the outside of the}} armature to be able to pass radially through the ferrite ring before the ends finish 90 degree apart. At the outer edge each copper strip has a crimp forming an electrical connection to its companion 90 degrees rotated. The inner edge of the copper strips have the insulation removed on the front face only, to form the commutator surface where the brushes make contact.|$|E
5000|$|Not all series wound motors operate well on AC current.If an {{ordinary}} series wound DC motor {{were connected to}} an AC supply, it would run very poorly. The universal motor is modified in several ways to allow for proper AC supply operation. There is a compensating winding typically added, along with laminated pole pieces, {{as opposed to the}} solid pole pieces found in DC motors. [...] A universal <b>motor's</b> <b>armature</b> typically has far more coils and plates than a DC motor, and hence fewer windings per coil. This reduces the inductance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} control of an integrated direct-drive joint suitable for applications that require a high-precision motion control system. The joint integrates a directdrive synchronous motor with axial air gap, a torque sensor, and a high-resolution position sensor. The key design aspects of the integrated joint, like the <b>motor’s</b> <b>armature,</b> cooling system, <b>motor</b> housing, bearing arrangement, sensors, and power electronics are detailed. We also present a number of advanced implementations in motor torque control, optimal joint torque sensory feedback, and motion control using positive joint torque feedback. Experimental results illustrate an outstanding performance regarding thermal response, torque ripple, reference trajectory tracking, torque disturbance rejection, and joint stiffness...|$|R
25|$|A {{commutator}} is {{a mechanism}} used to switch {{the input of}} most DC machines and certain AC machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated {{from each other and}} from the electric motor's shaft. The <b>motor's</b> <b>armature</b> current is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole. In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of significant advances {{in the past few decades}} due to improved technologies in electronic controller, sensorless control, induction motor, and permanent magnet motor fields, electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors.|$|R
50|$|To {{avoid using}} frame-mounted motors and jackshafts, some {{designers}} {{decided to use}} axle-mounted motors, driving each wheel directly, with the axle forming the spindle of not only the wheels, but also the <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> itself. This obviously simple system had been used before, but only for low-powered locomotives with lightweight motors. As the wheels and axle, {{and in this case}} the motor too, are unsprung by the suspension, any extra weight here would lead to poor riding qualities. To permit its use for high-horsepower locomotives, the motor was split in two. The armature was formed as part of the axle, but the much heavier field poles and coils were carried on the suspended frame of the locomotive. This setup managed to produce acceptable quality.|$|E
50|$|The most {{remarkable}} mechanical improvement was arguably the traction motors {{used on the}} new locomotives. They were known as bipolar motors, because each of the locomotive's 12 motors had only two field poles, mounted directly to the locomotive frame beside the axle. The <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> was mounted directly on the axle, providing an entirely gearless design. This design was almost entirely noiseless, as it eliminated not only gear tooth growl, but also the whine of higher-RPM electric motors typically used in standard nose-mounted applications. The EP-2s were not the first electric locomotives to use bipolar motors, which had first been designed by Asa F. Batchelder for the New York Central S-motors over a decade earlier, {{but at the time}} they were the largest.|$|E
50|$|On 16 April, S-32 set {{a course}} for Dutch Harbor. On 20 April, she arrived and {{commenced}} refit. On 4 May, she again sailed west. En route to the Kurils, she patrolled across possible Japanese reinforcement routes to Kiska and Attu, but almost zero visibility during the passage hindered hunting. On 12 May, she entered her assigned area off Paramushiro. The next day, she obtained her first fix, off Onekotan, and commenced patrolling across the approaches to Onekotan Strait and Musashi Wan. Visibility remained poor; seas were rough. Her radar, which {{had gone out of}} commission on 11 May, functioned improperly throughout her short time on station. On 15 May, the port main <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> developed a zero resistance to ground. Repeated repair attempts failed, and the motor was secured. S-32 turned back toward Unalaska and moored at Dutch Harbor on 23 May.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{locomotive}} accelerates, the now-rotating <b>motor</b> <b>armatures</b> {{will start to}} generate a counter-electromotive force (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose {{the output of the}} main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, {{the locomotive}} will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as [...] "transition," [...] a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{principal}} conducted EMI(electromagnetic interferences) sources of low voltage DC (direct current) motors is the commutation occurring during rotation. In this paper the small-signal impedance of low voltage DC motors under different functioning modes, including the dynamic one is studied over a large frequency range [0 Hz - 200 MHz]. Different test benches inspired from military and European standards (MIL-STD) have been set up. The measurements were performed on the <b>motor’s</b> <b>armature,</b> on the DC motor under static mode and during idle rotation. The setups provided repeatable and precise impedance results. They also highlight {{the impact of the}} stator and suppression filters in the low frequency range. The role of the parasitic inductances and capacitances in the high frequency range is also pointed out. The results were compared with those of other measurement techniques...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} an electric motor winding and, more particularly, to a three phase <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> winding arrangement designed to reduce motor vibration and improve efficiency. An individual phase winding arrangement having a sixty electrical degree phase belt width for use with a three phase <b>motor</b> <b>armature</b> includes a delta connected phase winding portion and a wye connected phase winding portion.

50|$|Each {{of the two}} {{propellers}} on {{the submarine}} is connected to a 3000-BHP DC electric motor. Each motor is designed with two separate armatures, in effect two motors in the same unit. Speed of the submarine can be varied by connecting the batteries and armatures in different series and parallel combinations. Slowest speed is obtained by connecting both batteries in parallel, thus supplying 440 V, across all four <b>motor</b> <b>armatures</b> in series, thus applying 110 V to each ('shafts in series'). Next, the batteries in parallel may be applied across the two motors in parallel, with their armatures in series ('group down'). This applies 220 V across each armature. Third, both batteries are applied in parallel across all four armatures applying 440 V to each ('group up'). Finally, the batteries can be arranged in series so as to apply 880 V across all four armatures in parallel ('batteries in series'). Each armature also has an associated field winding which is separately supplied with current which may be varied resistively, providing further speed control (maximum 35 A).|$|R
