500|$|Wright was {{prompted}} {{to publish the}} book after two incidents of his text, which had been prepared some years earlier, being used without attribution. He had allowed his table of <b>meridional</b> <b>parts</b> {{to be published by}} Thomas Blundeville in his Exercises (1594) and in William Barlow's The Navigator's Supply (1597), although only Blundeville acknowledged Wright by name. However, an experienced navigator, believed to be Abraham Kendall, borrowed a draft of Wright's manuscript and, unknown to him, made a copy of it which he took on Sir Francis Drake's 1595 expedition to the West Indies. In 1596 Kendall died at sea. The copy of Wright's work in his possession was brought back to London and wrongly believed to be by Kendall, until the Earl of Cumberland passed it to Wright and he recognised it as his work. Also around this time, the Dutch cartographer Jodocus Hondius borrowed Wright's draft manuscript for a short time after promising not to publish its contents without his permission. However, Hondius then employed Wright's calculations without acknowledging him for several regional maps and in his world map published in Amsterdam in 1597. This map {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Christian Knight Map" [...] for its engraving of a Christian knight battling sin, the flesh and the Devil. Although Hondius sent Wright a letter containing a faint apology, Wright condemned Hondius's deceit and greed in the preface to Certaine Errors. He wryly commented: [...] "But the way how this [...] should be done, I learned neither of Mercator, nor of any man els. And in that point I wish I had beene as wise as he in keeping it more charily to myself".|$|E

40|$|The Late Cretaceous {{continental}} {{deposits of}} the Sierra Perenchiza Formation in the Chera Basin, Eastern Iberian Ranges, Spain, {{have produced a}} rich aquatic and terrestrial vertebrate assemblage, mainly dominated by dinosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. Recent screen-washing campaigns also yielded a particularly diverse microvertebrate fauna composed of fishes, squamates and amphibians. The amphibian remains include several fragmentary albanerpetontid dentaries and fossils from two different anuran taxa: a discoglossid and a pelobatid. The taxa collected and the sedimentological traits of the sediments suggest a swamp or lacustrine palaeoenvironment located in a coastal area. The amphibians are typical Laurasian taxa, like those of other Late Maastrichtian Iberian localities reflecting a similar palaeoenvironment. This record provides important information on the biodiversity of amphibians in the <b>meridional</b> <b>part</b> of the Iberoarmorican realm throughout the CampanianeMaastrichtian transition...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to develop and {{validate}} a computational methodology for the prediction of the unsteady aerodynamics aircraft-engine fan-bypass configurations, with par-ticular emphasis on the extraction of data for input to noise-prediction methodologies. The Reynolds-averaged Navie-Stokes equations with a 7 -equation Reynolds-stress model are solved on a multiblock structured computational grid. Time-integration is implicit O(∆t 2) based on a dual-time-stepping subiterative procedure. Space discretization uses WENO 3 reconstruction. The flow is discretized on a single blade-passage per blade-row, using chorochronic periodicity con-ditions. Unsteady nonreflecting boundary-conditions are used at the inflow and outflow bound-aries. The particular issue of separating the boundary-conditions to a time-average <b>meridional</b> <b>part,</b> which fixes the operating point, and to a pitchwise-and-time-varying part, which is treated with a quasi-nonreflecting is examined in detail. Computational examples are presented for a typical fan/bypass configuration. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe AE {{indices are}} {{generally}} used for monitoring {{the level of}} magnetic activity in the auroral oval region. In some cases, however, the oval is either so expanded or contracted that the latitudinal coverage of the AE magnetometer chain is not adequate. Then, a longitudinal chain in the key region would give more information of the real situation, but, of course, only during some limited UT-period. In order {{to find out the}} UT coverage of a single meridional chain, we have compared the global AL and AU indices with corresponding local indices determined using data from the <b>meridional</b> <b>part</b> of the EISCAT Magnetometer Cross during the years 1985 ? 1987. A statistical study shows that the local indices are close (within relative error of 0. 2) to the global AU and AL during periods 1500 ? 2000 UT (~ 1730 ? 2230 MLT) and 2130 ? 0130 UT (~ 0000 ? 0400 MLT), respectively. In the middle of these optimal MLT-sectors the EISCAT Cross sees more than 70 % of the cases when the global AE chain records activity. Then, also the correlation between the local and global indices is generally good (> 0. 7). Thus we conclude that five to six evenly located meridional chains are needed for covering all the UT-periods. On the other hand, already the combination of IMAGE, CANOPUS, and the Greenland chains catches ~ 50 % of the substorms. Case-studies show that usually during 2130 ? 1100 UT the AL achieved from these chains reproduces the real AL with good timing, although it does not follow all transient variations...|$|R

50|$|The Walker circulation, {{also known}} as the Walker cell, is a {{conceptual}} model of the air flow in the tropics in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). According to this model, parcels of air follow a closed circulation in the zonal and vertical directions. This circulation, which is roughly consistent with observations, is caused by differences in heat distribution between ocean and land. It was discovered by Gilbert Walker. In addition to motions in the zonal and vertical direction the tropical atmosphere also has considerable motion in the <b>meridional</b> direction as <b>part</b> of, for example, the Hadley Circulation.|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of the stratospheric wave driving during northern winter is often quantified by the Jan. -Feb. mean poleward eddy heat flux at 100 hPa, averaged over 40 Deg- 80 Deg N (or a similar area and period). Despite the dynamical and chem. relevance of the wave driving, the causes for its variability are still not well understood. In this study, ERA- 40 reanal. data for the period 1979 - 2002 are used to examine several factors that significantly affect the interannual variability of the wave driving. The total poleward heat flux at 100 hPa is poorly correlated with that in the troposphere, suggesting a decoupling between 100 hPa and the troposphere. However, the individual zonal wave- 1 and wave- 2 contributions to the wave driving at 100 hPa do exhibit a significant coupling with the troposphere, predominantly their stationary components. The stationary wave- 1 contribution to the total wave driving significantly depends on the latitude of the stationary wave- 1 source in the troposphere. The results suggest that this dependence is assocd. with the varying ability of stationary wave- 1 activity to enter the tropospheric waveguide at mid-latitudes. The wave driving anomalies are sepd. into three parts: one part due to anomalies in the zonal correlation coeff. between the eddy temp. and eddy <b>meridional</b> wind, another <b>part</b> due to anomalies in the zonal eddy temp. amplitude, and a third part due to anomalies in the zonal eddy meridional wind amplitude. It is found that year-to-year variability in the zonal correlation coeff. between the eddy temp. and the eddy meridional wind is the most dominant factor in explaining the year-to-year variability of the poleward eddy heat flux...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} of the stratospheric wave driving during northern winter is often quantified by the January&ndash;February mean poleward eddy heat flux at 100 hPa, averaged over 40 &deg;&ndash; 80 &deg; N (or a similar area and period). Despite the dynamical and chemical relevance of the wave driving, the causes for its variability are still not well understood. In this study, 45 years of ERA- 40 reanalysis data are used to examine several factors that significantly affect the interannual variability of the wave driving. The total poleward heat flux at 100 hPa is poorly correlated with that in the troposphere, suggesting a decoupling between 100 hPa and the troposphere. However, the individual zonal wave- 1 and wave- 2 contributions to the wave driving at 100 hPa do exhibit a significant coupling with the troposphere, predominantly due to their stationary components. The stationary wave- 1 contribution to the total wave driving significantly depends on the latitude of the stationary wave- 1 source in the troposphere. The results suggest that this dependence {{is associated with the}} varying ability of stationary wave- 1 activity to enter the tropospheric waveguide at mid- to subpolar latitudes. If composites of strong and weak wave-driving years are compared, we find significantly higher refractive index values in the midlatitude stratosphere for the strong composite than for the weak composite. Since wave activity tends to propagate towards higher refractive index values, this could explain part of the interannual variability of the wave driving. Finally, an alternative approach is taken, in which the wave driving anomalies are separated into three parts: one part due to anomalies in the zonal correlation between the eddy temperature and eddy <b>meridional</b> wind, another <b>part</b> due to anomalies in the zonal eddy temperature amplitude, and a third part due to anomalies in the zonal eddy meridional wind amplitude.
