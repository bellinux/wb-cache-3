50|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that every fact that {{increases}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> sentence or minimum mandatory sentence must be named in the charging instrument, submitted to a jury, and proved {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} - whether or not statutory law labels that fact as an element of the offense or a sentencing factor. The only exception is the fact of prior conviction, which may be found by a judge. Because the relevant <b>maximum</b> is the <b>authorized</b> sentences that arises from the fact of conviction alone, without additional fact-finding, this principle invalidates mandatory sentencing guidelines that are the equivalent of increasing the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> sentence.|$|R
