[...] Despite some hesitancy from Fox's lawyers, the show got in contact with NBC executive producer Tom Fontana, who was more than willing to allow the use of Belzer: Gilligan later described Fontana as a [...] "great guy" [...] for assistance in the matter. The episode also features the first reappearance of X, who had been murdered in the season four opener [...] "Herrenvolk". The idea to bring back X was thought up by executive producer John Shiban, who helped Gilligan storyboard the episode. He noted, [...] "we had the board set up and [...] and there was a piece missing and we just couldn't come up with a how to get out of this situation, why doesn't this assassin just kill The Lone Gunmen? It was a flashback story and it was in 1989 and we were pacing around in <b>my</b> <b>backyard,</b> and [...] I just turned to him and said, 'X! [...] X has another agenda! X is the assassin, it's not some other character, it's our X. [...] He wouldn't kill the Gunmen, 'cause he's trying to help Mulder.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Sito {{mentioned}} that Joe Grant contributed heavily towards the film, {{as he was}} the creator of Redfeather, Meeko, and Flit. Redfeather was a wise-cracking turkey planning to be voiced by John Candy, and Percy, who was to be voiced by Richard E. Grant, was revised to become mute. Following the death of John Candy in March 1994, co-screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co-wrote for Pocahontas, and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime instead of talking. Joe Grant stated Redfeather [...] "had comic potential–he thought he was handsome, a lady's man. When we decided he couldn't talk, and, having no hands, he couldn't mime..." [...] Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair-braiding raccoon, in which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors [...] "loved the idea and {{got rid of the}} turkey character." [...] Likewise, according to Sito, Meeko was created because they were [...] "naturally enigmatic, because they have little hands and a little mask over their face like a thief." [...] Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird where [...] "I have hummingbirds all over <b>my</b> <b>backyard,</b> [...] I thought, 'That's a great animal to animate.'" [...] According to the directors, Governor Ratcliffe's pampered pet, Percy, was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went.|$|E

Suddenly I thought I’ve been wasting my time trying to like hardcore punk and here’s this thing that was in <b>my</b> own <b>backyard</b> that I was totally unaware of. From there on I started looking for more bands like that. Then you get into The Cramps and all of these other things that kind of ride that line, that are really good, gritty rock‘n’roll, but are also on the outside of culture, like punk. So that was a real eye opener. I continued to hunt records in thrift stores and junk shops." [...] http://turnit-down.blogspot.com/2009/07/greg-cartwright-interview-reigning.html ...|$|R

40|$|Zimbabwe is Big Mammal {{country and}} most zoological {{research}} has concentrated, disproportionately, on this group. Research on invertebrates has emphasized, correctly, pests of medical, veterinary and agricultural importance. A handful of eminent entomologists, such as Dr G. Arnold and Dr E.

The {{high number of}} unknown animal species, even in <b>my</b> own <b>backyard</b> in Highlands, Harare (the focus of my natural history studies) surprised me.

40|$|From the introduction] In a few sentences, my artist {{statement}} {{is that my}} religious faith {{is an important part}} of who I am as a person and as an artist.

My goal is to make a lasting legacy as a gift to try to make the world a better place and show its beauty. [ [...] . ] The overall composition of my body of art can be described as a multi-studio artist with a focus on spiritual positive encouraging works. As an older student I have had formal training in Art, history drawing, design, and stain glass sculpting, sculpting glass, and painting glass on glass. For my career here at Pacific University I concentrated my focus on photography. I began seeing beauty in photographing nature in <b>my</b> own <b>backyard</b> beauty in seeing art in the landscapes. It began out of coping with and separate the destruction left on the land by capturing lighter beautiful living subjects. It helped that I had some past photographic relationships on the land where I live. Photographing wilderness landscapes and portraits were something entirely new to me. So I studied the subject and my mentors shared their knowledge. I was willing to learn from making mistakes in once-in-a-lifetime shots.

40|$|It {{has been}} a long journey, with much learned that is not {{contained}} in these pages. At every turn, I am deeply indebted. Here, I mention only a few. The idea for this dissertation did not fit a mold, and my committee provided invaluable guidance in formulating questions and pursuits in ways that allowed them to bear meaningful fruit.

Thanks are due to Hyman Bass for his patience, in particular when I have jumped too quickly and thought too recklessly, and for modeling graciousness in being, care in thinking, and eloquence in expressing oneself. These lessons continue to serve me daily. I am grateful to Alan Taylor for his interest and good will — that he cares about these issues matters more than he would guess.
