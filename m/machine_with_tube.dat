40|$|The epoxy {{samples were}} {{implanted}} with heavy ions such as tungsten (W), gold (Au) and lead (Pb) {{to investigate the}} attenuation characteristics of these composites. Near-surface composition depth profiling of ion-implanted epoxy systems was studied using Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS). The effect of implanted ions on the X-ray attenuation was studied with a general diagnostic X-ray <b>machine</b> <b>with</b> X-ray <b>tube</b> voltages from 40 to 100 kV at constant exposure 10 mAs. Results show that the threshold of implanted ions above which X-ray mass attenuation coefficient, mu(m), of the ion-implanted epoxy composite is distinguishably higher than the mu(m), of the pure epoxy sample is different for W, Au and Pb. © 2012, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Within the {{framework}} of info-computationalism, morphological computation is described as fundamental principle for all natural computation (information processing). Foundations of a New Science of Computation Present computational machinery evolved from mechanical calculators to electronic <b>machines</b> <b>with</b> vacuum <b>tubes</b> and then transistors, and to integrated circuits and eventually microprocessors. During this remarkable development of hardware towards ever smaller, faster and cheaper devices, the computational principles remained unchanged: an isolated machine calculating a function, executing an algorithm. Such machines were adequately represented by the Turing Machine model. However, computational machinery gradually started to change its character from isolated calculators to networked communicating devices. In the 1970 s first networks were created with computers linked together via telecommunications. The emergence of networking involved a changed nature of computers an...|$|R

Frequently, exhibitors would equip many of these <b>machines</b> <b>with</b> listening <b>tubes</b> (acoustic headphones) and array them in [...] "phonograph parlors", allowing the patron to select between multiple records, each played on its own machine. Some machines even contained carousels and other mechanisms for playing multiple records. Most machines were capable of holding only one musical selection, the automation coming from the ability to play that one selection at will. In 1918 Hobart C.

40|$|Samples of acrylic {{and glass}} were {{implanted}} with tungsten (W) and lead (Pb) to investigate their X-ray attenuation characteristics. The near-surface composition depth profiles of ion-implanted acrylic and glass samples were studied using ion-beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy—RBS). The effect of implanted ions on the X-ray attenuation ability was studied using a conventional laboratory X-ray <b>machine</b> <b>with</b> X-ray <b>tube</b> voltages ranging from 40 to 100 kV at constant exposure 10 mAs. The results {{were compared with}} previous work on ion-implanted epoxy. As predicted, the RBS results and X-ray attenuation for both ion-implanted acrylic and glass increase {{with the type of}} implanted ions when compared to the controls. However, since the glass is denser than epoxy or acrylic, it has provided the higher X-ray attenuation property and higher RBS ion concentration implanted with a shorter range of the ion depth profile when compared to epoxy and acrylic. A prolonged time is necessary for implanting acrylic with a very high nominal dose to minimize a high possibility of acrylic to melt during the process...|$|R

At the ogive and rear ends are threaded openings used to the install the shell's filler and hold the fuzes. Around the tube near the base is a copper alloy ring called the Rotating Band. This band has a diameter larger than the bore, and when the projectile and powder case are rammed into the chamber, the band is jammed into the grooves of the bore's rifling. It forms a gas seal between the projectile and the bore. Also, as the projectile travels down the barrel, the band grips the rifling to impart spin to the projectile.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{problems}} of {{the design of the}} portable x-ray devices for the works under the field conditions is to get smallest possible weight and the overall sizes. The classical apparatuses, which contain thermo-emission X-ray tube and source of constant high voltage as a rule have weight about 15 - 30 kg, which strongly impedes their use in the nonstationary conditions. In the proposed work are described pulse X-ray <b>machines</b> containing <b>tube</b> <b>with</b> the cold cathode on the base of explosive electron emission. It explains the essence of explosive electron emission and the basic principles of the construction of the pulse X-ray emitters containing the cold cathode tube and the source of its power, capable to form the pulses of high voltage with an amplitude of 100 - 300 kV and with the duration of 10 - 9 s. Specifically with this duration and this voltage appears the effect of explosive electron emission, which is accompanied by the intensive flash of X-radiation.
