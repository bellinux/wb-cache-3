40|$|Abstract:- The dynamic working {{environment}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>workforces</b> attracts {{the use of}} multi-agent systems in supporting mobile business processes. An agent's autonomy, sociality and intelligence are highly prized features {{when it comes to}} supporting those mobile workers who are geographically isolated from the main knowledge source (i. e. the corporate Intranet) and are frequently moving from one location to another. This paper proposes desirable metrics for any multi-agent systems platform intended for enterprise mobilisation use, and evaluates currently available multi-agent platforms for mobile devices based on the identified metrics. This paper also identifies some improvement points of currently available multi-agent platforms as an enterprise mobilisation platform.

40|$|One of the {{obstacles}} preventing the widespread adoption of multi-agent systems in industry is the difficulty of implementing heterogeneous interactions among participating agents via asynchronous messages. This difficulty arises from the {{need to understand how}} to combine elements of various content languages, ontologies, and interaction protocols in order to construct meaningful and appropriate messages. In this paper mPower, a component-based layered framework for easing the development of multi-agent systems, is described, and the facility for customising the components for reuse in similar domains is explained. The framework builds on the JADE-LEAP platform, which provides a homogeneous layer over diverse operating systems and hardware devices, and allows ubiquitous deployment of applications built on multi-agent systems both in wired and wireless environments. The use of the framework to develop mPower mobile, a multi-agent system to support <b>mobile</b> <b>workforces,</b> is reported. ...|$|R
