40|$|Abstract. Common {{components}} {{for some of}} the optical diagnostic for ITER have been designed and developed. The design of the front-end optics has been optimized paying special attention to the selection of materials and to an arrangement of each component, and by analyzing the heat deposition. The effect of thermal deformation to the optical properties such as the measured position and the resolving power is also estimated by using an optical design code. Results indicate that mirrors can be cooled by thermal conduction using <b>mirror</b> <b>holders</b> made of high thermal conductivity materials such as copper alloy. By using many uniformly spaced cooling channels on the mounting module the effect of thermal deformation to the optical properties can be made small. A shutter is designed for installation in the mounting module. An irradiation test of the bearing is necessary and the mockup testing for endurance in the high vacuum and high temperature environment are required. In order to extend the measured area toroidally a micro lens array has been introduced and a mockup test carried out. The result indicates that the micro lens array is effective to increase the signal without reducing the poloidal resolution. An in-situ calibration method using a newly developed micro retro-reflector array has been developed and a mockup test carried out using prototypes of optical components. The result indicates that the reflected light can be measured but it is necessary to reduce the reflection of the end plate of the optical fiber and the micro lens array. 1...|$|R

40|$|Thermally-induced {{deformations}} of steering mirrors reflecting 100 J/ 10 Hz laser pulses in vacuum {{have been}} analyzed. This deformation {{is caused by}} the thermal stress arisen due to parasitic absorption of 1 kW square-shaped flat-top laser beam in the dielectric multi-layer structure. Deformation depends on amount of absorbed power and geometry of the mirror {{as well as on the}} heat removal scheme. In our calculations, the following percentages of absorption of the incident power have been used: 1 %, 0. 5 % and 0. 1 %. The absorbed power has been considered to be much higher than that expected in reality to assess the worst case scenario. Rectangular and circular mirrors made of zerodur (low thermal expansion glass) were considered for these simulations. The effect of coating layers on induced deformations has been neglected. Induced deformation of the mirror surface can significantly degrade the quality of the laser beam in the beam delivery system. Therefore, the proper design of the cooling scheme for the mirror in order to minimize the deformations is needed. Three possible cooling schemes of the mirror have been investigated. The first one takes advantage of a radiation cooling of the mirror and a copper heatsink fixed to the rear face of the mirror, the second scheme is based on additional heat conduction provided by flexible copper wires connected to the <b>mirror</b> <b>holder,</b> and the last scheme combines two above mentioned methods...|$|E

The development of the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heater (ICRH) with regards to neutronics was discussed. The ICRH went through a number of design stages and shutdown gamma ray dose rates were determined for each stage. It was determined that of all the designs analysed only one of them, the ﬁrst concept design for the internally matched design did not meet the shutdown dose criteria. This was due to a ﬂaw in the system design, brought about by a lack of consideration towards nuclear design. The ITER Light Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system was subjected to a full shutdown nuclear analysis. It was found that the design of the LIDAR system supplied did not meet the ITER required shutdown gamma ray dose rate limit of 100 µSvhr− 1, however use of the MCR 2 S system highlighted the components that contributed most to the shutdown gamma ray dose rate and were shown to be the <b>mirror</b> <b>holder</b> and the laser beam pipe.

40|$|The {{usage of}} polymer as Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) {{actuator}} {{has received a}} great intention due to high elasticity characteristic, hence lower the power consumption [1]. Poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) {{is one of the}} polymers that widely used in MEMS application. This chapter evaluates the suitability of PDMS as MEMS Fabry Perot Optical Tunable Filter (FPOTF) with electrostatic actuator. Poly-dimethly siloxane (PDMS) is commonly used in MEMS fluidic systems. In general, this type of polymer is more robust and high elasticity compared with other semiconductor material such as silicon [1]. Furthermore, PDMS is moderate in terms of temperature and humidity sensitivity as well as consume low processing and preparation cost. These factors make PDMS receive a great intention in many areas of MEMS application. In literature, PDMS as a MEMS actuator have been realized using several actuation methods. One type of sealed PDMS which is parylene-caulked PDMS is used in pneumatic actuator and shown a superior deflection for a given force which is bigger than 5 kPa [2]. High deflection for a small given force shows the suitability of PDMS in MEMS electrostatic actuator. PDMS will reduce the consumption of DC voltage for a same amount of deflection compared with other semiconductor material. In this chapter, PDMS is proposed to be used as electrostatic actuator in MEMS FPOTF.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} method to convert {{computer}} images to a holographic film plate. In the recording process of holographic multi-stereograms, one uses a liquid crystal display (LCD) to show 70 different pictures of a constructed object. These pictures show the object from 70 different positions, and in a sequence the object appears as though turned over the LCD. Each of the pictures is exposed in a different area of the film and the film position is controlled by the holographic printer. The result of this recording process is a 3 -D image of the object with horizontal parallax, constructed from 70 different 2 -D computer pictures. At the start of thesis search for relevant literature was given high priority, where the purpose was to find what kind of optical equipment and quality was needed for these experiments. Most papers recommended the He-Ne laser, silver halide film emulsion and developers like Agfa GP 62 and Kodak D- 19. As for the quality of the optical equipment, mirrors need a flatness of the order of 1 / 10 ⋅λ, and lenses must have minimal aberrations. Before the making of a holographic multi-stereogram, the optical equipment and set-up for recording holograms together with developing process were examined. In order to find a practical favourable method, preliminary holography experiments where carried out. In these experiments, there were practical problems like instability, reflections, depolarisation and exposure. The developing and bleaching processes were also tried out, and gave good results. In order to produce a holographic multi-stereogram, it was necessary to procure some more optical equipment. Some of the equipment was made in the work-shop in the Institute of Physics: - Micrometer screws for the spatial filter. It is possible to change the pinhole from 25 μm to 10 μm. The result is a cleaner laser beam. - New slit on the holographic printer. The angle is larger and the possibility of shadows is reduced. - Micrometer screws on the holographic printers slit. It is possible to adjust the width of the slit easily and precisely to the right size. - Table extension for the optical breadboard, used in the production of reflection and rainbow holograms. - Table holder for breadboard and the table extension. - <b>Mirror</b> <b>holder</b> to transfer laser light from the optical table (lower level) to the breadboard (upper level). - Glass cage mounted on the optical table to protect the equipment from air vibrations. Other optical equipment bought from different companies : 4 34 35 - High quality lenses - Mirrors with flatness 1 / 10 ⋅λ. - Liquid crystal display (LCD). - Optical breadboard. The optical breadboard made it possible to arrange the optical equipment at two levels on the table. This is very practical in the production of holographic multi-stereograms. - High power red He-Ne laser with 24 mW output power. The production of holographic transmission multi-stereogram is time-consuming; the recording time can be 30 minutes and for reflection holograms several hours. Therefore, the laser output power stability must be constant in the exposure of holographic multi-stereogram. The power stability is measured for 2 different periods at different sampling rate, which shows the laser power stability is very good. It is important the laser is sufficiently heated before recording holograms. The heating time must be at least 1 hour. The laser’s coherence length is measured with help of Michelson’s set-up, and is measured to be 30 cm. From the visibility plot the contrast of the hologram will fall from 1 to 0. 8 for 5 cm laser beam path difference. It is very important that the reference and object beam have the same path length. To produce high quality holograms the stability of the laser beam and the optical equipment must be good. Vibrations of the interference fringes on the film plate for more than 1 / 10 ⋅λ reduce the brightness of the hologram. Therefore, the optical equipment’s stability and quality have to be very good to meet this requirement. Several different vibrational measurements have been made on the optical table. The first is made with the glass cage and the second without. The plot shows distinctly that the measurement without the glass cage has higher vibrational amplitude than the measurement with the class cage. A vibrational measurement of the recording process of the holographic multi-stereogram recording is also made. This measurement shows the printer makes a high vibration amplitude when the motor is running, but the optical table is stable 1 - 2 seconds after the motor has stopped. There are no vibrations measured when the shutter moves (open/close). With the use of the printer and the shutter, which is the equipment that moves under the recording process, there are no vibrational problems for the production of holographic multi-stereogram. The thermal stability requirement for the film plate is very high, a change of temperature for more than 0. 1 °K makes reduction of the hologram quality. Several holographic recordings were made: transmission, reflection and rainbow holograms made with 1 -step and 2 -step methods. For all of the recordings made with the 1 -step method, {{it is not possible to}} get rid of the vertical lines from the slit of the printer. With the use of the 2 -step method, where a master hologram is copied onto a new hologram the problem of lines from the slit was solved. From a master transmission holographic multi-stereogram, high quality 2 -step reflection and rainbow holograms were produced. There were also produced 13 reflection holograms of good quality for EPM Consultants, who have co-operated in this thesis work...|$|E

The Hall and the Bathroom, at opposite ends of the long and narrow, windowless pavilion, were open to the world and visible from outside. The Bathroom was probably the part of the installation that received most attention; an open room like a life-size doll’s house. The tiled but roofless room contained all the usual bathroom fittings including a <b>mirror,</b> hooks, toilet-paper <b>holder,</b> lamps. There was water here too, far too much of it in fact, though it did not come just from the taps but seemed to be pushed up from below, from the drains, and to run in all directions from the overflowing vessels: the toilet, the basin and the bathtub. It fizzed and foamed and bubbled up as though from a volcanic spring and heaved itself, indeed it poured itself over everything, just as thick and wet as when one spills a bucket of water onto the floor. Like a torrential flood it hurried across the tiled floor and down over a gently rounded step out into a channel that ended in an opening leading to the depths of the earth. The viewers’smiles of recognition assumed a lingering undertone: what was it that one was really witnessing? The Dining Room, a windowless space in the depths of the installation, was a singularly chilly and dismal room with a lean and lonely, dimly illuminated chandelier above a dreary, oval dining table veneered in some dark wood with a cold chair at each end of the table and the ceiling as oppressively low as in a caravan. The tabletop was covered with something that might have been a sunken sheet of glass but was, in fact, ice. Two dinner settings were frozen solidly into the tabletop. The dark, heavy and wet carpet gave off puffs of frozen breath, a white fuzz that swept slowly across the floor down there in the darkness. There was a tall, fateful looking cupboard in the background, broody with aggression and guilt like a Kienholz tableau. Here there is a painful contrast, depicted in the state of the furniture, between the concept of the Swedish word 'hem' (home) as a metaphor for security and the total negation of this security expressed in the substantivized adjective of this word, 'hemsk' (terrific). Like looking into a hellish relationship where everything is reflected in the state of the furniture. In the Living Room the velvet upholstery was seething. Above the soft pile of the velvet, little clouds of cold steam sailed through the atmosphere like an elfish dance at dawn. Perhaps the furniture was giving off this cold, humid mist because it was so replete; a mist that was like old tobacco smoke in a smoking carriage on a train, or some sort of foam from a fire extinguisher that covered everything like a psychoactive drug, threatening to suffocate or drown it. Perhaps it was merely an abandoned summer room in a garden cottage where the furniture was sweating cold humidity as the snow melted outside. And a rug that was as saturated as only a Wilton rug can be. * Characteristic of several of Meta Isæus-Berlin’s installations is the fact that it is sometimes only after a while that one becomes aware that they are not a part of the room’s ‘normal’ furnishings. It appears as though she has taken something that already exists; which is not the case at all. She has produced a highly conscious stage set but a stage set that seems ‘real’. As public art this has a particularly powerful effect. In Meta Isæus-Berlin’s installations the mental expression of everyday objects – something often overlooked – and the social masque that they form part of emerge clearly alongside their trivial and more practically oriented existence. These intense emotional characteristics can seem like the visual, intricate remains of diffuse memories or else they are the heralds of dark experiences: the items were present themselves, they have been shaped, permeated and animated by a social and mental cosmos (or chaos) which, in due course, has sunk into these things where they continue their lives. Whatever it is, henceforth, that they express and hand on can consist of an entire instrumentarium of items that, quite simply, is experienced as the present, physical ‘reality’. Meta Isæus-Berlin employs these objects as a rich, artistic language with deep roots accumulated in many layers down in our consciousness and our memory. The visual language of the objects is recognizable in our own bodily experiences and it immediately strikes us since the objects speak the same wordless language as that of our bodies. The objects in the installations are, like so-called ‘ordinary’ objects, simultaneously active on a number of different levels. This may be a matter of furnishing items that, in everyday life, are often enslaved by being required to be practical or serviceable aids that are subservient to the arbitrariness of the commissioner and constructor. Such objects can have become fully incorporated into their task and have become deformed accordingly and can, over time, almost completely have lost their memory, that is, other memories. What is specific to her artistic use is that these levels can be presented as simultaneous, indistinguishable. They express, illuminate and reinforce each other. In an everyday context our consciousness of the technical functions often displaces the object’s visual expression so that, on many occasions, we are not conscious of the enormous, latent, visual, expressive force that the objects, as materialized language, can have in our day-dreaming memory and consciousness. The exhibition includes a number of sketches and models for Ett vattenhem and for Återblickens transparens (2004), an installation of delicately transparent furniture made of the thinnest organza; hardly materialized at all. The furniture is suspended on thin wires and it moves in slow motion like gentle sounds, diaphanous clouds; yet with slightly threatening unpredictability. The solidity of the furniture has been dissolved. The items are transparent and weightless like certain very old people whose bodies consist mainly of memories and traces of experience. Meta Isæus-Berlin’s sketches, in their intense simplicity, are as expressive as comic strips. The furniture exhibits a forceful integrity and is animated to such an extent that it becomes almost like pictures of people, of human individuals. Some of these characteristics are also apparent in the large paintings that Meta Isæus-Berlin has produced in the last few years. In several ways they would seem to mark a turning point in her art. A characteristic difference is that while the installations work in the public sphere, the paintings inescapably refer to more private contexts. There is often an obvious narrative and dramatic aspect with human figures that interact very expressively; which may well remind one of Munch’s figures though viewed, perhaps, through the freer composition and use of colour typical of the sixties. I find myself most strongly moved by those aspects of the paintings that have most in common with the installations. Where people, temporarily or permanently, have gone from the room but have left behind them a forceful impression in the objects; these human casts for charged memories that then continue to act out human distress on their own. Consider, for example, the painting Implosion with a room whose narrow set has been taken over by so-called "white goods" to such an extent that there is no floor left. Or the hotel beds all pushed together in some petit-bourgeois logistics in front of an overwhelming arrangement of curtains in Varför gjorde de så? [Why did they do that?] Or the row of furniture covered with cloth like an anaesthetic mask in Förberedelse [Preparations] while the walls and the carpet are drowned by slow trickles of diluted paint...|$|R
