Image matting and compositing are important operations in image editing, photography, and film production. Matting separates a foreground element from an image by estimating a color, F, and an opacity, �, for each foreground pixel. The set of all � values is the alpha matte. Compositing blends the extracted foreground element, F, {{on top of an}} opaque background image, B, using linear blending: I[x;y] ��F � (1 ��) B. Given an image, I, matting solves the inverse problem with seven unknowns (�, Fr, Fg, Fb, Br, Bg, Bb) and three constraint...|$|R
50|$|The {{replacement}} of the hearth roasters with the fluid-bed roaster meant {{that the amount of}} sulfur eliminated from the concentrate during the roasting process increased, raising the copper content ("matte grade") of the reverberatory furnace <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> 33-35% copper to 40-42% copper. This higher matte grade meant that less sulfur per tonne of concentrate treated in the smelter had to be eliminated in the converters, thus raising their effective capacity and allowing higher copper production from the smelter without adding additional converters.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new, simple-to-use and rapid {{approach}} to video matting, {{the process of}} pulling a highquality alpha <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a video sequence. Our approach builds upon techniques in natural image matting, namely spectral matting, and optical flow computation. No additional hardware, despite a single camera, is needed, and only very few and intuitive user interactions are required for foreground estimation. For certain scenes the approach is able to estimate the alpha matte for a video, consisting of up to 102 frames, without any user interaction at all...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for extracting a shadow <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a single image. The removal of shadows from a single image is a {{difficult}} problem to solve unless additional information is available. We use user-supplied hints to solve the problem. The proposed method estimates a fractional shadow matte using a graph cut energy minimization approach. We present a new hierarchical graph cut algorithm that efficiently solves the multi-labeling problems, allowing our approach to run at interactive speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed shadow removal method is demonstrated using various natural images, including aerial photographs. ...|$|R
5000|$|From 1910 to 1920, {{the main}} {{innovations}} in special effects were the improvements on the matte shot by Norman Dawn. With the original matte shot, pieces of cardboard were placed {{to block the}} exposure of the film, which would be exposed later. Dawn combined this technique with the [...] "glass shot." [...] Rather than using cardboard to block {{certain areas of the}} film exposure, Dawn simply painted certain areas black to prevent any <b>light</b> <b>from</b> exposing the film. From the partially exposed film, a single frame is then projected onto an easel, where the matte is then drawn. By creating the <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> an image directly from the film, it became incredibly easy to paint an image with proper respect to scale and perspective (the main flaw of the glass shot). Dawn's technique became the textbook for matte shots due to the natural images it created.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new process, environment matting,which captures {{not just a}} foreground object and its traditional opacity <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a real-world scene, but also a description of how that object refracts and reflects light, which we call an environment matte. The foreground object can then {{be placed in a}} new environment, using environment compositing, where it will refract and reflect <b>light</b> <b>from</b> that scene. Objects captured in this way exhibit not only specular but glossy and translucent effects, as well as selective attenuation and scattering of light according to wavelength. Moreover, the environment compositing process, which can be performed largely with texture mapping operations, is fast enough to run at interactive speeds on a desktop PC. We compare our results to photos of the same objects in real scenes. Applications of this work include the relighting of objects for virtual and augmented reality, more realistic 3 D clip art, and interactive lighting design. CR Catego [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Modified Aspect Ratio is a {{home cinema}} term for the aspect ratio or {{dimensions}} in which a film was modified to fit {{a specific type of}} screen, as opposed to original aspect ratio. Modified aspect ratios are usually either 1.3:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.7:1 aspect ratio. 1.3:1 is the modified aspect ratio used historically in VHS format. A modified aspect ratio transfer is achieved by means of pan and scan or open matte, the latter meaning removing the cinematic <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.3:1 frame. Another name for it is [...] "prescaled" [...] aspect ratio".|$|R
5000|$|Often, it is {{desirable}} to extract two or more <b>mattes</b> <b>from</b> a single image. This process, dubbed [...] "matting" [...] or [...] "pulling a matte," [...] is most commonly used to separate the foreground and background elements of an image, and these images are often individual frames of a video file. Compositing techniques are a relatively simple way of pulling a matte - the foreground from a greensceen scene could be imposed on an arbitrary background scene, for instance. Attempting to matte an image that doesn't use this technique is significantly more difficult. Several algorithms have been designed {{in an effort to}} address this challenge.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} extracting shadows from one natural scene and inserting them into another. We develop physically-based shadow matting and compositing equations and use these to pull a shadow <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a source scene in which the shadow is cast onto an arbitrary planar background. We then acquire the photometric and geometric properties of the target scene by sweeping oriented linear shadows (cast by a straight object) across it. From these shadow scans, we can construct a shadow displacement map without requiring camera or light source calibration. This map can then be used to deform the original shadow matte. We demonstrate our approach for both indoor scenes with controlled lighting and for outdoor scenes using natural lighting...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} extracting an alpha <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a single photograph given a user-defined trimap. A crucial part of this task is the color modeling step where for each pixel the optimal alpha value, together with its confidence, is estimated individually. This forms the data term of the objective function. It comprises of three steps: (i) Collecting a candidate set of potential fore- and background colors; (ii) Selecting high confidence samples from the candidate set; (iii) Estimating a sparsity prior to remove blurry artifacts. We introduce novel ideas {{for each of these}} steps and show that our approach considerably improves over state-of-the-art techniques by evaluating it on a large database of 54 images with known high-quality ground truth. ...|$|R
40|$|Image matting is {{a longstanding}} problem in {{computational}} photography. Although, {{it has been}} studied {{for more than two}} decades, yet there is a challenge of developing an automatic matting algorithm which does not require any human efforts. Most of the state-of-the-art matting algorithms require human intervention in the form of trimap or scribbles to generate the alpha matte form the input image. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient approach to automatically generate the trimap from the input image and make the whole matting process free from human-in-the-loop. We use learning based matting method to generate the <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> the automatically generated trimap. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces good quality trimap which results into accurate matte estimation. We validate our results by replacing the automatically generated trimap by manually created trimap while using the same image matting algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The {{output of}} {{copper-nickel}} <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> the BCL smelter traditionally has exceeded the smelter’s 40,000-metric-ton-per-year (t/yr) design capacity, often {{by more than}} 30%. Despite the adverse effect of cyclical metals prices {{during the past two}} decades and the looming closure of the Selebi-Phikwe Mine, the design capacity of BCL smelter recently was expanded to 60,000 t/yr. In 2005, matte output exceeded the smelter’s new design capacity. Because the BCL smelter might shut down with the closure of the Selebi-Phikwe Mine, LionOre had initiated in 2003 a pilot plant project to evaluate the recovery of copper and nickel from the Phoenix Mine by using Western Minerals Technology Pty. Ltd.’s Activox process. In 2005, a feasibility study of an Activox plant with an output capacity of 25,000 t/yr of nickel was underway. The study was expected to be completed in mid-2006.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to iteratively estimate both high-quality depth map and alpha <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a single image or a video sequence. Scene depth, which is invariant to illumination changes, color similarity and motion ambiguity, provides a natural and robust cue for foreground/background segmentation – a prerequisite for matting. The image mattes, on the other hand, encode rich information near boundaries where either passive or active sensing method performs poorly. We develop a method to combine the complementary nature of scene depth and alpha matte to mutually enhance their qualities. We formulate depth inference as a global optimization problem where information from passive stereo, active range sensor and matte is merged. The depth map is used in turn to enhance the matting. In addition, we extend this approach to video matting by incorporating temporal coherence, which reduces flickering in the composite video. We show that these techniques lead to improved accuracy and robustness for both static and dynamic scenes. 1...|$|R

A coded image that is invisible for human observers is temporally integrated into the projected image, but can be reconstructed by a synchronized camera. The embedded code is dynamically adjusted on the fly to guarantee its non-perceivability and to adapt it to the current camera pose. Linked with real-time flash keying, for instance, this enables in-shot optical tracking using a dynamic multi-resolution marker technique.

From left to right: flash image, no-flash image, recovered alpha matte, and flower basket with new background. In this paper, we propose {{a novel approach}} to extract mattes using a pair of flash/no-flash images. Our approach, which we call flash matting, {{was inspired by the}} simple observation that the most noticeable difference between the flash and no-flash images is the foreground object if the background scene is sufficiently distant. We apply a new matting algorithm called joint Bayesian flash matting to robustly recover the <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> flash/no-flash images, even for scenes in which the foreground and the background are similar or the background is complex. Experimental results involving a variety of complex indoors and outdoors scenes show that it is easy to extract high-quality mattes using an off-the-shelf, flash-equipped camera. We also describe extensions to flash matting for handling more general scenes. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a framework that}} can extract an alpha <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a single image with Fresnel reflection, and that can composite other objects with the image such that plausible reflections are included. Our method handles reflections in a plane with small undulations, for example, a water surface with waves or a glossy tabletop. During the matting stage, our method first estimates the transmission color, which {{is assumed to be}} uniform, and then calculates a reflection image and alpha matte based on user markups. However, accurate extraction of the matte becomes challenging when a plane has small undulations because these create perturbations in the matte. We therefore propose a filter that can refine the matte effectively. In the compositing stage, the reflection of a composited object is synthesized by ray tracing in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through comparisons with ground-truth data and results using natural images as inputs...|$|R
40|$|The extreme {{depletion}} of the Earth’s mantle in sulfur is commonly seen as a signature of metal segregation from Earth’s mantle to Earth’s core. However, in addition to S, the mantle contains other elements as volatile as S that are hardly depleted relative to the lithophile volatility trend although they are potentially as siderophile as sulfur. We report experiments in metal-sulfide–silicate systems {{to show that the}} CI normalized abundances of S, Pb, and Sn in Earth’s mantle cannot be reproduced by element partitioning in Fe ± S–silicate systems, neither at low nor at high pressure. Much of the volatile inventory of the Earth’s mantle must have been added late in the accretion history, when metal melt segregation to the core had become largely inactive. The great depletion in S is attributed to the selective segregation of a late sulfide <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> an oxidized and largely crystalline mantle. Apparently, the volatile abundances of Earth’s mantle are not in redox equilibrium with Earth’s core...|$|R
