All the species show a DNA fingerprint-like pattern using at least one restriction enzyme in combination with each <b>multilocus</b> <b>probe.</b> The number of bands detected {{and the value of}} the index of similarity for each species differ significantly between the profiles obtained with each <b>multilocus</b> <b>probe.</b> Some enzyme/probe combinations reveal strong cross-hybridization of the multilocus probes with satellite or satellite-like DNA sequences in pheasant, peacock, quail and chicken, which partially or completely prevented scoring of the profile. The choice of restriction enzyme was found to influence the number of bands, the value of the index of similarity and the probability of obtaining an identical fingerprint between unrelated individuals. The Mendelian inheritance and independent segregation of the fragments detected using AluI was investigated in three species (ring-necked pheasant, Indian peafowl and red grouse). Some bands were shown to be tightly linked. An extreme case was encountered in the red grouse, where 12 of the 15 bands scored in one parent represented only two, apparently allelic, haplotypes and so derived from a single locus. However, fingerprint patterns will often be adequate for use in paternity analyses, such as in behavioural studies, despite the occurrence of haplotypic sets of bands. Identical DNA multilocus profiles were sometimes observed between captive-bred siblings in one species. These results emphasize the desirability of determining, in each new species, the optimal experimental conditions as a preliminary to any behavioural or population genetic studies that use the multilocus DNA fingerprinting methodology...|$|E

Treated and control cells were seeded in {{the presence or absence}} of 6 -thioguanine to determine mutant frequency and cell survival. From clonal cultures of the same cell populations we isolated a number of clones and grew them up individually to obtain appropriate amounts of DNA. High molecular weight DNA was digested with HinfI or HaeIII and hybridized with 32 P-labelled 33. 15 <b>multilocus</b> <b>probe.</b> The induction of 6 -thioguanine resistant cells depended on the mutagen dose. The highest value of mutant frequency obtained was 7475 x 10 (- 6) (MNNG, 27 microM), corresponding to 0. 7 percent of clonable cells. DNA fingerprint analysis carried on the same treated cells showed that DNA rearrangements occurred at minisatellites much more frequently than in transcribed sequences. UV irradiation produced the highest frequency of variation, modifying minisatellite patterns in about 50 percent of the analyzed clones...|$|E

Despite the number of trials already performed on the quantitation of fetal DNA, data about the amount of DNA at the beginning of pregnancy, in particular in the first trimester, remain limited. A new probe mapping on the deleted in azoospermia (DAZ) repetitive region of the Yq chromosome was designed for an early assessment of fetal DNA concentration in maternal serum. Among 57 pregnant women prospectively studied in their first trimester, fetal DNA was detected already by the 5 th gestational week, with the analysis becoming reliable by the 8 th week of gestation when a 100 % accuracy in fetal sex determination was achieved. Moreover, in the three cases of pregnancy ending in fetal loss, the amount of fetal DNA apparently decreased before the abortion was diagnosed, whereas it consistently showed an increasing trend in normal pregnancies.

40|$|Animals {{from the}} Booroola line of Australian Merino sheep are {{characterized}} by a high ovulation rate that {{can be attributed to}} the presence of a codominant allele (Fec). The specific function of the gene has not been identified. Effective use of the trait within the sheep breeding industry requires one or more genetic markers that can distinguish between alternative alleles at the locus Fec. With a combination of DNA minisatellite markers and polymorphic protein markers, a cluster of seven minisatellite fragments has been identified as being linked to the Fec gene and to the ovine A blood group locus. The minisatellite fragments have been derived from <b>multilocus</b> <b>probes</b> and hence cannot be used to define the chromosomal location of the Fec gene or to serve as diagnostic markers for Fec.

40|$|To {{assess the}} value of DNA {{fingerprints}} for the prediction of heterosis in chickens, retrospective analyses of data from three crossbreeding experiments and DNA fingerprints (DFP) of parental strains were conducted using two minisatellite and one middle-repetitive DNA probes. DFP bands were assessed on pooled DNA samples of 10 - 15 individuals per parental genetic group. The number of DFP bands evaluated in the experiments ranged from 81 to 139. The probes varied in their predictive value, but predictability of heterosis generally increased with multiple probes. Highly significant correlations (0. 68 - 0. 87) between band sharing ratios (SH) and heterosis were found in 25 crosses of White Leghorns in the first egg production cycle for age at sexual maturity, egg production, and mature body weight: traits with heterosis of 10 % {{or more of the}} means. Regressions of SH explained 78. 4 % of the variation in heterosis in age at sexual maturity, 60. 2 % in egg production and 46. 4 % in mature body weight.

Based on DNA fingerprinting with the <b>multilocus</b> <b>probe</b> MGR 586 and single-locus probes, 157 haplotypes clustered into 56 lineages (at >/= 70 % MGR 586 band similarity, each with unique single-locus profiles) and high diversity indices were detected among 458 isolates collected from 29 sites during 1992 - 1995. Most valleys sampled had distinct populations (73 % of the lineages were site specific) with some containing {{one or a few}} lineages, confirming the importance of clonal propagation, and others were very diverse. Widely distributed lineages suggested that migration occurs across the region and into the Indo-Gangetic plains. Repeated sampling at one site, Matli, (170 isolates, 1992 - 1995) yielded 19 lineages and diversity significantly greater than that reported from similar samples from Colombia and the Philippines. Analysis of allelic associations using pairwise comparisons and multilocus variance analysis failed to reject the hypothesis of gametic phase equilibrium. The Matli population shifted from highly diverse in 1992 to almost complete dominance by one lineage in 1995. Such population dynamics are consistent with recombination followed by differential survival of clonal descendants of recombinant progeny. At another site, Ranichauri, population (n = 84) composition changed from 2 to 11 lineages over 2 yr and yielded additional evidence for equilibrium. Sexually fertile and hermaphrodite isolates of both mating types were recovered from rice in both Matli and Ranichauri.

40|$|Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, {{the causal}} agent of potato late blight {{is best known}} for its role in the great Irish famine of 1845 - 1849 which {{resulted}} in the deaths of over 1 million people. Since then, the disease has become established in all potato growing countries and is the most important pathogen of potatoes worldwide. The appearance of resistance to the phenylamide fungicides in the late 1970 ’s indicated that populations of P. infestans were changing. An antiresistance strategy was developed for growers in an effort to reduce the spread of resistant strains. Subsequently the A 2 mating type of the fungus was discovered in 1989 promoting fears that a super strain of the fungus could evolve through sexual reproduction. Populations of the fungus have been monitored from 1981 to 1998 for levels of phenylamide resistance and since 1988 for the A 2 mating type. Physiological race surveys were conducted in 1983 and 1996. Prior to the 1980 s no reliable methods were available for adequate identification of genotypes. Development of molecular markers specific to P. infestans has made this possible and a survey was conducted on isolates from the 1996 population. Results confirm that the anti-resistance strategy for phenylamide based fungicides has been effective in preventing the build up of metalaxyl resistant populations of P. infestans. During the 1990 ’s the distribution of phenylamide resistance has remained stable at about 50 % of crops tested compared to a high of over 80 % in 1981. The level of A 2 in the population has also fallen from a high of 35 % of isolates tested in 1989 to a static level of 3 - 4 % in the 1990 ’s. Physiological race composition has become much more complex since 1983 and 16 different physiological races were found in Ireland in 1996. The population was dominated by race 3. 4. 7. 10. 11 which accounted for over 54 % of isolates tested. This change has taken place without a corresponding change to varieties with a complex Rgene base. Twelve different genotypes of the fungus were uncovered using the <b>multilocus</b> <b>probe</b> RG 57. Races of the fungus were independent of genotype. One particular genotype IE- 2 was predominantly associated with phenylamide resistance. The low population diversity discovered suggests that sexual reproduction between A 1 and A 2 types has not been a major factor in disease epidemiology to date. Super strains similar to those identified in the USA could not be confirmed. The overall level of variation in the Irish isolates of Phytophthora infestans would confirm that the population has become progressively more diverse during the last forty years. However, the population is much less complex than that found in the highland tropics of central Mexico. End of Project ReportTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|E

Many investigators have attempted to study the pathogenesis of hypertension by comparing these strains with their respective normotensive "controls, " the Wistar-Kyoto rat and the Dahl salt-resistant rat However, the genetic relation between each of these hypertensive strains and its corresponding normotensive control has never been clearly defined.

DNA fingerprinting in 43 families of the parthenogenetic lizard species Darevskia armeniaca (131 siblings), using (GACA) 4, (GGCA) 4, (GATA) 4, and (CAC) 5 probes, revealed mutant fingerprints in siblings that differed from their mothers in sev-eral restriction DNA fragments.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{remarkable}} {{advances in}} DNA technologies {{over the past}} two decades have had an enormous impact on human identification, medical diagnosis, population genetics, understanding of evolution of species, wildlife management, characterization and unfolding the mysteries of antiquity of archaic specimens. This article presents an overview of the current technologies in the field of forensic genetics, their evolution and the emerging trends. DNA techniques have opened a new frontier in forensic analysis. Until 1985 all polymorphic immunological and biochemical markers employed to identify biological samples in criminal cases had limited applicability. The way to a new course of events was first paved by the introduction of minisatellites using <b>multilocus</b> <b>probes</b> (MLPs), providing incomparably higher discriminatory power. However, the procedures for multilocus typing were too arduous and required very large amounts of intact DNA which were usually not recovered from the difficult forensic biological specimens. This paved way for initiation of single locus probes (SLPs) in VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) detection analysis. The advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the turning point in the crucial issue of analytical efficiency of the DNA variants in the genome. Since then the field of molecular identification seems to have acquired a virtual unlimited power of analysis allowing experts to address even the most inaccessible sources of DNA. The first PCR amplification based DNA technique used in human identification was the reverse dot blot assay (HLADQA 1 and PM typing), which was followed by short tandem repeat (STR) PCR multiplex analysis.

Mendelian inheritance was confirmed shown {{for two of the}} polymorphic minisatellites. DNA fingerprinting studies of the level of inter- and intra-breed variation did not show any significant difference between the two. Analysis of intra-breed variation in Bedlington Terriers using two polymorphic minisatellites as single-locus probes revealed a significant {{reduction in the number of}} alleles in comparison with an agglomerated population sample, consistent with the high level of inbreeding within this breed. Multi-locus canine minisatellite probe analysis of unrelated species showed that related repeat sequences are present in numerous species. Use of single-locus canine minisatellite probes to analyse related canids suggested that polymorphic canine minisatellites are likely to show transience in their variability and detection, whereas monomorphic minisatellites are stable and more readily detected in related canids. Use of cCfaMP 5, the most polymorphic canine minisatellite isolated to date, as a single-locus probe in paternity analysis demonstrates its applicability to forensic problems. Flanking sequence and partial repeat sequence data obtained for the minisatellite in cCfaMP 5. The variable region in this minisatellite region is similar to many human minisatellites which show a distinct purine or pyrimidine strand bias. A mechanism whereby this minisatellite might have evolved is suggestedon the basis of the distribution and kinds of repeat units.

40|$|Relatedness between {{individuals}} {{is an important}} element of genetic-epidemiological and evolutionary investigations in the context of anthropological research. In general, data on relationships {{between individuals}} are gathered from personal interviews or from examination of vital records. When blood samples are collected, such information can be validated from genotypic similarities of individuals. Although genotype data may offer opportunities to exclude certain types of relationships, inclusionary statements are necessarily only probabilistic in nature. The limitations of such probabilistic statements depend on the number of segregating alleles and the extent of polymorphisms at the loci employed. With the advent of DNA technology, several hypervariable single-locus <b>probes</b> (SLPs) and <b>multilocus</b> <b>probes</b> (M LPs) are now available for many organisms. These can be used to circumvent limitations of unequivocal assignment of relationships from genotype data. In this article we describe analytical principles for such investigations.

We derive the expected distributions of number of alleles in individuals and of number of shared alleles between individuals of known relationships in a population. These distributions can be used in hypothesis testing to determine relatedness between individuals. We also derive the number of SLPs, each detecting a hypervariable polymorphism, needed to determine a specified relationship for given ranges of errors of prediction. Illustrations of the theory with data on several short tandem repeat loci and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci indicate that with 6 to 12 SLPs the parent-offspring pairs can be reliably distinguished from random pairs of individuals.

The level of allelism and linkage between different hypervariable DNA fragments scored with these probes is also low, implying substantial statistical independence of DNA fragments. Variation between the DNA fingerprints of different individuals indicates that the probability of chance identity is very low (<< 10 - 7 per probe). Empirical observations and theoretical considerations both indicate that genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations is unlikely to affect substantially the statistical evaluation of DNA fingerprints, at least among Caucasians.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{increasing}} application of DNA fingerprinting to natural populations and to the genetic identification of humans, explicit methods for estimation of basic population genetic parameters from DNA fingerprinting data have not been developed. Contributing to this omission is the inability to determine, for <b>multilocus</b> fingerprinting <b>probes,</b> relatively important genetic information, such {{as the number of}} loci, the number of alleles, and the distribution of these alleles into specific loci. One of the most useful genetic parameters that could be derived from such data would be the average heterozygosity, which has traditionally been employed to measure the level of genetic variation within populations and to compare genetic variation among different loci. We derive here explicit formulas for both the estimation of average heterozygosity at multiple hypervariable loci and a maximum value for this estimate. These estimates are based upon the DNA restriction-pattern matrices that are typical for fingerprinting studies of humans and natural populations. For several empirical data sets from our laboratory, estimates of average and maximal heterozygosity are shown to be relatively close to each other. Furthermore, variances of these statistics based on simulation studies are relatively small. These observations, as well as consideration of the effect of missing alleles and alternate numbers of loci, suggest that the average heterozygosity can be accurately estimated using phenotypic DNA fingerprint patterns, because this parameter is relatively insensitive to the lack of certain genetic information...|$|R

Four <b>multilocus</b> and multiallele <b>probes</b> were employed (M, X, H 10, and H 16) that detect different families of minisatellite sequences dispersed throughout the genome. Genomic rearrangements were detectable only with probe M. This specificity {{may be explained}} by a genomic instability owing to a specific sequence or structure of DNA recognized by probe M. Genomic rearrangements were detected in 5 of 12 type III foci trans formed by 600 cGy of X-rays and in all clones isolated from a previously transformed clone exposed to a second dose of 600 cGy and recloned. The latter data suggest that the stage of transformation and the occurrence of genomic rearrangement induced by X-rays may be related. An intensity shift or a complete deletion of band 2 was common to these X-ray-induced clones, as well as to clones transformed by UV-C (1 of 5) or 3 -methylcholanthrene (4 of 6). This band did not hybridize to probes for the retinoblastoma gene RB or for p 53. We hypothesize that the loss of band 2 may reflect a significant genetic change in the transformation of 10 T 1 / 2 cells, perhaps representing the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene other than RB or p 53. Additional rearrangements occurred in X-ray-transformed clones; these rearrangements were not observed with the other carcinogens.

40|$|Thesis (PhDAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Barley leaf scald, {{caused by}} Rhynchosporium secalis, {{is the most}} {{important}} disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare) in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The disease was first reported from South Africa in 1937. The present study is the first attempt to characterise the South African R. secalis population. Topics such as pathogenesisrelated proteins, virulence spectra, variability of pathotypes, sources of variation, host resistance, breeding strategies, molecular characterisation and fungicide sensitivity are summarised in Part 1 of this dissertation. In succeeding Parts {{the focus is on the}} characteristics of the local R. secalis population regarding virulence spectrum, DNA polymorphisms, in vitro as well as in vivo fungicide sensitivity. These aspects are treated as separate entities, leading to some duplication which is unavoidable. In Part 2 the virulence spectra of 50 R. secalis isolates from a population in the. Western Cape province were determined. Twenty-one races were detected using 17 differential barley cultivars. The two most prevalent races, namely races 4 and 7 had three and four virulence genes respectively. Both race 4 and 7 were virulent on the most susceptible cultivars, namely West China, Steudelli, C. I. 8618 and C. I. 2226. Considering the resistance genes reported for cultivars Atlas 46, Turk, and C. I. 3515 which showed no susceptible cultivar-pathogen interaction, it would appear that the Rh- Rh 3 -Rh 4 complex is primarily involved in conferring resistance to the local R. secalis isolates. A total of 20 races (47 isolates) characterised in Part 2 were selected for further characterisation by means of DNA fingerprinting. In Part 3 an anonymous <b>multilocus</b> DNA <b>probe</b> was used to characterise the genotypic structure of these isolates by means of RFLP analysis. No correlation between any particular fingerprint pattern, race, district, field or lesion was found. The two most prevalent races, 4 and 7, did not share the same genotypes, even when isolated from the same field or lesion. The genotypic diversity of the isolates studied was 46. 5 % of the theoretical maximum diversity. The high level of genotypic variation observed in the South African R. secalis population resembled the genotypic diversity observed in other cereal pathogens with known sexual structures. Although no teleomorph has yet been observed, these data suggest that sexual recombination may operate within the local population of R. secalis. In South Africa barley scald is primarily controlled by means of fungicides. The continued use of fungicides on cereal crops results in the build-up of fungicide resistance in the population, which could lower the efficacy of these compounds. These aspects were investigated in Part 4, where isolates (collected during 1993 to 1995) were evaluated in vitro for sensitivity to triadimenol, tebuconazole, flusilazole and propiconazole. The sensitivity fluctuated but in 1995 isolates were significantly less sensitive towards triadimenol than in the previous two years. In a second experiment, isolates collected from two fields with a 5 - 6 year-history of triadimenol seed treatments and tebuconazole applications, were evaluated for their fungicide sensitivity. A significant positive correlation was observed between tebuconazole and triadimenol sensitivity among,R. secalis populations from these fields. However, such a correlation was not found within the R. secalis population collected during 1993 - 1995 where shorter crop rotation patterns and a range of fungicides was applied. In a third experiment, the fungicide sensitivity of local R. secalis isolates was evaluated towards two new triazole fungicides, namely bromuconazole and triticonazole. Correlation coefficients observed between these new triazoles and those previously applied in South Africa were not significantly positive. The lack of significant cross-resistance has important practical implications regarding the management of fungicide resistance. In Part 5, isolates with different minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) towards tebuconazole in vitro (1, 3 and 10 ug/ml) were compared in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine how MIC values would influence virulence (leaf area affected) and sporulation. Results indicated that all isolates were equally fit to induce lesions and sporulate in the absence of tebuconazole. Thus no fitness cost was associated with the degree of tebuconazole sensitivity in the present study. All R. secalis isolates were able to induce lesions on tebuconazole treated leaves, but differed significantly with respect to the percentage leaf area affected. Isolates, least sensitive (MIC = 10 ug/rnl) towards tebuconazole were more adapted on tebuconazole treated leaves, being able to repeatedly cause larger lesions than sensitive R. secalis isolates (MIC = 1 ug/rnl), Sporulation was not significantly different between isolates on lesions of untreated or tebuconazole treated leaves. Larger leaf areas affected and adequate sporulation suggest that a less sensitive population would result in more disease in tebuconazole treated fields. In conclusion, this study revealed the variability associated with the South African R. secalis population regarding virulence spectrum and genotypic structure. The data in this study suggest that it is likely that the local population will easily adapt to newly introduced, single gene resistance. For more durable resistance, higher levels of quantitative resistance should be introduced. This type of resistance is, however, more difficult to identify and incorporate than single gene resistance. Consequently, barley scald control will remain dependent on the efficacy of fungicide applications. Furthermore, the lack of cross-resistance and low frequency of resistant isolates indicates a low risk for the development of fungicide resistance in the local R. secalis population. Other factors such as current crop rotation practices and the range of fungicides being ~pplied also contribute to this low risk level. However, the status of these factors can change over time. The in vivo tebuconazole sensitivity study has indicated that a resistant field population of R. secalis may be able to build-up. It is, therefore, necessary to monitor the fungicide sensitivity of R. secalis isolates at timely intervals with view to successful barley cultivation in the future. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Blaarvlek op gars (Hordeum vulgare), veroorsaak deur Rhynchosporium secalis, is die belangrikste siekte van gars in die Wes-Kaap provinsie van Suid-Afrika. Die voorkoms van R. secalis op gars is in Suid-Afrika vir die eertse keer in 1937 gerapporteer. Hierdie studie is die eerste poging tot karakterisering van die plaaslike R. secalis-populasie. Aspekte soos proteïene betrokke by patogenese, virulensiespektra, variabiliteit van patotipes, bronne van variasie, gasheerweerstand, teeltprogramme, molekulêre karakterisering en swamdodersensitiwiteit word in Deel I van die tesis opgesom. In die daaropvolgende gedeelte is die fokus op die karakterisering van die R. secalis-populasie en behels DNA karakterisering, virulensiespektrum, en swamdodersensitiwiteit in vitro asook in vivo. [...] In Deel 2 is die virulensiespektra van 50 R. secalis isolate van 'n populasie in die. Wes-Kaap geëvalueer teenoor 17 differensiëel weerstandbiedende gars kultivars en hieruit is 21 rasse geïdentifiseer. Die twee mees algemene rasse (rasse 4 en 7), met onderskeidelik drie en vier virulensie gene, het virulent vertoon teenoor die mees vatbare kultivars soos West China, Steudelli, C. I. 8618 en C. I. 2226. Geen vatbare kultivar-patogeen interaksies is met kultivars Atlas 46, Turk en C. I. 3515, wat al drie die Rh-Rh 3 -Rh 4 kompleks dra, gevind nie. Dit wil dus voorkom asof hierdie genekompleks effektiewe gasheerweerstand teen die plaaslike R. secalis isolate kan bied. 'n Totaal van 20 rasse (47 isolate), gekarakteriseer in Deel 2, is geselekteer vir verdere karakterisering met behulp van DNA bandpatrone. In Deel 3 is 'n anonieme multilokus DNA peiler gebruik om deur middel van RFLP analise die genotipiese struktuur van hierdie R. secalis-isolate te bepaal. Geen assosiasie is gevind tussen DNA bandpatroon en ras, distrik, garsland of letsel nie. Die twee rasse (4 en 7) wat mees algemeen voorkom, het nie dieselfde bandpatroon vertoon nie, ook nie dié afkomstig vanuit dieselfde garsland of letsel nie. Die genotipiese diversiteit van isolate was 46. 5 % van die teoretiese maksimum diversiteit. Die hoë vlak van variasie waargeneem in die R. secalis populasie is soortgelyk aan variasie waargeneem in ander graanpatogene wat oor 'n geslagtelike stadium in die lewenssiklus beskik. Alhoewel geen geslagtelike stadium tot dusver geidentifiseer is nie, dui die vlak van variasie daarop dat geslagtelike rekombinasie moontlik wel plaasvind binne die plaaslike R. secalis populasie. In Suid-Afrika word blaarvlek op gars primêr deur swamdoders beheer. Die toenemende gebruik van swamdoders op graangewasse veroorsaak moontlik 'n opbou van swamdoderweerstand in die populasie. Dit kan die effektiwiteit van swamdoders verlaag. Hierdie veronderstelling is in Deel 4 ondersoek, waar die sensitiwiteit van isolate in vitro teenoor triadimenol, tebukonasool, flusilasool en propikonasool geëvalueer is. Die triasooi sensitiwiteit van R. secalis isolate wat gedurende die 1993 - 1995 seisoen versamel is het gewissel en slegs vir triadimenol was daar 'n tendens na meer weerstandbiedenheid. 'n Swamdoder-evaluasie is in 'n aparte eksperiment op isolate gedoen wat versamel is vanaf twee garslande met 'n 5 - 6 jaar geskiedenis van triadimenol saadbehandelings en tebukonasool bespuitings. 'n Betekenisvolle positiewe korrelasie is waaJ~geneem tussen tebukonasool en triadimenol sensitiwiteit in R. secalis isolate afkomstig vanaf hierdie twee garslande. 'n Soortgelyke korrelasie is egter nie gevind in die populasie wat gedurende die 1993 - 1995 seisoene versamel IS me. Laasgenoemde kan moontlik toegeskryf word aan korter wisselboupatrone en die toediening van 'n verskeidenheid van swamdoders. In 'n derde eksperiment is die sensitiwiteit van plaaslike R. secalis isolate teenoor twee nuwe triasole, naamlik bromukonasool en tritikonasool getoets. Die korrelasie waargeneem tussen die twee nuwe triasole en triasooi swamdoders reeds voorheen in gebruik in die Wes-Kaap was me betekenisvol positief me. Die gebrek aan betekenisvolle kruisweerstandbiedendheid het belangrike praktiese implikasies vir die bestuur van swamdoder -weerstandbiedendheid. In Deel 5 is isolate met wisselende minimum inhiberende konsentrasies (MIKs) teenoor tebukonasool in vitro (1, 3 en 10 ug/ml) en in vivo vergelyk. Die doel van hierdie studie was om te bepaal hoe wisselende MIK-waardes virulensie (blaaroppervlakte geïnfekteer) en sporulasie sal beïnvloed. Resultate dui daarop dat alle R. secalis isolate in hierdie studie ewe fiks was om, in die afwesigheid van tebukonasool, letsels te induseer en te sporuleer. Die bevinding is dat die verlies in fiksheid nie geassosieer is met die mate van tebukonasool weerstand nie. Alle R. secalis isolate het die vermoë gehad om letsels op tebukonasool-behandelde blare te veroorsaak maar het betekenisvol verskil ten opsigte van die blaaroppervlakte geaffekteer. Isolate wat minder sensitief (MIK = 10 ug/rnl) teenoor tebukonasool in vitro is, het meer aangepastheid op tebukonasool-behandelde blare getoon. Gevolglik het hierdie isolate herhaaldelik meer letsels veroorsaak as sensitiewe isolate (MIK = 1 ug/ml), Sporulasie het nie betekenisvol verskil tussen isolate vanaf letsels op ondehandelde of tebukonsoolbehandelde blare nie. Hierdie resultate dui egter daarop dat 'n minder sensitiewe populasie tot meer siektevoorkoms in tebukonasool-bespuite lande kan lei. Die studie het die veranderlike karakter van die Suid-Afrikaanse R. secalispopulasie aangaande virulensiespektrum en genotipiese struktuur blootgelê. Dit is dus baie moontlik dat die R. secalis-populasie maklik sal aanpas by teelmateriaal met nuwe enkelgeen-weerstand. Vir volgehoue gasheerweerstand is dit egter nodig dat hoër vlakke van kwantitatiewe weerstand ingeteel moet word. In die praktyk is hierdie tipe weerstand egter baie moeiliker om te identifiseer en by nuwe teelmateriaal in te sluit as in die geval van enkelgeen-weerstand, Dit bring mee dat blaarvlekbeheer afhanklik bly van swamdodertoedienings as beheermaatreël. Die resultate van hierdie studie dui daarop dat daar tans 'n lae risiko vir die ontwikkeling van swamdoderweerstand in die plaaslike populasie is, as gevolg van die afwesigheid van kruisweerstandbiedendheid en die lae voorkoms van weerstandbiediende isolate. Ander faktore soos die wisselboustelsels wat toegepas word en die verskeidenheid van swamdoders toegedien dra ook daartoe by. Ten spyte hiervan kan die status van hierdie faktore egter oor tyd verander. Die in vivo tebukonasool studie het daarop gedui dat 'n weerstandbiedende veldpopulasie van R. secalis die potensiaal het om te vermeerder. Gevolglik is die tydige monitering van swamdodersenisitiwiteit van R. secalis isolate noodsaaklik om 'n volhoubare garsproduksie te verseker...|$|R
