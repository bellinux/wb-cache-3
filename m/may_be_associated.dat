5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E

5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with pathology in Wernicke's area or Broca's area of the brain. In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with {{immunosuppressive}} {{effects and}} liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful {{adherence to the}} administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment {{to decide whether the}} therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E
5|$|NGC 6251 is {{an active}} supergiant {{elliptical}} radio galaxy more than 340 million light-years away from Earth.

This galaxy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with gamma-ray source 3EG J1621+8203, which has high-energy gamma-ray emission.

5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{adverse events}} {{are related to}} the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} subspecies macrantha {{is found}} in two distinct regions on the far north coast of New South Wales; the first from Crowdy Bay on the Mid North Coast northwards to Hat Head National Park north of Port Macquarie, and then from Yuraygir National Park north to Kingscliff {{just south of the}} Queensland border. This variety is more strictly coastal with most populations being found within two kilometres of the coast, or in swampy areas. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with Banksia oblongifolia.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E
