2500|$|Malt is {{germinate}}d cereal grains {{that have been}} dried in {{a process known as}} [...] "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develops the enzymes required for modifying the grain's starches into various types of sugar, including the monosaccharide glucose, the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines. It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, which break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast. Depending on when the <b>malting</b> <b>process</b> is stopped one gets a preferred starch enzyme ratio and partly converted starch into fermentable sugars. Malt also contains small amounts of other sugars, such as sucrose and fructose, which are not products of starch modification but were already in the grain. Further conversion to fermentable sugars is achieved during the mashing process.|$|E
2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The <b>malting</b> <b>process</b> starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{characterize}} and quantify the genetic variability of 30 elite barley malt accessions irrigated in the savannas, using traits related to the industrial quality to verify if they could be used in improvement programmes in the selection of better malt quality genotypes. The following analytical determinations were carried out: total protein content (%), extract yield M. F. i. a. (%), Hartong index VZ (45 °C), viscosity 8. 6 °P (mPa s), boiled wort colour (EBC), soluble nitrogen content (mg/ 100 g), Kolbach index (%), friability (%) and &# 946;-glucan. The descriptive analysis of data was performed and the coefficients of genetic dissimilarity were estimated for each pair. The relative contribution of each trait of genetic diversity was measured and also the correlations among them. According to the genetic dissimilarity matrix, a cluster analysis and scatter chart were constructed. Through cluster analysis, two major similarity groups were observed. The soluble nitrogen was the variable that contributed the most for the genetic variability (86. 6 %), followed by &# 946;-glucan (12. 5 %). The results indicate that the barley grown in the savanna is ready to be included in the national <b>malt</b> <b>process</b> and that there is a genetic variability among the barley genotypes evaluated for the malting quality traits. It can be concluded that the barley can be used in the Brazilian irrigated barley improvement programme. The qualitative traits that contribute the most to the genetic diversity are soluble nitrogen and &# 946;-glucan and the less variable ones are protein content and malt viscosity. 201...|$|R

During germination, the grain is spread out {{on the floor of the}} germination room for around 5 days. The final part of malting is kilning when the malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln; with gradual temperature increase over several hours.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was the use and evaluation of dynamic modeling techniques to identify mathematical models for cereal drying rates and quality changes that best describe thin-layer malt drying data. Seven thin-layer malt drying experiments were performed at the Great Western Malting pilot facilities, Vancouver, WA. Malt moisture content, temperature, β-amylase activity, endo-barley-β-glucanase activity, and color were all monitored as the malt was dried with air at various temperature and relative humidity values. A constrained direct search optimization method was used to fit available drying, enzyme deactivation, and color formation models to the data obtained by minimizing the error between predicted and experimental values. Because the deactivation of β- amylase observed during the kiln experiments was less than the error involved in β-amylase measurement, β-amylase modeling efforts were dropped from the study. The end result is a computer simulation of the <b>malt</b> kilning <b>process</b> that can predict malt drying rates, color formation, and endo-barley-β-glucanase deactivation based on the drying air temperature, relative humidity, and time spent in the kiln.

25|$|Documented {{evidence}} and recently excavated tombs {{indicate that the}} Chinese brewed alcoholic beverages from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the <b>malt</b> conversion <b>process</b> was largely considered inefficient {{in comparison with the}} use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into fermentable sugars, both in the amount of resulting fermentable sugars and the residual by products (the Chinese use the dregs left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔzāo), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like barley malt. Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic beverages did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic beverages gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history {{by the end of the}} Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacture}} of malt and beer requires large amounts of electrical and thermal energy which is nowadays mainly based on fossil fuels. In State of the Art breweries 7. 5 – 11. 5 kWhel [1] and 16. 7 – 33. 3 kWhth [1, 2] per hl of beer are needed (reference: final energy demand) and the annual output of medium to large sized breweries may easily exceed one million hl. The entire process heat demand of the thermally driven processes in breweries and malting plants can be met with heat at a temperature of between 25 and 105 °C on process level [3, 4]. This enables the integration of solar thermal energy supplied by conventional, non- concentrating solar thermal collector technologies such as flat-plate or evacuated tube collectors. In fact, providing thermal energy by means of solar thermal systems is mostly energy efficient if the energy from the sun is converted into heat and supplied to the process at minimum required temperature level (referred to as solar integration on process level). With this regard and {{in the framework of}} a European Union-funded demonstration project, three large-scale solar thermal systems (each with an installed thermal peak capacity ≥ 1 MWth) are being realized. The focus of the project is to demonstrate the integration of large scale solar thermal systems on process level for different applications (mashing, pasteurization of beer, drying of green <b>malt)</b> at <b>process</b> temperatures below 80 °C.

40|$|AbstractThe exergetic {{performance}} of beer {{produced by the}} conventional <b>malting</b> and brewing <b>process</b> is {{compared with that of}} beer produced using an enzyme-assisted process. The aim is to estimate if the use of an exogenous enzyme formulation reduces the environmental impact of the overall brewing process. The exergy efficiency of malting was 77 %. The main exergy losses stem from the use of natural gas for kilning and from starch loss during germination. The exergy efficiency of the enzyme production process ranges between 20 % and 42 % depending on if the by-product was considered useful. The main exergy loss was due to high power requirement for fermentation. The total exergy input in the enzyme production process was 30 times the standard chemical exergy of the enzyme, which makes it exergetically expensive. Nevertheless, the total exergy input for the production of 100  kg beer was larger for the conventional process (441  MJ) than for the enzyme-assisted process (354  MJ). Moreover, beer produced using enzymes reduced the use of water, raw materials and natural gas by 7 %, 14 % and 78 % respectively. Consequently, the exergy loss in the enzyme production process is compensated by the prevention of exergy loss in the total beer brewing process...|$|R
