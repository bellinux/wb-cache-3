5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|There {{came to me}} Bowes, by whom I do {{understand}} that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall {{from a pair of}} stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him.

25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, {{he advised}} {{them on the}} proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, [...] "Nothing really affected <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there {{would not have been}} the Beatles." ...|$|E

In his official report of Monitor to the Navy Department, Bankhead praised Green and Stodder for their heroic efforts and wrote, [...] "I would beg leave to call {{the attention of the}} Admiral and of the Department of the particularly good conduct of Lieutenant Greene and Acting Master Louis N. Stodder, who remained with <b>me</b> <b>until</b> the last, and by their example did much toward inspiring confidence and obedience {{on the part of the}} others." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Illegal" [...] is a ballad with lyrics {{revolving}} around mourning {{for the loss}} of a lover, as seen in the lines, [...] "It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart". It contains elements of pop and country music. Spence D. of the website IGN felt that Shakira adopted an [...] "almost modern day country-styled pop aesthetic". Throughout the song, her vocals are subdued, complete with [...] "rolling delivering, breathy accentuations, and... trill". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the lyrics [...] "You said you would love <b>me</b> <b>until</b> you died/And as far as I know you're still alive" [...] were similar to Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] (1995).|$|E
500|$|Kathy Baker saw {{her part}} of Joyce, the {{neighbor}} {{who tries to}} seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. Nothing really made sense to <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E

500|$|The {{collapse}} of Hubbard's marriage to Sara created yet more problems. He had begun {{an affair with}} his 20-year-old public relations assistant in late 1950, while Sara started a relationship with Dianetics auditor Miles Hollister. Hubbard secretly denounced the couple to the FBI in March 1951, portraying them in a letter as communist infiltrators. According to Hubbard, Sara was [...] "currently intimate with [...] but evidently under coercion. Drug addiction set in fall 1950. Nothing of this known to <b>me</b> <b>until</b> a few weeks ago." [...] Hollister was described as having a [...] "sharp chin, broad forehead, rather Slavic". He {{was said to be}} the [...] "center of most turbulence in our organization" [...] and [...] "active and dangerous". The FBI did not take Hubbard seriously: an agent annotated his correspondence with the comment, [...] "Appears mental." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about getting [...] "the rules {{straight}} on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't say you love <b>me</b> <b>until</b> you give me some time {{and get to know}} me." [...] According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broch Ålvik, [...] "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] is the [...] "thinking person's teen pop." [...] Ålvik rejects a superficial interpretation that the lyrics are a [...] "moralistic message of abstinence", arguing instead that M2M [...] "signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish" [...] and that {{the song is}} a statement of [...] "burgeoning agency." [...] The song has been described as bubblegum pop music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by girl groups of the 1960s, while also having more influence from rock and singer-songwriter genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of the late 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism {{as a child}} and attended the all-girls Cathedral High School, for six months before transferring to public high school, which she attended until she dropped out. Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E

500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E
500|$|Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 {{was given}} a 6 out of 10 by Newsarama's Richard Gray. He stated that [...] "despite the “Trinity War” tie-in banners, [...] {{scarcely}} essential reading for current DC fans" [...] adding that [...] "Pandora’s focus doesn’t appear to be as concerned with this bigger picture" [...] and the series {{requires a lot of}} backstory, only in its second issue. IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the issue a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 improves on the first issue, but the series still lacks a clear, ongoing purpose" [...] and [...] "as a [...] "Trinity War" [...] tie-in, this is certainly a more compelling read than Constantine #5." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 is an average comic book all the way around. It doesn't add much to the [...] "Trinity War" [...] story despite the logo on the cover and it certainly isn't going to stick with <b>me</b> <b>until</b> the next issue." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E

500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He {{opened the door for}} black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really affected <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been the Beatles." ...|$|E
2500|$|The accusations {{he made in}} Rebuilding American Family Values {{differed}} from a claim which he told Associated Press journalist David Beard in June 1992, where he was confessed there was a link between pediatrics and political activism: People have said, [...] "You've turned your back on pediatrics." [...] I said, [...] "No. It took <b>me</b> <b>until</b> I was in my 60s to realize that politics {{was a part of}} pediatrics." ...|$|E
