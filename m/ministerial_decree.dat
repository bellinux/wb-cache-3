It succeeded the Highest Judicial Office (Oberste Justizstelle), the common justice department and supreme court of the Austrian hereditary lands and the Lands of the Bohemian Crown that had been founded under the reign of the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa in 1749. The Court received its organisational structure by edict of Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1850, with Count Louis Taaffe (1791–1855) as its first president. It then had jurisdiction over all crown lands of the Austrian Empire.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} and other investigations, in June 2001, a complaint of an environmental disaster was presented to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Brescia. Research on the adult population of Brescia showed that residents of some urban areas, former workers of the plant, and consumers of contaminated food, have PCB levels in their bodies that are in many cases 10-20 times higher than reference values in comparable general populations. PCBs entered the human food supply by animals grazing on contaminated pastures near the factory, especially in local veal mostly eaten by farmers' families. The exposed population showed an elevated risk of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but not for other specific cancers.|$|E

Such was Joffre's fall from grace that, entitled to take three staff officers from GQG with him to his new post, he could find only one volunteer. Finding he had actually been sidelined and left with few defined responsibilities, he resigned on 27 December 1916. [...] The North Army and North-East Army were also removed from the direct control of GQG.

500|$|A similar {{situation}} occurred in Italy when, in 1990, the Ca' del Bosco Winery acquired {{what they thought}} was Cabernet Franc vines from a French nursery. The growers noticed that the grapes were different from the traditional Cabernet Franc both in color and taste. They also noticed that the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc would have. Other Italian wine regions also started to doubt the origin of these vines and it was finally established to be Carménère. Although, in Italy, the variety is grown mainly in the northeast part of the country from Brescia to Friuli, it has only recently been entered into Italy's national catalog of vine varieties and thus [...] "no district has yet requested the authorization to use it". Therefore, the wine [...] "cannot be cultivated with its original name or specific vintage and the name cannot be used to identify the wine on the label with an IGT, DOC or a DOCG status assignment." [...] Ca' del Bosco Winery names the wine it produces Carmenero. In 2007 the grape was authorised to be used in Italian DOC wines from Veneto (Arcole, Bagnoli di Sopra, Cori Benedettine del Padovano, Garda, Merlara, Monti Lessini, Riviera del Brenta and Vicenza), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Collio, or Collio Goriziano) and Sardinia (Alghero). Since a <b>ministerial</b> <b>decree</b> of 2009, producers of Piave DOC wines in 50 communes of the Province of Treviso, and 12 in the Province of Venice have been permitted where appropriate to specify the variety Carmenère on the wine label.|$|E
