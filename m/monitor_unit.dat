40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} optimal configuration of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> in a hierarchical distributed monitoring system. A hierarchical distributed monitoring system consists of a hierarchy of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> which are grouped and distributed onto the physical network. The architecture lends itself to parallel processing, reducing the complexity of distributed monitoring caused by factors such as collection and processing of the large quantities of monitoring data. Furthermore, the topology-specific partitioning of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> allow complex, topology-specific events to be monitored and evaluated in a natural and efficient way. The optimal configuration problem is concerned with finding an optimal hierarchical partition of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> such that the total processing cost is the minimum. It is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we study the heuristics for obtaining near-optimal grouping of <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> Simulation of heuristic algorithms for mesh and hypercube networks are presented. The results suggest further system topology specific heuristics. Although the paper is targeted at distributed monitoring, {{we believe that the}} results can also be applied to other hierarchical control problems in distributed computing.

30|$|The {{use case}} we {{selected}} for evaluating our architecture {{is related to}} road traffic and road condition monitoring in the Finnish highway network. The Finnish highway network has nearly 10, 000 kilometers of road. If <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> consisting of equipment to monitor traffic and weather conditions are deployed on highways for instance on the average every five kilometers, the resulting system has 2, 000 <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> With an average distance of one kilometer, there would be 10, 000 <b>monitoring</b> <b>units.</b> We further assume that these units, which act as PNs, are equipped with 3 G HSDPA modules. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> are coupled with variable speed limit displays and warning displays {{that are used to}} show information to the users of the road. Every <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> acts as a PN for 1 - 100 wireless sensors (LNs) in a local WSN. The sensors are used for monitoring various conditions such as road surface temperature (to detect ice formation), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, light, the amount of chemicals applied for prevention of freezing of water, water layer thickness, black ice, traffic volume, speed of vehicles (e.g., using a radar), and accidents (e.g., using video cameras coupled with computer vision). The data from the sensors can be used to adjust the current speed limit and show warnings to the users of the road on the warning displays. We assume that a given <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> uses not only local information but information from sensors in nearby WSNs as input for showing warnings and for determining an appropriate speed limit to optimize the flow of traffic. For this, every <b>monitoring</b> <b>unit</b> is assumed to have on the average 10 outgoing CoAP observation relationships. The mean time between notifications is assumed to be either 1 min or 10 min.|$|R

Very rarely, SUDEP occurs in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units,</b> providing highly informative data for its still elusive pathophysiology. The MORTEMUS study expanded these data through comprehensive evaluation of cardiorespiratory arrests encountered in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> worldwide. Methods: Between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 29, 2009, we did a systematic retrospective survey of epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> located in Europe, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, to retrieve data for all cardiorespiratory arrests recorded in these units and estimate their incidence. Epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> from other regions were invited to report similar cases to further explore the mechanisms. An expert panel reviewed data, including video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and electrocardiogram material at the time of cardiorespiratory arrests whenever available. Findings: 147 (92 %) of 160 units responded to the survey. 29 cardiorespiratory arrests, including 16 SUDEP (14 at night), nine near SUDEP, and four deaths from other causes, were reported. Cardiorespiratory data, available for ten cases of SUDEP, showed a consistent and previously unrecognised pattern whereby rapid breathing (18 - 50 breaths per min) developed after secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizure, followed within 3 min by transient or terminal cardiorespiratory dysfunction. Where transient, this dysfunction later recurred with terminal apnoea occurring within 11 min of the end of the seizure, followed by cardiac arrest. SUDEP incidence in adult epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> was 5. 1 (95 % CI 2. 6 - 9. 2) per 1000 patient-years, with a risk of 1. 2 (0. 6 - 2. 1) per 10 000 VEEG monitorings, probably aggravated by suboptimum supervision and possibly by antiepileptic drug withdrawal. Interpretation: SUDEP in epilepsy <b>monitoring</b> <b>units</b> primarily follows an early postictal, centrally mediated, severe alteration of respiratory and cardiac function induced by generalised tonic-clonic seizure, leading to immediate death or a short period of partly restored cardiorespiratory function followed by terminal apnoea then cardiac arrest.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aims to {{investigate}} the process of <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> verification using control charts. Control charts is a key tool within statistical process control (SPC), through which process characteristics can be visualized, usually chronologically with statistically determined limits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our group has developed a <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> verification software that has been adopted at several Swedish institutions for pre-treatment verification of radiotherapy treatments. Deviations between point dose calculations using the treatment planning systems and using the independent <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> verification software from 9219 treatment plans and five different institutions were included in this multicenter study. The process of <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> verification was divided into subprocesses. Each subprocess was analyzed using probability plots and control charts. RESULTS: Differences in control chart parameters for the investigated subprocesses were found between different treatment sites and different institutions, {{as well as between}} different treatment techniques. 19 of 37 subprocesses met the clinical specification (Â± 5 %), i. e. process capability index was equal to or above one. CONCLUSIONS: Control charts were found to be a useful tool for continuous analysis of data from the <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> verification software for patient specific quality control, as well as for comparisons between different institutions and treatment sites.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> calculations from a pencil beam based, three-dimensional treatment planning system (3 D TPS) has been evaluated for open irregularly shaped photon fields. The dose per <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> {{was measured in}} water and in air for x-ray beam qualities from 6 to 15 MV. The fields were shaped either with a multileaf collimator (MLC) or with customized alloy blocks. Calculations from the 3 D TPS were compared with measurements. The agreement between calculated and measured dose per <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> depended on field size {{and the amount of}} blocking and was within 3 % for the MLC-shaped fields. The deviation could be traced to limitations in head scatter modelling for the MLC. For fields shaped with alloy blocks, the dose per <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> was calculated to be within 1. 6 % of measured values for all fields studied. The measured and calculated relative phantom scatter for fields with the same equivalent field size were identical for MLC and alloy shaped fields.

40|$|An {{essential}} component of quality assurance in radiation therapy is verifying the accuracy of <b>monitor</b> <b>unit</b> calculations.

However, for tangential breast fields the discrepancies are considerably larger than those that would generally be considered acceptable. A simple model to reconcile the differences between sophisticated and simple algorithms is presented, based on replacing the breast contour with a triangular or elliptical contour and using this to estimate an equivalent rectangular prism providing equivalent scatter to the prescription point. The elliptical approximation reconciles the observed differences in calculated monitor units.
