5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations. Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|As a bishop, Baldwin {{came to the}} {{attention}} of King Henry II of England, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in Wales with Gerald of Wales, preaching and raising money for the Third Crusade. After the coronation of King Richard I, the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the Holy Land, where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin died in the Holy Land while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> to Christianity than Saladin.|$|E
50|$|Three {{new weapons}} are introduced: the Flame Machine Gun (which has <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> than Heavy Machine Gun ,and capable of burning enemy {{soldiers}} when hit), the Grenade Launcher (which fires grenade rounds {{that provides a}} large blast radius and <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> than Super Grenade), and Super Shotgun (which has <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> than the Shotgun).|$|R
50|$|Units in Ravenmark {{are also}} known as Elements. All {{elements}} are classified into one of five types - infantry, ranged, cavalry, polearms and support. Each element type has a damage advantage on another type, less support elements who are neutral to all other element types. Infantry deals <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> to polearm elements, while polearm elements deal <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> to cavalry. Cavalry deals <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> to ranged elements and ranged elements deal <b>more</b> <b>damage</b> to infantry. Certain units such as mounted archers are classified as ranged elements and not cavalry.|$|R

5|$|The Fire Emblem series' Weapon Triangle {{mechanic}} {{is featured}} again, {{in which the}} three main close-combat weapons are strong or weak against each other: axes are strong against lances, lances are strong against swords, and swords are strong against axes. Other similar mechanics exist, such as fire magic being <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> to some beasts, and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies. Weapon durability decreases over time, with weapons eventually breaking when used {{a certain number of}} times. Weapons have different levels of strength, with its assigned letter (E to A and S) denoting the level of skill required to wield it. Weapons forged at Base can also be customized with a unique name. Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle; fire is weak to wind, wind is weak to thunder, and thunder is weak to fire.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} to defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by the babies.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned back from their planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Kim, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Osang, was the second typhoon in a week to {{directly}} affect the Philippines during July1980. Like Typhoon Joe, Kim formed from the near equatorial monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean on July19. The disturbance tracked quickly westward-northwest underneath a subtropical ridge, reaching tropical storm strength on the July21 and typhoon strength on July23. After developing an eye, Kim began to rapidly intensify, and during the afternoon of July24, peaked in intensity as a super typhoon. Several hours later, Kim made landfall over the Philippines, but the storm had weakened considerably by this time. Throughout the Philippines, 40people were killed, 2 via drownings, and 19,000 others were directly affected. A total of 12,000homes were destroyed and 5,000villages were flooded. Less than a week earlier, the same areas were affected by Joe; however, Kim was considered the <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> of the two typhoons. Land interaction took its toll on Kim, and upon entering the South China Sea, the storm was down below typhoon intensity. Kim continued northwestward but its disrupted circulation prevented re-intensification, and it remained a tropical storm until hitting southern China July27 to the northeast of Hong Kong, where only slight damage was reported. Later that day, Kim dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Lemon ants make devil's gardens {{by killing}} {{surrounding}} plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees, (Duroia hirsuta). This {{modification of the}} forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the Duroia trees. Although some ants obtain nectar from flowers, pollination by ants is somewhat rare. Some plants have special nectar exuding structures, extrafloral nectaries, that provide food for ants, which in turn protect the plant from <b>more</b> <b>damaging</b> herbivorous insects. Species such as the bullhorn acacia (Acacia cornigera) in Central America have hollow thorns that house colonies of stinging ants (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea) who defend the tree against insects, browsing mammals, and epiphytic vines. Isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants.N labelling study of nitrogen fluxes from ants to plants in the mutualism of Pheidole and Piper|vauthors=Fischer RC, Wanek W, Richter A, Mayer V |year=2003|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=91|pages=126–134|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00747.x }} In return, the ants obtain food from protein- and lipid-rich Beltian bodies. In Fiji Philidris nagasau (Dolichoderinae) are known to selectively grow species of epiphytic Squamellaria (Rubiaceae) which produce large domatia inside which the ant colonies nest. The ants plant the seeds and the domatia of young seedling are immediately occupied and the ant faeces in them contribute to rapid growth. Similar dispersal associations are found with other dolichoderines {{in the region as}} well. Another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes from the Macaranga tree, which has stems adapted to house colonies of Crematogaster ants.|$|E
