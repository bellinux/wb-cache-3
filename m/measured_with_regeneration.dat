The procedure consists of two parts: retrofit targeting and design for a water network <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> unit(s). In the targeting stage, retrofit targets (utility savings and capital investment) were determined for a range of process parameters (total flowrate and/or outlet concentration of the regeneration unit) to obtain a savings versus investment curve. Next, the existing water network was re-designed to meet the chosen targets. A case study on paper making process was used to demonstrate the new methodology...|$|R

40|$|Many organisms {{have the}} ability to shed an {{appendage}} (autotomy) to escape a predator or fouled molting event. Despite its immediate advantage on survivorship, autotomy can have important consequences for locomotion, foraging, survivorship, and/or reproduction. Thus, regeneration is a way that animals alleviate some of the costs associated with losing an appendage. Like autotomy, however, appendage regeneration can have important consequences for a variety of aspects of fitness; {{in a wide range of}} amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and arthropods, the allocation of resources to regenerate a lost appendage negatively affects somatic or reproductive growth. Previous research into the costs associated <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> has provided a strong framework to explore how trade-offs associated <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> may have influenced its evolution. However, all research to date describing the costs and benefits associated <b>with</b> autotomy and <b>regeneration</b> have compared individuals autotomizing and regenerating an appendage with individuals that have never lost an appendage. I suggest that for studies of the evolutionary significance of regeneration, an alternative comparison is between individuals experiencing autotomy without regeneration and individuals experiencing autotomy <b>with</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Future work in this direction promises new insights into the evolution of regenerative tendencies, as well as how regeneration may be influencing animal form and function.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the relation of}} cricket species richness and composition <b>with</b> forest <b>regeneration</b> time, evaluating canopy and litter depth as environmental drivers. Effects of forest patch area, nearest distance to the 300 -year patch, cricket abundance, sampling sufficiency, and nestedness were also evaluated. We collected 1174 individuals (five families, 19 species). Species richness increased asymptotically <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> time and linearly with canopy cover and litter depth. Canopy cover increased linearly, while litter depth increased asymptotically. Richness was not affected by patch area and nearest distance to the 300 -year patch. Richness increased with cricket abundance, and this explanation could not be distinguished from regeneration time, evidencing collinearity of these two explanatory variables. Rarefaction curve slopes increased <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> time. Species composition differed among patches, with no nested pattern. We suggest that regeneration and consequent increases in canopy and litter promote recovery of cricket biodiversity, abundance, and changes in species composition. We conclude that the recovery of cricket diversity involves an increase along the spatial scale of complementarity, together with a change in species composition...|$|R

40|$|In {{very low}} ambient {{temperature}} regions, both heating capacity and {{coefficient of performance}} (COP) of traditional air-source vapor compression heat pumps drop significantly with a decrease in outdoor air temperature. The current study investigates two alternative technologies for improving the efficiency of vapor compression cycles especially at very low ambient temperatures. The first method is liquid flooded compression <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> in which {{a significant amount of}} non-volatile liquid is mixed into the stream of refrigerant vapor entering the compressor in order to approach an isothermal compression process. The second method is multi-port refrigerant injection during compression and economizing which is similar to multi-stage compression in providing refrigerant cooling between compressor stages and a lower refrigerant quality entering the evaporator. ^ Both technology improvements address the thermodynamic inefficiencies that are inherent within the simple vapor compression cycle that is employed in most heat pumping equipment. The benefits of oil flooding and saturated vapor injection are evaluated using experimental testing of an oil flooded R 410 A scroll compressor and a 2 port saturated vapor injection R 410 A scroll compressor and simulation. The results show that the performance of the compressor increases with oil flooding and saturated vapor injection especially at very low evaporation temperatures. The experimental compressor results were used for system analysis of liquid flooded compression <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> and saturated vapor injection. At - 10 °C ambient temperature, estimated COP (heating) of the flooded compression <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> cycle was 25 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 12. 5 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. For Minneapolis, the seasonal efficiency (heating) of a flooded compression <b>with</b> <b>regeneration</b> cycle was estimated to be 34 % higher while that of the vapor injection cycle was 21 % higher than the standard vapor compression cycle. Both technologies lead to higher energy efficiency and less degradation in heating capacity at low ambient temperatures. Also, a previously developed detailed flooded scroll compressor model has been validated with the oil flooding experimental data, for which good agreement was found. ...|$|R
