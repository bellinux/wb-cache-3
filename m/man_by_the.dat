Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying {{to come up with}} an explanation, they {{wondered}} if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.|$|E

5|$|Other early leather {{preserving}} products {{included the}} Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English <b>man</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under {{the brand name}} Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.|$|E
