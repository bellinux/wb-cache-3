5000|$|The Formation of the Economic Thought of Karl Marx {{received}} a positive review in Telos from James E. Hansen {{when the work}} was published in English in 1971.

The political scientist David McLellan called <b>Mandel's</b> work [...] "excellent" [...] in the 1995 edition of his Karl Marx: His Life and Thought.

40|$|O'Brien {{provides}} a critical assessment of Ernest <b>Mandel's</b> 1975 monograph Late Capitalism. In so doing, {{he offers a}} historical narrative that puts into question <b>Mandel's</b> framing of 'waves' of capitalist development {{as a process of}} capital accumulation that was dependent upon uneven development in the Third World. O'Brien starts by problematising <b>Mandel's</b> argument that an initial concentration of money, capital and bullion in the hands of Europeans explains combined and uneven development. He goes on to demonstrate that <b>Mandel's</b> (and Lenin's) notion of imperialism as a necessary conduit for the flow of surplus capital from industrialising Europe does not stand up to the historical evidence. In fact, O'Brien maintains an alternative thesis, namely that these marginalised regions were insuffciently penetrated by European capital...|$|R

5|$|Former Auburn University {{athlete and}} three-time Olympian Jeremy Knowles competed in three {{events at the}} Beijing Olympics: The 100meters butterfly, the 200meters butterfly, and the 200meters {{individual}} medley.

Knowles ranked third in his heat after completing the event in 53.72seconds, falling behind <b>Mandel</b> by 0.27seconds but beating Hungarian Adam Madrassy by 0.21seconds. Overall, Knowles ranked 49th out of 66th participating athletes, and did not advance.|$|E

5|$|Speedie {{was drafted}} by the National Football League's Detroit Lions in the late rounds of the 1942 draft. Fred <b>Mandel,</b> {{the owner of the}} Lions, visited him at Fort Warren and offered a {{contract}} worth $2,800 a year. Speedie wanted to sign immediately, but <b>Mandel</b> preferred to wait until after the war. By the time the war drew to a close in 1945, however, Speedie was considering signing with the Chicago Rockets, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He was pursued by the Rockets after playing well against a team at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from which many of the Rockets' players were drawn. Speedie was also spotted by Paul Brown, who had been the head coach of a military team at Great Lakes Naval Station that played against the Broncos. Brown, who was starting a new AAFC team called the Cleveland Browns, sent a friend named Jackie Ranen to sign Speedie for $7,000 in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In the west, NY164 splits {{off from}} NY311 a short {{distance}} east of I-84. It crosses under the Metro North tracks three times, including two one-lane underpasses with limited sight to the other side. It passes along the northern base of a small mountain and turns slightly southward. The highway turns due eastward and intersects with County Route64 in the hamlet of Towners. Just to the north is <b>Mandel</b> Pond, and the route makes a series of erratic turns around small mountains, passing south of Cornwall Hill as it does so. NY164 turns south-southeast and ends at NY22 in Patterson, east of the East Branch Croton River.|$|E
5|$|Of Human Feelings was {{recorded}} with a Sony PCM-1600 two-track digital recorder, a rare item at the time. According to journalist Howard <b>Mandel,</b> the passages {{played by the}} band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album, {{because it had been}} mixed with a middle-frequency range and compressed dynamics. Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided overdubbing, multi-tracking, and remixing. According to him, Of Human Feelings was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Around 12 {{percent of}} Auschwitz's 6,500 staff {{who survived the}} war were {{eventually}} brought to trial. Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial. On 25 November 1947, the Auschwitz Trial began in Kraków, when Poland's Supreme National Tribunal brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff. The trial's defendants included commandant Arthur Liebehenschel, women's camp leader Maria <b>Mandel,</b> and camp leader Hans Aumeier. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, 7 life sentences, and 9 prison sentences ranging from three to fifteen years. Hans Münch, an SS doctor who had several former prisoners testify on his behalf, {{was the only person}} to be acquitted.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred <b>Mandel</b> (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E
5|$|Leopold's {{decision}} to surrender was seized {{on by the}} British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilité de régner), and resolved to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly denounce the King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and in sympathy with the Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges <b>Mandel</b> to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society {{and supported by the}} church, led to a big loss of public support and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.|$|E
