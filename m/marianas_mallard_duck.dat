50|$|The <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> or Oustalet's <b>duck</b> (Anas oustaleti) is an extinct type of duck of {{the genus}} Anas that was endemic to the Mariana Islands. Its taxonomic status is debated, and it has {{variously}} been treated as a full species, a subspecies of the mallard or the Pacific black duck, or sometimes as a subspecies of the Indian spot-billed duck.|$|R

50|$|After Salvadori, most taxonomists, such as Dean Amadon and Ernst Mayr, {{considered}} it a subspecies of the mallard. Yoshimaro Yamashina examined those specimens in Japanese museums in 1948, and decided that the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> {{was an example of}} hybrid speciation, and was descended from the mallard and the Pacific black duck's Palau subspecies (Anas superciliosa pelewensis). However, no molecular genetic evidence is available to support this hypothesis. Some scientists, such as Jean Delacour, have considered the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> a simple hybrid, so it was absent from Delacour's four-volume monograph on the ducks and from the IUCN Red List. If Yamashina's hypothesis is correct, the <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard</b> would have presumably evolved into near species status in only about ten thousand years.|$|R
50|$|Neither <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallards</b> nor their {{progenitor}} {{species are}} known from fossils on the Marianas, casting into doubt {{the assumption that}} a resident black duck population had been long established on the islands. However, most rock shelters and caves on the Marianas were obliterated in the 1944 Battle of Guam. A species of flightless duck is known from a prehistoric bone found on Rota in 1994; was apparently not {{closely related to the}} <b>Mariana</b> <b>mallard.</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{suitability}} of propofol for minor diagnostic or thera-peutic procedures in mute swans (Cygnus olor) and <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> (Anas platyrhynchos). In the present study 30 free-living mute swans and seven <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> were given propofol as part of minor diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures. The birds were randomly divided into two groups. Induction of anesthesia was accomplished by administering 8 mg/kg of propofol. The birds of the first group were given additional boluses (2 - 4 mg/kg of propofol every one to seven minutes) as required to attain a light plain of anesthesia. In the other birds the induction was followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of propofol (0. 85 mg/kg/min). After receiving the loading dose no bird showed apnea and all birds could be easily intubated. Periodic bolus injection requires constant assessment and adjustment of anesthetic depth. Birds woke up unexpectedly during anesthesia with bolus administration. Therefore constant rate infusion is superior to and much more practical than bolus administration. Body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, saturation with oxygen and reflexes were comparable in both groups. In mute swans the loss in body temperature was 0. 75 °C (bolus) and 0. 85 °C (CRI) within 35 minutes, and in <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> 0. 8 °C (bolus) and 0. 9 °C (CRI) within 35 minutes. Heart rate decreased from 164 to 129 bpm (bolus) and from 221 to 191 bpm (CRI) in mute swans, and from 310 to 210 bpm (bolus) and from 367 to 337 bpm (CRI) in <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks.</b> Respiratory rate varied in mute swans during anesthesia with boluses and decreased during CRI from eight to 12 breaths per minute. In <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> the respiratory rate did not change significantly over time (bolus) and decreased during CRI from 37 to 34 breaths per minute. Saturation with oxygen varied in all birds, increased in mute swans from 69 % to 81 % (bolus) and in <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> from 61 % to 88 % (bolus) and from 79 % to 82 % (CRI). There was no increase of saturation with oxygen in mute swans during CRI. During CRI all mute swans and during boluses and CRI all <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> had corneal reflex. During boluses corneal reflex was temporarily delayed in three mute swans and lost in one. The swallowing reflex was lost in most birds and delayed in some birds. Most birds always displayed pedal reflex. All birds recovered from anesthesia without any long-term effects. At the latest 40 minutes after the end of anesthesia all birds had fully recovered. 60 % (12 / 30) of the mute swans and 71 % (5 / 7) of the <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> examined showed transient signs of central nervous system excitement during recovery, which subsided after a few minutes. Besides respiratory depress-sion and excitatory phenomena during recovery, no other side effects of propofol occurred during this study. Propofol is a good anesthetic agent for minor procedures in mute swans and <b>mallard</b> <b>ducks</b> – especially given as constant rate infusion...|$|R
