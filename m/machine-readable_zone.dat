25|$|The {{name that}} appears in the <b>machine-readable</b> <b>zone</b> {{at the bottom of}} the visa {{represents}} the holder’s Cyrillic name mapped into the Roman alphabet. This allows Russian computer systems to read the Cyrillic name, despite the machine readers only being able to read Roman alphabet letters. As a result, the spelling of a name in the <b>machine-readable</b> <b>zone</b> does not necessarily reflect its spelling in the visa’s name field. For example, the name “Christoph” would appear in the field as “Kpиcтoф/Christoph”, but the MRZ would contain the name “Kristof”.|$|E

5000|$|Most travel {{passports}} worldwide are MRPs. They are standardized by the ICAO Document 9303 (endorsed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission as ISO/IEC 7501-1) {{and have}} a special <b>machine-readable</b> <b>zone</b> (MRZ), which is usually {{at the bottom of}} the identity page at the beginning of a passport. The ICAO Document 9303 describes three types of documents. Usually passport booklets are issued in [...] "Type 3" [...] format, while identity cards and passport cards typically use the [...] "Type 1" [...] format.The <b>machine-readable</b> <b>zone</b> of a Type 3 travel document spans two lines, and each line is 44 characters long.

5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that Russian visas (and Russian {{internal}} passports since 2011) are intended for use in Russia only, there are certain other Latin letters as well as other alphanumerical symbols used to transliterate the letter with no direct analogue in Latin script into the <b>machine-readable</b> <b>zone.</b> As an example, the letter [...] "ч" [...] is usually transcribed as [...] "ch" [...] in Russian travel documents, however, Russian visas and internal passports use [...] "3" [...] in the <b>machine-readable</b> <b>zone</b> instead.
