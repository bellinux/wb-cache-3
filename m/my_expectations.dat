500|$|Howe himself {{wrote to}} Burgoyne on 17 July that he {{intended}} to stay close to Washington: [...] "My intention is for Pennsylvania, where I expect to meet Washington, but if he goes to the northward contrary to <b>my</b> <b>expectations,</b> and you can keep him at bay, be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you." [...] This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson. [...] Howe, however, sailed from New York on 23 July. [...] On 30 August, shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk, Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne, citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} Test, in which White took the solitary wicket of Sachin Tendulkar, Ponting said [...] "He's come along in leaps and bounds in his bowling. [...] He's {{probably}} exceeded <b>my</b> <b>expectations</b> with what he's done, although he did not take the wickets." [...] White improved his return in the second Test, claiming three wickets, but only took one more in the last two matches. [...] Although Ponting extolled White in public, he once again often opted to use the part-time spin of Clarke before and more frequently than White throughout the series. [...] White's five wickets on the tour came at a bowling average of almost 70, and with Symonds named in Test squad to face New Zealand, there was no place in the squad for White.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{starred in}} {{and served as}} {{executive}} producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting for Ophelia, which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: [...] "I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." [...] Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she [...] "believe in this project, and <b>my</b> <b>expectations</b> have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: [...] "You can support art even if it's {{not going to make}} a zillion dollars."

But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} divided {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7.9/10, saying, [...] "Overall, while it's {{far from being}} the funniest episode of the season, there were more than enough laughs and uncomfortable moments to make this episode entertaining." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the episode could have been more though, due to the fact that the show has used many clever gay jokes in the past. Likewise, Alex Rocha of TV Guide commented, [...] "'Family Gay' fell way short of <b>my</b> <b>expectations.</b> Even with its traditional pop culture references and flashbacks, this week's episode could not simply keep me tuned in. I'll admit, I did manage to laugh at times, but as in previous times, Family Guy simply fell short again." [...] Steve Heisler from The A.V. Club gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "yet another pointless exercise in Family Guy insider smugness", and rating it C-.|$|E

Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt [...] "very much disappointed in <b>my</b> <b>expectations</b> of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed {{in the way of}} my getting on shore and making collections" [...] while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo, and stayed there with three others when the Beagle left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of [...] in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to go back. A seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River, and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July.|$|E

[...] Casting directors suggested Evans to Bong, who initially had misconceptions of Evans before they met due to the [...] "caricature of the American all muscle", but quickly departed from that notion and described Evans as [...] " [...] he's actually very sensitive and has a quiet and introverted side. He's a very, very smart person, and he's a director." [...] Bong {{was introduced to the}} films Puncture and Sunshine where he described Evans' performances as showing his [...] "sensitive acting abilities". Bong and Evans spent months talking about the dialogue, and Bong received help from the cast and crew including Evans due to it being his first English language film.

Explaining, [...] "He's supposed to be in the poor tail section for 17 years, eating only protein blocks, and it was tricky to hide all of that muscle mass with costume and make-up."
