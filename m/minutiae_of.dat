Influenced by Walter Rauschenbusch and the Social Gospel movement, McGovern began divinity studies at Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, near Chicago. He preached as a Methodist student supply minister at Diamond Lake Church in Mundelein, Illinois, during 1946 and 1947, but became dissatisfied by the <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> his pastoral duties. In late 1947, McGovern left the ministry and enrolled in graduate studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, {{where he also}} worked as a teaching assistant. The relatively small history program there was {{among the best in}} the country and McGovern took courses given by noted academics Ray Allen Billington, Richard W. Leopold, and L. S. Stavrianos. He received an M.A. in history in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
5|$|William III's {{victory at}} the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 (O.S.) forced JamesII to abandon his army and flee back to France. In August Marlborough himself left for Ireland engaged upon his first {{independent}} command – a land/sea operation upon the southern ports of Cork and Kinsale. It was a bold, imaginative project aimed at disrupting Jacobite supply routes, and one which the Earl conceived and executed with outstanding success. Cork fell on 27 September (O.S.), and Kinsale followed in mid-October. Although the campaign did not end the war in Ireland as Marlborough hoped, it taught him {{the significance of the}} <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> logistics, and the importance of cooperation and tact when working alongside other senior Allied commanders. It would, however, be more than ten years before he once again took charge in the field.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E

25|$|The {{plots and}} subplots of the episodes are {{established}} in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with Seinfeld, which David co-created, {{the subject matter}} in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, {{as well as his}} annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E
25|$|The {{mansion in}} the village overlooks Rutland Water. The house in the manner {{associated}} with Sir Christopher Wren, {{was built in the}} 1690s by the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who was to a large extent his own architect and involved himself in the <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> construction, but employed Henry Dormer (died 1727) to supervise its building. Nottingham replaced Dormer with John Lumley in 1697. Before embarking on the project, Lord Nottingham consulted Sir Christopher Wren and had measurements taken at Berkeley House and Montagu House in London. The house, in an H-plan, has a pedimented central block and lightly projecting end pavilions. With its symmetrical wings and outbuildings forming a cour d'honneur, and segmental walling linking matching blocks in a larger outer grassed court, it forms one of the most ambitious aristocratic ensembles of the late seventeenth century.|$|E

In 1932, after six years in London, the Tates returned to Nairobi {{for the opening of}} the New Stanley Long Bar. Fred Tate kept busy with the constant appraisal of the hotel's guests, and the <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> things such as the daily menu. After Fred's death in 1937, Mayence's interest in managing the hotel's affairs waned. She eventually sold the hotel to Abraham Lazarus Block, a Jewish Lithuanian entrepreneur, in 1947, although she still maintained a financial interest.

The ambassadors of Rupert, King of the Romans, were then given audience. The Bishop of Verden, Ulrich von Albeck, made a strong {{statement}} against the pretensions of the Council itself, listing twenty-four objections of various kinds that the Germans wished to propound; most involved <b>minutiae</b> <b>of</b> Canon Law. Finally, the German delegation proposed a meeting between the Pisans and Pope Gregory at a mutually agreeable place, a proposition which was old and which had already failed several times. The speech was not well-received, but a response was promised for the next general Session, which was scheduled for April 24. In the meantime, a Sunday sermon by the Dominican Bishop of Digne attacked nearly all the German criticisms, and, seeing nothing to be gained, the German embassy departed Pisa, appealing their grievances to a future council, to be called by Gregory XII. The Council, wishing to proceed through generosity rather than rigor, and since some personages were understood to be en route, aannounced {{a continuation of the}} cases. Throughout the month of May testimonies were heard against the claimants, but the formal declaration of contumacy did not take place until the fourteenth session.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of fingerprint individuality can be posed as follows: Given a query fingerprint, {{what is the}} probability that the observed number <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> matches with a template fingerprint is purely due to chance? An assessment of this probability can be made by estimating the variability inherent in fingerprint minutiae. We develop a compound stochastic model that is able to capture three main sources <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> variability in actual fingerprint databases. The compound stochastic models are used to synthesize realizations <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> matches from which numerical estimates of fingerprint individuality can be derived. Experiments on the FVC 2002 DB 1 and IBM HURSLEY databases show that the probability of obtaining a 12 minutiae match purely due to chance is 1. 6 × 10 − 5 when the number <b>of</b> <b>minutiae</b> in the query and template fingerprints are both 46. ...|$|R
