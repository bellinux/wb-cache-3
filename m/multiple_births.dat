5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. <b>Multiple</b> <b>births</b> in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E
5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. <b>Multiple</b> <b>births</b> are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E
25|$|A {{multiple}} birth is {{the culmination of}} one multiple pregnancy, wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter, and <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> may be more common than single births. <b>Multiple</b> <b>births</b> in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{apparent}} that many fertility patients consider <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> an ideal treatment outcome. We wished to evaluate the desire for <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> among patients, {{and the effect of}} patient demographics and recognition of the increased fetal risks of multiple pregnancy on this desire. METHODS: This was a prospective questionnaire study completed by 801 male and female infertility patients attending a tertiary level Canadian university fertility clinic. Two logistic regression analyses were performed with desire for <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> with next fertility treatment and recognition of the increased fetal risks of multiple pregnancy as the dependent variables. RESULTS: 41 % of patients desired a <b>multiple</b> <b>birth.</b> Increasing duration of infertility or previous assisted reproductive treatment increased, and having previous children or recognition of the increased fetal risks decreased, this desire. Patient age or sex did not affect desire for <b>multiple</b> <b>birth.</b> Previous assisted reproductive treatment was associated with increased recognition of the fetal risks of multiple pregnancy.

25|$|The {{number of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> has {{increased}} over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. Much of the increase can probably {{be attributed to the}} impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization. Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH, followed by intrauterine insemination, are particularly at risk for <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> of higher order.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study on}} the {{maternity}} records of 5750 Hausa women living in the Savannah zone of Nigeria, there were 40 twins and 2 triplets per 1000 births. Twenty-six percent of twins were monozygotic. The incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>births,</b> which was about five times higher than that observed in any western population, was significantly lower than that of other ethnic groups, who live in the hot and humid climate of {{the southern part of the}} country. The incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> was related to maternal age but did not bear any association to the climate or prevalence of malaria.|$|E

25|$|Cerebral palsy is {{more common}} among <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 {{survivors}} in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England. This is likely {{a side effect of}} premature birth and low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|Twins {{are by far}} {{the most}} common form of <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30.|$|E
40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>birth,</b> {{which is}} {{associated}} with adverse fetal, infant, and maternal outcomes, is increasingly related {{to the use of}} in vitro fertilization (IVF). Among women undergoing IVF who use their own eggs, greater maternal age {{is associated with}} decreased risk of multiple birth; using donor eggs from younger women may negate this age effect. Data from 6, 936 IVF procedures performed in the United States in 1996 – 1997 on women aged 35 – 54 years who used donor eggs were analyzed to assess the effect of maternal age, number of embryos transferred, and cryopreservation of extra, nontransferred embryos (an indicator of higher embryo quality) on risk of <b>multiple</b> <b>birth.</b> Greater maternal age did not decrease multiple-birth risk. Rates of <b>multiple</b> <b>birth</b> were related to number of embryos transferred and whether extra embryos had been cryopreserved, and they were high compared with those of IVF patients the same age who had used their own eggs. Among women who had extra embryos cryopreserved, transferring more than two embryos increased multiple-birth risk, with no corresponding increase in the chance for a livebirth. These results highlight the need to consider the age of the donor and embryo quality when making embryo transfer decisions involving use of donor eggs.

25|$|Human <b>multiple</b> <b>births</b> {{can occur}} either {{naturally}} (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) {{or as the}} result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).|$|E
25|$|From 1980 to 1997, {{the number}} of twin births in the United States rose 52%.

25|$|Stillbirths {{occurs when}} a fetus dies after 20 weeks of gestation. There {{are two types of}} stillbirth, {{including}} intrauterine death and intrapartum death.

The cause of stillbirth is often unknown, but the rate of babies who are stillborn is higher in twins and <b>multiple</b> <b>births.</b> Caesareans or inductions are advised after 38 weeks of pregnancy for twins, because the risk of stillbirth increases after this time.|$|E
