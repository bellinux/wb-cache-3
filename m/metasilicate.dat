2500|$|Layer silicates, such as {{the clay}} {{minerals}} and the micas, are very common, and are often formed by horizontal cross-linking of <b>metasilicate</b> chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is kaolinite {{in many of these}} minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral SiIV may be replaced by AlIII, octahedral AlIII by MgII, and OH− by F−. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO2 structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the SiIV atoms with AlIII they require more cations {{to be included in the}} structure to balance charge. Examples include feldspars (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), zeolites, and ultramarines. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi3O8–KAlSi3O8–CaAl2Si2O8. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting AlIII to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the Mohorovičić discontinuity, which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks (truncated cuboctahedra being most common, but other polyhedra are also known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl−, , and , but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.|$|E

2500|$|The orthosilicates MSiO (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO4 are neso-silicates.

Zircon, ZrSiO4, demands eight-coordination of the ZrIV cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84pm). Also significant are the garnets, , in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe).

Objective: To study the effect of various thermal processing on the crystallization kinetics, crystallite microstructure, and strength of LS 2. Methods: The control group of the LS 2 samples was heated using the standard manufacturer heating-schedule. Two experimental groups were tested: (1) an extended temperature range (750 - 840 °C vs. 820 - 840 °C) at the segment of 30 °C/min heating rate, and (2) a protracted holding time (14 min vs. 7 min) at the isothermal temperature of 840 °C. Five other groups of different heating schedules with lower-targeted temperatures were evaluated to investigate the microstructural changes. For each group, the crystalline phases and morphologies were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) respectively. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to determine the activation energy of LS 2 under non-isothermal conditions. A MTS universal testing machine was used to measure 3 -point flexural strength and fracture toughness, and elastic modulus and hardness were measured by the MTS Nanoindenter® XP. A one-way ANOVA/Tukey was performed per property (alpha = 0. 05). Results: DSC, XRD, and SEM revealed three distinct microstructures during LS 2 crystallization. Significant {{differences were found between the}} control group, the two aforementioned experimental groups, and the five lower-targeted-temperature groups per property (p< 0. 05). The activation energy for lithium disilicate growth was 667. 45 (± 28. 97) KJ/mole. Conclusions: Groups with the extended temperature range (750 - 840 °C) and protracted holding time (820 - 840 °C H 14) produced significantly higher elastic-modulus and hardness properties than the control group but showed similar significant flexural-strength and fracture-toughness properties with the control group.

30|$|Mineral {{dissolution}} reactions actively {{participate in}} controlling {{the composition of}} mineral water. In this study, water soluble, acidic–alkaline and carbonated solution experiments were designed, and mineral reaction mechanisms were researched using chemical kinetics and the minimum free-energy method.

In the water soluble experiment, the release process of <b>metasilicate</b> in powdered rocks reached equilibrium after 40  days, while <b>metasilicate</b> in solid rocks took 170  days. The release process of <b>metasilicate</b> in solid rocks satisfied an asymptotic model, while in powdered rocks it accorded with the Stanford reaction kinetic model. In the acidic–alkaline experiment, <b>metasilicate</b> was released earlier under acidic conditions (2.46  < pH <  7) than under alkaline conditions (7  < pH <  10.61). The release process of <b>metasilicate</b> under acidic conditions reached equilibrium in 40  days, compared with 60  days for alkaline conditions. The addition of CO 2 to the water solution was beneficial to the formation of <b>metasilicate.</b> Under neutral pH conditions, the reaction barely occurred.

30|$|In the {{condition}} of neutral pH, <b>metasilicate</b> formation was mainly from the hydrolysis of SiO 2, but the reaction was difficult.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1 b for the slag {{basicity}} of 1.1, the mineralogical phases composed of melilite, anorthite, calcium <b>metasilicate</b> and wollastonite, were the {{similar to those}} in the slag with basicity of 1.0 with the declining of temperature. The crystallization temperature of melilite and calcium <b>metasilicate</b> increased to 1406.3 and 1247.4  °C, respectively, while those of anorthite and transforming temperature of calcium <b>metasilicate</b> declined to 1286.8 and 1156.7  °C, respectively. Compared with the crystallization quantities of different mineralogical phases in Fig.  1 a, the mass ratio of melilite increased to 93.43  %, while those of anorthite, calcium <b>metasilicate</b> and its transformation product, namely wollastonite, declined observably.|$|E
30|$|In {{the water}} soluble experiment, the release process of <b>metasilicate</b> for the {{powdered}} sample matched the Stanford reaction kinetic model, while {{the process of}} <b>metasilicate</b> release for the solid sample followed an asymptotic model. In the powdered sample experiments, rock particles and the reaction solution have full contact, leading to an increased reaction rate and to the reaction reaching equilibrium faster. In the acidic–alkaline experiment, the release process of <b>metasilicate</b> for the powdered samples all matched the Stanford reaction kinetic model, but the reaction mechanisms differed. For alkaline experiments (7.00  < pH <  10.61), <b>metasilicate</b> formation is produced by the hydrolysis of SiO 2, plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene, but the secondary minerals also inhibit the reaction by covering {{the surface of the}} rock samples. For acidic (2.46  < pH <  7.00) experiments, <b>metasilicate</b> formation is predominantly from the reaction of H+ and SiO 2, plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene. The addition of CO 2 can adjust the pH of the solution (Aiman and Al 2010). In the carbonated solution experiment, the release process of <b>metasilicate</b> with the initially neutral or alkaline solutions complied with the Boltzmann reaction kinetic model, while initially acidic solutions complied with the Stanford reaction kinetic model. For the carbonated experiment, <b>metasilicate</b> formation is mainly from the reaction of CO 2 and H 2 O, plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxene. Since CO 2 reacted as an aqueous solution, its products were H 2 CO 3 with a neutral or alkaline pH, meaning the rate of <b>metasilicate</b> release is relatively small initially, until the pH of the reaction solution becomes acidic.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{the main}} mineralogical {{phase of the}} slag system was melilite. Both {{crystallization}} temperature and mass ratio of melilite increased with the increasing MgO content.

With the increasing of MgO content, the mass ratio of anorthite, calcium <b>metasilicate</b> and wollastonite crystallized declined. Finally, anorthite and calcium <b>metasilicate</b> were replaced by pyroxene and spinel, respectively, as MgO content increased to 12  %.|$|E
30|$|The {{release process}} of <b>metasilicate</b> of solid rocks was slower {{than that of}} {{powdered}} rocks in the same experimental conditions; and the release process of <b>metasilicate</b> of solid rocks satisfied asymptotic model while that of powdered rocks fit in with Stanford reaction kinetic model.|$|E

It was showed that the mass ratio of melilite was 40.29  % at the temperature of calcium <b>metasilicate</b> crystallization, which was much less than crystallization amount as MgO content was 9  %. When the temperature declined {{to the point of}} anorthite crystallization, the mass ratios of melilite and calcium <b>metasilicate</b> crystallized were 56.02 and 7.6  %, respectively. At 1179.7  °C, unstable calcium <b>metasilicate</b> should transform the species of wollastonite, and the mass ratio of melilite, anorthite and wollastonite were 24.61, 64.67 and 11.04  %, respectively.|$|E
30|$|In general, {{the main}} mineralogical {{phases of the}} slag systems were melilite and anorthite, which {{crystallization}} temperature could be improved along with the increasing of Al 2 O 3 content.
