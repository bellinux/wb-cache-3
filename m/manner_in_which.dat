The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what is sought from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit {{up out of the}} ground to learn the future).|$|E

Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging.

5|$|Fairman {{writes that}} legal {{precedent}} regarding {{use of the}} word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions.

He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses the <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words {{that can be used in}} speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon freedom of thought.|$|E
