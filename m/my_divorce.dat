She said, [...] "In {{the early part of}} my life, I liked light-skinned guys better than dark-skinned guys. The people I've dated since <b>my</b> <b>divorce</b> have been white because I haven't been in a circle where {{there were a lot of}} black people. I can't say that I'm not still attracted to black men. My preference is a very light-skinned black man. And my preference in white men is blond. But I haven't seen any black or white men that I've liked lately." ...|$|E

I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song means to me – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad time in my life.|$|E

[...] Soames uttered a curious little grunt, and the two {{remained}} a full minute without speaking. 'Like wax!' thought Jolyon, watching that close face, where the flush was fast subsiding. 'He'll never give me a sign of what he's thinking, or going to do. Like wax!' And he transferred his gaze to a plan of that flourishing town, 'By-Street on Sea,' the future existence of which lay exposed on the wall to the possessive instincts of the firm's clients. The whimsical thought flashed through him: 'I wonder if I shall get a bill of costs for this--"To attending Mr. Jolyon Forsyte in the matter of <b>my</b> <b>divorce,</b> to receiving his account of his visit to my wife, and to advising him to go and see her again, sixteen and eightpence."' ...|$|E

And suddenly I felt I couldn't go on working, working, working; I was so tired, I felt so ill. I told him about my husband. He offered {{to give me the}} money to get <b>my</b> <b>divorce</b> if I would marry him as soon as I could. He had a very good job, and it wouldn't be necessary for me to do anything unless I wanted to. He was so fond of me and so anxious to take care of me. I was awfully touched.

60|$|The {{taking up}} of {{experimental}} work produced a great {{change in my}} personal habits. I have told how already once in my life at Wimblehurst I had a period of discipline and continuous effort, and how, when I came to South Kensington, I became demoralised by the immense effect of London, by its innumerable imperative demands upon my attention and curiosity. And I parted with much of my personal pride when I gave up science {{for the development of}} Tono-Bungay. But my poverty kept me abstinent and my youthful romanticism kept me chaste until my married life was well under way. Then in all directions I relaxed. I did a large amount of work, but I never troubled to think whether it was my maximum nor whether the moods and indolences that came to me at times were avoidable things. With the coming of plenty I ate abundantly and foolishly, drank freely and followed my impulses more and more carelessly. I felt no reason why I should do anything else. Never at any point did I use myself to the edge of my capacity. The emotional crisis of <b>my</b> <b>divorce</b> did not produce any immediate change in these matters of personal discipline. I found some difficulty at first in concentrating my mind upon scientific work, it was so much more exacting than business, but I got over that difficulty by smoking. I became an inordinate cigar smoker; it gave me moods of profound depression, but I treated these usually by the homeopathic method,--by lighting another cigar. I didn't realise at all how loose my moral and nervous fibre had become until I reached the practical side of my investigations and was {{face to face with the}} necessity of finding out just how it felt to use a glider and just what a man could do with one.|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} to my office to spend an uneasy morning. My sorrow for Mr. Watling was genuine, but {{nevertheless}} I found myself compelled to consider an honour no man lightly refuses. Had it presented itself at any other time, had it been due to a happier situation than that brought about by the illness of a man whom I loved and admired, I should have thought the prospect dazzling indeed, part and parcel of my amazing luck. But now--now I was in an emotional state that distorted the factors of life, all those things I hitherto had valued; even such a prize as this I weighed in terms of one supreme desire: how would the acceptance of the senatorship affect the accomplishment of this desire? That was the question. I began making rapid calculations: the actual election would take place in the legislature a year from the following January; provided I were able to overcome Nancy's resistance--which I was determined to do--nothing in the way of divorce proceedings could be thought of for more than a year; and I feared delay. On the other hand, if we waited until after I had been duly elected to get <b>my</b> <b>divorce</b> and marry Nancy my chances of reelection would be small. What did I care for the senatorship anyway--if I had her? and I wanted her now, as soon as I could get her. She--a life with her represented new values, new values I did not define, that made all I had striven for in the past of little worth. This was a bauble compared with the companionship of the woman I loved, the woman intended for me, who would give me peace of mind and soul and develop those truer aspirations that had long been thwarted and starved for lack of her. Gradually, as she regained the ascendency over my mind she ordinarily held--and from which she had been temporarily displaced by the arrival of Mr. Watling's letter and the talk in the bank--I became impatient and irritated by the intrusion. But what answer should I give to Dickinson and Gorse? what excuse for declining such an offer? I decided, as may be imagined, to wait, to temporize.|$|E
