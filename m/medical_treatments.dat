Controversial results still exist regarding the effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in non-ischemic heart failure. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for randomized trials comparing implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in combination with <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> versus <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> for non-ischemic heart failure. The primary endpoint was incidence of all-cause death. We derived pooled risk ratios with fixed-effects models. Results: Five studies enrolling 2573 patients were included.

5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause.

40|$|It is now claimed {{more than}} ever that the {{relationship}} between <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and social welfare be more cooperative. Probably {{there has never been a}} time in history the mutual relationship between these two areas has been taken as seriously as it is now. An aging society has generated new kinds of diseases to which the traditional treatment of curing can not be given. It requires <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> to be changed "from curing to caring". In order to meet the social demands, medical science has developed a new field which is called "caring medical treatment". This is a new concept which came after the two traditional fields of medical treatment: preventive <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and rehabilitative <b>treatment.</b> Although both <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and social welfare are essentially concerned with people's private lives, in order to receive services from these two areas, people should depend heavily on public organizations, especially administrative agencies. In these organizations, which actually conduct duties of both <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and social welfare, conflicts occur from time to time. I do not think I need to say here that a caring program should not consist solely of assistance for personal needs and daily activities of a patient. It is necessary for a caring program to include a rehabilitative program in it so that caring <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> can be established as an independent field of <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> In other words, caring <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> needs to be developed to retain a function of rehabilitative <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> I am sure that what insurance system for the elderly under consideration ought to be will be a conclusive factor when the characteristics of caring <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> become distinct. As long as this system primarily deals with assistance for personal needs and remains in the field of social welfare, it will no longer be able to establish caring <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> as the fourth-newly-developed field of <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> The final goal of an assisting program for daily activities of a patient is to help him/her to become independent. In order to achieve this goal, we need to establish and promote an appropriate rehabilitation program which can be provided for a patient as soon as he/she has gone into remission. Therefore, it is necessary to connect caring <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> with rehabilitative <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> organically...|$|R

5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative <b>medical</b> <b>treatments.</b> It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E

40|$|Background : Central poststroke pain(CPSP) {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} lesion or {{dysfunction}} of the brain from stroke and may cause many difficulty in the social activities and daily life. In this study, we evaluate the clinical effectiveness of east-west medical management for CPSP through VAS(visual analogue scale), infrared themography, MBI(Moderfied Barthel Index) and Rankin scale. Methods : We treated thirty patients with oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> method and western & oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> method. Each group has fifteen patients of the CPSP. We evaluated their pain(characterizes tingling and burning sensation, aching, hyperalgesia, and allodynia) through VAS(visual analog scale) pain score, the skin temperature of pain site by infrared thermography and assessed their mobility & rehabilitation ability through MBI(Moderfied Barthel Index), Rankin scale before and after pain treatment. Results : The skin temperature of pain site was lower than non-pain site. The difference of skin temperature improved from 0. 65 ± 0. 45 ℃ to 0. 39 ± 0. 25 ℃ after oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and 0. 68 ± 0. 54 ℃ to 0. 27 ± 0. 24 ℃ after western & oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> VAS scores improved from 7. 9 ± 1. 4 ℃ to 4. 7 ± 1. 6 ℃ after oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and 8. 1 ± 1. 3 ℃ to 4. 6 ± 1. 2 ℃ after western & oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> MBI scores improved from 61. 40 ± 13. 58 ℃ to 85. 00 ± 13. 85 ℃ after oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and to after western & oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> And Rankin scale scores improved from 3. 33 ± 0. 72 ℃ to 2. 46 ± 0. 74 ℃ after oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> and 3. 06 ± 0. 82 ℃ to 2. 66 ± 0. 81 ℃ after western & oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> Conclusion : The difference of skin temperature and Rankin scale scores more significantly improved after western & oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> than oriental <b>medical</b> <b>treatment.</b> According to the results, we thought east-west medical management is very useful treatment for CPSP and rehabilitation of the patients with stroke...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: Over {{the last}} 50 years, <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> of solid cancers gained major {{advances}} {{in terms of}} effectiveness through breakthrough knowledge of cancer biology, technology development and identification of fundamental active drugs. State of the Art: We conventionally discriminate between <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> of the advanced or metastatic disease and of the early disease, namely adjuvant and neoadjuvant or primary treatment, if administered after or before surgery. New drugs or treatment associations can be sequentially introduced in <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> of cancer patients in phase I, II and III clinical trials. No drug or drug association can be proposed in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting of treatment without proven effectiveness in the advanced disease. Primary endpoints of <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> according to the phase of the disease are safety, activity and efficacy. Different options of <b>medical</b> <b>treatment</b> may be selected for each tumor according to the specific phase of disease.
