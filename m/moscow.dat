5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against <b>Moscow,</b> codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on <b>Moscow</b> proved hazardous, as <b>Moscow</b> had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{attributed}} his recall to <b>Moscow</b> {{to mental}} disorder {{on the part}} of Stalin, who feared conspiracies in <b>Moscow</b> matching those which the ruler believed to have occurred in the fabricated Leningrad case, in which many of that city's Party officials had been falsely accused of treason. Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in <b>Moscow</b> city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to <b>Moscow</b> to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.|$|E

Major infrastructure projects began during the 2000s in order to modernise and connect the regional bloc to other markets, facilitating both integration and trade in the region.

5|$|With {{the ground}} {{hardening}} {{due to the}} cold weather, The Germans resumed the attack on <b>Moscow</b> on 15 November. Although the troops themselves were now able to advance again, {{there had been no}} improvement in the supply situation. Facing the Germans were the 5th, 16th, 30th, 43rd, 49th, and 50th Soviet Armies. The Germans intended to move the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies across the <b>Moscow</b> Canal and envelop <b>Moscow</b> from the northeast. The 2nd Panzer Group would attack Tula and then close on <b>Moscow</b> from the south. As the Soviets reacted to their flanks, the 4th Army would attack the center. In two weeks of fighting, lacking sufficient fuel and ammunition, the Germans slowly crept towards <b>Moscow.</b> In the south, the 2nd Panzer Group was being blocked. On 22 November, Soviet Siberian units, augmented by the 49th and 50th Soviet Armies, attacked the 2nd Panzer Group and inflicted a defeat on the Germans. The 4th Panzer Group pushed the Soviet 16th Army back, however, and succeeded in crossing the <b>Moscow</b> Canal in an attempt to encircle <b>Moscow.</b>|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to <b>Moscow</b> and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to <b>Moscow</b> either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to <b>Moscow,</b> but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Chief of the OKH, General Franz Halder, Fedor von Bock, the {{commander}} of Army Group Center, and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa argued vehemently in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward <b>Moscow.</b> Besides the psychological importance of capturing the Soviet capital, the generals pointed out that <b>Moscow</b> was a major center of arms production, {{the center of the}} Soviet communications system and an important transport hub. Intelligence reports indicated that the bulk of the Red Army was deployed near <b>Moscow</b> under Semyon Timoshenko for the defense of the capital. Panzer commander Heinz Guderian was sent to Hitler by Bock and Halder to argue their case for continuing the assault against <b>Moscow</b> but Hitler issued an order through Guderian (bypassing Bock and Halder) to send Army Group Center's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to <b>Moscow.</b> Convinced by Hitler's argument, Guderian returned to his commanding officers as a convert to the Führer's plan, which earned him their disdain.|$|E
