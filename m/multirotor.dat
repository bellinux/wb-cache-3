50|$|FYAT has {{developed}} a family of unmanned airship as alternatives to unmanned helicopters and <b>multirotors.</b> The main advantage of unmanned blimp over unmanned helicopters and <b>multirotors</b> is that while it can perform the hovering functions, unmanned blimp has much lower operating cost than unmanned helicopters and <b>multirotors.</b> Other advantages included longer endurance and lower maintenance cost. However, {{it is not clear}} if any FYAT unmanned blimp has entered service with Chinese law enforcement or military, because FYAT has not released any information in its marketing effort of unmanned blimps. One of the features of unmanned blimps developed by FYAT is that the landing gear consists of a pair of skids, a rather unusual design among Chinese unmanned blimps.|$|R
