40|$|Abstract — Tremendous {{efforts have}} been made to protect the {{location}} privacy of <b>mobile</b> <b>users.</b> Some of them, e. g., k-anonymity, require the participation of multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> to impede the adversary from tracing. These participating <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> constitute an anonymity set. However, not all <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> are seriously concerned about their location privacy. Therefore, to achieve k-anonymity, we need to provide incentives for <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> to participate in the anonymity set. In this paper, we study the problem of incentive mechanism design for k-anonymity location privacy. We first consider the case where all <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> have the same privacy degree requirement. We then study the case where the requirements are different. Finally, we consider a more challenging case where <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> can cheat about not only their valuations but also their requirements. We design an auction-based incentive mechanism for each of these cases and prove that all the auctions are computational efficient, individually rational, budget-balanced, and truthful. We evaluate the performance of different auctions through extensive simulations. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To enable {{multiple}} <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> {{to transmit}} their signals simultaneously {{over the same}} sub-channels, the virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO) techniques can exploit the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spectrum efficiency gain. Traditional V-MIMO transmission schemes mainly focus on maximizing the throughput of grouped <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> without {{taking into account the}} quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. In this paper, we propose the optimal power allocation schemes with statistical QoS provisionings to maximize the effective capacity of non-collaborative/collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks, respectively. For non-collaborative V-MIMO wireless networks, the <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> in one V-MIMO group transmit signals in-dependently over the same sub-channels. In the view point of existing <b>mobile</b> <b>users,</b> they solely occupy the sub-channels. Thus, the existing <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> employ the QoS-driven single-use...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} dynamic content dis-tribution in publish-subscribe mobile social networks. <b>Mobile</b> <b>users</b> subscribe to the content provider. Then, when new content is created, the provider transmits it to subscribers (i. e., <b>mobile</b> <b>users)</b> through the base station. The <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> who have the social relationship (i. e., <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> in the same community) can transfer the fresh content when they move and meet each other. From the content provider’s perspective, the content transmission policy by the base station can be optimized so {{that the number of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> having the fresh data is maximized subject to the constraint on the maximum waiting time of the new content. An optimization formulation is presented for the content provider to obtain this optimal content transmission policy.

However, the limited contact time and the wireless capacity constrain the amount of data that can be collected by the <b>mobile</b> <b>users.</b> Quality of Service (QoS) becomes very important for <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> to collect sensing data that can maximize their information value. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we are the first to propose a distributed algorithm that can support QoS ubiquitous {{data collection}} for multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>users.</b> Our distributed algorithm constructs the data collection trees adaptively to the dynamic moving speeds and the available capacity of the <b>mobile</b> <b>users.</b> It allocates capacity for receiving high priority data to maximize the information value with low communication overheads. Our algorithm supports smooth data collection for multiple <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> with independent movements. We provide analysis and extensive simulations to evaluate the information value, energy efficiency and scalability of our distributed solution. The results showed that our distributed algorithm can improve information value up to 50 % and reduce energy consumption to half compared with the existing approach.

40|$|Abstract—Dummy-based anonymization {{techniques}} for protecting location privacy of <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> {{have been proposed}} in the literature. By generating dummies that move in humanlike trajectories, [8] shows that location privacy of <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> can be preserved. However, by monitoring long-term movement patterns of users, the trajectories of <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> can still be exposed. We argue that, once the trajectory of a user is identified, locations of the user is exposed. Thus, it’s critical to protect the moving trajectories of <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> {{in order to preserve}} user location privacy. We propose two schemes that generate consistent movement patterns in a long run. Guided by three parameters in user specified privacy profile, namely, shortterm disclosure, long-term disclosure and distance deviation, the proposed schemes derive movement trajectories for dummies. A preliminary performance study shows that our approach is more effective than existing work in protecting moving trajectories of <b>mobile</b> <b>users</b> and their location privacy...|$|R
