40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drug that}} has shown therapeutic potential for {{different types of}} cancers, including androgen-independent prostate neoplasms. The antitumor effect of diverse nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs {{has been shown to}} be accompanied by histological and molecular changes that are responsible for this beneficial effect. The objective of the present work was to analyze the histological changes caused by <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Tumors were created in a nude mouse model using PC 3 cancerous human cells. <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 mg/kg/day; experimental group, n= 5) or saline solution (control group, n= 5) was administered intraperitoneally for twenty days. Histological analysis was then carried out on the tumors, describing changes in the cellular architecture, fibrosis, and quantification of cellular proliferation and tumor vasculature. <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> causes histological changes that indicate less tumor aggression (less hypercellularity, fewer atypical mitoses, and fewer nuclear polymorphisms), an increase in fibrosis, and reduced cellular proliferation and tumor vascularity.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} protective effect of resveratrol on human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell phagocytosis against ultraviolet irradiation damage. Cultured RPE cells were exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA, 20 minutes) irradiation, and treated with <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (30 μM, 20 minutes), paxilline (100 μM, 20 minutes) or resveratrol (10 μM, 20 minutes). <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and resveratrol were given after exposure to UVA. Pretreatment with <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> resveratrol or paxilline before UVA irradiation was also performed. Fluorescent latex beads were then fed for 4 hours and the phagocytotic function was assessed by flow cytometry. UVA irradiation inhibited the phagocytic function of human RPE cells. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel activator <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> ameliorated {{the damage caused by}} UVA irradiation. Pretreatment with resveratrol acid also provided protection against damage caused by UVA. Posttreatment with <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> offered mild protection, whereas resveratrol did not. In conclusion, the red wine flavonoid resveratrol ameliorated UVA-mediated inhibition of human RPE phagocytosis.

40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} {{inhibition}} of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis on {{the initiation of}} parturition was studied in 4 groups of 16 sows each. Oral administration of <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (5 =. mg/kg body weight/day) on Days 112, 113 and 114 of pregnancy significantly delayed parturition compared to controls (P < 0 =. 01).

Functional luteolysis as indicated by a decline in maternal progesterone levels began during <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment; the fall in progesterone was then arrested in sows treated only with <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment in late pregnancy modified the normal initiation of lactation, {{as indicated by the}} high concentration of lactose and low concentrations of protein and Na+ in colostrum in treated sows compared to controls.

40|$|<b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> {{has been}} {{successfully}} used in several obstetrical and gynecological disorders sustained by a prostaglandin overproduction. A brief review of <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> use for primary dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and episiotomy pain is followed by an original study of this compound in postsurgical pain and stress. Thirty gynecological patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and 10 pregnant women submitted to cesarean section at term were considered. In gynecological patients, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> suppositories (200 mg) or placebo were given every 12 h during the immediate postsurgical period; pregnant women were given the active drug only. Subjective pain was evaluated [through visual analogue scale (VAS) ] in basal conditions (2 h {{from the end of}} surgery) and 2, 4, 6, 24, and 28 h from the first drug dose. At the same time, blood was drawn for the evaluation of plasma cortical levels (through coated-tube radioimmunoassay). A significant pain relief was obtained after only 4 h posttreatment both in gynecological patients and pregnant women. <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> was superior to placebo from 6 h after treatment and it almost suppressed subjective pain {{at the end of the}} observation period (28 th h). Cortisol levels were already high at the basal evaluation and showed a further increase during the first postsurgery hours. Patients treated with <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> had cortisol values lower than those who were treated with placebo. The former recovered normal levels after 24 h, whereas the latter already had increased values. These data demonstrate that <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> is a safe, powerful and specific analgesic for the postsurgical period. The reduction of pain stimulation is also accompanied by a reduced activation of the neuroendocrine axis with a prompt recovery from postsurgical stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{maternal}} {{administration of}} <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor) to pregnant sheep prevented the dexamethasone-induced delivery of live lambs and delayed delivery after foetal death in utero. Administration of <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> {{had no effect}} on the changes in the levels of progesterone and oestrogen in the plasma which occur before lambing in response to foetal glucocorticoid. Despite normal maternal endocrine changes, increased uterine activity did not occur at the expected time, although it could be elicited by vaginal distension or by administration of oxytocin. The rates of cervical ripening and dilatation were reduced by <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and lambing was frequently associated with some degree of cervical dystocia. Withdrawal of <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> did not immediately result in an increase in the level of prostaglandin F in the plasma despite the appearance of co-ordinated uterine contractions; the concentration of prostaglandin in the plasma was not raised until vaginal passage of the lambs.

40|$|<b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> {{blocks the}} gap {{junction}} {{communication between the}} retinal pigment epithelial cells N Ning 1, 2, Y Wen 3, Y Li 1, 2 and J Li 1, 2 Aim: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to manage the pain and inflamma-tion. NSAIDs can cause serious side effects, including vision problems. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (MFA) on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Materials and methods: In our study, we applied image analysis and whole-cell patch clamp recording to directly measure the effect of MFA on the gap junctional coupling between RPE cells. Results: Analysis of Lucifer yellow (LY) transfer revealed that the gap junction communication existed between RPE cells. Functional experiments using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique showed that a gap junction conductance also existed between this kind of cells. Importantly, MFA largely inhibited the gap junction conductance and induced the uncoupling of RPE cells. Other NSAIDs, like aspirin and flufenamic acid (FFA), had the same effect. Conclusion: The gap junction functionally existed in RPE cells, which can be blocked by MFA. These findings may explain, at least partially, the vision problems with certain clinically used NSAIDs...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{is characterized}} by cerebral deposits of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles which are surrounded by inflammatory cells. Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{reduces the risk of}} developing AD and delays the onset of the disease. In the present study, we used fluorescence spectroscopy with thioflavin T and electron microscopy {{to examine the effects of}} NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, aspirin, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt, diclofenac sodium salt, ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, naproxen, sulindac sulfide and indomethacin on the formation, extension, and destabilization of β-amyloid fibrils (fAβ) at pH 7. 5 at 37 °C in vitro. All examined NSAIDs dose-dependently inhibited formation of fAβ from fresh Aβ(1 - 40) and Aβ(1 - 42), as well as their extension. Moreover, these NSAIDs dose-dependently destabilized preformed fAβs. The overall activity of the molecules examined was in the following order: ibuprofen ≈ sulindac sulfide ≥ <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt > aspirin ≈ ketoprofen ≥ flurbiprofen ≈ diclofenac sodium salt > naproxen ≈ indomethacin. Although the mechanisms by which these NSAIDs inhibit fAβ formation from Aβ, and destabilize preformed fAβ in vitro are still unclear, NSAIDs may be promising for the prevention and treatment of AD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Cyclooxygenase (Cox) is a {{key enzyme}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of prostaglandins and, as such, is the target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Two isoforms exist, being expressed constitutively (Cox- 1), or inducibly in response to inflammatory mediators (Cox- 2). Currently available NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms somewhat equipotently but selective Cox- 2 inhibition may eliminate unwanted side effects. We have characterized the kinetic mechanisms of the interactions of purified recombinant human cyclooxygenase- 1 and - 2 (hCox- 1, hCox- 2) with the selective Cox- 2 inhibitor N-(2 -cyclohexyloxy- 4 -nitrophenyl) methanesulphonamide (NS- 398) and some classical non-selective NSAIDs. NS- 398, flurbiprofen, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and indomethacin are time-dependent, irreversible inhibitors of hCox- 2. The inhibition {{is consistent with a}} two-step process, involving an initial rapid equilibrium binding of enzyme and inhibitor, characterized by Ki, followed by the slow formation of a tightly bound enzyme-inhibitor complex, characterized by a first-order rate constant kon. NS- 398 is a time-independent inhibitor of hCox- 1, consistent with the formation of a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex. Flurbiprofen, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and indomethacin are also time-dependent inhibitors of hCox- 1 and hence show little selectivity for one isoform over the other. Flufenamic acid is time independent towards both isoforms and is also non-selective. The high degree of selectivity of NS- 398 towards Cox- 2 results therefore from the difference {{in the nature of the}} time-dependency of inhibition of the two isoforms...|$|E
40|$|The escape of the {{blastocyst}} {{from the}} zona pellucida in vitro {{is probably the}} result of expan-sion due to fluid accumulation in the blastocoele. This fluid accumulation is mediated by the epithelial trophectoderm. Since prostagiandins of the E series {{are involved in the}} control of water movement across epithelia, the effect of prostaglandin antagonists on the hatching of mouse blastocysts has been examined. Protein-free culture media have been used to overcome the compli-cating effects of protein bindings of the drugs on their activities. 7 -Oxa- 1 3 -prostynoic acid, meclofen-amic acid, indomethacin and pheniodone inhibit hatching, but the properties of their dose-response lines vary. 7 -Oxa- 1 3 -prostynoic acid and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> have steep dose-response lines. The me-dian inhibitory doses (lD 5 Os) and confidence limits (P = 0. 05) are: 7 -oxa- 13 -prostynoic acid 0. 81 MM (0. 55 - 1. 20); <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> 7. 72 MM (3. 43 - 17. 4).

40|$|All nonsteroidal {{antiinflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{inhibit the}} cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes to different extents, {{which accounts for}} their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities and their gastrointestinal side effects. We have exploited biochemical {{differences between the two}} COX enzymes to identify a strategy for converting carboxylate-containing NSAIDs into selective COX- 2 inhibitors. Derivatization of the carboxylate moiety in moderately selective COX- 1 inhibitors, such as 5, 8, 11, 14 -eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) and arylacetic and fenamic acid NSAIDs, exemplified by indomethacin and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively, generated potent and selective COX- 2 inhibitors. In the indomethacin series, esters and primary and secondary amides are superior to tertiary amides as selective inhibitors. Only the amide derivatives of ETYA and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibit COX- 2; the esters are either inactive or nonselective. Inhibition kinetics reveal that indomethacin amides behave as slow, tight-binding inhibitors of COX- 2 and that selectivity {{is a function of the}} time-dependent step. Site-directed mutagenesis of murine COX- 2 indicates that the molecular basis for selectivity differs from the parent NSAIDs and from diarylheterocycles. Selectivity arises from novel interactions at the opening and at the apex of the substrate-binding site. Lead compounds in the present study are potent inhibitors of COX- 2 activity in cultured inflammatory cells. Furthermore, indomethacin amides are orally active, nonulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory agents in an in vivo model of acute inflammation. Expansion of this approach can be envisioned for the modification of all carboxylic acid-containing NSAIDs into selective COX- 2 inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a series}} of mono- and disubstituted N-phenylanthranilic acids is described. Substituents on the phenyl ring include Cl, CN, OH, CF 3, Br, I, CH 3, OCH 3, and OCF 2 CF 2 H. These compounds have been tested for their inhibitory effect on triiodothyronine (T 3) uptake by H 4 hepatocytes. The nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs flufenamic acid, mefenamic acid, and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> and the structurally related compounds 2, 3 -dimethyldiphenylamine and diclofenac were also tested. The most potent compounds were found to be, in order of decreasing activity, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (2, 6 -Cl 2, 3 -CH 3), flufenamic acid (3 -CF 3), mefenamic acid (2, 3 -(CH 3) 2), and the compounds with 3, 5 -Cl 2 and 3 -OCF 2 CF 2 H substituents. The least potent compounds had 3 -CN and 3 -OH substituents. An analysis of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) for the series of phenylanthranilic acids showed that the inhibition of T 3 uptake is highly dependent on the hydrophobicity of the compound. The relationship between uptake inhibition and the calculated octanol-water partition coefficient (clogP) was found to be parabolic, with optimum inhibitory activity found when the clogP of the phenylanthranilic acid was 5. 7. It was also found that the 1 -carboxylic acid group of the phenylanthranilic acids was not a prerequisite for uptake inhibition to occur, but its removal or alteration resulted in reduced inhibition...|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is often}} assumed that the {{antitumor}} effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are due to inhibition of cyclooxgenase (COX) activity, specifically COX- 2, there is accumulating evidence that COX- 2 independent mechanisms can also play an important role. Studies with sulindac sulfone (Aptosyn) and related derivatives have revealed a novel pathway of tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis mediated by activation of the guanosine 3 ', 5 ' monophosphate (cGMP) -dependent enzyme protein kinase G (PKG). The present study indicates that concentrations of the NSAIDs celecoxib, indomethacin, and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> that inhibit growth of SW 480 human colon cancer cells inhibit subcellular cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymatic activity and in intact cells induce a two- to threefold increase in intracellular levels of cGMP. This is associated with phosphorylation of the protein VASP, a marker of PKG activation, activation of JNK 1 {{and a decrease in}} cellular levels of cyclin D 1; effects seen with other agents that cause activation of PKG in these cells. On the other hand even a high concentration of the COX- 2 specific inhibitor rofecoxib (500 microM) did not inhibit growth of SW 480 cells. Nor did rofecoxib inhibit cGMP-PDE activity or cause other changes related to PKG activation in these cells. Since activation of the PKG pathways by celecoxib, indomethacin, and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> in this cell culture system required high concentrations of these compounds, it remains to be determined whether activation of this pathway contributes to the in vivo antitumor effects of specific NSAIDs...|$|E
40|$|We have {{documented}} {{in previous studies}} that local irradiation therapy for breast cancer caused severe lymphopenia with reduction of both T and non-T lymphocytes. Non-T cells were relatively more depressed but recovered within six months. The recovery of T cells, on the other hand, remained incomplete 10 - 11 years after irradiation. Several lymphocyte functions were also severely impaired. An association was found between prognosis and postirradiation mitogen reactivity of lymphocytes from these patients. Mortality up to eight years after irradiation was significantly higher in patients with low postirradiation phytohemagglutinin and PPD reactivity. The radiation induced decrease in mitogenic response seemed mainly {{to be caused by}} immunosuppressive monocytes, which suggests that the underlying mechanism might be mediated by increased production of prostaglandins by monocytes. For this reason we examined the effect of some cyclooxygenase products on different lymphocyte functions and found that prostaglandins A 2, D 2, and E 2 inhibited phytohemagglutinin response in vitro. Natural killer cell activity was also reduced by prostaglandins D 2 and E 2. The next step was to examine various inhibitors of cyclooxygenase in respect to their capacity to revert irradiation-induced suppression of in vitro mitogen response in lymphocytes from breast cancer patients. It was demonstrated that Diclofenac Na (Voltaren), <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> Indomethacin, and lysin-mono-acetylsalicylate (Aspisol) could enhance mitogen responses both before and after radiation therapy. This effect was most pronounced at completion of irradiation. On a molar basis, Diclofenac Na was most effective followed by Indomethacin, <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> and lysin-monoacetylsalicylate. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

Rat Oatp 1 c 1 was cloned and stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Oatp 1 c 1 -transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells transported 125 I-labeled T 4 in a time-dependent manner that was completely abolished {{in the presence of}} excess unlabeled T 4. Next, various compounds, including inhibitors of thyroid hormone uptake, were screened for inhibitory effects on Oatp 1 c 1 -mediated T 4 uptake. Phenytoin (64 %), indocyanine green (17 %), fenamic acid (68 %), diclofenac (51 %), and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (33 %) all reduced T 4 uptake by Oatp 1 c 1 when assayed at concentrations of 10 μM. Dose-response assays for the fenamic acids, iopanoic acid, indocyanine green, and phenytoin revealed IC 50 values for Oatp 1 c 1 T 4 uptake below or near the blood plasma levels after therapeutic doses. Further kinetic assays and reciprocal plot analyses demonstrated that the fenamic acid diclofenac inhibited in a competitive manner. Finally, microvessels were isolated from adult rat brain and assessed for T 4 uptake. Ten micromolar of fenamate concentrations inhibited T 4 microvessel uptake with a similar hierarchical inhibition profile [fenamic acid (43 %), diclofenac (78 %), and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (85 %) ], as observed for Oatp 1 c 1 transfected cells.

40|$|PurposeThe {{presence}} of novel KCNQ currents {{was investigated in}} guinea pig bladder interstitial cells of Cajal and their contribution {{to the maintenance of}} the resting membrane potential was assessed. Materials and MethodsEnzymatically dispersed interstitial cells of Cajal were patch clamped with K+ filled pipettes in voltage clamp and current clamp modes. Pharmacological modulators of KCNQ channels were tested on membrane currents and the resting membrane potential. ResultsCells were stepped from − 60 to 40 mV to evoke voltage dependent currents using a modified K+ pipette solution containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (5 mM) and adenosine triphosphate (3 mM) to eliminate large conductance Ca activated K channel and Kadenosine triphosphate currents. Application of the KCNQ blockers XE 991, linopirdine (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, Missouri) and chromanol 293 B (Sigma®) decreased the outward current in concentration dependent fashion. The current-voltage relationship of XE 991 sensitive current revealed a voltage dependent, outwardly rectifying current that activated positive to − 60 mV and showed little inactivation. The KCNQ openers flupirtine and <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (Sigma) increased outward currents across the voltage range. In current clamp mode XE 991 or chromanol 293 B decreased interstitial cell of Cajal resting membrane potential and elicited the firing of spontaneous transient depolarizations in otherwise quiescent cells. Flupirtine or <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> hyperpolarized interstitial cells of Cajal and inhibited any spontaneous electrical activity. ConclusionsThis study provides electrophysiological evidence that bladder interstitial cells of Cajal have KCNQ currents with a role in the regulation of interstitial cell of Cajal resting membrane potential and excitability. These novel findings provide key information on the ion channels present in bladder interstitial cells of Cajal and they may indicate relevant targets for the development of new therapies for bladder instability...|$|E

The prostaglandin endoperoxide/thromboxane A 2 antagonist trans- 13 -azaprostanoic acid, an inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated water flow, inhibited thromboxane B 2 - and U 46619 -stimulated water flow in a dose-dependent manner.

A detailed analysis of the structures and properties of both the starting materials and the cocrystals allows a tentative explanation of these differences, but it also shows that even though all four cocrystals utilize one of the most predictable supramolecular synthons (COOH···N), their structures and properties remain elusive to design...|$|E

The KCNQ 2 /Q 3 heteromeric channel complex was identified as the molecular correlate of the M-current. Furthermore, the KCNQ 2 and KCNQ 3 channel � subunits are mutated in families with benign familial neonatal convulsions, a neonatal form of epilepsy. Enhancement of KCNQ 2 /Q 3 potassium currents may provide an important target for antiepileptic drug development. Here, we show that <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> (meclofenamate) and diclofenac, two related molecules previously used as anti-inflammatory drugs, act as novel KCNQ 2 /Q 3 channel openers.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{identify}} the {{mechanisms by which}} oxidative stress with oxidizing agents alters the activity of ion channels in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. METHODS. The effects of oxidizing agents on ion currents were investigated in human RPE R- 50 cells {{with the aid of}} the whole-cell, cell-attached, and inside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique. RESULTS. In the whole-cell configuration, t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP; 1 mM), thimerosal (30 �M), and 4, 4 �-dithiodipyridine (DTDP; 30 �M) suppressed voltage-dependent K � current (I K) that was sensitive to inhibition by iberiotoxin or paxillin, yet not by apamin or 5 -hydroxydecanoate sodium. <b>Meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> or Evans blue, but not diazoxide, reversed the decrease in I K caused by t-BHP.

Injection of each of four camels with 10 and 50 mg of PGF 2 =a clearly that five times the dose of exogenous hormone produced five times the amount of PGFM in peripheral plasma, thereby indicating that, as in other animal species, PGFM is the principal metabolite of PGF 2 =a∈ the camel. Serial sampling of three non-pregnant camels on each of days 8, 10 and 12, and three pregnant camels on day 10, after ovulation for 8 h showed a significant (P < 0. 05) rise in mean plasma PGFM concentrations only on day 10 in the non-pregnant, but not the pregnant, animals. A single intravenous injection of 20, 50 or 100 iu oxytocin given to three groups of three non-pregnant camels on day 10 after ovulation did not increase their basal serum PGFM concentrations. However, daily treatment of six non-pregnant camels between days 6 and 15 (n = 3) or 20 (n = 3) after ovulation with 1 =n-g of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> inhibited PGF 2 =a and thereby resulted in continued progesterone secretion throughout the period of <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> administration. These results showed that, as in other large domestic animal species, release of PGF 2 =a from, presumably, the endometrium controls luteolysis in the dromedary camel. Furthermore, reduction in the amount of PGF 2 =a released is associated with luteal maintenance and the embryonic signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy must be transmitted before day 10 after ovulation if luteostasis is to be achieved. However, the results also indicate that, in contrast to ruminants, the release of endometrial PGF 2 =a in the non-pregnant camel may not be controlled by the release of oxytocin...|$|E

The structures have been solved by direct methods and refined to R value of 0. 062 and 0. 079, respectively for 1942 and 2852 observed reflections. The four crystallographically independent meclofenamate anions in the complexes have {{nearly the same}} molecular geometry {{which in turn is}} very similar to that found in the crystal structure of free <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid.</b> The choline and ethanolamine molecules assume a gauche conformation with respect to the central C [...] -C bond. The invariant structural features observed in the crystals of the free fenamates are retained by the meclofenamate ions in the complexes. These features are the rigid coplanar geometry of the six-membered ring carrying the carboxyl group, the carboxyl group and the imino nitrogen atom, and the internal hydrogen bond connecting the imino and the carboxyl groups. The crystal structures are stabilised by ionic interactions between the carboxylate groups of meclofenamate ions and choline or ethanolamine cations, and hydrogen bonds. The choline complex exhibits pseudosymmetry and the distribution of molecules in it is nearly centrosymmetric although the space group is noncentrosymmetric. The packing of molecules in the crystals is such that the polar columns are surrounded by non-polar regions. The core of each column in the choline complex is made up of water molecules connected by hydrogen bonds involving disordered protons. The results of the X-ray structure analysis of fenamates and their crystalline complexes provide some insights into structure-function relationships in this family of drugs...|$|E

In present experiments {{we have found that}} 1) pretreatment of the animals with either <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid</b> or acetylsalycylic acid, inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis, prevented the LH-induced cholesterol depletion in the follicles; 2) administration of PGE 2, but not PGF 20, caused cholesterol depletion in the follicles and the effect was not blocked by indomethacin; 3) simultaneous administration of LH and PGE 2 resulted in the same magnitude of cholesterol depletion as was observed after their individual administration; and 4) cholesterol depletion caused by PCE 2 was in the ester moiety only, and this effect was similar to the earlier reported effect of LI-I administration. Thus, it seems that PGE formation may be necessary for expression of the cholesterol depleting action of LI-I in the rabbit follicle...|$|E

Possible significance of these findings in arachidonic acid metabolism is discussed. Glutathione S-transferases (EC 2. 5. 1. 18) catalyze transfer of the gluta-thionyl group to an electrophilic acceptor. When the acceptor contains a reac-tive double bond or epoxy group, an addition reaction takes place. The reac-tion is considered an initial step in converting the electrophile to a mercap-turic acid for excretion [1, 2]. Recently, Hammarstrom et al. [3] and Parker et al. [41 suggested that glutathione S-transferases catalyze the conversion o...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the effects of}} alterations in extracellular and intracellular calcium concentration on arginine vasopressin (AVP) -stimulated cAMP formation in cultured rat inner medullary collecting tubule cells. cAMP formation remains constant at extracellular calcium concentrations between 0. 5 and 4. 0 mM, which did not change intracellular calcium. Maneuvers that alter intracellular calcium concentration are associated with marked changes in cAMP generation. EGTA decreases intracellular calcium and enhances AVP-stimulated cAMP formation, while increasing cellular calcium with 2 microM A 23187 decreases AVP-stimulated cAMP formation in the presence, {{but not in the}} absence, of extracellular calcium. The changes in cAMP formation observed when intracellular calcium is altered are associated with reciprocal changes in prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) synthesis. Despite greater than 95 % inhibition of PGE 2 synthesis with 5 microM <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> the changes in cAMP formation accompanying alterations in intracellular calcium concentration are still evident. These studies suggest that intracellular calcium critically influences AVP-stimulated cAMP formation. It does so by a mechanism independent of PG that is probably mediated by a direct effect of the cation on the adenylate cyclase complex...|$|E
40|$|The {{yellow fever}} {{mosquito}} Aedes aegypti is an important vector of viral diseases that impact global health. Insecticides are typically used to manage mosquito populations, but the evo-lution of insecticide resistance is limiting their effectiveness. Thus, identifying new molecular and physiological targets in mosquitoes is needed to facilitate insecticide discovery and development. Here we test the hypothesis that gap junctions are valid molecular and physi-ological targets for new insecticides. Gap junctions are intercellular channels that mediate direct communication between neighboring cells and consist of evolutionarily distinct pro-teins in vertebrate (connexins) and invertebrate (innexins) animals. We show that the injec-tion of pharmacological inhibitors of gap junctions (i. e., carbenoxolone, <b>meclofenamic</b> <b>acid,</b> or mefloquine) into the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes elicits dose-dependent toxic effects, with mefloquine showing the greatest potency. In contrast, when applied topically to the cuticle, carbenoxolone was the only inhibitor to exhibit full efficacy. In vivo urine excre-tion assays demonstrate that both carbenoxolone and mefloquine inhibit the diuretic output of adult female mosquitoes, suggesting inhibition of excretory functions as part of thei...|$|E
