So far, no enzymes involved in this metabolism have been isolated from red algae. We report here the isolation of a gene encoding a homologue of the respiratory burst oxidase gp 91 (phox) stop in C. crispus, named Ccrboh. This single copy gene encodes a polypeptide of 825 amino acids. Search performed in available genome and EST algal databases identified sequences showing common features of NADPH oxidases in other algae such as the red unicellular Cyanidioschyzon merolae, the economically valuable red <b>macro-alga</b> Porphyra yezoensis and the two diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana. Domain organization and phylogenetic relationships with plant, animal, fungal and algal NADPH oxidase homologues were analyzed. Transcription analysis of the C. crispus gene revealed that it was over-transcribed during infection of C. crispus gametophyte by the endophyte A. operculata, and after incubation in presence of atrazine, methyl jasmonate and hydroxyperoxides derived from C 20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).

40|$|Inter-tidal <b>macro-algae</b> {{communities}} often exhibit consistent broad {{vertical distribution}} patterns of species. The factors {{that set the}} distribution limits of these patterns have long intrigued marine ecologists, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon; however, no general conclusion has yet been drawn. Of all the factors limiting the occurence and development of photosynthetic organisms in aquatic environments, light is the most crucial and variable, {{and its role in}} the zonation of intertidal <b>macro-algae</b> is an unresolved issue. This thesis addresses the problem of whether the characteristics of the underwater light field available to intertidal <b>macro-algae</b> could influence species distribution. Semi-diurnal in situ measurements of the underwater light field were carried out at three sites on the south-west coast of England (United Kingdom)); the Hamble Estuary, Southampton Water and Swanage Bay. The tide is shown to significantly affect the water optical properties, and the tidal range and water transparency combine to produce important intensity and spectral fluctuations of the underwater light field available to intertidal <b>macro-algae.</b> To circumvent the limitations of in situ field studies a mathematical model was developed to investigate the effect of tidal features on the availability of underwater light to intertidal <b>macro-algae</b> across the compete tidal cycle. The results reveal the importance of the range and phase of the tide, and identify two significant zones within the intertidal zone which might depict where certain <b>macro-algae</b> flourish. Finally, the effect of vertical height of "transplanted" <b>macro-algae</b> in the intertidal zone and their pigment content was studies in situ. The results of this study were inconclusive but produce the foundation for future work. This study demonstrated that intertidal <b>macro-algae</b> are subjected to major intensity and spectral fluctuations in underwater irradiance, and there are two major zones within the intertidal zone which could potentially affect the zonation of some species.

The deduced amino acid sequence coincided well with partial sequences of peptide fragments of the enzyme. From the same cDNA library we also isolated another cDNA clone (bpo 2) encoding a protein of 597 amino acids with an identity of about 90 % to BPO 1, suggesting a genetic diversity of the bromoperoxidase gene of C. pilulifera growing in a relatively narrow area.

40|$|Objective: To study Ulva linza (U. linza) as <b>macro-alga</b> {{exposed to}} {{different}} levels of ionizing radiation from the natural background of radioactivity. Methods: Samples of U. linza were collected from two different habitats at the two terminals of the rocky shore of Abu Qir Bay, Alexandria, Egypt. The western terminal at Abu Qir represented an area of normal background radiation while the eastern terminal at Rosetta represented an area of relatively high background radiation. Distinguishing between the algae grown in areas of relatively high and normal background radiation was investigated by using different indicators. Moreover, the ambient water quality was measured and the concentrations of natural radionuclides (238 U, 232 Th and 40 K) bio-accumulated in the tested <b>macro-alga</b> were detected. Results: The algae naturally exposed to radionuclides (238 U series, 232 Th series and 40 K) were investigated. Radiation dose rates in U. linza inhabiting in Rosetta and Abu Qir were calculated as 70. 12 and 42. 67 nGy/h, respectively. Chemical analysis of algal samples demonstrated that total pigment contents were 2. 21 and 2. 19 mg/g on a fresh weight basis for U. linza inhabiting in Rosetta and Abu Qir, respectively. Fatty acid compositions showed comparable profiles for both algal samples with saturated fatty acids as major component. The results of protein profiles confirmed slight differential expression in protein bands. Sequence-related randomly amplified polymorphic DNA provided evidence that both samples were strongly similar. By using transmission electron microscopy, no obvious ultra structural changes in the examined cells were observed.

40|$|The {{need for}} sustainability, energy {{security}} and reduction {{of global warming}} has brought many alternative energy sources into the foreground. Already there are well established technologies that can produce renewable energy {{but when it comes}} to the production of renewable liquid fuels and chemicals, biomass is the primary feedstock. Biomass is a renewable source of energy that can provide heat, electricity and transport fuels. However, utilisation of biomass posses some limitations such as land availability and competition of energy crops with food crops. In order to overcome these problems "third generation" biofuels from alternative feedstock such as <b>macro-algae</b> have recently come into the foreground. Oceans and seas cover over 70 % of the earth's surface, most of which is under exploited, resulting in additional potential for biomass production. This thesis concentrates on the potential for production of bio-energy and chemicals from <b>macro-algae</b> through thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis, combustion and hydrothermal liquefaction. Utilisation of aquatic biomass for production of bioenergy is a very recent concept and there is a lack of information on their thermochemical behaviour. This investigation contributes to a wider study and forms part of the Supergen II bionergy programme investigating the potential for utilisation of macrolage in the UK. This investigation includes a detailed characterisation of the fuel properties and thermal behaviour of a range of wild seaweeds around the UK provided by the Scottish Association of Marine Sciences. In addition, a range of model biochemical components have been investigated, in particular, the model carbohydrates present in <b>macro-algae.</b> Alginic acid, mannitol, laminarin, fucoidan and cellulose are the main carbohydrates present in brown <b>macro-algae.</b> The rest of the plant material comprises of protein and ash. Freshly harvested <b>macro-algae</b> contain 80 - 90 wt% moisture. Their ash content is high, reflecting their high inorganic content. Potassium is the most abundant metal present in <b>macro-algae</b> although other metals are also present including sodium, calcium, magnesium, Their carbohydrate, protein and ash content undergo a seasonal variation during their growth cycle. This variation was found to affect their properties as fuel. Carbon content reaches its maximum during summer - early autumn. During the same period, the inorganic (and thus ash) content is at its minimum suggesting summer - early autumn as the optimum period for harvesting <b>macro-algae</b> for bioenergy. The high carbon and low inorganic content during this period is reflected in its higher heating value but it is still relatively low (13 - 14 MJ/kg) when compared with terrestrial biomass. The nature of the inhabitant location was found to significantly influence <b>macro-algae</b> fuel properties with samples grown in the open ocean having better fuel properties (higher HHV and lower inorganic content) than samples growing in canals and estuaries. Investigation of the pyrolysis behaviour was performed using thermal analysis such as TGA and Py-GC/MS. The volatile matter evolved during pyrolysis was higher for samples collected during summer and early spring due to their higher carbon content. The main volatiles evolved during decomposition were found to originate either from their carbohydrates or from their protein content. Specific marker compounds were identified for the carbohydrates such as dianhydromannitol, 1 -(2 -furanyl) -ethanone, 2 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 2 -cyclopenten- 1 -one and furfural for manitol, laminarin and alginic acid respectively. Proteins are found to produce a range of indoles and pyrroles. Some of the compounds identified may have industrial applications indicating the possibility of producing chemicals through pyrolysis of <b>macro-algae.</b> The high moisture content of seaweed necessitates that significant amounts of water must be removed before this feedstock can be converted by pyrolysis. The high moisture content is similary an issue for combustion which has been assessed by a combination of TGA and characterisation of the biomass. <b>Macro-algae</b> have a low HHV, high halogen content and high ash content and are predicted to have high slagging and fouling behaviour in conventional combustion chambers. This fouling behaviour is predicted through empirical indexes such as the alkali index and is shown to be higher than terrestrial biomass even during summer - early autumn when their inorganic content is at minimum. Typical ash contents vary from 18 to 45 wt% and contain mainly oxides of K 20, Na 2 O, CaO and MgO. Pre-treatment prior to combustion can significantly reduce the ash content leading to improved combustion properties, but this also leads to removal of some biochemical components. Using an acid pre-treatment, some of the seaweed's biopolymers, such as mannitol or fucoidan, can be removed presenting the possibility for acquiring valuable chemicals from seaweed before combustion of the residue. An alternative processing route, capable of processing wet feedstocks called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) involves the processing of the <b>macro-algae</b> in subcritical water. HTL converts the starting material into four product streams including a bio-crude, a char, an aqueous stream consisting primarily of process water and a gaseous stream. A parametric study of HTL has been investigated using high pressure batch reactors with or without the presence of catalysts. The bio-crude produced from the liquefaction of macrolgae was found to have a high heating value and resembling chemical composition to crude-oil. It can be used directly as a fuel however it still contains significantly high nitrogen levels and will required suitable upgrading (e. g. denitrogenation). The bio-char was found to also have a high heating value. Both bio-crude and bio-char produced from HTL are virtually free of alkali metals suggesting they are suitable for combustion. Reaction conditions such as temperature and the ratio of biomass to water have the greatest influence on product yields and properties. Typical bio-crude yields were in the range of 10 to 19 wt% on a daf basis with their HHVs ranging from 32 to 38 MJ/kg. The yields of bio-chars were in similar range (IOwt% to 19 wt% on a db) with HHVs between 10 and 26 MJ/kg. An energy balance was calculated in order to investigate the energy required to heat the mixture of <b>macro-algae</b> and water. The energy recovery in the bio-crude and bio-char was relatively low, between 50 and 65 %, indicating that a significant portion of the energy content of <b>macro-algae</b> is passing in to the other product streams. The aqueous phase (process water) was found to be rich in metals, especially alkali metals, and sugars, and its composition suggests it maybe possible to utilize it as a fertilizer. A fraction of the sugars present in macro algae (mannitol and laminarin) pass in to the aqueous stream, suggesting there is also potential for fermentetion to bioethanol. The gaseous stream is composed mainly of CO 2, N, CO and lower concentrationso H and CH 4. The most suitable thermochemical processing route for <b>macro-algae</b> is proposed to be hydrothermal liquefaction and has potential for utilization of all the product streams producing fuels and chemicals using a bio-refinery concept.

From the different techniques used and the known chemical composition of the algal cell wall, {{it was observed that}} biosorption of the metallic cations to the algal cell wall component was a surface process. The binding capacities of the different metal cations were be-tween 1 and 1. 2 mmol metal/g on a dry weight basis. The main chemical groups involved in the metallic cation bio-sorption were apparently carboxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, and sulfonate. These groups were part of the algal cell wall structural polymers, namely, polysaccharides (alginic acid, sulfated polysaccharides), proteins, and peptidoglycans. The main cadmium cation sequestration mechanism by the algal biomass was apparently chelation, while the nickel cation sequestration mechanism was mainly ion exchange. Lead cations exhibit higher affinity to the algal biomass, and their binding mechanism included a combination of ion exchange, chelation, and reduction reactions, accompa-nied by metallic lead precipitation on the cell wall matrix.

Starved and refed abalone showed slower growth rates (DGR, 63 and 70 mg/day in the 5 / 5 and 10 / 10 groups respectively), {{as a result}} of reduced food intake (DFI 15 % and 16 % day âˆ’ 1 respectively), after repeated starvation and refeeding cycles. Percentage weight gains (5 / 5 = 196 %, 10 / 10 = 177 %) were significantly lower than that of the control (397 %). When refed continuously over 60 days, the starved groups exhibited increased DFI and fed at the rate of 24 % and 25 % day âˆ’ 1, which were not significantly {{different from that of the}} control at 26 % day âˆ’ 1. At the end of the experiment, no significant differences were observed among three treatments in terms of shell length (range: 46 â€“ 48 mm), body weight (range 25 â€“ 28 g), % weight gain (392 â€“ 465 %) and per cent survival (range 87 â€“ 98 %). The results indicated that H. asinina had a complete compensatory growth following a return to full rations after a series of intermittent starvation and refeeding cycles...|$|E
40|$|PhDThis {{study on}} the {{littoral}} of Crosemere has shown that complex direct and indirect interactions exist between larvae of the gallery-building caddis Tinodes waeneri, the filamentous <b>macro-alga</b> Cladophora glomerata, and the larvae of several species of retreat-building chironomids. Co-existence between these species is facilitated by spatial and temporal patchiness in dispersal ability and behaviour by the dominant grazer/competitor Tinodes waeneri. Tinodes eats Cladophora and thus indirectly controls the abundance of chironomids which associate with the Cladophora mat. Adult oviposition under trees determines the initial distribution of Tinodes and several chironomids. While these latter can probably rapidly disperse by swimming, Tinodes dispersal is more limited. This creates spatial refugia for Cladophora and chironomids {{in areas of the}} littoral away from trees. Local-scale, temporal refugia are created by Cladophora being able to 'grow away' from Tinodes during periods in spring when Cladophora colonizes more vigorously than Tinodes. Local-scale spatial refugia are also created by modes' apparent reluctance to colonize taller stones. This spatial and temporal patchiness in species interactions in the littoral is set against a background of lake-wide, temporal variation which appears to constrain the entire littoral habitat. The summer stratification of Crosemere into upper and lower layers causes the surface waters, probably including also the littoral, to be seasonally nutrient-limited, particularly in nitrogen. This in turn will limit primary production in the littoral and thus also secondary production. The epilithic species studied all appeared to be food-limited in summer. The dominance of the Crosemere littoral by retreat-dwelling species may partly be due to their ability to recycle limited nutrients within or on their retreats and so to consume more algae than is otherwise available to mobile species...|$|E

40|$|Hydrothermal {{liquefaction}} (HTL) of four brown <b>macro-algae</b> {{was used}} to produce bio-crude and bio-char in an energy favorable way. Bio-crude yields between 9. 8 wt% and 17. 8 wt% (daf) with HHVs between 32 and 34 MJ/kg and bio-char yields between 10. 9 wt% and 18. 6 wt% (db) with HHVs between 15. 7 and 26. 2 MJ/kg were produced. A modification of the energy consumption ratio (ECR) index was attempted in order {{to include in the}} formula the calculation of the specific heat capacity of the feedstock used, as well as the increase of the specific heat capacity of water with temperature. A comparison in terms of energy output was made between the products from HTL and products from bio-chemical conversion of <b>macro-algae</b> such as anaerobic digestion (AD) and fermentation. The results indicate that HTL has higher energy output than fermentation and analogue of that from anaerobic digestion (7. 91 MJ/kgseaweed and 8. 25 MJ/kgseaweed from HTL and AD respectively) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{scientific}} research program was {{initiated by the}} International Molybdenum Association (IMOA) which addressed identified gaps in the environmental toxicity data for the molybdate ion (MoO 4 2 -). These gaps were previously identified during the preparation of EU-REACH-dossiers for different molybdenum compounds (European Union regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances; EC, 2006). Evaluation of the open literature identified few reliable marine ecotoxicological data {{that could be used}} for deriving a Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) for the marine environment. Rather than calculating a PNEC marine using the assessment factor methodology on a combined freshwater/marine dataset, IMOA decided to generate sufficient reliable marine chronic data to permit derivation of a PNEC by means of the more scientifically robust species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach (also called the statistical extrapolation approach). Nine test species were chronically exposed to molybdate (added as sodium molybdate dihydrate, Na 2 MoO 4 • 2 H 2 O) according to published standard testing guidelines that are acceptable for a broad range of regulatory purposes. The selected test organisms were representative for typical marine trophic levels: micro-algae/diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Dunaliella tertiolecta), <b>macro-alga</b> (Ceramium tenuicorne), mysids (Americamysis bahia), copepod (Acartia tonsa), fish (Cyprinodon variegates), echinoderms (Dendraster exentricus, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and molluscs (Mytilus edulis, Crassostrea gigas). Available NOEC/EC 10 levels ranged between 4. 4 mg Mo/L (blue mussel M. edulis) and 1174 mg Mo/L (oyster C. gigas). Using all available reliable marine chronic effects data that are currently available, a HC 5, 50 % (median hazardous concentration affecting 5 % of the species) of 5. 74 (mg Mo) /L was derived with the statistical extrapolation approach, a value that can be used for national and international regulatory purposes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>macro-alga</b> Fucus vesiculosus has a broad {{global and}} estuarine {{distribution}} and exhibits exceptional resistance to toxic metals, the molecular basis {{of which is}} poorly understood. To address this issue a cDNA library was constructed from an environmental isolate of F. vesiculosus growing in an area with chronic copper pollution. Characterisation of this library led to the identification of a cDNA encoding a protein known to be synthesised in response to toxicity, a full length 14 - 3 - 3 exhibiting a 71 % identity to human/mouse epsilon isoform, 70 – 71 % identity to yeast BMH 1 / 2 and 95 and 71 % identity to the Ectocarpus siliculosus 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms 1 and 2 respectively. Preliminary characterisation of the expression profile of the 14 - 3 - 3 indicated concentration- and time-dependent inductions on acute exposure of F. vesiculosus of copper (3 – 30 μg/l). Higher concentrations of copper (≥ 150 μg/l) did not elicit significant induction of the 14 - 3 - 3 gene compared with the control even though levels of both intracellular copper and {{the expression of a}} cytosolic metal chaperone, metallothionein, continued to rise. Analysis of gene expression within environmental isolates demonstrated up-regulation of the 14 - 3 - 3 gene associated with the known copper pollution gradient. Here we report for the first time, identification of a gene encoding a putative 14 - 3 - 3 protein in a multicellular alga and provide preliminary evidence to link the induction of this 14 - 3 - 3 gene to copper exposure in this alga. Interestingly, the threshold exposure profile may be associated with a decrease in the organism’s ability to control copper influx so that it perceives copper as a toxic response...|$|E
40|$|Shigella flexnery and Shigella sonnei {{isolated}} from several countries have shown resistance to most antibiotics used for shigellosis treatment and therefore new antibiotics against the two bacteria are urgently needed. Although most antibiotics were discovered from soil microorganisms, the marine environment, {{such as the}} microbial communities of the <b>macro-alga</b> Ulva australis, is a potential source for finding new antibiotics. Since most of the bacteria living in the alga are not readily cultured or &# 147;not-yet&# 148; cultured, metagenomics was applied to access the uncultured properties for antibacterial activity against the two Shigella species. To optimally capture antibiotic synthesis genes, two host systems (Escherichia coli and Streptomyces lividans) were used. Moreover, to obtain a link of antibiotic function and phylogenetic origin, Homing Endonuclease Restriction and Marker Insertion (HERMI) was applied. The functional screening of the metagenomic library expressed in the two host cells resulted in the antibacterial activity against Shigella and {{it is thought that}} the activity was due to production by a microcin-like compound by the host cell and microcin maturation through genes encoded by the cosmid. HERMI, a valuable technique for the phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic libraries, has produced a clone for phylogenetic analysis and identification of gene properties. This HERMI clone was identified as belonging to a new, uncultured bacterium with only 79 % 16 S rRNA gene identity to Hyphomonas oceanitis. Five antibiotic resistant clones were obtained from the HERMI application and five genes encoding for beta-lactamases were characterized. It was revealed that both clinical and novel beta-lactamases were present in the microbial communities. The gene encoding for putative cell wall-associated hydrolase, which are distantly related to the existing sequences were also identified. Furthermore, genes for virulence (Toll/ interleukin- 1 receptor protein and leucine-rich repeat protein-like protein) were identified, indicating the presence of pathogens on the alga. Overall, the microbial communities of U. australis have possibly important properties for pharmaceutical applications and further work will be needed to uncover its full potential...|$|E

40|$|Human-induced {{growth of}} <b>macro-algae</b> is often assumed to {{increase}} trematode infections in fishes {{by increasing the}} abundance and condition of the parasite’s intermediate host – snails – as this can boost the release of trematode larvae, cercariae, from the intermediate hosts. However, <b>macro-algae</b> can also impose barriers to the transmission of cercariae and reduce infections. We investigated whether an increased growth of filamentous algae affects the transmission of Diplostomum pseudospathaceum cercariae to the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, a common fish in eutrophied shallow waters. We exposed sticklebacks to trematode cercariae in the absence and presence of artificial filamentous algae, and recorded effects on the proportion of sticklebacks infected {{and the number of}} encysted metacercariae per fish. No significant effect of artificial algae on cercariae transmission was detected. However, the body size and the sex of the sticklebacks were strongly correlated with the number of encysted metacercariae per infected fish, with females and larger individuals being more infected. We discuss different factors that could have caused the difference in parasite transmission, including sex-related differences in body size and behaviour of sticklebacks...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{simulate}} the uptake flow of nitrogen (gN m- 2) of P. oceanica meadow for 4 primary producers of the bay of Calvi (Corsica, France) (phytoplankton, <b>macro-algae,</b> the Posidonia oceanica leaves and their epiphytes). The model developed for this purpose simulates the evolution of nitrogen incorporation. The effect of the light intensity, and the water column temperature and concentration in internal and external nitrogen on nitrogen incorporation by the 4 primary producers is modeled. Thus, the incorporation rate of both NO 3 -and NH 4 +by phytoplankton was more important than for benthic producers. <b>Macro-algae</b> incorporations had intermediate incorporation rates between the ones of, the phytoplankton and P. oceanic leaves and their epiphytes. The incorporation of NH 4 + by the phytoplankton is higher than the incorporation of NO 3 -. The model appears well adapted to establish the main environmental factors that determine the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen by the various primary producers. It is also able to represent the relative importance of nitrogen incorporation by the various producers. Peer reviewe...|$|R
