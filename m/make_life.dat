5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} of {{the driving force behind}} the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly <b>make</b> <b>life</b> decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Less common {{sports are}} gaining popularity. Rugby is {{increasing}} in popularity, a Rugby Union is recognised by the Jordan Olympic Committee which supervises three national teams. Although cycling is not widespread in Jordan, {{the sport is}} developing rapidly as a lifestyle and {{a new way to}} travel especially among the youth. In 2014, a NGO <b>Make</b> <b>Life</b> Skate Life completed construction of the 7Hills Skatepark, the first skatepark in the country located in Downtown Amman. Jordan's national basketball team is participating in various international and Middle Eastern tournaments. Local basketball teams include: Al-Orthodoxi Club, Al-Riyadi, Zain, Al-Hussein and Al-Jazeera.|$|E

25|$|Irish LGBT {{immigrants}} often experience vulnerability in {{the absence}} of family networks, which is exacerbated in the context of homophobia and sexual discrimination.

25|$|The {{treatment}} for post-polio syndrome is generally palliative {{and consists of}} rest, analgesia (pain relief) and utilisation of mechanisms to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> easier such as powered wheelchairs. There are no reversive therapies. Fatigue is usually the most disabling symptom; energy conservation can significantly reduce fatigue episodes. Such conservation can be achieved with lifestyle changes, reducing workload and daytime sleeping. Weight loss is also recommended if patients are obese. In some cases, the use of lower limb orthotics can reduce energy usage.|$|E
25|$|William Sloane Coffin, Sr. died {{at home on}} {{his oldest}} son Edmund's {{eleventh}} birthday in 1933 {{from a heart attack}} he suffered returning from work.

After years spent in the most exclusive private schools in Manhattan, the three Coffin children were educated in Carmel's public schools, where William had his first sense that there was injustice—sometimes very great—in the world.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptian word written m3ˁt, often {{rendered}} maat or ma'at, {{refers to}} the fundamental order of the universe in Egyptian belief. Established at {{the creation of the}} world, maat distinguishes the world from the chaos that preceded and surrounds it. Maat encompasses both the proper behavior of humans and the normal functioning of the forces of nature, both of which <b>make</b> <b>life</b> and happiness possible. Because the actions of the gods govern natural forces and myths express those actions, Egyptian mythology represents the proper functioning {{of the world and the}} sustenance of life itself.|$|E
25|$|Open {{units are}} {{psychiatric}} units {{that are not}} as secure as crisis stabilization units. They are not used for acutely suicidal persons; the focus in these units is to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> as normal as possible for patients while continuing treatment {{to the point where}} they can be discharged. However, patients are usually still not allowed to hold their own medications in their rooms, because of the risk of an impulsive overdose. While some open units are physically unlocked, other open units still use locked entrances and exits depending on the type of patients admitted.|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{that favor}} forest habitat predominate within the Slide Wilderness. Among the 49 species known to exist there, black bears have done {{exceptionally}} well, as have snowshoe hare, gray squirrel and porcupine. White-tailed deer, who were successfully reintroduced into New York in 1887 via a protected habitat on lands {{now part of}} the wilderness area, winter here. Cottontail rabbit and beaver also maintain lower population levels. Fisher were reintroduced to the area in the late 1970s and have thrived in numbers significant enough to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> difficult for the porcupine, always abundant in the Catskills.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the general purpose computer software design environment, a primary characteristic of embedded environments is {{the sheer number of}} different platforms available to the developers (CPU architectures, vendors, operating systems and their variants). Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact <b>make</b> <b>life</b> tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, he {{stressed}} the importance of being courteous in one’s everyday life as it would <b>make</b> <b>life</b> better for everyone. It was a desirable attribute which could be found in all cultivated societies, and something which we should practice for Singapore’s own self-esteem. If tourists do find Singapore a courteous nation, it was because it was ‘incidental’. This ‘prodding’ by Lee Kuan Yew thus saw the birth of the National Courtesy Campaign, which became a recurrent, annual campaign that was seen as a long-term project of aiming to imbue values of courtesy into Singaporeans within a period of 10 years.|$|E
25|$|The last {{philosophy}} {{book that}} Feyerabend finished is The Tyranny of Science (written 1993, published May 13, 2011). In it Feyerabend challenges {{what he sees}} in his view as some modern myths about science, e.g., {{he believes that the}} statement 'science is successful' is a myth. He argues that some very basic assumptions about science are simply false and that substantial parts of scientific ideology were created on the basis of superficial generalizations that led to absurd misconceptions about the nature of human life. He claims that far from solving the pressing problems of our age, scientific theorizing glorifies ephemeral generalities at the cost of confronting the real particulars that <b>make</b> <b>life</b> meaningful.|$|E

25|$|Another more vindictive {{motivation}} for {{bringing in the}} indoor soccer side was to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> {{more difficult for the}} expansion Western Hockey League team, the Edmonton Ice. Pocklington had wanted a WHL franchise in Edmonton for himself, but was never granted one. So when Ed Chynoweth stepped down as WHL commissioner and was promptly granted a franchise in Edmonton, needless to say it rubbed Pocklington the wrong way. As a result, the Ice were not allowed to play at the Pocklington controlled Coliseum, and were instead left to play their games at the somewhat less fan friendly Northlands Agricom. On top of that it was standard practice to schedule Driller games head-to-head with Ice games, and distribute large quantities of complimentary tickets.|$|E
25|$|On some of {{the busiest}} routes, the {{convenience}} of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, {{so most of the}} platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the upward direction) by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a cutout section taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails <b>make</b> <b>life</b> difficult for passengers with baby buggies or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein.|$|E
25|$|Two {{settlers}} {{who were}} staying near Fort Antes {{were killed in}} June 1777. A party of four men and two women had left {{the safety of the}} fort and crossed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River to milk some cows that had been left there to pasture. Zephaniah Miller, Abel Cady, and James Armstrong left the riverbank and meadow to gather a cow who had wandered into the surrounding woods. These three men came under attack by a group of warriors who had been hiding in the woods. Sounds of fighting stirred the men at the fort. They crossed the river despite the objections of Colonel Antes who thought that the Native Americans might have set a trap. Upon reaching {{the other side of the}} river, the militiamen found Miller dead and Cady and Armstrong mortally wounded. Only Bouser and the women, one of them Cady's wife, survived the attack. This was just one of many attacks in the West Branch Valley that continued to <b>make</b> <b>life</b> more dangerous for the settlers, who were encroaching on tribal land.|$|E
