The body of the rocket was shaped like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E

This resulted in shares of profitable systems as follows: 33 % with a tax rebate, 51 % with a subsidy, and 93 % with both.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{decreased}} solar photovoltaic (PV) system prices, the Swedish PV market has grown rapidly the last few years, {{with the majority of}} new capacity installed in buildings. However, the market is still small and this licentiate thesis therefore aims to help facilitating for a continued positive development by adding to the knowledge about conditions related to PV in Swedish buildings. The thesis includes two separate studies. The first study describes how existing PV systems in Sweden are mounted. It comprises 444 systems larger than 10 kWp. A majority of the systems were found on rooftops and only about 10 % on façades. Most of the modules on steep-slope roofs were mounted parallel to the roof, while on lowslope roofs, tilted modules fixed to the roof were the most common, followed by horizontal systems. An increasing share of ballast-only systems on flat roofs could be seen. Historically, PV modules used as shading devices has been the most popular choice for façades, but in 2013, a majority of the façade systems had vertically applied modules. In general, the initial development of a Swedish PV market has been successful {{and there has been a}} smooth transition to more and larger systems on buildings. In many ways, this is thanks to a fully developed European market. The second study examines how the profitability of a solar PV investment is influenced by building-specific parameters as well as current economic conditions. Analyses were conducted for 108 electricity supply points in multifamily buildings and 16 in other buildings. First, PV systems were sized to give the highest net present values (NPVs) only considering fuse size and hourly demand matched to simulated PV generation. In a scenario with a 20 % investment subsidy, this resulted in positive NPVs for 56 % of the studied supply points. A scenario with tax rebates based on grid feed-ins resulted in a slightly smaller share of profitable systems. It was shown that this support scheme with tax rebate promotes relatively large systems compared to the subsidy, although with a much higher risk. In a scenario with both support schemes, nearly all systems turned out profitable. Also considering the orientation of existing roofs drastically decreased the share of profitable system among the multifamily buildings, while a large share of the systems in other buildings remained profitable. Lastly, it was shown that the <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> size and the yearly load had a substantial influence on the profitability...|$|E

40|$|Electricity must be {{produced}} {{at the same}} time as it is used. This necessitates flexibility in the electricity production and electricity networks. Until recently, the increase in electricity demand and peak power demand has been met by expansion of the electricity production. Today, due to the deregulation of the electricity market, the production capacity is decreasing. Therefore, there is a national interest in finding solutions to peak problems also on the demand side, i. e. enabling electricity users to decrease or shift load when needed. For local players in the electricity market, there are various technical and economic motives for developing methods to influence or control customers’ usage patterns. In the studies described here (Study 1 and Study 2) ten households in electrically heated houses, were examined. The households were all customers of the electric utility Skånska Energi AB. In 1999 the utility equipped their customers with a remote metering system (CustCom) that has an in-built load control component. A large number of studies, in Sweden as well as in other countries, investigate the impact of habits on energy use within a home. A hitherto not investigated area is the effect of habits on the load pattern. In Study 1 (of this licentiate thesis), the load pattern of ten households was examined by using energy diaries combined with frequent meter readings (every five minutes) of the load demand for heating, hot water service and domestic electricity use. Household members kept energy diaries over a four-day period in January 2004, noting time, activities and the use of household appliances that run on electricity. Comparison of the data from these two sources provided an estimate of the impact of various activities and the use of electrical appliances on load demand. The analysis showed that the use of heat-producing household appliances, e. g. sauna, washing machine and dryer, appliances used for cooking (oven, kitchen range-hob, electric kettle and microwave oven), dishwasher and extra electric heaters, contribute to the household’s highest peaks. Turning on the sauna and {{at the same time}} using the shower equates to a peak load of 7 - 9 kW. This, in addition to the use of electricity for heating and lighting along alongside electricity use for refrigerators and freezers, results in some households reaching their <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> level (roughly 13, 8 kW for a <b>main</b> <b>fuse</b> of 20 A). This means that the domestic use of electricity makes up a considerable part of the highest peak loads in a household, but the highest peaks occur together with the use of electricity for heating and hot water. vi ix In the second study, Study 2, the households participated in a load control experiment, in which the utility was able to turn on and switch off the heating and hot water systems remotely, using the CustCom system. Heating and water heaters were switched off for periods of 1 - 4 hours (except for one occasion during which the water heater was switched off for 16 hours) without letting the households know when the control periods would take place or how long they would last. Household heating and hot water comfort as well as the households’ attitudes towards and experiences of being controlled were investigated using a combination of methods. During the experiment period, which lasted three weeks, the household indoor temperature was measured to establish the temperature drops caused by switching off the heating system. The households were asked to make notes of their experiences of thermal comfort and hot water comfort on a specified “comfort sheet”. In order to be able to ascertain whether the households had missed out on any of the control periods, the household members had to keep a record of when they were away from home. Following the test period, interviews were carried out in order to establish the household experiences of the load control experiment, to gain insight into the household members’ views of their energy use and energy habits, and to gain an understanding of the requirements that customers have regarding load control measures. Issues such as limitations of control time, compensation and feedback were discussed. Also, a more indirect form of load control - tariffs - were discussed, namely classical time tariffs and tariffs using a peak load component where the grid fee is based on an average of the customer's three highest hourly peaks during one month. Interview data, records of thermal and hot water comfort and indoor temperature readings showed that the households noticed some of the control periods but that equally some went unnoticed. At its lowest, the indoor temperature went down by 2, 5 ºC. Obviously, longer control periods of three or four hours contributed to larger temperature drops, but at the same time sun radiation through windows affected the indoor temperature. Hence, the households seemed to be more sensitive to load controls in the mornings than in the evenings when the sun had had the chance to heat up the house. The households under investigation kept different indoor temperature levels; the average temperature ranged from 18, 5 ºC to 24 ºC. Intuitively, a household that normally keeps a lower indoor temperature should be more sensitive to a temperature drop of a couple of degrees. In this study, however, the households with a higher average indoor temperature tended to sense the temperature drops to the same extent as those with lower average indoor temperatures. This may be a result of these households adapting their clothing to the high indoor temperature by for instance wearing Tshirts or walking around barefoot even in wintertime. Another factor impacting on the thermal experience is the speed of the temperature drop. Houses equipped with direct resistive electric radiators and light frameworks lack the capacity to store heat and as such the indoor climate will be affected more easily. Load control of the hot water systems went unnoticed. Only one household experienced a shortage of hot water when the water heater had been switched off for several hours (during the 16 -hour long control period). The other households did not notice the switch-off period at all. This may however be a result of the fact that the households participating in this study did have big water heaters in relation to their hot water needs...|$|E

40|$|The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has the {{responsibility}} of distributing electricity to the consumers in Sri Lanka except few areas which belong to the Lanka Electric Company (LECO). When considering about the distribution network, distribution transformers play the major role. Protection of transformers is therefore very much important. Transformer failure rate and the distribution network reliability are major concerns of the CEB. Distribution transformer failure rate is high in theCEB network and also the fuse usage is unacceptably high. Present CEB fuse selection practice and practical situation at the field have been analyzed to find out better solution for above problems. Theory behind distribution transformer fuse selection has been discussed in detail. K type expulsion fuses are the recommended primary side fuses by the CEB. The study has proposed several changes to the existing fuse selection practice recommended by the CEB. The present distribution transformer protection scheme do not provide over load protection. It has been identified that nearly 13 % transformers had failed annually due to over load within the Southern Province. The study revealed that lower capacity of transformers such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA have the higher probability of getting overloaded. Furthermore, 15 % of distribution transformers installed in the Southern Province {{have at least one}} phase overloaded. A Primary side K type fuse does not provide overload protection to the distribution transformer. Hence, secondary side fuse should provide the over load protection but above findings tell that the expected task cannot be achieved by the present system. The study has proposed three options to solve this problem. Introduction of a primary fuse which is having special Time Current Characteristic (TCC) curve is the first option. The fuse type is called “SloFast” and it has a duel TCC curve. The SloFast fuse TCC curve behaves very much parallel to the transformer damage curve at some low level of current unlike K type fuse TCC curve, which intersects transformer damage curve at some low level of current. The second option is adding a <b>main</b> secondary <b>fuse</b> in between the transformer secondary terminal and the feeder fusses. So that the feeder fuse does the overload protection of the feeder conductor and the <b>main</b> secondary <b>fuse</b> does the overload protection of distribution transformer. The third option is limitation of the number of outgoing feeders from a transformer. This is very important for the distribution transformers having low capacities such as 100 kVA and 160 kVA, because the probability of getting overloaded is high with the present feeder arrangement. It is recommended the maximum number of feeders for each distribution transformer capacit...|$|R
