50|$|<b>Monitor</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are {{heavy-duty}} amplifiers, typically 200 watts per channel or more. If {{the monitor}} speakers are using passive crossovers, then each channel {{is connected to}} one or more monitor speakers. In simple monitor configurations, a single monitor mix might drive both channels of the amplifier so that the single mix can be heard by most of the band by using multiple speakers. In more complex monitor configurations where each performer has a separate mix, then each mix will drive a separate channel on the <b>amplifier.</b> If the <b>monitors</b> are bi-amped, then two or more amplifier channels are needed for each speaker. This may be a single channel of two different amplifiers, a high-power amp for the woofer and a medium-power amp for the high-frequency driver, or it may be two channels of a high-power amp. A key criteria of a monitor amp is reliability. They must be able to survive the abuse of their output being shorted or speakers being plugged and un-plugged while the amp is turned on. They must continue to function while being overloaded for extended periods of time.|$|R

The expected input signal range is 100 μV- 10 mV from a lead II electrode configuration. The amplifier provides a gain of 42 dB in a 3 dB bandwidth of 0. 05 Hz- 2 kHz with an input impedance of 280 MΩ and a CMRR of greater than 80 dB. Its gain and phase characteristics meet the recommendations of the AHA, making it suitable for clinical diagnostic <b>monitoring.</b> The <b>amplifier</b> has a power consumption of 20 μW operating from a 3 V battery and is intended for use in small, lightweight, portable electrocardiographic equipment and heart-rate monitoring instrumentation.

50|$|Stage wash in {{professional}} audio is unwanted sound entering a microphone on stage during a concert. Stage wash {{can come from}} the main public address system, from monitor loudspeakers, from instrument amplifiers such as for guitars and keyboards, and from loud instruments such as drums. The effects of stage wash in an overall mix may include a sense of muddiness and lack of detail, as other sounds modulate the desired sound. High-pass filters on mixing consoles can help reduce problems with stage wash by greatly attenuating low frequencies. Other methods of combating stage wash include using hyper-cardioid microphones, exchanging monitor loudspeakers for in-ear <b>monitors,</b> putting instrument <b>amplifiers</b> offstage or in isolation boxes, isolating drum bleed with drum glass and gobos, and employing directional methods and models in the subwoofers and main loudspeaker system.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} thesis aims {{to develop}} a system composed by a a CMOS power amplifier and built-in sensors for variability monitoring and compensation. The integration of monitoring systems with high frequency analog circuits is commonly used for performance optimization and control. In addition, built-in sensors are used in quality testing, improving the yield by detecting circuit faults during the fabrication of these. Typically, most of the built-in sensors are electrically connected to a node of the circuit under test, affecting its performance. In tuned power amplifers, for instance, a small load variation can cause a degradation of its output power and effciency. Hence, the integration between the circuit under test and the monitoring block should be carefully designed. These loading effects can be avoided using non-invasive solutions such as temperature sensors. An integrated circuit composed by a CMOS power amplifer, two amplitude detectors and a temperature sensor is implemented in this work. The degradation of the power amplifier performance due to variability effects is accelerated by increasing its supply voltage. A feedback loop is added to control and adjust the system operation, stress the amplifier and accelerate its degradation, <b>monitor</b> the <b>amplifier</b> performance using the sensors and compensate the observed degradation. The design of {{each one of the}} main parts of the system is presented through this work, explaining their theoretical basis and validating their operation with simulations results.

500|$|The {{advantage}} of tactile transducers used for low frequencies {{is that they}} allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low frequency waves.
