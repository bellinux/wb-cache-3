25|$|For a sweet wine, {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end {{to keep some}} of the sugar: this is the Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine <b>mesh</b> <b>filter),</b> {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.|$|E

An enhancement operation is achieved by a procedure which subtract smoothed face normals from the original ones. To apply the high-boost filter to face normals on a triangle mesh, we require a low-pass filter for smoothing them. We use mean filtering applied to face normals in numerical experiments.

5000|$|Unfiltered {{compressed}} air frequently contains dust, oil, rust, moisture and other harmful substances, and therefore requires filtration. In {{the first stage}} of filtration, the {{compressed air}} passes through a tube-shaped <b>mesh</b> <b>filter,</b> which creates a [...] coalescence effect. Here bigger particles are adsorbed on the filter and the water will condense into larger droplets, which can then pass into the separation chamber. The compressed air is slowed down, which makes the particles condense on a honeycomb-like pad, allowing the water droplets to travel {{to the bottom of the}} drainage system and through an automatic or electric drain valve to the discharge. In the first filtration stage more than 95% of the water droplets, oil and large particles are removed. This practice is most common for removing water, but is also used for removing oil.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} standard IEC 61853 - Part 1 [1] at the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI). The purpose of this work is to assess the reproducibility of the power matrix measurements obtained by the three methods specified in that standard, namely: under natural sunlight using a tracking system; under natural sunlight without tracker; using a Large Area Pulsed Solar Simulator of Class AAA. Three module technologies (poly-Si, CdTe and CIS) were characterized according to the IEC standard. The present work also includes a procedure based on un-calibrated <b>mesh</b> <b>filters</b> compared to other techniques available at ESTI to reduce the irradiance intensity using indoor apparatus. The advantage is that <b>mesh</b> <b>filters</b> can be mounted outdoor as well as indoor allowing direct comparison of measurement results. All three methods as implemented at ESTI agree well for irradiances at and above 400 W/m 2. With the additional use of a calibrated self-reference variant, applied to solve issues of uniformity and spectral changes [2], good agreement was found for all irradiances for all three module technologies studied.

50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver {{it to the big}} end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big end bearings. A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod big end has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame is}} a full steel duplex {{swingarm}} design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: 200 mm drum, Sport: 230 mm drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed 260 mm Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine lubrication was by oil pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear. Although ingenious, it required riders to gentle warm up their engines before using maximum revs, redlined at 9,200 rpm. Oil filtration was by plastic <b>mesh</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} {{a new class of}} <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> for {{grayscale}} images, called grid smoothing filter. The framework presented considers an image as a sampling grid associated to a set of gray levels. Furthermore, the sampling grid is seen as mesh composed by vertices and edges, the number of vertices being equal to the number of pixels in the image. Embedding the mesh in a 2 D Euclidian space, each vertex has two spatial coordinates and one attribute, the value of the gray level. Starting from the classical formulation of Laplacian mesh filtering, a novel objective function is introduced. The minimization of the objective function leads to new spatial coordinates for the vertices in the mesh. A reconstruction mechanism is then applied to the non-uniform mesh to reconstruct a grayscale image. Whereas the Laplacian <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> aims at smoothing an image, the grid smoothing tends at sharpening the edges of the image. The grid smoothing framework is applied to image enhancement in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{construction}} of linear mesh layouts has found various applications, such as implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering</b> and <b>mesh</b> streaming, where {{a variety of}} layout quality criteria, e. g., span and width, can be considered. While spectral sequencing, derived from the Fiedler vector, {{is one of the}} best-known heuristics for minimizing width, it does not perform as well as the Cuthill-Mckee (CM) scheme in terms of span. In this paper, we treat optimal mesh layout generation as a problem of preserving graph distances and propose to use the subdominant eigenvector of a kernel (affinity) matrix for sequencing. Despite the non-sparsity of the affinity operators we use, the layouts can be computed efficiently for large meshes through subsampling and eigenvector extrapolation. Our experiments show that the new sequences obtained outperform those derived from the Fiedler vector, in terms of spans, and those obtained from CM, in terms of widths and other important quality criteria. Therefore, in applications where several such quality criteria can influence algorithm performance simultaneously, e. g., mesh streaming and implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering,</b> the new <b>mesh</b> layouts could potentially provide a better trade-off. ...|$|R

The important geometric {{feature of the}} filters, which SU 8 is able to increase, is {{the thickness of the}} cross-shaped micromachined slots. This is five times its width. This thickness offers an extra degree of control over the resonance characteristics. The large thickness not only strengthens the structures, but also enhances the resonance quality factor (Q-factor).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution of implicit or explicit surfaces. The first part of this thesis addresses three problems in fluid simulation: advection, thin film, and the volume error. First, we show that the back and forth error compensation and correction (BFECC) method can significantly reduce the dissipation and diffusion. Second, thin film is hard to simulate since it has highly complex liquid/gas interface that requires high memory and computational costs. We address this difficulties by using cell centered octree grid to reduce memory cost and a multigrid method to reduce computational cost. Third, the volume loss is an undesired side effect of the level set method. The known solution to this problem is the particle level set method, which is expensive and has small but accumulating volume error. We provide a solution that is computationally effective and can prevent volume loss without accumulation. The second part of this thesis is focused on filtering a triangle mesh to produce a mesh whose details are selectively reduced or amplified. We develop a <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> with a rational transfer function, which is a generalization from previously developed mesh filters. In addition, we show that the <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> parameters can be computed from the physical size of mesh feature. Ph. D.
