Trends towards improved productivity, accuracy, reliability, flexibility, economy of the technological process, technological machines and machine system demand the development of new methods for the analysis of their effectiveness. A unified approach to the assessment of the effectiveness of processes, equipment and production allows considering them as energy-information model {{in which there is a}} transformation of all types and forms of energy, matter and information. This allows considering the concept of "energy efficiency" as the relative coefficient of efficiency of the collection of all kinds of transformative mechanisms and devices. On the basis of the proposed energyinformation model is given the generalized method for the evaluation and comparison of the integral energy efficiency of technological processes, technological machines and production engineering. Due to the directive for the ecodesign of energy-related products (2009 / 125 /EC) and economic factors a <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> has been evaluated over its whole life cycle.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{frequency}} domain approach {{for the analysis}} of time delay systems is presented. After linearization of a nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) with constant distributed delay around a constant or periodic reference solution the so-called Hill-Floquet method can be used {{for the analysis of}} the resulting linear DDE. In addition, systems with fast or slowly time-varying delays, systems with variable transport delays originating from a transport with variable velocity, and the corresponding spatially extended systems are presented, which can be also analyzed with the presented method. The newly introduced Hill-Floquet method is based on the Hill’s infinite determinant method and enables the transformation of a system with periodic coefficients to an autonomous system with constant coefficients. This makes the usage of a variety of existing methods for autonomous systems available for the analysis of periodic systems, which implies that the typical calculation of the monodromy matrix for the time evolution of the solution over the principle period is no longer required. In this thesis, the Chebyshev collocation method is used for the analysis of the autonomous systems. Specifically, in this case the periodic part of the solution is expanded in a Fourier series and the exponential behavior of the solution is approximated by the discrete values of the Fourier coefficients at the Chebyshev nodes, whereas in classical spectral or pseudo-spectral methods for the analysis of linear periodic DDEs the complete solution is expanded in terms of basis functions. In the last part of this thesis, new results for three applications with time delay effects are presented, which were analyzed with the presented methods. On the one hand, the occurrence of diffusion-driven instabilities in reaction-diffusion systems with delay is investigated. It is shown that wave instabilities are possible already for single-species reaction diffusion systems with distributed or time-varying delay. On the other hand, the stability of <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> vibrations at <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> is analyzed. In particular, parallel orthogonal turning processes with multiple discrete delays and turning processes with a time-varying delay due to a spindle speed variation are studied. Finally, the stability of the synchronized solution in networks with heterogeneous coupling delays is studied. In particular, the eigenmode expansion for synchronized periodic orbits is derived, which includes an extension of the classical master stability function to networks with heterogeneous coupling delays. Numerical results are shown for a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with two delays in the coupling. In dieser Dissertation wird ein neues Verfahren zur Analyse von Systemen mit Totzeiten im Frequenzraum vorgestellt. Nach Linearisierung einer nichtlinearen retardierten Differentialgleichung (DDE) mit konstanter verteilter Totzeit um eine konstante oder periodische Referenzlösung kann die sogenannte Hill-Floquet Methode für die Analyse der resultierende linearen DDE angewendet werden. Darüber hinaus werden Systeme mit schnell oder langsam variierender Totzeit, Systeme mit einer variablen Totzeit, resultierend aus einem Transport mit variabler Geschwindigkeit, und entsprechende räumlich ausgedehnte Systeme vorgestellt, welche ebenfalls mit der vorgestellten Methode analysiert werden können. Die neu eingeführte Hill-Floquet Methode basiert auf der Hillschen unendlichen Determinante und ermöglicht die Transformation eines Systems mit periodischen Koeffizienten auf ein autonomes System mit konstanten Koeffizienten. Dadurch können zur Analyse periodischer Systeme auch eine Vielzahl existierender Methoden für autonome Systeme genutzt werden und die Berechnung der Monodromie-Matrix für die Lösung des Systems über eine Periode entfällt. In dieser Arbeit wird zur Analyse des autonomen Systems die Tschebyscheff-Kollokationsmethode verwendet. Im Speziellen wird bei diesem Verfahren der periodische Teil der Lösung in einer Fourierreihe entwickelt und das exponentielle Verhalten durch die Werte der Fourierkoeffizienten an den Tschebyscheff Knoten approximiert, wohingegen bei klassischen spektralen Verfahren die komplette Lösung in bestimmten Basisfunktionen entwickelt wird. Im Anwendungsteil der Arbeit werden neue Ergebnisse für drei Beispielsysteme präsentiert, welche mit den vorgestellten Methoden analysiert wurden. Es wird gezeigt, dass Welleninstabilitäten schon bei Einkomponenten-Reaktionsdiffusionsgleichungen mit verteilter oder variabler Totzeit auftreten können. In einem zweiten Beispiel werden Schwingungen an Werkzeugmaschinen betrachtet, wobei speziell simultane Drehbearbeitungsprozesse und Prozesse mit Drehzahlvariationen genauer untersucht werden.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, complex {{multi-axis}} and multi-process {{machines with}} complex controllers have been commonplace for the efficient batch production of precision parts that incorporate various {{technologies such as}} milling, turning, grinding and laser cutting. With this level of complexity, interoperability between different resources and technologies in CNC <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> has always been difficult. For dealing with this difficulty in interoperability, researchers started to identify an efficient way of realising interoperability between CNC <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> with different technologies for machining the same component on various CNC machines. STEP-NC is a rich information standard developed to replace the traditional programming languages used for CNC machines. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose a methodology based on the use of STEP-NC to develop a framework for cross technology interoperability. A prototype implementation of the framework is tested by converting a STEP-NC programme written for a 4 -Axis milling machine to one suitable for a turn-mill machine...|$|R

The use of fluid-driven spindles is {{well known}} for machining various components, but not in real <b>metal</b> <b>cutting.</b> <b>Machining</b> of larger precision components as prototypes, tools and dies requires the use of relatively large <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and high-performance spindles. Usually these are mechanical spindles with relatively high power, displaying a rather low maximum speed of approximately 15, 000 rpm. However, in semi-finishing and finishing with HPC conditions and in micro machining, the required rotation speeds are higher and the required power is lower. This paper presents sustainability and efficiency using fluid-driven spindles for HPC on standard <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> with small tool diameters and rotation speeds of up to 90, 000 rpm using air and 30, 000 rpm using the coolant flow. The fluid-driven spindle leads to a significant widening of the application range of larger <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and to an improvement of productivity by higher efficiency and faster tool- and spindle change, respectively...|$|R
