5000|$|The caplock {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} a hammer, similar to the hammer used in a flintlock, and a nipple (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "cone"), which holds a small percussion cap. The nipple contains a tube which goes into the barrel. The percussion cap contains a chemical compound called <b>mercuric</b> <b>fulminate</b> or fulminate of mercury, whose chemical formula is Hg(ONC). It is made from mercury, nitric acid and alcohol. When the trigger releases the hammer, it strikes the cap, causing the <b>mercuric</b> <b>fulminate</b> to explode. The flames from this explosion travel down the tube in the nipple and enter the barrel, where they ignite the main powder charge.|$|E
