40|$|Any {{model for}} the {{formation}} of elliptical planetary nebulae (PNs) should account for the positive correlation between the mass loss rate and the degree of departure from sphericity of the AGB progenitor’s wind. I propose that this correlation results from dust formation above <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> spots. The model deals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is that a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust formation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the equatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust formation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is high. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage that it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation velocities of less than 10 − 4 times the break-up velocity. Such velocities can be achieved by a planet companion of mass ∼ 0. 1 MJupiter which spins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main sequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> spots also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the descendant PN. The model cannot explain the presence of jets and ansae in elliptical PNs. These are attributed to the destruction of a planet or brown dwarf on the AGB core. – 2 – 1...|$|R
40|$|Many {{planetary}} and Earth science missions require cooling {{to increase}} sensitivity and reduce thermal noise of detectors, for preserving high Isp propellants, or for protecting instruments from hostile environments. For space applications, such cooling requires reliable, efficient, long-life coolers that are relatively compact, lightweight, and have low vibration. We have developed and are developing coolers that meet these requirements {{over a wide}} range of temperatures. These include pulse tube coolers cooling from 300 K to below 6 K, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>cooler</b> cooling from 10 K to 2 K, a 3 He sorption cooler cooling from 2 K to 0. 3 K and a helium dilution cooler cooling from 0. 3 K to 0. 05 K.

40|$|I {{propose that}} the {{mechanism}} behind the formation of concentric semi-periodic shells found in several planetary nebulae (PNs) and proto-PNs, and around one asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, is a solar-like magnetic activity cycle in the progenitor AGB stars. The time intervals between consecutive ejection events is ∼ 200 − 1, 000 yrs, which {{is assumed to be}} the cycle period (the full magnetic cycle can be twice as long, as is the 22 -year period in the sun). The magnetic field has no dynamical effects; it regulates the mass loss rate by the formation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> spots. The enhanced magnetic activity at the cycle maximum results in more <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> spots, which facilitate the formation of dust, hence increasing the mass loss rate. The strong magnetic activity implies that the AGB star is spun up by a companion, via a tidal or common envelope interaction. The strong interaction with a stellar companion explains the observations that the concentric semi-periodic shells are found mainly in bipolar PNs.

40|$|A {{design of}} a highly {{efficient}} and lightweight space <b>magnetic</b> <b>cooler</b> has been developed that can continuously provide remote/distributed cooling at temperatures {{in the range of}} 2 K with a heat sink at about 15 K. The innovative design uses a cryogenic circulator that enables the cooler to operate at a high cycle frequency to achieve a large cooling capacity. The ability to provide remote/distributed cooling not only allows flexible integration with a payload and spacecraft, but also reduces the mass of the magnetic shields needed. The active magnetic regenerative refrigerator (AMRR) system is shown in the figure. This design mainly consists of two identical magnetic regenerators surrounded by their superconducting magnets and a reversible circulator. Each regenerator also has a heat exchanger at its warm end to reject the magnetization heat to the heat sink, and the two regenerators share a cold-end heat exchanger to absorb heat from a cooling target. The circulator controls the flow direction, which cycles in concert with the magnetic fields, to facilitate heat transfer. Helium enters the hot end of the demagnetized column, is cooled by the refrigerant, and passes into the cold-end heat exchanger to absorb heat. The helium then enters the cold end of the magnetized column, absorbing heat from the refrigerant, and enters the hot-end heat exchanger to reject the magnetization heat. The efficient heat transfer in the AMRR allows the system to operate at a relatively short cycle period to achieve a large cooling power. The key mechanical components in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cooler</b> are the reversible circulator and the magnetic regenerators. The circulator uses non-contacting, self-acting gas bearings and clearance seals to achieve long life and vibration- free operation. There are no valves or mechanical wear in this circulator, so the reliability is predicted to be very high. The magnetic regenerator employs a structured bed configuration. The core consists of a stack of thin GGG disks alternating with thin polymer insulating films. The structured bed reduces flow resistance in the regenerator and therefore the pumping work by the cryogenic circulator. This <b>magnetic</b> <b>cooler</b> will enable cryogenic detectors for sensing infrared, x-ray, gamma-ray, and submillimeter radiation in future science satellites, as well as the detector systems in the Constellation-X (Con-X) and the Single Aperture Far-Infrared observatory (SAFIR). Scientific ap p - lica tions for this innovation include cooling for x-ray micro calorimeter spectrometers used for microanalysis, cryogenic particle detectors, and superconducting tunnel junction de tectors for biomolecule mass spectrometry. The cooler can be scaled to provide very large cooling capacities at very low temperatures, ideal for liquid helium and liquid hydrogen productions...|$|R

The volume of the cylinder bore could also be significantly increase by only slightly increasing the volume of the magnets, for a fixed mean flux density. Placing additional blocks of magnets on the end faces of the Halbach cylinder also improved the mean flux density in the cylinder bore, especially so for short Halbach cylinders with large r_ex. Moreover <b>magnetic</b> <b>cooling</b> as an application for Halbach cylinders was considered.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{structure}} of <b>cool</b> <b>magnetic</b> spots in the photospheres of evolved stars, specifically asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. We find that the photosphere of a <b>cool</b> <b>magnetic</b> spot will be above the surrounding photosphere of AGB stars, opposite {{to the situation in}} the sun. This results from the behavior of the opacity, which increases with decreasing temperature, opposite to the behavior of the opacity near the effective temperature of the sun. We analyze the formation of dust above the <b>cool</b> <b>magnetic</b> spots, and suggest that the dust formation is facilitated by strong shocks, driven by stellar pulsations, which run through and around the spots. The presence of both the <b>magnetic</b> field and <b>cooler</b> temperatures make dust formation easier as the shock passes above the spot.

40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{studies of}} a class of white dwarfs (WDs) called DQ WDs. White dwarfs are the remnants of ordinary stars like our Sun that {{have run out of}} nuclear fuel. WDs are classified according to the composition of their atmosphere and DQ WDs have an atmosphere made of helium and carbon. The carbon comes in either atomic or molecular form and in some cases the strong spectral absorption features cover the entire optical wavelength region. The research presented here utilizes spectropolarimetry, which is an observational technique that combines spectroscopy and polarization. Separately these allow to study the composition of a target and the inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the target. Put together they form a powerful tool to probe the physical properties in the atmosphere of a star. It is espacially good for detecting magnetic fields. The papers in this thesis describe efforts to do a survey of DQ white dwarfs with spectropolarimetry in order to search for magnetic fields in them. Paper I describes the discovery of a new <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> DQ white dwarf, GJ 841 B. Initial modeling of molecular features on DQ WDs showed inconsistencies with observations. The first possible solution to this problem was stellar spots on these WDs. To investigate the matter, two DQ WDs were monitored for photometric variability that could arise from the presence of such spots. Paper II summarizes this short campaign and reports the negative results. Paper III reports observations {{of the rest of the}} objects in our survey. The paper includes the discovery of polarization from another cool DQ white dwarf, bringing the total of known <b>magnetic</b> <b>cool</b> DQs to three.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model that}} {{combines}} a Landau free energy part and a micromagnetic free energy part aimed at describing a magnetostructural multiferroic. We show that {{in the limit of}} high-elastic anisotropy and strong magnetostructural interplay, the model is able to reproduce characteristic strain and magnetization configurations typical of magnetic shapememory materials. For low-elastic anisotropy, in the presence of disorder arising from compositional fluctuations giving rise to a distribution of local transition temperatures, the model is able to reproduce strain glass behaviour. In this case, the temperature dependence of the magnetization measured after zero <b>magnetic</b> field <b>cooling</b> deviates from the magnetization measured after <b>magnetic</b> field <b>cooling</b> protocol, which proves that the strain glass behaviour induces non-ergodicity in the magnetic degrees of freedom as well.
