5|$|Shōgo Suzuki/Steve Blum as Vincent Valentine. Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent to have noticeably {{different}} voices {{because the}} characters were otherwise quite similar. Since Vincent was older and <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> than Cloud, his role {{was given to}} Suzuki, who has a very low voice.|$|E

5|$|Actors and props from Doppelgänger would re-appear {{in a later}} Anderson TV series, UFO. Although the Andersons {{incorporated}} adult themes {{into their}} script {{in an effort to}} distinguish the film from their children's TV productions, cuts to <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> content, in this case a shot of a pack of contraceptive pills, were required to permit an A and, later, PG certificate from the BBFC.|$|E
5|$|Ferreira's {{earlier work}} {{incorporated}} elements of dance-pop, while her recent projects experiment with acoustic, new wave and primarily indie rock musical styles. Her lyrical content originally incorporated themes of rebellion and teenage romance, {{and has since}} evolved to discuss personal insecurities and <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> romantic themes. Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, she has modeled for several brands and magazines, including serving as the spokeswoman for the hair care brand Redken in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Hiroyuki Okiura, the {{character}} designer and key animation supervisor, designed a <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> and serious Motoko than Masamune Shirow's original portrayal of {{the character}} in the manga. Okiura chose to depict a physically mature person to match Motoko's mental age, instead of the youthful twenty-something appearance in the manga. Motoko's demeanor lacks the comedic facial expressions and rebellious nature depicted in the manga.|$|E

5000|$|The {{enduring}} {{and heroic}} {{struggle of the}} people of the South, {{of the people of}} Thừa Thiên, is the source of inspiration of Thanh Hải.

5|$|In {{the postwar}} years, he portrayed <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> {{characters}} {{at odds with}} the world in films such as The Fountainhead (1949) and High Noon (1952).

5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first. Many favored Leaf's stronger arm and greater potential, while others deemed Manning the <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> player and the safer pick. Most observers, however, believed {{that it would not}} greatly matter whether Manning or Leaf was drafted first because either would greatly benefit his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was completed early in van der Weyden's career, probably just after his apprenticeship with Robert Campin ended. Although highly accomplished, it {{is filled with}} symbolism of a kind absent from his <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> works. It is one of three attributed paintings, all early works, that show the Virgin and Child set within an architectural setting, surrounded with painted sculptural figures, the others being The Madonna Standing and the Durán Madonna.|$|E
60|$|Burns, the catcher, however, gave Wayne confidence. He was a short, sturdy youngster, {{with all}} the earmarks of a coming star. Huling, the captain, handled himself well at first base. The Bellville players were <b>more</b> <b>matured,</b> {{and some of them}} were former college cracks. Wayne saw that he had his work cut out for him.|$|R
5000|$|The Microsoft Visual C++ [...]NET compiler, which compiles Managed C++ {{to target}} the [...]NET Framework, {{produces}} a much <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> set of instructions in its resultant assembly, thus improving performance.

5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by the beetles, but they find the beetles to be larger and <b>more</b> <b>mature.</b> From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep.

Slowly, Hasini starts befriending Santosh’s mother and sisters and gets close with them. Hasini informs them about Santosh’s behaviours such as alcohol consumption, going out at night to meet her, and his plans of getting a bank loan {{to start his own}} company which were not known to Santosh’s family before.|$|E
5|$|Gerry Anderson biographers Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn {{suggest that}} Thunderbird 6 {{develops}} {{the character of}} Lady Penelope from her previous appearances in the Thunderbirds franchise. This is argued to be due, in part, to a <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> reading of the character's lines from Sylvia Anderson, who provided Penelope's voice from the first episode of the Thunderbirds television series. Archer and Hearn also praise the work of David Graham, particularly his reading of Parker's dialogue, but note that other regular characters, such as Gordon and John, appear infrequently in the film.|$|E
60|$|Hurlstone laughed, but {{suddenly}} looking down upon her face {{he was struck}} with its youthfulness. She had always impressed him before--through her reserve and independence--as older, and <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> in character. He {{did not know how}} lately she was finding her lost youth as he asked her, quite abruptly, if she ever had any little brothers and sisters.|$|R
60|$|They entered. Heavens! {{what was}} my {{surprise}} when I beheld Bianca before me.

The time that had elapsed had developed the graces of her person; and the sorrow she had undergone had diffused over her countenance an irresistible tenderness.|$|R
5000|$|All come in {{a variety}} of styles {{depending}} on how long they have been aged. The <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> cheeses, referred to as stagionato ("seasoned" [...] or [...] "aged" [...] ), are harder but still crumbly in texture and have decidedly buttery and nutty flavours. The other two types semi-stagionato and fresco have a softer texture and milder cream and milk tastes.|$|R
5|$|On December 15, 2002, ABC aired Nancy Drew, {{starring}} Maggie Lawson {{and produced}} by Lawrence Bender. The movie {{was intended to}} be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> turn. The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed following Lawson being cast on another series.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E
5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> and in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.|$|E

A <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> portrayal by Rajini, an equally matching Radhika and thought-provoking script are the key factors which made the film memorable".|$|R
5000|$|On 2015 a {{long-range}} cruise missile was revealed {{under the name}} [...] "Soumar (missile)" [...] which possibly is the <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> type of Meshkat. The range of the missile was not mentioned. Haaretz newspaper claimed the design closely resembles the Kh-55 that Iran acquired from Ukraine in 2001. Because of the similarities media guess a range between 2000 and 3000 km for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{the mystery}} of your {{childhood}} will be gone, Miss Jones," [...] said Mr. M'Gabbery, who, in his present state of hopelessness as regarded Miss Waddington, was ill-naturedly interfering with young Pott.

Your associations will henceforth bear a richer tint." ...|$|R
5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, <b>more</b> <b>mature,</b> centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 1970s, comics aimed at {{children}} gradually disappeared. The new breed of underground, alternative and independent comics was aimed at a <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of science fiction and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like Gene Day, Dave Sim, Augustine Funnell, Jim Craig, Ken Steacy, Dean Motter, and Vincent Marchesano.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a <b>more</b> <b>mature</b> appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5000|$|Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie: Edmund is the second-youngest of the Pevensie {{children}} and a King of Narnia.

On his last journey, his hunger for more power against Caspian and the White Witch is being tested.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{researches}} {{have been}} more favorable to her. Cultural historian Peter Gay in an article titled [...] "The Legless Angel of 'David Copperfield': There's More to Her Than Victorian Piety" [...] stated that, she shows the effects of parentification. The death {{of her mother and}} alcoholism and weak-mindedness of her father makes her <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> for her age, along with gifts of intelligence and presence of mind.|$|R
50|$|Kaya is Erika and Iori's mother. Estimated to be {{at least}} 251 years old, yet she looks like a child, giving people the image that she is Iori and Erika's younger sister instead. Erika looks like a {{splitting}} image of her, the only difference being Erika's <b>more</b> <b>matured</b> body and that Kaya's eyes are constantly red in color, which every vampire has when they have their vampiric impulses.|$|R
