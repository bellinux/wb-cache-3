25|$|The first guitar {{amplifier}} with a tremolo {{effect was}} produced by Fender in 1955. In that amplifier, the tremolo generator controlled the bias of an amplifier cascade located near the output circuit, and its harmonics were leaking to the output signal. In the early 1960s, Fender and Gibson used a RO as a modulator. Its photoresistor was connected via a blocking capacitor and a controlling potentiometer between {{the output of the}} preamplifier and the earth, and shunted the preamplifier when triggered. In this scheme, the control signal did not leak to the output. <b>Modulation</b> <b>depth</b> was regulated by a low-impedance potentiometer placed on the front panel. The potentiometer significantly reduced the gain of the previous stage, and thus the preamplifier had to have reserves by amplification.|$|E

One of the major drawbacks preventing widespread acceptance of this technique is that the data acquisitions speeds are slow making imaging applications impractical.

50|$|In {{addition}} to increasing with average illumination intensity, the fusion frequency also increases with {{the extent of}} modulation (the maximal relative decrease in light intensity presented); for each frequency and average illumination, there is a characteristic modulation threshold, below which the flicker cannot be detected, and for each <b>modulation</b> <b>depth</b> and average illumination, there is a characteristic frequency threshold. It {{should be noted that}} these values vary with the wavelength of illumination, because of the wavelength dependence of photoreceptor sensitivity, and they vary with the position of the illumination within the retina, because of the concentration of cones in central regions including the fovea and the macula, and the dominance of rods in the peripheral regions of the retina.|$|E
50|$|The final {{key part}} of the {{architecture}} was the digital delay section, which provided an effect unit that could be applied to the sound. As the rest of the synthesizer architecture up to this point in the sound chain was analogue, the signal had to be converted back to a digital signal so that it could have the effect applied. This fact is evident in the increased noise when using the delay effect. Despite this, it was a flexible digital delay that gave times ranging from 2 to 512 milliseconds in length. Delay effects are similar to reverb. Added to this was a <b>modulation</b> <b>depth</b> parameter so the user could create chorus and flanging effects as well as delay.|$|E

We trained monkeys to reach to targets in a center-out task either using their arm or a BCI. We found that neurons’ PDs cluster similarly during training of the BCI decoder and usage of the BCI, but remain relatively unclustered when the monkeys use their arms. <b>Modulation</b> <b>depths</b> increase upon usage of the BCI, and narrowness of tuning tends to either increase or decrease rather than staying the same. In addition, the cluster direction can be predicted from per-target performance.

5000|$|Semiconductor saturable {{absorbers}} {{were used}} for laser mode-locking as early as 1974 when p-type germanium is used to mode lock a CO2 laser which generated pulses ~500 ps [...] Modern SESAMs are III-V semiconductor single quantum well (SQW) or multiple quantum wells grown on semiconductor distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). They were initially used in a Resonant Pulse Modelocking (RPM) scheme as starting mechanisms for Ti:Sapphire lasers which employed KLM as a fast saturable absorber [...] RPM is another coupled-cavity mode-locking technique. Different from APM lasers which employ non-resonant Kerr-type phase nonlinearity for pulse shortening, RPM employs the amplitude nonlinearity provided by the resonant band filling effects of semiconductors. SESAMs were soon developed into intracavity saturable absorber devices because of more inherent simplicity with this structure. Since then, the use of SESAMs has enabled the pulse durations, average powers, pulse energies and repetition rates of ultrafast solid-state lasers to be improved by several orders of magnitude. Average power of 60 W and repetition rate up to 160 GHz were obtained. By using SESAM-assisted KLM, sub-6 fs pulses directly from a Ti: Sapphire oscillator was achieved. A major advantageSESAMs have over other saturable absorber techniques is that absorber parameters can be easily controlled {{over a wide range}} of values. For example, saturation fluence can be controlled by varying the reflectivity of the top reflector while <b>modulation</b> <b>depth</b> and recovery time can be tailored by changing the low temperature growing conditions for the absorber layers [...] This freedom of design has further extended the application of SESAMs into modelocking of fiber lasers where a relatively high <b>modulation</b> <b>depth</b> is needed to ensure self-starting and operation stability.

50|$|Complex grating {{profiles}} can {{be manufactured}} by exposing {{a large number}} of small, partially overlapping gratings in sequence. Advanced properties such as phase shifts and varying <b>modulation</b> <b>depth</b> can be introduced by adjusting the corresponding properties of the subgratings. In the first version of the method, subgratings were formed by exposure with UV pulses, but this approach had several drawbacks, such as large energy fluctuations in the pulses and low average power. A sequential writing method with continuous UV radiation that overcomes these problems has been demonstrated and is now used commercially. The photosensitive fiber is translated by an interferometrically controlled airbearing borne carriage. The interfering UV beams are focused onto the fiber, and as the fiber moves, the fringes move along the fiber by translating mirrors in an interferometer. As the mirrors have a limited range, they must be reset every period, and the fringes move in a sawtooth pattern. All grating parameters are accessible in the control software, and it is therefore possible to manufacture arbitrary gratings structures without any changes in the hardware.|$|E
50|$|Neural fibers {{that are}} {{sensitive}} to infrasonic stimuli {{have been identified in}} the pigeon and their characteristics have been studied. It turns out that, although these fibers also originate in the inner ear, they are quite different from normal acoustic fibers. Infrasound sensitive fibers have very high rates of spontaneous discharge, with a mean of 115imp/s, which is much higher than the spontaneous discharge of other auditory fibers. Recordings show that discharge rates do not increase in response to infrasound stimuli but are modulated at levels comparable to the behavioral thresholds. <b>Modulation</b> <b>depth</b> is dependent on stimulus frequency and intensity. The modulation is phase locked so that the discharge rate increases during one phase of the stimulus and decreases during the other, leaving the mean discharge rate constant. Such pulse-frequency modulation allows the stimulus analysis to be independent of the peripheral tuning of the basilar membrane or the hair cells, which is already poor at low auditory frequencies. Unlike other acoustic fibers, infrasonic fibers do not show any indication of being tuned to a particular characteristic frequency.|$|E
