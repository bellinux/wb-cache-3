The seeds were selected by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>divider</b> and by hand, and their correspondence to radiographic images in seeds with glumes and their caryopses. The width and length of the seeds with glumes and their caryopses were measured with electronic calliper, and their weight, with precision balance. Radiographic images of seeds with glumes were taken with an X-ray experimental equipment. The analyst selected seeds with glumes by the width and by the length previously determined and so with more weight, than that obtained by hand selection was slightly narrower, larger and lighter. The presence of the glumes masked the caryopses real dimensions (width and length), and conduced the analyst to select seeds that differed more by the width than by the length. The radiographic images showed the presence, or not, of caryopses inside the seed and its real dimensions. The mechanical partition method for seeds showed to be more efficient because the analyst subjectivity was not considered when the selection upon its dimensions was done. The X-ray analysis was a useful tool that complements the pure seed fraction selection as another factor of seed quality. 200...|$|E

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a incidência da largura e do comprimento numa única fração de sementes de aveia [Avena sativa (L.) ] cv. Cristal. Essa fração de sementes foi selecionada por um divisor mecânico e seleção manual e sua correspondência com imagens radiográficas em sementes com glumas e seus cariopses. Foram medidos a largura e o comprimento das sementes com glumas e seus cariopses com um calibrador eletrônico, e seu peso, com o emprego de uma balança de precisão. As imagens radiográficas das sementes com glumas foram tomadas com um equipamento experimental de raios X. O analista escolheu sementes com glumas de largura e comprimento previamente determinado, e, portanto, com peso maior do que o das obtidas pela separação manual, as quais foram menos largas, mais compridas e mais leves. A presença das glumas mascarou as dimensões reais dos cariopses (largura e comprimento), conduzindo o analista a selecionar sementes que diferiram mais pela largura que pelo comprimento. As imagens radiográficas mostraram a presença, ou não, dos cariopses no interior das sementes e suas reais dimensões. Os métodos de seleção mecânica de sementes mostraram ser os mais eficientes, pois não foi considerada a subjetividade do analista quando a seleção foi feita por suas dimensões. As análises por raios X foram um instrumento útil que complementou a seleção da fração pura como outro fator da qualidade da semente...|$|E
