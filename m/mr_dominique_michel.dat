50|$|The {{series was}} an {{adaptation}} of Roger Lemelin's 1982 novel, Le crime d'Ovide Plouffe, a sequel to his influential 1948 novel Les Plouffe.

5000|$|The Kushner-Stratonovich {{solution}} is a stochastic partial differential equation. In 1969, Moshe Zakai introduced a simplified dynamics for the unnormalized conditional {{law of the}} filter known as Zakai equation.It has been proved by Mireille Chaleyat-Maurel and <b>Dominique</b> <b>Michel</b> that the {{solution is}} infinite dimensional in general, and as such requires finite dimensional approximations. These may be heuristics-based such as the extended Kalman filter or the assumed density filters described by Peter S. Maybeck [...] or the projection filters introduced by Damiano Brigo, Bernard Hanzon and François Le Gland, some sub-families of which are shown {{to coincide with the}} assumed density filters.|$|R

50|$|The {{particle}} filter methodology {{is used to}} solve Hidden Markov Chain (HMM) and nonlinear filtering problems. With the notable exception of linear-Gaussian signal-observation models (Kalman filter) or wider classes of models (Benes filter) Mireille Chaleyat-Maurel and <b>Dominique</b> <b>Michel</b> proved in 1984 that the sequence of posterior distributions of the random states of the signal given the observations (a.k.a. optimal filter) have no finitely recursive recursion. Various numerical methods based on fixed grid approximations, Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques (MCMC), conventional linearization, extended Kalman filters, or determining the best linear system (in expect cost-error sense) have never really coped with large scale systems, unstable processes or when the nonlinearities are not sufficiently smooth.|$|R

50|$|The Governor General's Performing Arts Awards are the {{foremost}} honours presented {{for excellence in}} the performing arts, in the categories of dance, classical music, popular music, film, broadcasting, and theatre.

Initially, the award came with a $15,000 prize from the Canada Council; today's winners receive $25,000 and a medallion struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. In addition, two complementary awards are given: The Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts, recognizing the voluntary services to the performing arts by an individual or group, and the National Arts Centre Award, which recognizes an individual artist's or company's work during the past performance year. There is also a mentorship program that connects award recipients with artists in their early to mid-career. Since 2008, the National Film Board of Canada has produced short films about each of the laureates, which are screened at the awards ceremony and streamed online.|$|R
