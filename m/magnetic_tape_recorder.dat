25|$|The {{history of}} sound {{recording}} can cover mechanical, acoustical, electrical, magnetic and digital recording. Methods and media for sound recording are varied and have undergone significant changes {{between the first}} time sound was actually recorded for later playback until now. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben a German chemical industry in Frankfurt am Main, created the world's first practical <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> the K1, which was first demonstrated in 1935. The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, along with the five smaller firms Agfa, Cassella and some other companies.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the recording and reproducing heads, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings could be cut on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing.

2500|$|Sound {{recording}} {{and reproduction is}} an electrical or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog {{recording and}} digital recording. Analog (or analogue) recording (Greek, ana = [...] "according to" [...] and logos = [...] "relationship") is a technique used to store signals of audio or video information for later playback. In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image. In 1967, the first digital audio <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> is invented. A 12-bit 30kHz stereo device using a compander to extend the dynamic range.|$|E

50|$|The wire {{recorder}} {{business was}} short-lived. In 1952 Webcor introduced its first <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> and by 1955 {{magnetic tape recorders}} overtook wire ones.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, another {{significant}} development {{was made in}} Germany. Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> called the Magnetophon.

50|$|Six of {{the seven}} active {{experiments}} that needed to record data used one or two Experiment Power and Data System (EPDS) modules. Each EPDS contained a processing and control module, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> and two LiSO2 batteries.One experiment (S0069) used a 4-track magnetic tape module not {{as part of an}} EPDS.|$|E

5000|$|British <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorders</b> or BTR {{machines}} were reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> initially made by EMI in England after World War II. They {{were the first}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> to be manufactured in Britain, and their design imitated that of the <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> used by the Germans during the war. Because these multi-track recorders were painted EMI green, they then {{became known as the}} [...] "Green Machines".|$|R
50|$|Consumer wire {{recorders}} were marketed {{for home}} entertainment {{or as an}} inexpensive substitute for commercial office dictation recorders, but the development of consumer <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> starting in 1946, with the BK 401 Soundmirror, using paper-based tape, quickly drove wire recorders from the market.|$|R

50|$|Engineers at AEG, {{working with}} the {{chemical}} giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. During World War II, an engineer at the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft discovered the AC biasing technique. With this technique, an inaudible high-frequency signal, typically {{in the range of}} 50 to 150 kHz, is added to the audio signal before being applied to the recording head. Biasing radically improved the sound quality of magnetic tape recordings. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders.|$|E
50|$|Both {{recording}} and playback heads, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted vertically so that several recordings could be cut on the same 3/16 in strip. While the machine was never developed commercially, {{it was an interesting}} ancestor to the modern <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> which it resembled somewhat in design. The tapes and machine created by Bell's associates, examined at one of the Smithsonian Institution's museums, became brittle, and the heavy paper reels warped. The machine's playback head was also missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning, they could be placed into working condition.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{his stories}} have been {{collected}} by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, whose logo he possibly inspired (although the logo was designed by Bill Kennard), under the title Memoirs of a space engineer. Additional humorous engineering stories include hand-decoding images from Mariner 4 onto a sheet of graph paper since NASA JPL had only built a single display system, running a <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> 25 times over its rated speed to have enough bandwidth to record Ranger 9 video of {{its impact on the}} moon, and an impromptu excavation of Pompeii's plumbing systems.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{recording}} {{was demonstrated}} in principle {{as early as}} 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen in his telegraphone. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> recording, involve {{the use of a}} magnetizable medium which moves with a constant speed past a recording head. Engineers at AEG, working with the chemical giant IG Farben, created the world's first practical <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> sound <b>recorder,</b> the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935.

50|$|In some {{electromechanical}} {{offices in}} the 1970s, the paper <b>tape</b> punch <b>recorders</b> were replaced by <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> Most punches remained in service until the exchange switch itself was replaced by more advanced systems. Stored program control exchanges, having computers anyway, do not need separate AMA equipment. They sent <b>magnetic</b> <b>tapes</b> to the Accounting Center until approximately 1990, when data links took over this job.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders,</b> not {{commercially available}} in the U.S. until 1948, were too expensive, complicated, and bulky to compete with these consumer-level wire recorders. During {{the first half of}} the 1950s, however, <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> which were sufficiently affordable, simple, and compact to be suitable for home and office use started appearing and they rapidly drove wire recorders from the market.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the MITS Altair 8800, the EDUC-8 {{included}} two serial input and two serial output ports {{at the back}} of the computer. The EDUC-8 also had front panel lights and switches to program the computer. The later articles included a variety of peripherals, allowing the computer to interface to a keypad, octal display, paper tape loader, paper tape puncher, printer, keyboard, music player, teleprinter, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> and alphanumeric display. The articles were collected into a book, where additional information was published detailing how to expand the number of I/O ports to 256, adding up to 32KB of additional memory, and using the computer to control various switches.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> became {{available}} in the U.S., NBC Symphony Orchestra concert broadcasts were preserved on transcription discs. After its conductor Arturo Toscanini retired, he transferred many of these recordings to tape, {{with the assistance of}} his son Walter, and most were eventually released on LP or CD.|$|R
5000|$|After the war, Ranger's work led {{to further}} {{development}} of <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> He developed a product using the German technology, and demonstrated it to potential users, including {{the members of the}} Institute of Radio Engineers, the National Broadcasting Company, the Radio Corporation of America, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and individuals like singer Bing Crosby.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{foundation}} of electronics company Sony in 1946, composers Toru Takemitsu and Minao Shibata independently conceived possible uses for electronic technology to produce music. Takemitsu had ideas {{similar to that of}} musique concrète, which he was initially unaware of, while Shibata foresaw the development of synthesizers and predicted a drastic change in music. Sony began producing popular <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> for government and public use.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Jack Mullin {{brought a}} Magnetophon <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>{{recorder}}</b> back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape; the recorder {{was one of}} the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5 mm tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality analog audio sound; Alexander M. Poniatoff then ordered his Ampex company to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophon for use in radio production. Bing Crosby eventually adopted the technology to pre-record his radio show, which was scheduled for a certain time every week, to avoid having to perform the show live, as well as having to perform it a second time for West Coast audiences.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{storage in}} the form of wire {{recording}}—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of the Electrical World. Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools. The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900) magnetic recorder was invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Poulsen's device recorded a signal on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer developed the first <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> Early magnetic storage devices were designed to record analog audio signals. Computers and now most audio and video magnetic storage devices record digital data.|$|E
5000|$|Sound poetry {{evolved into}} visual poetry and {{concrete}} poetry, two forms based in visual arts issues although the sound images are always very compelling in them. Later on, {{with the development}} of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> sound poetry evolved thanks to the upcoming of the concrete music movement {{at the end of the}} 1940s. Some sound poetics were used by later poetry movements like the beat generation in the fifties or the spoken word movement in the 80's, and by other art and music movements that brought up new forms such as text sound art that may be used for sound poems which more closely resemble [...] "fiction or even essays, as traditionally defined, than poetry".|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> were {{adopted by the}} {{networks}} to prerecord shows or repeat them for airing in different time zones, but 16-inch vinyl pressings continued to be used into the early 1960s for non-network distribution of prerecorded programming. Use of the LP's microgroove standard {{began in the late}} 1950s, and in the 1960s the discs were reduced to 12 inches, becoming physically indistinguishable from ordinary LPs.|$|R
50|$|Another, {{and more}} {{portable}} recording device of the era, was the wire recorder which used steel piano wire on {{a stainless steel}} spool. The wire recorder was the very first reliable audio recorder to {{find its way into}} the American home in significant numbers. The popular “Webster 80-1” model sold for $150 in 1947. That would equate to $1,250 in year 2005 money. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> did not become available until the mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{command and}} data {{handling}} subsystem {{was composed of}} two redundant command and telemetry processors and solid state recorders, a power switching unit, and an interface to two redundant 1553 standard data buses for communications with other subsystems.NEAR is the first APL spacecraft to use significant numbers of plastic encapsulated microcircuits (PEMs).NEAR is the first APL spacecraft to use solid-state data recorders for mass storage—previous APL spacecraft used <b>magnetic</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> or <b>magnetic</b> cores.|$|R
