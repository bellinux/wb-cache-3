5|$|Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual {{platforms}} like Second Life {{have indicated}} that their productions can be <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre {{has resulted in the}} involvement of film director Peter Greenaway who served as a juror for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.|$|E

25|$|Her {{first film}} {{appearance}} of note was in Battleground (1949). She <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> an impression in Tarzan and the Slave Girl (1950) opposite Lex Barker, then co-starred with Robert Taylor in Westward the Women (1952) and Glenn Ford in Young Man with Ideas (1952). In 1953, she {{was seen in}} the swimming musical Dangerous When Wet, which starred Esther Williams (1953). Her most important film was Vera Cruz (1954) where she played the female lead opposite Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster. Her last film (1961) was Seven Women from Hell.|$|E

25|$|Pook's {{design was}} {{constrained}} by the requirement that the vessel be armored. It {{would also have to}} operate on the shallow waters of the interior. Together, these meant that the hull had to be <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> broad, in order to support the weight of the armor. Faced with the limitations of the technology of the day, Pook decided that the hull should be built with three keels, the outboard pair somewhat longer than the one on the centerline. Propulsion would be provided by a single paddlewheel, immediately aft of the center keel; perhaps unintentionally, this meant that it would be somewhat protected from enemy projectiles by the armor carried along the sides.|$|E
25|$|Straight {{from his}} University years, Max {{was chosen to}} travel on the Corinthians tour of Brazil {{in the summer of}} 1913. Managing the tour's first goal, against Rio de Janeiro, he also scored against Paulistano and <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> a name for himself. In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was {{cancelled}} when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that there was more to life than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC.|$|E
25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E

25|$|Sri Lanka {{continually}} improved, {{at least}} in Test cricket, but Dias' career went the other way. He made few big scores in Tests, but he <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> a few fifties in losing causes in ODIs. Then, in September 1985, India came to tour – a tour which was Sri Lanka's biggest success to date. In the first Test, Dias made 4 and 0, yet Sri Lanka dominated thanks to centuries from Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga – India, however, survived out the five days and the match ended in a draw. However, in the second Test, Dias came in with the score 109 for 2 and made a stroke-filled 95 to lift Sri Lanka to 385. Then, India were bowled out for 244, and trailing by 141, but Dias scored a quick unbeaten 60 as Sri Lanka declared on 206 for 3, setting India 348 in a day. Despite 78 from Kapil Dev, India were bowled out by 198, and Sri Lanka recorded their first Test victory. Dias then recorded his third and last Test century in the third Test, as Dias survived for five hours with Duleep Mendis to save a draw and a series victory.|$|E
500|$|Given its obvious {{strategic}} importance, Belgium, {{though in}} principle neutral, had already <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> detailed arrangements for coordination with Entente troops. This {{made it difficult}} for the Dutch to have these plans changed again to suit their wishes. The Dutch desired the Belgians to connect their defences to the Peel-Raam Position, that Reijnders refused to abandon without a fight. He did not approve of a plan by Van Voorst tot Voorst to occupy a so-called [...] "Orange Position" [...] on the much shorter line 's-Hertogenbosch – Tilburg, to form a continuous front with the Belgian lines near Turnhout as proposed by Belgian General Raoul van Overstraeten.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} day of the competition, March 7, 1952, Katsura drew Irving Crane for her first match. They <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> a {{contrast}} as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney, while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the San Francisco Examiner as [...] "so small and doll-like she looks like a figurine in her flowing, gold-satin gown." [...] Crane's main discipline was straight pool, at which he won numerous championships, including six world titles. The match was close, but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 [...] On March 10, Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings. Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead. On March 11, she lost to Chamaco, 50 to 35, but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50–43 in 63 innings, with runs of six, five and four. [...] "Spectators exclaimed 'brilliant' and 'sensational' at some of her shots." ...|$|E

500|$|Keable's {{developing}} {{attitudes and}} relationship with [...] "Betty" [...] disgusted his wife, Sybil, {{but as a}} devout Catholic she refused to divorce. This left Keable unable to marry Buck, and contributed to a growing sense on his part of alienation from English society. At last, in 1922, he managed legally to separate from his wife. He took up the suggestion of former college friend Arthur Grimble, by then a colonial administrator in the Ellice Islands, that he visit the South Pacific, a fashionable destination for 1920s Europeans. To Keable the South Seas appeared to offer escape from the hypocrisies of British society, as well as furnishing a climate better suited to his never-hearty constitution. In 1922 Keable and Buck sailed aboard the Bendigo for the South Pacific via Australia, where Keable undertook a book tour, giving lectures in which he broadcast his new sexual ethics: that unmarried couples in love could have deeply moral relationships, while loveless spouses who stayed together for convention's sake were committing acts of deep immorality. His views scandalised the contemporary press, but Frank Weston noted in correspondence that Keable as a [...] "shipwrecked priest" [...] <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> a useful cautionary tale for novices.|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus is [...] "" [...] (May our mouth {{be full of}} laughter). It {{calls for}} all {{instruments}} to perform. The text [...] "concludes with acknowledgement that the Lord has achieved great things for his people". Bach based the music on the overture to his fourth Orchestral Suite in D major, adding festive trumpets and timpani as well as flutes to the original music and embedding the voices. He followed {{the format of the}} French overture by instrumental slow sections framing the fast choral section. The French overture, normally played upon the arrival of the king to a performance, seemed suitable to greet the King of Heaven. The laughter mentioned in the text is [...] "often <b>made</b> <b>quite</b> graphically audible", as the Bach Scholar Alfred Dürr words it. When Bach performed the work again later, he marked some vocal sections as [...] "ripieno", achieving even more variety in the [...] "concerto". John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, interprets it as Bach's vote against a strict one voice per part concept. He chose this cantata in one of three Christmas concerts to conclude the endeavour of a full year, and notes the first movement's [...] "marvellous rendition of laughter-in-music" [...] and [...] "innate elegance and lightness of touch".|$|E
