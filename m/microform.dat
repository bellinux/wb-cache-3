40|$|Micro-scaled plastic deformation, viz., <b>microforming,</b> {{has been}} widely used to {{fabricate}} microparts {{with at least two}} dimensions in submillimeter. In <b>microforming,</b> ductile fracture significantly affects product quality and the forming limit of materials. It happens when the deformation method, mode and sequence are not reasonable. Although extensive research on ductile fracture and ductile fracture criteria in macroforming domain has been conducted, the applicability of these criteria in <b>microforming</b> scenario has not yet been extensively explored and studied. It is thus necessary to explore and address this issue to support the design of <b>microforming</b> process and quality control of the <b>microformed</b> parts. In this paper, the applicability of the uncoupled ductile fracture criteria's in <b>microforming</b> is investigated and discussed. The hybrid constitutive model developed in prior research is used to study the applicability of ductile fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> via finite element simulation and physical experiments. The simulation results of each criterion are compared with the upsetting experiment to determine the most suitable criterion for further experimental implementation in flanged upsetting and extrusion processes. The influence of size-effects on the applicability of the uncoupled ductile fracture criteria is explored and the stress-induced fracture map is used to demonstrate this effect. The applicability of ductile fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> is extensively revealed and analyzed and the research thus provides an in-depth understanding of the applicability of ductile fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> processes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make clear the {{characteristics}} of <b>microforms</b> developed on the first-order vally side slope. The study area, covered with natural forest, is located in the northern part of Osaka Prefecture, West Japan. The results obtained are summarized by the following. <b>Microforms</b> developed on the slope are devided into two types. One is a small love which has been formed by miniature earth flows. The other is micro cliff or step-like form which has been produced by minute landsides. These <b>microforms</b> appear at about 3 meter intervals along the slope profiles. Especially, the middle and lower parts of the slope are most favorable for an intensive development of the <b>microforms</b> in question. The segment at which the <b>microforms</b> develop most frequently is a transitional one from thick part to shallow in regolith thickness. This suggests that rising water table in the transition zone at the time of rainfall may trigger generation of numerous mass wastings to produce a number of the <b>microforms...</b>|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for {{the quality and quantity}} of miniaturized parts, fabrication of microparts directly using sheet metals is proven to be promising and efficient for mass production. In this process, however, there are many unknowns in terms of size effect and its affected fracture and deformation behavior. This study is thus aimed at investigating the micromechanical damage and deformation behavior in progressive <b>microforming</b> and establishing a systematic knowledge to support the <b>microformed</b> part design, process configuration and tooling design. In detail, a micro cylindrical part is fabricated via shearing process and a multi-level flanged part is produced via progressive micro extrusion and blanking. To explore the effect of material microstructure on the deformation behavior, ductile fracture and the product quality of <b>microformed</b> part, the original sheet metals are annealed under different temperatures. To realize the <b>microforming</b> process, a progressive <b>microforming</b> system is developed and its characteristics are investigated. The effect of grain size on dimensional accuracy, microstructure evolution and fracture behavior in <b>microforming</b> is also studied. The ductile fracture and its induced defects are identified and the damage accumulation is predicted. In the end, the validity and applicability of different fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> is discussed. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Children {{born with}} palatal <b>microforms</b> are often {{clinically}} mismanaged due to difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. These difficulties are exacerbated by anatomical and physiological differences in clinical presentation. Although {{a variety of}} physical and functional findings related to palatal <b>microforms</b> have been documented, {{there is no consensus}} on what features or combination of features lead to velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) in this population. This study was designed to evaluate and compare the velopharyngeal musculature and related structures in children with palatal <b>microforms</b> and VPD with age and sex-matched noncleft controls with normal velopharyngeal anatomy. Nineteen subjects, four with palatal <b>microforms</b> and VPD, and 15 noncleft controls with normal velopharyngeal anatomy and normal speech and resonance participated in this study. Subjects were scanned at rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols specially designed to assess the velopharyngeal musculature. Measures of the levator veli palatini muscle (levator), musculus uvulae, and related velopharyngeal and craniometric structures were obtained. After controlling for the effect of vocal tract size, children with palatal <b>microforms</b> demonstrated quantitative and qualitative differences in the velopharyngeal musculature compared to noncleft controls. These differences included levator diastasis, abnormal attachment to the hard palate, and irregular dispersal of the levator muscle in the velar midline. Absence of the musculus uvulae was observed in three of four subjects with palatal <b>microforms.</b> Children with palatal <b>microforms</b> demonstrated decreased acuity of the velar genu angle and decreased alpha angle compared to noncleft controls, and these differences were statistically significant. Findings from this study demonstrate that children with palatal <b>microforms</b> and VPD present with velopharyngeal anatomy that is quantitatively and qualitatively different compared to noncleft controls with normal speech and resonance. Results from the present study are the first to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative differences in the velopharyngeal musculature in children with palatal <b>microforms</b> and VPD using MRI. This study adds valuable information to the body of literature documenting velopharyngeal differences in children with palatal <b>microforms</b> and VPD, and may help improve clinical diagnostic and treatment approaches...|$|R
40|$|Small {{streambed}} structures (or <b>microforms,</b> 0. 01 - 1 m in length) exist ubiquitously in riverbed systems. Small-scale topography {{is potentially}} important in controlling hyporheic exchange flow and transport of conservative and reactive solutes at the groundwater-surface water interface. The role of <b>microforms</b> on NO 3 - transfer in a riffle-scale (macroforms of > 1 m length) hyporheic zone within a gaining river setting is investigated using a 2 -D flow and transport model {{which accounts for}} both nitrification and denitrification. Results show that the short pathlines caused by <b>microforms</b> lead to more NO 3 - discharge to the river compared with a macroform-only condition due to shortened residence times of both surface water and groundwater in mixing zones. Short hyporheic exchange flow pathways caused by <b>microforms</b> could remain oxic along their entire length or switch from nitrate producing to nitrate consuming as oxygen concentrations decline. <b>Microforms</b> affect net NO 3 - flux by the combined effect of introducing more stream mass flux and reducing their residence time in mixing zones under different hydrological and biogeochemical conditions. Our findings underscore that ignoring <b>microforms</b> in river beds may underestimate NO 3 - load {{to the river and}} have practical implications for porewater sampling strategies in groundwater-surface water studies...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{ubiquitous}} trend of product miniaturization, energy saving and weight reduction, micro/meso-scale parts {{have been widely}} used in many industrial clusters. Micromanufacturing processes for production of such micro/meso-scale parts are thus critically needed. <b>Microforming,</b> as one of these micro manufacturing processes, is a promising process and thus got many explorations and researches. Compared with the research on size effect affected deformation behaviours, less {{attention has been paid to}} the process development for mass production of micro-parts. The product quality and fabrication productivity of micro-parts depend on the involved process chain. To address the difficulty in handling and transporting of the micro-sized workpiece, development of a progressive <b>microforming</b> process for directly fabricating bulk micro-parts using sheet metals seems quite promising as it avoids or facilitates billet handling, transportation, positioning, and ejection in the process chain. In this paper, an intensive review on the latest development of progressive <b>microforming</b> technologies is presented. First of all, the paper summarizes the characteristic of progressive <b>microforming</b> directly using sheet metal. The size effect-affected deformation behaviour and the dimensional accuracy, deformation load, ductile fracture, and the surface finish of the <b>microformed</b> parts by progressive <b>microforming</b> using sheet metals are then presented.

Heat assisted <b>microforming</b> is an effective approach to reduce the influence of size effects. To improve the heating rate, resistance heating method is introduced to the <b>microforming</b> process. To investigate the size effect of heat on material deformation for thin foils in <b>microforming,</b> uniaxial tensile tests were performed for the foils with different grain sizes at different temperatures by tensile testing system incorporating with resistance heating method. The {{results show that the}} reduction of the stress at elevated temperatures compared to room temperature is higher for the foils with larger grain size than that for the foils with smaller grain size. The fracture strain decreases with increas-ing temperature when the temperature is below 300 C, and then increases as the temperature increases when the temperature is above 300 C. In addition, the work hardening behavior of the material is independent of the grain size. As temperature increases, the work hardening increases...|$|R
