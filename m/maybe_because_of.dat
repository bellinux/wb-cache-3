25|$|It is {{important}} to highlight the presence of Calabrians in Renaissance humanism and in the Renaissance. Indeed, the Hellenistics in this period frequently came from Calabria <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the Greek influence. The rediscovery of Ancient Greek was very difficult because this language had been almost forgotten. In this period the presence of Calabrian humanists or refugees from Constantinople was fundamental. The study of Ancient Greek, in this period, was mainly a work of two monks of the monastery of Seminara: Barlaam, bishop of Gerace, and his disciple, Leonzio Pilato. Leonzio Pilato, in particular, was a Calabrian born near Reggio Calabria. He was an important teacher of Ancient Greek and translator, and he helped Giovanni Boccaccio in the translations of Homer's works.|$|E
25|$|During Prima Vera's hiatus {{in early}} 1984, Falsk toured Norway with a solo {{stand-up}} comedy show. Prima Vera's shows {{had always had}} a certain element of toilet humor in their material, but for his solo act, Falsk got even dirtier. Falsk's solo act was described by some critics as vulgar and obscene, {{but in spite of}} this, or <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> it, the show was a big hit with the fans. The show was also recorded and released as an album, called Born in Drammen, which {{is believed to be the}} first ever stand-up comedy album released in Norway. The album title is a reference to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which topped the charts in Norway at the time, and the album cover is an almost exact copy of the Born in the USA cover, except that Falsk is not wearing jeans or even underpants on the picture. After the Prima Vera breakup, Falsk did another comedy tour in 1985, and released a second comedy album called Falskboy, which also contained a few songs by Tom Mathisen.|$|E

The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian Ictus Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by Ictus Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Loïc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player Géry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. Patton has said of the work, [...] "I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as I can to Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized... <b>Maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the language barrier, maybe because it’s not easily understood.

Boss Drum featured a spoken-word collaboration, [...] "Re:Evolution" [...] with Terence McKenna, and the Shamen's biggest and most controversial hit: [...] "Ebeneezer Goode". [...] "Ebeneezer Goode" [...] was accused of promoting drug use, owing to the refrain, 'Ezer Goode, Ezer Goode' as homophonic with 'E's are good' (E being slang for the drug ecstasy), 'These F in Es are good' as 'He's Ebenezer Goode', and to double entendre drug references throughout the song. This echoed similar references in previous songs such as [...] "Synergy"'s 'MDMA-zing... we are together in ecstasy'.

2500|$|Several foreign {{travelers}} through Moldavia {{since the}} 16th century noted that locals called themselves [...] "Romanians" [...] and their language [...] "Romanian". They also mention {{the awareness of}} a common Roman origin among the inhabitants of Moldavia and neighbouring Wallachia and Transylvania [...] [...] (1495–1554), a Transylvanian Saxon, was the emissary of Ferdinand I of Habsburg in Wallachia and Moldavia. Reicherstorffer had traveled in 1527 and 1535 in the Principality of Moldavia and wrote his travel memoirs – Moldaviae quae olim Daciae pars, Chorographia (1541) and also Chorographia Transylvaniae(1550). Describing the geography of Moldavia he finds that [...] "besides this name it is also called Wallachia" [...] and then speaking about the Moldavian people he says that [...] "the Roman [...] language still endures in this nation...so the Wallachians [...] are an Italian nation, as they claim, from the old Romans". A chronicler and mercenary from Verona, Alessandro Guagnini (1538–1614), traveled twice in Moldavia and helped Despot Vodă (Ioan Iacob Heraclid) gain the throne in 1563. In his biography of the prince, [...] "Vita despothi Principis Moldaviae", he described {{to the people of}} Moldavia:"This nation of Wallachians refer to themselves as Romana and say that they originate from exiled Romans of Italy. Their language is a mixture of Latin and Italian languages, so that an Italian can easily understand a Wallachian". After a visit to Moldavia an anonymous traveler, probably an Italian Jesuit, wrote in 1587 [...] a description of the people and found that [...] "these people [...] belong to the Greek faith, they take kindly to everything that is Roman, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their corrupted language from Latin, or for the belief they have about their descent from the Romans, as they call themselves Romans". Also, according to these sources, the Slav neighbours called Moldovans [...] "Vlachs" [...] or [...] "Volokhs", a term equally used to refer to all the Romance speakers from Wallachia, Transylvania, and the Balkan peninsula. Nicolaus Olahus (1493–1568), proeminent humanist, writes in Hungaria et Attila that the Moldavians have the same language, rituals and religion as the Wallachians and {{that the only way to}} distinguish them is by their clothes. He also mentions that the language of Moldavians and other Vlach peoples was once Roman (Latin), as they all were colonies of the Roman Empire.|$|E
