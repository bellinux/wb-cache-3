40|$|A direct sulfhydrylation pathway for {{methionine}} biosynthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum {{was found}}. The pathway was catalyzed by <b>metY</b> encoding O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase. The gene <b>metY,</b> located immediately upstream of metA, {{was found to}} encode a protein of 437 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 46, 751 Da. In accordance with DNA and protein sequence data, the introduction of <b>metY</b> into C. glutamicum resulted in the accumulation of a 47 -kDa protein in the cells and a 30 -fold increase in O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activity, showing the efficient expression of the cloned gene. Although disruption of the metB gene, which encodes cystathionine γ-synthase catalyzing the transsulfuration pathway of methionine biosynthesis, or the <b>metY</b> gene {{was not enough to}} lead to methionine auxotrophy, an additional mutation in the <b>metY</b> or the metB gene resulted in methionine auxotrophy. The growth pattern of the <b>metY</b> mutant strain was identical to that of the metB mutant strain, suggesting that both methionine biosynthetic pathways function equally well. In addition, an Escherichia coli metB mutant could be complemented by transformation of the strain with a DNA fragment carrying corynebacterial <b>metY</b> and metA genes. These data clearly show that C. glutamicum utilizes both transsulfuration and direct sulfhydrylation pathways for methionine biosynthesis. Although <b>metY</b> and metA are in close proximity to one another, separated by 143 bp on the chromosome, deletion analysis suggests that they are expressed independently. As with metA, methionine could also repress the expression of <b>metY.</b> The repression was also observed with metB, but the degree of repression was more severe with <b>metY,</b> which shows almost complete repression at 0. 5 mM methionine in minimal medium. The data suggest a physiologically distinctive role of the direct sulfhydrylation pathway in C. glutamicum...|$|R
40|$|A {{gene library}} of the Leptospira meyeri serovar semaranga strain Veldrat S. 173 DNA has been {{constructed}} in a mobilizable cosmid with inserts {{of up to}} 40 kb. It was demonstrated that a Leptospira DNA fragment carrying <b>metY</b> complemented Escherichia coli strains carrying mutations in metB. The latter gene encodes cystathionine γ-synthase, an enzyme which catalyzes the second step of the methionine biosynthetic pathway. The <b>metY</b> gene is 1, 304 bp long and encodes a 443 -amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 45 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Leptospira <b>metY</b> product has {{a high degree of}} similarity to those of O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases from Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A lower degree of sequence similarity was also found with bacterial cystathionine γ-synthase. The L. meyeri <b>metY</b> gene was overexpressed {{under the control of the}} T 7 promoter. <b>MetY</b> exhibits an O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activity. Genetic, enzymatic, and physiological studies reveal that the transsulfuration pathway via cystathionine does not exist in L. meyeri, in contrast to the situation found for fungi and some bacteria. Our results indicate, therefore, that the L. meyeri <b>MetY</b> enzyme is able to perform direct sulfhydrylation for methionine biosynthesis by using O-acetylhomoserine as a substrate...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>metY</b> locus which {{specifies}} tRNA(2 fMet) in Escherichia coli K- 12 specifies tRNA(1 fMet) in E. coli B. This conclusion is based on results of Southern blot analysis of E. coli B and K- 12 DNAs and on polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, and sequencing of an approximately 200 -bp region of DNA corresponding to the <b>metY</b> loci of E. coli B and E. coli K- 12. We also {{show that the}} <b>metY</b> locus of E. coli B is transcriptionally active. E. coli strains transformed with the multicopy plasmid vector pUC 19 carrying the <b>metY</b> locus of E. coli B overproduce tRNA(1 fMet) in E. coli B and E. coli K- 12 in contrast to strains transformed with pUC 19 carrying the corresponding locus from E. coli K- 12, which overproduce tRNA(2 fMet) ...|$|R
25|$|Although {{critics were}} slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable {{literary}} and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably Charlotte Brontë and Elizabeth Gaskell. Suddenly Ruskin had found his <b>métier,</b> and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin’s relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.|$|E

The police and the mayor investigate, but Doucet denies the charges. Two other students come forward to reveal more of Doucet's misconduct—one confessing to be his mistress. Doucet faces trial and hard labour if convicted. The film was released on 21 December 1967. Film critics praised Brel's performance.|$|E
25|$|French {{doctrine}} in the interwar years was defence-oriented. Colonel Charles de Gaulle was {{an advocate of}} concentration of armour and aeroplanes. His opinions were expressed in his book Vers l'Armée de <b>Métier</b> (Towards the Professional Army 1933). Like von Seeckt, he concluded that France could no longer maintain the huge armies of conscripts and reservists with which World War I had been fought, and he sought to use tanks, mechanised forces and aircraft to allow {{a smaller number of}} highly trained soldiers to have greater impact in battle. His views little endeared him to the French high command but are claimed by some to have influenced Heinz Guderian.|$|E

40|$|The cAMP-catabolite {{activator}} protein (CAP) complex is a pleiotropic regulator that regulates {{a vast number}} of Escherichia coli genes, including those involved in carbon metabolism. We identified two new targets of this complex: argG, which encodes the arginosuccinate synthase involved in the arginine biosynthetic pathway, and <b>metY,</b> which encodes one of the two methionine tRNA initiators, tRNAf 2 Met. The cAMP-CAP complex activates argG transcription and inhibits <b>metY</b> transcription from the same DNA position. We also show that ArgR, the specific repressor of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, together with its arginine cofactor, acts on the regulation of <b>metY</b> mediated by CAP. The regulation of the two divergent promoters is thus simultaneously controlled not only by the cAMP-CAP complex, a global regulator, but also by a specific regulator of arginine metabolism, suggesting a previously unsuspected link between carbon metabolism and translation initiation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: A Youth Compendium of Physical Activities (Youth Compendium) was {{developed}} to estimate the energy costs of physical activities using data on youth only. METHODS: Based on a literature search and pooled data of energy expenditure measurements in youth, the energy costs of 196 activities were compiled in 16 activity categories to form a Youth Compendium of Physical Activities. To estimate the intensity of each activity, measured oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]O 2) was divided by basal metabolic rate (Schofield age-, sex- and mass-specific equations) to produce a youth MET (<b>METy).</b> A mixed linear model {{was developed}} for each activity category to impute missing values for age ranges with no observations for a specific activity. RESULTS: This Youth Compendium consists of <b>METy</b> values for 196 specific activities classified into 16 major categories for four age groups, 6 - 9, 10 - 12, 13 - 15, and 16 - 18 years. <b>METy</b> values in this Youth Compendium were measured (51...|$|R
25|$|The {{skilled workers}} and {{craftsmen}} of Paris had been divided for centuries into métiers or professions. In 1776, there were 125 recognized métiers, ranging from barbers, apothecaries, bakers and cooks to sculptors, barrel-makers, lace-makers and musicians. Each <b>métier</b> or profession {{had its own}} corporation, rules, customs, and patron saint. The corporation set prices, controlled entry into the profession, and provided charitable services, including paying for the funeral, of members. In 1776, the government tried to reform the system, and consolidated the métiers into six corporations: the drapiers, or cloth-dealers; bonnetiers, who made and sold hats; épiciers, who sold food products; merciers, who sold clothing; pelletiers, or fur merchants, and orfèvres, who included silversmiths, goldsmiths, and jewelers.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 de Gaulle wrote Vers l'Armée de <b>Métier</b> (Toward a Professional Army). He {{proposed}} mechanization of the infantry, {{with stress}} on an élite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. Ironically the German panzer units, so effectively {{employed in the}} invasion of France in 1940, used similar theories, while the French dispersed and wasted their armour. The book imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. De Gaulle’s mentor Emile Mayer was somewhat more prophetic than he about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for France's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the Treaty of Versailles, which forbade Germany from rearming. He also {{thought it would be}} a precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that “a master has to make his appearance … whose orders cannot be challenged – a man upheld by public opinion”.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, a young filmmaker named Roger Corman {{received}} his first screen credits as writer and associate producer of Allied Artists' Highway Dragnet. Corman soon independently produced his first movie, Monster from the Ocean Floor, on a $12,000 budget and a six-day shooting schedule. Among the six films {{he worked on}} in 1955, Corman produced and directed the first official ARC release, Apache Woman, and Day the World Ended, half of Arkoff and Nicholson's first twin-bill package. Corman {{would go on to}} direct over fifty feature films through 1990. As of 2007, he remained active as a producer, with more than 350 movies to his credit. Often referred to as the [...] "King of the Bs", Corman has said that [...] "to my way of thinking, I never made a 'B' movie in my life", as the traditional B movie was dying out when he began making pictures. He prefers to describe his <b>metier</b> as [...] "low-budget exploitation films". In later years Corman, both with AIP and as head of his own companies, would help launch the careers of Francis Ford Coppola, Jonathan Demme, Robert Towne, and Robert De Niro, among many others.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} genes {{encoding}} proteins involved in transcription and translation are clustered between 68 and 69 {{minutes on the}} Escherichia coli genome map and are transcribed clockwise as two operons: the <b>metY</b> operon, containing <b>metY,</b> P 15 A, nusA, infB; and about a kilobase further downstream, the rpsO and pnp operon. The DNA sequence between infB and rpsO was determined and two open reading frames were detected which code for proteins of 15, 200 (P 15 B) and 35, 091 (P 35) daltons. Maxicell analysis showed a relatively strong expression of P 15 B whereas P 35 was synthesized more weakly. An overlap of the termination codon of P 15 B and the initiator codon for P 35 suggests that translation of P 15 B and P 35 may be coupled. S 1 nuclease mapping of in vivo transcripts between infB and rpsO provided no evidence for major promoters but detected a moderately efficient rho-independent terminator between infB and P 15 B. The results indicate that P 15 B and P 35 are expressed {{as part of the}} <b>metY</b> operon, but that some transcriptional read through into the rpsO operon also occurs, thereby, functionally linking the expression of these two complex systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of Streptococcus pyogenes uridine phosphorylase (UP) in the salvage pathway reveals that it uses different residues {{to stabilize the}} transition state. Sequence alignment of the enzyme uncovers a subclass of uridine phosphorylases that contain these active site residues. These data, together with the specificity loop of uridine phosphorylases, {{may be used to}} distinguish between UP and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzymes at the level of primary sequence, and thus may allow proper annotation. In Bos taurus, the active site of its purine nucleoside phosphorylase can accommodate the major by-product of DNA damage, pyrimidopurinone 2 '-deoxyribose, and cleave its glycosidic bond. The base-binding site of the enzyme helps explain why the reaction cannot proceed in the reverse direction. The {{structure of}} a protein complex, ThiS-ThiG, in the thiazole biosynthetic pathway was used to rationally design and synthesize a light-activated analog. Preliminary characterization of the analog demonstrates that it could be covalently linked to ThiS using intein chemistry. We anticipate that this analog will be of use for the structural and mechanistic characterization of thiazole synthase. The crystallization and diffraction screenings of selected enzymes in the methionine biosynthetic and sulfur assimilation pathways of Wolinella succinogenes were carried out. The crystallization conditions for the MetY/homocysteine complex have been optimized from 8 Angstrom to 4 Angstrom resolution by screening with different cryoreagents. Detergent screens for the apo-MetY generated small crystals, which were used for X-ray diffraction experiments. The <b>MetY</b> structure, which is the first o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase, has been determined. A search for structurally homologous proteins reveals that <b>MetY</b> has the same fold as cystathionine gamma lyase and methionine gamma lyase. The active sites of these enzymes, which contain PLP, share a high degree of structural similarity, suggesting that <b>MetY</b> belongs to the [gamma]-elimination subclass of Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent family of enzymes. The structure of <b>MetY,</b> together with biochemical data, provides useful insight to the mechanism of sulfur transfer to a small molecule via a protein thiocarboxylate...|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli strains {{harbouring}} elongator tRNAs that insert {{amino acids}} {{in response to}} a termination codon during elongation have been generated for various applications. Additionally, it was shown that expression of an initiator tRNA containinlog a CUA anticodon from a multicopy plasmid in E. coli resulted in initiation from an amber codon. Even though the initiation-based system remedies toxicity-related drawbacks, its usefulness has remained limited for want of a strain with a chromosomally encoded initiator tRNA 'suppressor'. E. coli K strains possess four initiator tRNA genes: the metZ, metW and metV genes, located at a single locus, encode tRNA_ 1 ^f^M^e^t, and a distantly located <b>metY</b> gene encodes a variant, tRNA_ 2 ^f^M^e^t. In this study, a stable strain of E. coli K- 12 that affords efficient initiation from an amber initiation codon was isolated. Genetic analysis revealed that the <b>metY</b> gene in this strain acquired mutations to encode tRNA_ 2 ^f^M^e^t with a CUA anticodon (a U 35 A 36 mutation). The acquisition of the mutations depended n the presence of a plasmid-borne copy of the mutant <b>metY</b> and recA+ host background. The mutations were observed when the plasmid-borne gene encoded tRNA_ 2 ^f^M^e^t (U 35 A 36) with additional changes in the acceptor stem (G 72; G 72 G 73) but not in the anticodon stem (U 29 C 30 A 31 /U 35 A 36 / ψ 39 G 40 A 41).
