50|$|An {{alternative}} to syringes in the 1970s {{was to use}} a glass <b>medicine</b> <b>dropper,</b> supposedly easier to manipulate with one hand. A large hairpin was {{used to make a}} hole in the skin and the dropper containing the drug (usually heroin) was inserted and the bulb squeezed, releasing it into the tissues. This method was also reported—by William S Burroughs and other sources—for intravenous administration at least as far back as 1930.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{described}} as a device that looks like a <b>medicine</b> <b>dropper</b> suspended above a beaker. Small drops of metallic mercury fall from the dropper into the beaker below. [...] "The growing drop adsorbs the faint odors of the room on its surface,...but when it falls into the beaker it gives up most of its surface area. Most of the odor is then released back into the air, but it stays in the beaker above the surface of the mercury, because odors are heavier than air." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1834, Mothes and Dublanc {{were granted}} a patent for {{a method to}} produce a single-piece gelatin capsule that was sealed with a drop of gelatin solution. They used {{individual}} iron moulds for their process, filling the capsules individually with a <b>medicine</b> <b>dropper.</b> Later on, methods were developed that used sets of plates with pockets to form the capsules. Although some companies still use this method, the equipment is not produced commercially any more. All modern soft-gel encapsulation uses variations of a process developed by R. P. Scherer in 1933. His innovation was to use a rotary die to produce the capsules, with the filling taking place by blow molding. This method reduced wastage, {{and was the first}} process to yield capsules with highly repeatable dosage.|$|E
50|$|In <b>medicine,</b> <b>droppers</b> and IV {{infusion}} sets have {{a standardized}} diameter, {{in such a}} way that 1 millilitre is equivalent to 20 drops. And, for the cases when smaller amounts are necessary (such as paediatrics), microdroppers or paediatric infusion sets are used, in which 1 millilitre = 60 microdrops.|$|R
50|$|The {{two largest}} {{operations}} that now comprise Kimble Chase, Kimble Kontes and Chase Scientific, both started as family {{businesses in the}} late 19th century and early 20th century. In the late 19th century, Kimble Glass started making vials, funnels, <b>medicine</b> <b>droppers</b> and culture tubes in a Chicago loft. Founded in 1942, Kontes Glass made high precision, specialty glassware {{on the top floor}} of the family-owned Royal Candy Shop. The crown symbol from the candy shop sign is still part of the Kontes logo. Kontes Glass became a sister company to Kimble glass around 1982. Some time in the early years of 2000, Gerresheimer Glass purchased the two companies and shortly there after Kontes became known as Kimble-Kontes. Chase Scientific Glass, founded in 1934, is a major supplier of disposable laboratory glassware for North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific. Today, Kimble Chase has 1,500 employees, six manufacturing facilities—located in the United States, Mexico, Germany, and China—and over 10,000 total square feet of production and warehouse space.|$|R
50|$|Paris and Neelix {{discuss their}} {{argument}} over Kes. Paris confesses {{that he is}} attracted to her, but that he respects her choice to be with Neelix. The two care for the creature, but before long {{it appears to be}} dying. It will not eat their rations, but they surmise that the vapor outside must be the source of the protein they saw in their scans, but the stone they blasted in front of the entrance has prevented the hatchling from feeding. Once they bring the creature outside and force-feed the vapors to it by a <b>medicine</b> <b>dropper,</b> the creature recovers. Paris and Neelix are overjoyed, though they exhibit symptoms from the trigemic poisons. Voyager disables the weapons aboard the enemy ship, and moves into the planet's atmosphere to rescue Neelix and Tom. They refuse to be transported off until they are sure that the creature will survive. They hide, and beam away only when an adult of the creature's species collects the infant.|$|E

She has been caring for six rabbits the past six weeks feeding them with a <b>medicine</b> <b>dropper.</b> The babies' mother was killed by a dog when they were only three days old and Sharon took over the {{parenting}} chore for neighbors who are friends of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John B. Webster of Warr Acres. ...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal {{absorption}} using vibration-obtained individual {{small bowel}} epithelial {{cells of the}} rat: folate absorption 1 ’ 2 ’ 3 ’ 4 Shahab Momtazi, M. S., and Victor Herbert, M. D. A simple and rapid method of obtaining a suspension of intact, viable individual in-testinal epithelial cells (based on application of controlled mechanical stress (vibration) to the intestinal mucosa) has been reported (1 - 3), but the cells so obtained were used for studies of cell content rather than for meta-bolic studies. The present study was under-taken to determine if such cell preparations {{could be used to}} study 3 H pteroylglutamic acid (3 HPGA) absorption. If this proved pos-sible, the system would be susceptible to easy study of various factors affecting folate ab-sorption across the intestinal wall, as com-pared with other methods (4 - 13). However, the system loses the polarity of the intesti-nal epithelium (i. e., there may be absorption or desorption across other surfaces than that covered by brush border). Preliminary stud-ies using guinea pig small intestine and a less refined system (intestinal cell suspensions prepared by running the mucosa back and forth through a capillary-tipped <b>medicine</b> <b>dropper)</b> were presented in abstract form (14). Materials and methods Charles River strain male rats, weighing from 100 to 350 g, were used after fasting for 24 hr (with access to water). Each animal was killed by instant severing of the cervical spinal cord. The entire length of the small bowel was resected and meas-tired. The upper and/or lower half of the small bowel was separated and rinsed with 0. 9 % saline solution (at room temperature), then placed in 0. 9 % saline at 4 C. After 5 mm of soaking, the gut was everted over a homemade glass spiral having a diameter of 4. 4 cm and a thickness of 4 mm. The glass spiral was then attached to a Vibro-mixe...|$|E
