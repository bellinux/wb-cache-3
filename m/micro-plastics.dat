40|$|One of {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} and long-lasting recent changes {{to the surface of}} our planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950 s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines. Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to <b>micro-plastics</b> that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported.

The levels of organochlorine compounds (PCBs, DDTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) plastic additives, and related biomarkers responses (CYP 1 A) were investigated for the first time in the whale shark. Twelve whale shark skin biopsy samples were collected in January 2014 in La Paz Bay (BCS, Mexico) and a preliminary investigation on microplastic concentration and polymer composition was also carried out in seawater samples from the same area.

The carbon concentration is increased, too, while the concentration of oxygen (dominant impurity in silicon) is changed in various ways. Non-homogeneous distribution of impurities results in non-uniformity of heights for nano-objects that are formed from them, which leads to non-uniformity in micro-relief and causes a respective increase of the roughness parameter.

This study also focuses on Taguchi design method for investigating the effect of injection parameters on the dimensional accuracy of Fresnel lens during plastic injection molding. It was found that the dominant factor affecting the microgroove depth of Fresnel lens is packing pressure. The optimum processing parameters are packing pressure of 80 MPa, melt temperature of 240 °C, mold temperature of 90 °C and injection speed of 50 m/s. The dimensional accuracy of Fresnel lens can be controlled within ± 3 µm using the optimum level of process parameters through the confirmation test. The research results of this study have industrial application values because electro-optical industries are able to significantly reduce a new optical element development cycle time.

The numerical simulations {{were performed on}} large samples (similar to 100 (3) angstrom(3) box size with similar to 70 000 atoms), {{and the results were}} compared to experimental measurements. It was shown that the cutoff in the non-Coulombic part of the empirical interactions affects the pressure/density relations. Therefore, this value was tuned to achieve the experimental density at ambient pressure. As a result we obtained realistic mechanical and structural properties as well. With this model, we analyzed the elastic response of the samples for different sodium content. We showed, that experimentally measured elastic moduli result from a succession of <b>micro-plastic</b> rearrangements that {{must be taken into account}} when calculating microscopic elastic moduli. Moreover, we investigated the size dependence of the elastic moduli, and we showed a strong connection between small scale heterogeneous elasticity and sodium repartition. The transition from small scale to large scale description of elasticity should involve an accurate description of the spatial organization of sodium ions inside the silica network...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the <b>micro-plastic</b> {{behavior}} of rough surface contact is the critical link towards a fundamental understanding of contact, friction, adhesion, and surface failures at small length scales. In the companion paper (Yu et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 55, 489 - 516, 2007), we have studied the onset of surface yielding due to single-dislocation nucleation from a stepped surface under adhesive contact. Here we analyze the contact hardening behavior due to multiple dislocations in a two-dimensional dislocation model. Continuum micromechanical analyses are used to derive the configurational force on the dislocation, while a modified Rice-Thomson model is {{used to describe the}} dislocation nucleation. Dislocations nucleated from a surface source are stabilized and pile up {{as a result of the}} balance between the resolved driving force and the non-zero lattice resistance in the solid. The dislocation pileup will exert a strong back stress to prevent further dislocation nucleation and thus lead to the contact hardening behavior, the degree of which depends on the slip-plane orientation. Particularly, we find that the dislocation interactions between two slip planes can make the contact loading order-of-magnitude easy to nucleate multiple dislocations, which is thus named “latent softening”.
