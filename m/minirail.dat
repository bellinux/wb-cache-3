500|$|Starting at 2:00p.m., Expo Commissioner General Pierre Dupuy officiated {{over the}} medal ceremony, in which {{participating}} nations and organizations received {{gold and silver}} medallions, and over the ceremony in which national flags were lowered in the reverse order to {{which they had been}} raised, with Canada's flag lowered first and Nigeria's lowered last. After Prime Minister Pearson doused the Expo flame, Governor General Michener closed Expo at Place des Nations with the mournful spontaneous farewell: [...] "It is with great regret that I declare that the Universal and International Exhibition of 1967 has come to an official end." [...] All rides and the <b>minirail</b> were shut down by 3:50p.m., and the Expo grounds closed at 4:00p.m., with the last Expo Express train leaving for Place d'Accueil at that time. [...] A fireworks display, that went on for an hour, was Expo's concluding event.|$|E

50|$|The Yellow <b>Minirails</b> {{received}} their nicknames from the colour of the cars’ canopies. Twelve 16-car trains operated on each line. Each train seated 60 in its 105 ft length.Also designed by Habegger, these cars {{were built in}} 1964 for the Swiss National Exhibition held that year in Lausanne. Originally controlled by an on-board operator, they were converted to automatic operation for Expo 67. Additional cars were purchased from the manufacturer, Von Roll Seilbahnen AG.to replace the rolling stock and rail from Lausanne that were sold to Blackpool's Pleasure Beach.The Yellow <b>Minirails</b> ran {{on a pair of}} outward-facing 3+1/2 in &times; 12 in “C” channels, 4+9/16 in apart and supported on A-frames.|$|R

50|$|Now {{managed by}} the Six Flags Corporation, the La Ronde {{facility}} has replaced the <b>minirail</b> canopies with ones of an aqua-green color.|$|E
50|$|The Saint Helen's Island Yellow <b>Minirail</b> {{ran around}} a 1.1 mi loop {{on the south}} end of the island that {{connected}} Metro station on the Blue <b>Minirail</b> to the Expo Express’ Sainte Helen's station. After leaving the latter station the route swung over a corner of Swan Lake. Both this and the La Ronde loop were built by Mojan Ltée. It ceased operation when the Saint Helen's Island section of Man and His World closed in late 1981, and then later demolished in the mid 1980's.|$|E
5000|$|The larger <b>Minirail</b> {{was laid}} out to pass as many major points as possible. Stations were named for nearby major attractions. The 4.2 mi circuit had six stops at four stations, Agriculture and Theme being served twice. Although on an {{elevated}} structure up to 40 ft above the ground {{for most of its}} length, the line also swung out over the water near the Quebec pavilion, dropping to within 6 ft of the St. Lawrence. It also ran through the Ontario pavilion and the geodesic dome of the U.S. Pavilion. A small section of the Blue line ran on Saint Helen's Island, primarily to connect to the Metro and (south) Yellow <b>Minirail</b> line. The track structure was designed by the Swiss firm of Maschinenfabrik Habegger and fabricated on-site by Dominion Bridge Company. The running rails were twin 21 in &times; 8+1/4 in “I” beams 21+3/4 in apart, supported on A-frame pylons on 50 ft centres, reduced to 34 ft on curves. The Blue <b>Minirail</b> continued to operate on Notre Dame Island until late 1973, despite the closure and abandonment of the park below two years earlier. During these final two years there were no stops as all stations on Notre Dame Island were closed, therefore passengers boarded and exited at the [...] "Metro" [...] <b>Minirail</b> station on Saint Helen's Island. The circuit was dismantled by the mid 1970s, primarily due to construction of the Olympic rowing basin.|$|E
50|$|Architects from Golden Metak Productions {{designed}} the interior exhibition space. Visitors {{had access to}} four themed platforms divided into seven levels. The building included a 37-metre-long escalator, the longest ever built at the time. The <b>Minirail</b> monorail ran through the pavilion.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Minirail</b> was an {{automated}} monorail system on Saint Helen's and Notre Dame Islands in Montreal, Canada. The network {{was built for}} the 1967 World's Fair (Expo 67), and continued to operate for Man and his World. The system consisted of three independent circuits operated by {{two different types of}} trains: the larger [...] "Blue" [...] (which ceased operating in 1973) that ran mostly on Notre Dame Island, and the smaller [...] "Yellow" [...] (ended in 1981) which ran on the north and south ends Saint Helen's Island. Only the La Ronde route loop (also “Yellow”), segregated {{from the rest of the}} system on the north end, still remains and continues to operate at the amusement park to this day—the only surviving part of the <b>Minirail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{main part}} of the system was the “Blue” <b>Minirail</b> on Notre Dame Island and a small section of Saint Helen's Island. There were also two smaller loops: the “Yellow” Minirails on {{opposite}} ends of Saint Helen's Island. The minimum system radius was 50 ft, and maximum grade 10%.|$|E
50|$|The La Ronde Yellow <b>Minirail</b> {{is also on}} Saint Helen's Island, but was {{completely}} separate {{from the rest of}} the system. It circles the amusement park, and its 1.3 mi route also passes the Marina and runs in between Dolphin Lake and the Saint Lawrence River. It continues to operate to present day, albeit on a slightly modified route.|$|E
50|$|The {{rolling stock}} {{consists}} of four works trucks and twelve passenger coaches, one from the Exmoor railway, three Ex-longleat coming from various sites, and three car enclosed articulated set, rebuilt on site from the remains of three <b>minirail</b> coaches and five semi enclosed ex Bush Mill Railway coaches from Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway. On site is {{the remains of the}} last Ex-longleat railway coaches, being donated from the Lappa Valley railway.|$|E
50|$|La Pitoune {{opened the}} same year as La Ronde, in 1967, and {{operated}} for 50 seasons. In May 2017, on what would have been its 50th year anniversary, Six Flags announced the ride had reached the end of its useful life and will not reopen. During its final season in 2016, {{it was one of the}} original rides of La Ronde still operating. Only 6 original rides remain as of 2017: Le Galopant, Tchou Tchou, Joyeux moussaillons, La Marche du Mille Pattes (previously petite montagne russe), the <b>Minirail</b> and La Spirale.|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the <b>Minirail</b> monorail which ran within the perimeters of the Expo Site, the Expo Express used standard railway technology, with two running rails and a third electrified rail identical to those of the Toronto subway. In fact, the trains used were a modified version of the Hawker Siddeley H-series used by the Toronto Transit Commission with one fewer door on each side, and streamlined ends. Consequently, unlike Montreal's Metro with rubber tires, the Expo Express used traditional steel-wheeled trains. The Expo Express also featured fully air conditioned passengers cars, whereas Montreal's Metro does not.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} applied to three different systems, developed roughly {{at the same}} time. One was Skybus, an automated mass transit system prototyped by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation beginning in 1964. The second, alternately called the People Mover and <b>Minirail,</b> opened in Montreal at Expo 67. Finally the last, called PeopleMover or WEDway PeopleMover, was an attraction that was originally presented by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and that opened at Disneyland in 1967. [...] Now, however, the term [...] "people mover" [...] is generic, and may use technologies such as monorail, duorail, automated guideway transit or maglev. Propulsion may involve conventional on-board electric motors, linear motors or cable traction.|$|E
5000|$|United States of America Pavilion - {{designed}} by Buckminster Fuller, the pavilion {{was one of}} the most popular, with over 5 million visits. The building was distinguished by its large 20-story geodesic dome with an acrylic skin (which would catch fire and melt away in 1976). The Expo 67 <b>minirail</b> train passed through the building. Designed by Cambridge Seven Associates, the six levels of exhibits, connected by escalators, were based on the theme of: [...] "Creative America - the positive use of creative energy". The exhibits included everything from American Folk Art and Elvis Presley's guitar to NASA’s Apollo Command Module and Lunar Excursion Module. But not everyone liked the pavilion, including US President Lyndon B. Johnson, who (after a brief visit) was alleged to have said [...] "the homosexuals have had carte blanche!" [...] in reference to the design and content of the displays.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1965 and {{expanded}} in 1976, this [...] gauge ridable miniature railway {{is among the}} busiest in the country. It has a length of [...] through scenic woodland and {{along the edge of}} Half Mile Lake. The line has taken several different courses across the years, but the route along the lake has remained consistent. After opening the railway was originally run by outside company <b>Minirail</b> on a ten-year contract, which was not renewed due to disagreements between the two companies. Following this, Longleat took over running the railway in 1976. Many engines have run on the railway over the years, both steam and diesel; currently the railway owns two diesel locomotives with one running the passenger services and another in reserve. The railway also has 15 carriages, all built at Longleat between 1976 and 2013 and wearing mock British Railways crimson and cream livery, along with several permanent way wagons. Between 2011 and 2017 the railway was known as the Jungle Express, with the station and carriages given additional theming.|$|E
5000|$|Expo 67 {{closed on}} Sunday afternoon, October 29, 1967. The fair had been {{scheduled}} to close two days earlier, however a two-day extension granted by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) allowed it to continue over the weekend. On the final day 221,554 visitors added to the more than 50 million (50,306,648) that attended Expo 67 at a time when Canada's population was only 20 million, setting a per-capita record for World Exhibition attendance that still stands.Starting at 2:00 p.m., Expo Commissioner General Pierre Dupuy officiated over the medal ceremony, in which participating nations and organizations received gold and silver medallions, and over the ceremony in which national flags were lowered in the reverse order to which they had been raised, with Canada's flag lowered first and Nigeria's lowered last.

40|$|A new-generation common feeding (CF) fuel {{injection}} system without rail has been compared with the standard common rail (CR) apparatus for diesel engine passenger cars. The high-pressure pump in the CF apparatus is connected directly to the injectors, and a volume of about 2. 5 cm 3 is integrated at the pump delivery. Experimental tests on solenoid injectors {{have been carried out}} for the CF and CR apparatus at a hydraulic test rig. The dependence of the injected volumes and total injector leakages on the energizing time (ET) of the two systems has been investigated for different rail pressure levels. Furthermore, the measured injected flow-rates of the CF and CR systems have been compared for single and pilot-main injection events. In general, the injection performance of the two systems is very similar, even though the differences occur in the high-pressure transients. The dynamics of the pressure waves changes because the high-pressure hydraulic layouts of the two systems are different, and the propagation and reflection of the rarefaction waves, triggered by the injection events, occur in different ways. A previously developed one-dimensional (1 D) code for the CF high-pressure layout has been further validated by means of a comparison with the experimental data. The effects of either a calibrated orifice installed at the pump delivery or an injector-integrated <b>Minirail</b> on the CF performance have been investigated by means of the model. Numerical parametrical tests have also been conducted on the pump-to-injector pipe length. The additional orifices that can be installed in the high-pressure circuit of the CF are effective, provided their diameter is smaller than the diameter of any other orifice inserted in the injector. Furthermore, the presence of a <b>Minirail</b> within the injector has an impact on the injected flow-rates of small injections, such as pilot, pre, after, and post, and also induces a reduction in the energy stored in the pressure waves. Another relevant active damping strategy of the pressure waves for the CF involves shortening the pump-to-injector pipe as much as possible. Finally, the fluid dynamical transients within the solenoid injector have been discussed for the CF and CR systems. The numerical time distributions of the main variables within the injector are shown to be independent of the presence of the rail in the layou...|$|E
