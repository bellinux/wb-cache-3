500|$|In Virginia, wind {{gusts of}} over [...] were {{observed}} at the Weather Bureau office in Norfolk. Roofs were blown off, trees and power lines were toppled, windows were shattered, and awnings were torn. The naval station suffered mainly minor damage to its temporary installations. The tugboat Indian, carrying five barges, sank in the James River; {{four of the}} eight crew members drowned. One building was demolished and several others were damaged in Portsmouth. The ferry Princess Anne was beached into the docks at Kiptopeke. An unfinished vessel at the Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News broke from its moorings and was swept into {{the shore of the}} James River. The roof of the Custom house was detached and landed on the street. In Richmond, 200store fronts were damaged, while part of the steeple at Trinity Methodist Church was toppled. Additionally, a [...] <b>microwave</b> <b>tower</b> in Warsaw was knocked over. Approximately 50% of residents in Virginia lost telephone and electrical service for six days. The storm damaged approximately 18,000homes and businesses. Overall, there were 12deaths and about $15million in damage.|$|E

50|$|Near-field {{effects of}} an AM antenna may extend out two miles (3 km) or more. Cellular and <b>microwave</b> <b>towers</b> within this radius can reflect the AM signal out at a {{different}} frequency. This process results in interfering frequencies called reradiation.|$|R
500|$|After {{crossing}} the Malay Peninsula, Typhoon Gay {{moved through the}} Andaman Islands on November6. As a precautionary measure, all air and sea traffic were suspended to the region. Winds in excess of 120km/h (75mph) battered North Andaman Island, causing two structures to collapse. A few days before Typhoon Gay made landfall, officials in Andhra Pradesh began evacuating roughly 50,000 residents along the coast and stockpiled relief goods. Some people were forced to leave vulnerable locations in the Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts. Local meteorologists warned that the storm was comparable to a cyclone in 1977 that killed more than 10,000 people. Striking the southern coast of Andhra Pradesh, Typhoon Gay produced wind gusts estimated at 320km/h (200mph). Along the coast, a storm surge of [...] inundated areas up to [...] inland, washing away numerous structures. About [...] outside of Kavali, a [...] tall, steel lattice <b>microwave</b> <b>tower</b> collapsed after experiencing winds estimated at 142km/h (88mph). Transportation and communication across the region was disrupted and 20,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 100,000 people homeless. Nearly every structure in Annagaripalem were severely damaged or destroyed. Offshore, 25 fishermen drowned near Machilipatnam after ignoring warnings to return to port. Throughout Andhra Pradesh, 69 fatalities and [...] (...) worth of damage was attributed to Typhoon Gay. In the months after the storm, concrete shelters were built to house displaced persons.|$|E
