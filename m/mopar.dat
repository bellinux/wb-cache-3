5|$|A {{technology}} demo for Forza Motorsport 4 {{was first}} revealed at Microsoft's E3 2010 press conference. The live demonstration showcased a passing challenge while driving the 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia. Using the Microsoft Kinect sensor the player steered {{the car to}} pass opponents. Forza Motorsport 4 was formally unveiled at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards. Turn 10 announced that the game would feature over 500 cars from 80 manufacturers, and confirmed that it will support Kinect as well as standard Xbox 360 controllers and racing wheels. Turn 10 officially partnered with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) for two years from August 8, 2011. The partnership provides several in-game ALMS themed events to complement the cars and tracks raced in the ALMS present in previous entries in the Forza Motorsport series. Unlike past games in the series, vehicles from the SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge were not present initially in Forza Motorsport 4 aside from a <b>Mopar</b> sponsored Dodge Viper. The Porsche download content pack added one World Challenge Porsche GT3. More known content was leaked during IGN's visit to E3 2011, which revealed {{that there will be}} the option to create car clubs and share garages within that club, and that the game will support 16 player online racing. Hockenheimring, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Infineon Raceway were added as three more real world tracks to the Forza series.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Mopar</b> {{performance}} parts {{found in the}} SEMA concept car were sold as 2013 SRT Viper components.|$|E
25|$|Richard is a <b>MOPAR</b> {{automobile}} enthusiast, {{and original}} {{owner of a}} 1970 Plymouth Barracuda with the unusual 440-6 engine and automatic transmission package.|$|E
50|$|Stage 2 {{includes}} <b>Mopar's</b> cold-air {{intake and}} free-flowing cat-back exhaust, performance brakes with cross-drilled rotors.|$|R
50|$|The 409 (cubic inches) {{engine was}} one of the giants of early 60’s Super Stock and FX racing, along with other factory ‘big block’ competitors, the 421 Pontiacs, the 426 Max Wedge and then the 426 Hemi <b>MoPars</b> (Dodge and Plymouth) and the 427 FE and later the ‘Cammer’ Fords.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, Ford {{introduced}} the Ford Torino Talladega to Grand National competition. The car featured a slick, aerodynamic fastback design. A year later, the Plymouth Superbird was <b>Mopar's</b> {{answer to the}} Torino. The Superbird featured a protruding nosecone, a massive rear wing, and was introduced also to lure Richard Petty back to Plymouth.|$|R
25|$|Dual-way power sunroofs were {{available}} on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by <b>Mopar</b> itself. An installed sunroof eliminated {{most of the}} front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.|$|E
25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted {{oil filter}} check valve was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their oil filters. The pre-1987 engines had an oil filter adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM oil filter common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded <b>Mopar</b> and Ford V8 oil filter; the oil filter adapter was redesigned where the oil filter is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 oil filter {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E
25|$|The PT Cruiser GT (also {{known as}} the GT Cruiser) is a high output {{turbocharged}} hot hatch variant of the PT Cruiser introduced as a 2003 model. Much like the Dodge Neon SRT-4 sedan, the PT Cruiser GT uses the same 2.4L turbocharged I4 engine. The engine is upgraded over the standard PT with improved cooling, oiling, an aluminum cylinder block with steel sleeves, and forged internals. The PT Cruiser GT is much {{more powerful than the}} standard model and has the potential to make significantly more power with available and relatively simple performance upgrades. Upgrades such as <b>MOPAR</b> Stage 1 and supporting turbo components are common. Most performance parts from the Dodge Neon SRT-4 are compatible with the PT Cruiser GT.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the first}} {{generation}} and second generation Cordobas made appearances in NASCAR. Ed Negre campaigned one occasionally in 1979-80 seasons, and Buddy Arrington ran a second generation car in the 1982-84 seasons, alternating with Dodge Miradas and Chrysler Imperials. The Cordoba was no more aerodynamic than the other <b>Mopars</b> and never finished higher than 15th in any race entered.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} {{was that}} Imperial, and all <b>Mopars,</b> received [...] "Torsion-Aire" [...] suspension for 1957. Torsion-Aire was an indirect-acting, torsion-bar {{front suspension system}} which reduced unsprung weight and shifted the car's center of gravity downward and rearward. Torsion-bar suspension on the front combined with multi-leaf springs on the rear provided a smoother ride and improved handling. Pillarless hardtops, in both two and four door configurations, got the Southampton designation.|$|R
50|$|Imperial styling was {{completely}} new for the 1967 and 1968 models. Using a two-inch shorter wheelbase, Imperial switched from the body-on-frame platform (D-body) to a unibody platform (C-body platform {{used in other}} full size <b>Mopars.)</b> While Imperial's front K member was 3.0 in longer than a Chrysler's, dimensions behind the front fenders were similar. One reason for the change was that Chrysler had gained experience with unibody construction {{and was ready to}} apply it to the company's flagship line.|$|R
500|$|NASCAR {{banned the}} <b>Mopar</b> Hemi engine in 1965, so Petty and Pearson boycotted many races rather than compete with a non-competitive engine against Ford and Mercury drivers. Both competed in drag racing. Pearson drove a Dodge Dart station wagon nicknamed the [...] "Cotton Picker" [...] for Owens. NASCAR owner Bill France, Sr. {{adjusted}} the engine rules {{later in the}} season to bring back <b>Mopar</b> drivers; Petty and Pearson ended up competing in 14 of 55 events. Pearson won two of the final 21 races (Columbia and Richmond) to finish 40th in the season points.|$|E
500|$|Until mid-decade, all radios in {{automobiles}} used vacuum tubes, but on April 28, 1955, Chrysler and Philco {{announced the}} development and production of the first all-transistor radio for an automobile. Dubbed the <b>Mopar</b> model 914HR, it was jointly developed by Chrysler and Philco and offered as a $150 option for 1956 Imperial and Chrysler car models. Philco manufactured the radio exclusively for Chrysler at its Sandusky, Ohio plant. [...] A few years earlier in 1952, Blaupunkt {{had been the first}} company to offer FM radio for automobiles, although AM radio still dominated for years to come. Beginning in 1955, Chrysler offered a small phonograph called the Highway Hi-Fi in its luxury cars, which played proprietary seven-inch records. [...] It proved unpopular and was soon discontinued.|$|E
2500|$|A {{prototype}} 2008 <b>Mopar</b> Viper Coupe, with , {{appeared at}} the 2007 North American International Auto Show, but is not planned for production. This concept {{appears to have been}} a sneak peek at the Viper ACR. [...] Performance parts from this car are sold by <b>Mopar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chrysler {{released}} the VH Valiant range in June 1971. The VH {{was the first}} fully Australian-designed Valiant and was a major change from the preceding VG range — these were larger cars, styled to look even larger than they were. The grille treatment on the new VH range was a direct design descendant from the US <b>Mopars</b> with the central recessed area for grille and headlamps, surrounded by uninterrupted trim on the outer {{leading edge of the}} whole assembly. The rectangular headlamps were carried over from the VG model.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in the 1957 model year, Imperials were {{available}} in three levels of trim: standard Imperial Custom, mid-range Imperial Crown, and the new top-of-the-line Imperial LeBaron [...] (a reference to LeBaron, Carrossiers). The custom-built [...] Imperial Crown limousine was also offered. Through the late 1950s and into the early 1960s styling would continue to become [...] "Longer, Lower, Wider", {{with the addition of}} some of the wildest fins on a car. The [...] "FliteSweep Deck Lid", a fake continental tire bulge, was an option for 1957 through 1961 and again in 1963 (due to demand). It was shared with contemporary <b>Mopars,</b> including the Valiant. Exner's love of this feature extended back to early-fifties concept cars like the 1953 Chrysler D'Elegance.|$|R
2500|$|Plymouth product {{planning}} director Jack Charipar gave impetus for a stock car racing {{version of the}} Valiant, and while Chrysler engineers developed the Hyper-Pak for the track, the Hyper-Pak dealer tuning kit option was made available in limited quantities on December 1, 1959. Features included [...] of torque, a 10.5:1 compression ratio, dual exhaust pipes on a single muffler, a manual choke and a larger [...] fuel tank. Dick Maxwell, a Chrysler engineer responsible {{for many of the}} Super Stock <b>Mopars,</b> recalls that [...] "When NASCAR decided to run a compact road race in conjunction with the 1960 Daytona 500, all the factories got involved. We built a fleet of seven Hyper Pak Valiants with 148-hp 170-ci [...] sixes having a single four-barrel with ram manifold." [...] The race Hyper-Paks also featured high-load valve springs and long-duration, high-lift camshafts.|$|R
2500|$|The SEMA {{concept car}} is a version of 2013 SRT Viper coupe demonstrating <b>Mopar</b> {{products}} for SRT Viper. Changes include yellow body colour, carbon fiber parts at underhood, exposed carbon fiber performance cross X-Brace trimmed in a satin finish, a decal-cut Viper [...] "Stryker" [...] logo {{in the center of}} X-Brace, engine cover in carbon fiber and aluminum with the SRT logo, prototype aluminum oil filler cap with the SRT logo, a carbon fiber aero package, <b>Mopar</b> coil springs, full black interior with yellow accents, Sabelt hard-shell seats with a six-point safety harness, seat edging in black Katzkin leather with yellow accents in the perforations, <b>Mopar</b> billet aluminum shift knob, billet aluminum HVAC bezels and controls, carbon fiber bulkhead satchel with a universal integrated quick-release camera mount, polished chrome door-sill guards with the Viper logo, race-inspired sand-blasted aluminum <b>Mopar</b> bright pedal kit with the Viper logo etched in the pedals, footrest pedal with [...] "Stryker" [...] logo, optional [...] "Track Pack" [...] wheels finished in hyperblack, a front tow hook and an LED fog lamp kit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Dodge and Plymouth teams {{moved their}} {{front and rear}} wheels forward, giving them greater traction. These new [...] "Funny Cars" [...] were not allowed in NHRA meets. Ford {{disallowed}} their factory-supported Ford and Mercury teams competing against these new <b>Mopar</b> Funny Cars. Nicholson was concerned about losing his match racing income since his car was outclassed. That August, he converted his car to a Funny Car, adding nitromethane fuel, switching to fuel injection, and changing the wheelbase. Several weeks later he defeated the Ramcharger Dodge, the top <b>Mopar</b> entry, with a 9.30 second pass at [...]|$|E
2500|$|In April 1955 Chrysler and Philco {{announced}} {{the development and}} production of the world’s first all-transistor car radio. The radio, <b>Mopar</b> model 914HR, was a $150.00 [...] "option" [...] on 1956 Imperial car models. Philco began manufacturing the all-transistor car radio for Chrysler {{in the fall of}} 1955 at its Sandusky, Ohio plant.|$|E
5000|$|The tailfins {{were largely}} {{truncated}} in 1962, topped with free-standing gunsight taillights, {{but these were}} elongated, streamlined affairs. The front grille was split, as in 1955-56, and a large round Eagle hood ornament was fitted for the first time. The 1962 models had a new, slimmer TorqueFlite A727 automatic transmission, which allowed a smaller transmission [...] "hump" [...] in the floor. This provided greater comfort for passengers in the center seat up front. Dual exhaust was now only standard on convertibles. 1962 also marked the closing of Imperial's dedicated assembly plant. All later Imperials were once again built in the same Jefferson Avenue facilities in Detroit as Chryslers, as sales were insufficient to maintain a separate facility. 1962 production totaled 14,337. Shortly before leaving Chrysler, Virgil Exner had planned for a smaller Imperial {{to go along with}} the downsized 1962 <b>Mopars,</b> but the idea never went anywhere.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966 a four-door Coronet 500 was added, {{called the}} Coronet 500 SE (Special Edition). It had special [...] "SE" [...] logos on the C-pillars {{and on the}} seat back. There would be no Coronet 500 wagon until 1968. Coronet {{received}} a redesign in 1966, and a facelift in 1967. Trim levels initially were base Coronet, Coronet 440 and Coronet 500. In 1966, the Coronet Deluxe was introduced, fitting between the base Coronet and the Coronet 440. The Coronet R/T was introduced in 1967.The Coronet R/T was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. Standard engine was Chrysler's largest, the 440-cid V-8, it was tweaked to 375 bhp and christened the Magnum. The only engine option was the 426-cid Hemi, now in its second year in [...] "Street" [...] trim and again rated at 425 bhp. It added $908. Transmission choices were <b>Mopar's</b> excellent heavy-duty three-speed TorqueFlite automatic or a four-speed manual.|$|R
5000|$|HemiGTX - The Hemi GTX {{package is}} a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were {{customized}} by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from <b>Mopar's</b> Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20" [...] American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl [...] "blacked-out" [...] hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a [...] "hockey-stick" [...] stripe with [...] "HEMI GTX" [...] that extended from the hood {{to the rear of}} the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005. A certificate of authencity was given to all original owners.|$|R
2500|$|MY 1993: Base 3.3L engine had [...] and {{standard}} non-touring suspension. A six-disc trunk-mounted <b>Mopar</b> CD changer with wire remote and an alarm system were dealer installed options. This {{was the first}} car, along with Intrepid and Vision, to have the 3.5L 24-valve SOHC V6. A Panasonic cell phone with externally mounted antenna could be ordered. The split bench seat with column shift lever was not yet available, but planned from the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Andretti {{drove the}} Taco Bell Express Top Fuel Dragster for owner Jack Clark. He reached the semi-finals {{in his first}} {{national}} event at Atlanta during the FRAM Southern Nationals, clocking a career-best speed of [...] In that race he beat 1992 T/F Champion Joe Amato in Round 1 and <b>Mopar</b> Express Lube driver Tommy Johnson Jr. in Round 2, but lost to Mike Dunn in Darrell Gwynn's La Victoria Salsa Car in the semi-finals. That race was won by Eddie Hill.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127parts {{with its}} predecessor (mostly fasteners). The European model was coded WG. The spare tire was relocated {{from the side}} of the cargo compartment to under the floor. (Like the 1998 ZJ, the rear tailgate glass opened separately.) The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler's then-new PowerTech. The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The straight-six engine was also updated in 1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added [...] While other Jeep vehicles used the <b>Mopar</b> 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern:– 5 x 5.|$|E
5000|$|But to Chrysler's {{shock and}} dismay, Chevrolet's 1962 {{full-size}} lineup emerged {{slightly larger than}} the 1961 models, with the mid-range Chevrolet Bel Air (on a 119 in wheelbase) growing a [...]5 in longer in its body, although the car weighed 45 lb less than its 1961 predecessor. The rumored [...] "small Chevrolet" [...] {{turned out to be}} the new GM [...] "X" [...] body Chevy II compact, which was intended to bolster Chevy's position where the Corvair had faltered in that segment of the market. The [...] "full-size" [...] Dodge Polara and Dart that emerged for 1962 were built on a 3 in shorter (116 in) wheelbase and were 7 in shorter overall than the comparable Chevrolet, placing Dodge in the precarious position with consumers of not offering a true full-sized automobile. Ford also brought their new intermediate- or mid-size Ford Fairlane and Mercury Meteor to market for 1962 with a 115 in wheelbase (116.1 in on all Meteors but wagons). They were roughly the same size as the new standard-size Dodges, which made the new <b>Mopars</b> intermediates by default. The AMC Rambler was also similarly sized and was introduced to North America in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1957 model year, the Imperial {{received}} its own platform, setting it apart {{from any other}} division of Chrysler. This would last through the 1966 model year. Imperials during this period were substantially wider, both inside and out, than other <b>Mopars</b> with front and rear shoulder room equal to 64.0 in and 62.0 in respectively. The front seat shoulder room measurement remains an unsurpassed record for Imperial and would remain the record for any car until the 1971-1976 GM full-size models. Exterior width reached a maximum of 81.7 in for 1961-1963, which remains {{the record for the}} widest non-limousine American car. After Lincoln downsized for 1961 this generation of Imperial had no real competitor for the title of largest car for the remainder of its decade-long lifespan.One advantage of Imperials of this vintage was their strength; their crashworthiness got them banned from most demolition derbies for being too durable and too tough to take down. Unlike the rest of the Chrysler Corporation makes (Chrysler, De Soto, Dodge and Plymouth), that began unibody construction for 1960, the Imperial retained separate full perimeter frames for rigidity through the 1966 model year. These substantial frames had a box cross section with crossmembers forming an [...] "X". The drive shaft passed {{through a hole in the}} [...] "X" [...] frame. The emergency brake gripped the drive shaft, and was not connected to the rear drum brakes prior to the 1963 model year.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2015, the {{department}} uses {{a large number}} of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors as their main fleet of patrol vehicles which was first ordered in 1996 replacing the Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (used between 1988 and in patrol service until 2004 (replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria squads to 1987 along with M-bodied <b>Mopars</b> (primarily the Plymouth Gran Fury (both R and M platform) last used in 1989)). They have Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor models from dating from 1999 to 2011. Since Ford no longer produces the [...] "crown Vic" [...] (procurement of the Crown Vic ended in April 2011 when the orders were filled), The department has chosen to phase in the Chevy Tahoe PPV and Ford Police Interceptor Utility(Explorer) as the successor to the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. The department is continuing to test new Chevy Caprice PPV models and Ford Taurus Interceptors (including the fifth-generation Explorer) as well - the test mules as of 2015 have been integrated into the mainstream vehicle fleet. [...] It also uses pickup trucks from the Big Three, such as the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford F150, and Dodge Ram for their Truck Enforcement Unit. There is also a small fleet of Dodge Chargers and Chevrolet Camaro s, which are mainly used as [...] "stealth traffic patrol vehicles" [...] (which is part of the Traffic Enforcement division). The stealth vehicles are plain white police cars with a slicktop roof and gray, reflective [...] "HOUSTON POLICE" [...] graphics on the side {{as well as on the}} front bumper, and hidden emergency lights that are driven by uniformed officers. The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is also used in this manner - as of late 2011 the stealth patrol vehicles are now painted black. The stealth squads have been supplemented with 14 Ford Taurus Police Interceptors in early 2014 (painted black). Solo (motorcycle) officers use Harley-Davidson motorcycles. [...] The patrol vehicle livery, painted white with blue lettered graphics dating back to 1999 (which replaced the Columbia Blue livery last used in 1998 and retired a decade later), is being phased out for a black and white color scheme where 100 vehicles are painted from $60,000 earmarked from asset forfeiture funds (under HPD policy the previous livery is still used in service until official retirement). HPD squads are usually retired when the vehicle reaches 100,000 miles (they are not reassigned to reserve or secondary duty as with the Austin or San Antonio PD after 80,000 miles) - some squads dating over 10 model years old which are no longer used for patrol duty are usually reassigned either as bait squads (HPD will park an unmanned squad in a high crime area or illegal dumping site) or the Mobility Response Division - the older HPD fleet used by Mobility Response have been retired and replaced with Ford F150 extended cab pickup trucks from the Truck Enforcement Unit. Around 2016 the Houston Chronicle revealed that some of the older squads are still in service but the breakdown rate has increased - a 100,000 mile marked squad (or 120,000 mile unmarked vehicle) has the life expectancy of an automobile with 300,000 miles with regular maintenance. At the time HPD ordered 50 new Ford Police Interceptor Utilities for the command staff but not the mainstream vehicle fleet ({{the department}} has procured newer vehicles but the budget crunch has taken in a few new orders whilst the older squads are still operational. A budget crunch in major Texas cities is partly to blame where municipal budgets are usually slashed including priority spending for first responders. Most modern HPD Patrol cars today are Blue and white saying [...] " [...] HOUSTON POLICE" [...] on the side.Newer models use a mixture of black and white paint now with 911 EMERGENCY listed on the rear side of the car or truck.|$|R
2500|$|In 1991, a Chrysler MPI fuel {{injection}} system replaced the RENIX system, and the intake ports were raised approximately [...] for a better entry radius. Chrysler also enlarged the throttle body and redesigned the intake and exhaust manifolds for more efficiency, and the fuel injectors were replaced with higher flow units. Camshaft timing was also changed. The net result was an engine that made [...] and [...] Badging on most Jeeps equipped with this engine read [...] "4.0 Litre HIGH OUTPUT." [...] The new cam profile combined with altered computer programming eliminated {{the need for an}} EGR valve and knock sensor, but made the engine more sensitive to alterations, especially where emissions are concerned. The OEM fuel injectors used with the <b>Mopar</b> MPI system (manufactured by Siemens) have been known to leak fuel especially with OBDII where plugged catalytic converters are common which usually throws a P0420 code.|$|E
2500|$|A new ACR {{was added}} to the Viper line-up after the 2008 model year. Its {{upgrades}} were more drastic than the original, including street-legal racing tires (Michelin Pilot Sport Cups which Michelin describes as [...] "Ultra-High Performance Sport tires"), two-piece brake rotors, adjustable suspension, and significant aerodynamic revision. No engine modifications were made, so power and torque remain at 600hp (450kW) and 560lb·ft (760 N·m) as in the standard SRT-10. The ACR is street-legal, and is similar to the <b>MOPAR</b> Viper that Dodge displayed at various auto shows. Weight was also decreased by [...] by using the [...] "Hardcore Package", without AC, radio, speakers, amplifier, trunk carpet, hood pad or tire-inflator. Its aerodynamic upgrades produce up to 1000 pounds (4.45 kN) of downforce at , or roughly 10 times the downforce the standard Viper SRT-10 can produce at the same speed. The interior was upgraded only by the addition of a beacon-tripped lap timer (Hardcore Edition Only).|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, the Valiant was {{available}} as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (Federal) [...] single-barrel Slant-6; E44 , twin-barrel V-8; E58 , four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (Federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service {{as it was the}} only one with [...] "added endurance features to improve durability." [...] The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in Federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler cop car tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of [...] and could catch nearly all the so-called [...] "performance cars" [...] of the day. The Seattle Police Department using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers, and according to a Motor Trend police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars. A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear antisway bars. Unfortunately, the Valiant wasn't physically durable enough; it lacked additional frame welds and rear cross-member reinforcements standard on all other <b>Mopar</b> A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.|$|E
