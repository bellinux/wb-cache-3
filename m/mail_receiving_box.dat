25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount of <b>mail</b> they <b>receive</b> each day may notice that they receive an average number of 4 letters per day.

Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|R

When you write a column, you can't sit on the fence".|$|R
40|$|In {{most of the}} {{existing}} commercial platforms for distance education, the hold in account of individual differences between students is nearly non-existent or it often based on an instructor’s presence. But, an instructor can sometimes be overflowed by the different electronic <b>mails</b> <b>received.</b> An efficient distance-learning environment {{must be able to}} adapt the content to all students by planning sequences of activities. The main goal of this communication is to show the different aspects bound to such a planning in the ARDOVIA environment...|$|R

50|$|King's Boarding House is {{important}} as a once common, now uncommon surviving example of a coach stop established on a historically important travel route.

While some alterations have occurred over time, the place is relatively intact and retains sufficient fabric in its layout and materials to demonstrate its functions as a boarding house, <b>mail</b> <b>receiving</b> office and store.|$|R
