5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin <b>metal</b> <b>film</b> composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMetals are {{favorable}} {{candidates for}} flexible transparent electrodes {{because they have}} high electrical conductivity and good ductility. Theoretically, ultrathin <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> can present low sheet resistance and high transmittance simultaneously. However, due to Ostwald ripening many <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> (e. g., Ag) tend to form in island growth mode, leading to isolated metal islands and non-conducting feature until the films become relatively opaque. Here we present a new vacuum deposition method that can effectively suppress the Ostwald ripening in <b>metal</b> <b>films,</b> which become conducting at a thickness {{much smaller than the}} percolation threshold.

25|$|The {{arrangement}} of plates and dielectric has many variations {{depending on the}} desired ratings of the capacitor. For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values {{can be made by}} multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or <b>metal</b> <b>film</b> layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plasticthese are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the <b>metal</b> <b>film,</b> which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Georgia Tech made {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} with a higher effective surface area by wrapping the cells around a quartz optical fiber. The researchers removed the cladding from optical fibers, grew zinc oxide nanowires along the surface, treated them with dye molecules, surrounded the fibers by an electrolyte and a <b>metal</b> <b>film</b> that carries electrons off the fiber. The cells are six times more efficient than a zinc oxide cell with the same surface area. Photons bounce inside the fiber as they travel, so there are more chances {{to interact with the}} solar cell and produce more current. These devices only collect light at the tips, but future fiber cells could be made to absorb light along {{the entire length of the}} fiber, which would require a coating that is conductive as well as transparent. Max Shtein of the University of Michigan said a sun-tracking system would not be necessary for such cells, and would work on cloudy days when light is diffuse.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>film</b> {{resistors}} {{are usually}} coated with nickel chromium (NiCr), but might be coated {{with any of}} the cermet materials listed above for thin film resistors. Unlike thin film resistors, the material may be applied using different techniques than sputtering (though {{this is one of the}} techniques). [...] Also, unlike thin-film resistors, the resistance value is determined by cutting a helix through the coating rather than by etching. [...] (This is similar to the way carbon resistors are made.) The result is a reasonable tolerance (0.5%, 1%, or 2%) and a temperature coefficient that is generally between 50 and 100 ppm/K. <b>Metal</b> <b>film</b> resistors possess good noise characteristics and low non-linearity due to a low voltage coefficient.

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{performance of}} the stacked glass―ceramic capacitors depends largely on the inner electrode structure and the interface quality. In this work, several <b>metal</b> <b>films,</b> such as Pt, Au, Cu and Ag, were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering serving as inner electrode layers between the dielectric layer and the silver paste electrode of glass―ceramic capacitors. The effect of the deposited <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> on the electrical properties of Na 2 O―PbO―Nb 2 O 5 ―SiO 2 glass―ceramic capacitors was investigated. Compared with the single paste electrode structure, Pt and Au <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> could effectively improve the electrical {{performance of the}} capacitors, corresponding to an increase of equivalent capacitance by 25 % and a decrease of leakage current by an order of magnitude. SEM observations indicate that the Pt, Au and Cu <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> would help {{the formation of a}} dense electrode/dielectric interface and inhibit the diffusion of silver, whereas a porous interface and intense silver diffusion are often found in the single screen―printed paste electrode and the deposited Ag metal electrode.

[...] The danger in using lines instead of dots would be creating a reflective layer which would reject light from the system. [...] This is very undesirable for solar cells.

40|$|Nanofabrication, at lateral resolutions {{beyond the}} {{capability}} of conventional optical lithography techniques, is demonstrated here. Femtosecond laser was {{used in conjunction with}} Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopes (NSOMs) to nanostructure thin <b>metal</b> <b>films.</b> Also, the possibility of using these nanostructured <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> as masks to effectively transfer the pattern to the underlying substrate by wet etching process is shown. Two different optical nearfiled processing schemes were studied for near-field nanostructuring.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the optical and {{electrical}} properties of very thin <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> vary according to their structures [13].

2500|$|While not {{an example}} of [...] "noise" [...] per se, a {{resistor}} may act as a thermocouple, producing a small DC voltage differential across it due to the thermoelectric effect if its ends are at different temperatures. This induced DC voltage can degrade the precision of instrumentation amplifiers in particular. Such voltages appear in the junctions of the resistor leads with the circuit board and with the resistor body. Common <b>metal</b> <b>film</b> resistors show such an effect at a magnitude of about 20 µV/°C. Some carbon composition resistors can exhibit thermoelectric offsets as high as 400 µV/°C, whereas specially constructed resistors can reduce this number to 0.05 µV/°C.

2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a three-terminal resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider.

A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (see drawing) is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, <b>metal</b> <b>film,</b> or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil.

An example of this is the colorful patterns produced by thin layers of oil on a surface.

The retarded attraction between thin <b>metal</b> <b>films</b> may be larger than the nonretarded attraction. This property is related to a comparatively weak retardation dependence of the energy that originates from the transverse magnetic modes. At separations where the transverse electric modes give a significant contribution, the net effect can actually be an increased attraction.
