The 492nd Fighter Squadron was readying {{to take off}} at 09:20. JG 4 hit the {{airfield}} at 09:15. Several P-47s taxiing out were abandoned by pilots and strafed to destruction. The small-scale attack by JG had achieved considerable damage. Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged. The Germans lost eight fighters, including seven Bf 109s, and three damaged. No damage was done at Le Culot airfield.|$|E

5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, {{an error}} in scoring caused the wrong medals to be presented. In this {{combined}} class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, {{to account for the}} different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to {{an error in}} the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of his frigates in the Java Sea, Pellew mustered a {{significant}} force in the early autumn of 1806, including four ships of the line, two frigates and a brig with which to eliminate the remaining Dutch squadron. Reaching the Sunda Strait on 23 November, Pellew passed by the port of Bantam and on 27 November reached Batavia, splitting his forces so that the lighter vessels sailed close to shore and the ships of the line remained in deeper water outside the channel entering the harbour. A corvette was captured, {{and the rest of the}} Dutch squadron was taken by surprise, mistaking Pellew's force for a French squadron. By the time their <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> revealed, the harbour was already blocked and so Captain Vander Sande drove Phoenix ashore, followed by six other warships and 22 merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the mistake}} by the Observer Corps, and the Geschwader being missed {{approaching}} the eastern, instead of central Channel by radar, KG 2 hit the RAF airfield.KG 2 claimed 10 Spitfires destroyed on the ground. In fact, no Fighter Command fighters were lost. For some time afterward, this wrong claim convinced German intelligence that Eastchurch was a fighter {{station and the}} Luftwaffe would launch seven fruitless raids {{on it in the}} coming weeks. Added to this <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> the failure to keep up pressure. Raids were spaced out, giving the field time to recover. The station was used by RAF Coastal Command, which lost five Bristol Blenheims in the attack and one Coastal Command Spitfire. However, severe damage was done to the infrastructure. Much equipment and ammunition was destroyed and 16 of the Command's personnel were killed. RAF Eastchurch was back in operation by 16:00.|$|E

5|$|The {{first to}} realise the <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> General Dembiński, the {{commanding}} officer of the Reserve Corps tasked with defending the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To make things worse for the Poles, General Umiński, {{the commanding officer}} of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not notice {{what was happening in}} Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Whilst outnumbered, the Muslims {{gained the}} early {{initiative}} {{and forced the}} Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> committed by {{a part of the}} Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of Muhammad's orders by the Muslim archers, who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry, led by Meccan war veteran Khalid ibn al-Walid, which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.|$|E
5|$|One lap later, Daniil Kvyat {{suffered}} a heavy impact at the penultimate corner, causing another safety car period. Both Hamilton and Vettel used this to change tyres again, as did Button on lap 45. The safety car {{came back in}} {{at the end of}} lap 46, with the order being: Rosberg, Hamilton, Verstappen, Vettel, Alonso, Pérez, Button and Maldonado. At the restart, Verstappen tried to move past Hamilton but failed and was in turn overtaken by Vettel. On lap 48, Nico Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton after sliding off track due to wheelspin in his rear tyres. The German later declared that his <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> caused by a strong gust of wind. Hamilton soon opened up a gap to his teammate, while Jenson Button moved up into sixth ahead of Alonso on lap 50, but lost the position again to Sainz {{before the end of the}} race. His teammate Alonso had been running fifth, but a loss of power from his engine moved him down the order to eventually finish eleventh. In the closing laps, Vettel edged closer to Rosberg in second, but was unable to overtake. This meant that Hamilton, who crossed the line as race winner, also took his third career championship title, with both Vettel and Rosberg now too far behind.|$|E

Architecture that <b>is</b> full of <b>mistakes.</b> San Rocco 3 does not talk about that. San Rocco 3 is interested in another kind of mistake: <b>mistakes</b> that <b>are</b> {{the product of a}} disproportion, of a displacement; <b>mistakes</b> that <b>are</b> somehow generous, open, brave; mistakes that involve some sort of heroic failure; mistakes that shed a new light on the limits of the very same rule that labels them as <b>mistakes.</b> <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> evident, public. Like rules, they involve some sort of agreement. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> the opposite of opinions. Actually, mistakes despise opinions even more than rules do. Mistakes can happen only if there is a shared knowledge. Mistakes do not imply a complete refusal of the rule; rather, a rule is opposed by a new and different rule, not by a mistake. Mistakes do not want {{to do away with the}} rule; instead, mistakes try to establish a relationship with the rule (even if this is not a very relaxed one). <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> episodes in which the rule manifests itself in all its weakness and clumsiness. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> a comedy about rules, or the stumbling and stuttering little brothers of rules. There is something intimately didactic about mistakes. As soon as there <b>is</b> a <b>mistake,</b> there <b>is</b> some sort of correction, some sort of teaching, some sort of school. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> necessarily plural: if there is a rule, there will <b>be</b> plenty of <b>mistakes.</b> Mistakes suggest the possibility (and the necessity) of a new kind of rule, one that could even cope with this specific kind of mistake. Mistakes somehow point toward some forgotten potential. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> progressive...|$|R

5|$|Second, Frederick's {{most egregious}} <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> {{his refusal to}} {{consider}} the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not move across the river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon's cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, {{they did not have}} enough water, and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his secure position, though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick's much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against entrenched positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Statement that {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of {{a statement to the}} bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the <b>mistake</b> <b>was</b> likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.|$|E
