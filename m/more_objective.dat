The anonymity of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case for removal was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} {{biography}} of Tubman {{to be published}} after Sarah Hopkins Bradford's 1869 and 1886 books was Earl Conrad's Harriet Tubman (retitled Harriet Tubman: Negro Soldier and Abolitionist in some later printings). Conrad had experienced great difficulty in finding a publisher – the search took four years – and endured disdain and contempt for his efforts to construct a <b>more</b> <b>objective,</b> detailed account of Tubman's life for adults. Several highly dramatized versions of Tubman's life had been written for children, and many more came later, but Conrad wrote in an academic style to document the historical importance of her work for scholars and the nation's memory. The book was finally published by Carter G. Woodson's Associated Publishers in 1943. Despite her popularity and significance, another Tubman biography for adults did not appear for 60 years, until Jean Humez published a close reading of Tubman's life stories in 2003, and Larson and Clinton both published their biographies in 2004. Author Milton C. Sernett discusses all the major biographies of Tubman in his 2007 book Harriet Tubman: Myth, Memory, and History.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{number of}} {{objectives}} in a multiobjective optimization problem strongly influences both {{the performance of}} generating methods and the decision making process in general. On the one hand, with <b>more</b> <b>objectives,</b> <b>more</b> incomparable solutions can arise, the number of which affects the generating method’s performance. On the other hand, the <b>more</b> <b>objectives</b> are involved the more complex is the choice of an appropriate solution for a (human) decision maker. In this context, the question arises whether all objectives are actually necessary and whether some of the objectives may be omitted; this question in turn is {{closely linked to the}} fundamental issue of conflicting and non-conflicting optimization criteria. Besides a general definition of conflicts between objective sets, we here introduce the N P-hard problem of computing a minimum subset of objectives without losing information (MOSS). Furthermore, we present forMOSS both an approximation algorithm with optimum approximation ratio and an exact algorithm which works well for small input instances. We conclude with experimental results for a random problem and the multiobjective 0 / 1 -knapsack problem. ...|$|R

25|$|Income {{and wealth}} {{statistics}} {{may serve as}} a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a <b>more</b> <b>objective</b> manner. In 2005, approximately one and a half percent (1.5%) of households in the United States had incomes exceeding $250,000 with the top 5% having incomes exceeding $157,000. Furthermore, only 2.6% of households held assets (excluding home equity) of more than one-million dollars. One could therefore fall under the assumption that less than five percent of American society are members of rich households. The richest 1% of the American population owns as much as the combined wealth of the bottom 90%, or perhaps even more.|$|E
25|$|Research shows mixed {{findings}} {{on the effect of}} smoking on prospective memory, but more evidence is in favour of smoking diminishing prospective memory performance. Self-reported measures such as the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) have reported no difference between smokers and non-smokers; however, results from prospective memory tasks have suggested otherwise. Tasks are <b>more</b> <b>objective</b> as they eliminate subjective biases which can occur on the PRMQ. A study by Heffernan et al. (2010) suggested that persistent smoking is associated with prospective memory decrements and the impact of nicotine on long-term prospective memory may be dose dependent. Greater amounts of smoking lead to worse prospective memory performance.|$|E

These trials tested intracoronary administration of Ad5FGF-4 in over 450 patients and demonstrated {{the safety of the}} product and the procedure. It is notable that when exercise tolerance was used as the primary end-point, the product did not achieve statistically significant effect primarily due to high placebo effect in the control groups. In contrast, when the <b>more</b> <b>objective</b> end-point of SPECT (measuring the extent of reversible myocardial ischemia) was used in the AGENT-2 clinical study, intracoronary administration of Ad5FGF4 resulted in a statistically significant therapeutic effect. Currently ongoing pivotal (Phase 3) clinical studies use myocardial perfusion (as measured by SPECT) as the primary end point.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Pareto set of a multiobjective {{optimization}} problem {{consists of the}} solutions for which one or <b>more</b> <b>objectives</b> can not be improved without deteriorating one or <b>more</b> other <b>objectives.</b> We consider problems with linear objectives and linear constraints and use Adjustable Robust Optimization and Polynomial Optimization as tools to approximate the Pareto set with polynomials of arbitrarily large degree. The main difference with existing techniques is that we optimize a single (extended) {{optimization problem}} that provides a polynomial approximation whereas existing methods iteratively construct a piecewise linear approximation. The proposed method has several advantages, e. g. it is more useful for visualizing the Pareto set, it can give a local approximation of the Pareto set, {{and it can be}} used for determining the shape of the Pareto set. ...|$|R

40|$|Methods for allocating {{redundant}} {{controls for}} systems with four or <b>more</b> <b>objectives</b> are studied. Previous research into aircraft control allocation {{has focused on}} allocating control effectors to provide commands for three rotational degrees of freedom. Redundant control systems {{have the capability to}} allocate commands for a larger number of objectives. For aircraft, direct force commands can be applied in addition to moment commands. When controls are limited, constraints must be placed on the objectives which can be achieved. Methods for meeting commands in the entire set of of achievable objectives have been developed. The Bisecting Edge Search Algorithm has been presented as a compu-tationally efficient method for allocating controls in the three objective problem. Linear programming techniques are also frequently presented. This research focuses on an effort to extend the Bisecting Edge Search Algorithm to handle higher numbers of objectives. A recursive algorithm for allocating controls for four or <b>more</b> <b>objectives</b> is proposed. The recursive algorithm is designed to be similar to the three objective allocator and to require computational effort which scales linearly with the controls. The control allocation problem can be formulated as a linear program. Some background o...|$|R
