5|$|The 30 contestants {{were divided}} into three teams of ten named Team 1, Team 2 and Team 3, and each group met in a {{different}} London location on 10 June, {{the day of the}} programme's launch. To record what each team did, Russian hired unpaid trainee cameramen. Once the teams were assembled, they were given their challenge: in a year, they had to make £1million. Their first task was to find accommodation for themselves for free for a week. The contestants slowly realised that, despite what their contracts had claimed, they would have to find their own food and accommodation, and would essentially be <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> prize money. Some contestants demanded to meet with Russian, who eventually revealed to them that no television channel had actually commissioned his show. Teams 1 and 3 disbanded within two days.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} was to make £1million in a single year. Realising that they would essentially be <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> prize money, most contestants quit the show within two days. One group stayed together for slightly longer: sleeping {{on the floor of}} their cameraman's flat, they attempted to create their own TV show about themselves. Having also given up his flat and job, Russian was also homeless, and was forced to stay with the contestants he had manipulated. After the programme failed, Russian went into hiding, and was unable to be contacted. He was eventually tracked down by one of his victims to an address in Richmond upon Thames, where he was forced to apologise on camera. As he had not taken any money from his victims, a criminal case against Russian was not pursued—a civil case was also not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E

5|$|The Last Remnant {{was created}} by {{developers}} who had previously worked on games in the SaGa and Final Fantasy series. It was directed by Hiroshi Takai and produced by Nobuyuki Ueda. The game was written by Masato Yagi and Miwa Shoda whose work {{was based on a}} scenario concept by executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu. Kimihiko Miyamae was the chief artist, while Yusuke Naora served as both art producer and character designer. The game was the first game by Square Enix to use the Unreal Engine 3. Because they used a licensed engine rather than <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> the production time it took to see graphical resources onscreen was cut significantly, allowing the team to begin illustrating and experimenting at an early stage. The decision to use a licensed engine, rather than develop their own as was traditional at Square Enix, was made due to concerns in the company of the rising production costs of making a game, and the direct development time savings possible from using an existing engine. Over a year after the game was released, on February 17, 2010, Square-Enix's chief technology officer Julien Merceron claimed in an interview that most of the game's perceived technical shortcomings were caused by a decision to use the Unreal Engine to try to replace having as many skilled programmers as would be used otherwise.|$|E

25|$|The TVR Vixen Series 1 was {{unveiled}} at the British motor show in October 1967. It proved popular, and generated many new orders for cars. With {{the launch of}} the Vixen, TVR transitioned back to <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> fiberglass bodies, rather than depending on Grantura Plastics to build them. Despite the sales success of the Vixen, the company still recorded an overall loss for 1967, and financial advisors began to recommend to Arthur Lilley that the company be shut down. Martin resolved to improve TVR's financial fortunes with increased production in 1968.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} renamed the Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd. in 1897. In 1902 they began {{producing}} Triumph motorcycles at their works in Coventry on Much Park Street. At first, they used engines purchased from another company, but the business prospered and they soon started <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> engines. In 1907 they purchased {{the premises of}} a spinning mill on Priory Street {{to develop a new}} factory. Major orders for the 550 cc ModelH were placed by the British Army during the First World War; by 1918 Triumph had become Britain's largest manufacturer of motorcycles.|$|E

25|$|Governance and {{decision}} making is conducted at a special meeting for worship—often called a meeting for worship with a concern for business or meeting for worship for church affairs at which all members can attend, as in a Congregational church. Quakers consider {{this to be a}} form of worship, conducted in the manner of meeting for worship. They believe this is the gathering of believers who wait upon the Lord to discover God's will, believing that they are not <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> decisions. They seek to understand God's will for the religious community, via the actions of the Holy Spirit within the meeting.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt to}} {{describe}} the model of care used quickly becomes complex. At the ALS end of the spectrum, the model closely resembles the German version of the Franco-German model, with paramedics working with and {{under the direction of}} a physician. This represents, however, only the 5 percent of EMS personnel in the entire country who are paramedics, and only a single ambulance, out of 77 units in service. For the balance, the model much more closely resembles the Anglo-American model, with EMTs <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> treatment decisions based upon local guidelines, albeit at a basic life support level, or at best, with the limited skill set of an EMT-I.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{cost saving}} {{initiative}} within ITV plc, Michael Grade announced in 2007 that the regional news service would be reduced from seventeen distinct news programmes and services to nine, affecting all the sub-regional services. As a result, all Tyne Tees sub-opts were ceased immediately. As {{part of the same}} plans, he also announced that Tyne Tees would be merged with Border Television, subject to Ofcom approval which occurred the following year, resulting in one large programme covering both regions.

25|$|Dairy {{products}} play {{an important}} role in Lithuanian cuisine; curd cheese (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Lithuanian butters and cream are unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called sūreliai are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though many people still prefer <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> soured milk.|$|E
25|$|In October 1820, {{a plague}} of locusts {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} crops. Francia ordered a second harvest planted. It proved abundant, so from then on Paraguay's farmers planted two crops a year. Through the decade, Francia nationalised half the land in four stages. First he confiscated the lands of traitors, then clerics (1823–4), squatters (1825) and finally unused land (1828). The land was either run directly by soldiers for <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> supplies or leased to the peasants. By 1825 Paraguay was self-sufficient in sugar cane, and wheat was introduced. At {{the end of his}} life, Francia ruthlessly confined all the cattle at Ytapua to stop a plague spreading from Argentina until it died out.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by <b>making</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> fanzines, music and art.|$|E
