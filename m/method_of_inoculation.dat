30|$|In conclusion, {{taking into}} account the search for more {{conservative}} agricultural systems, inoculation with A. brasilense stands as a promising strategy to contribute to increased sustainability. However, in times when more and more pesticides for seed treatment are released, and so little is known about their toxicity to inoculated Azospirillum bacteria, compatibility with inoculants applied to the seed can seriously limit microbial contribution. In our study we have identified alternative <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> to avoid the contact of Azospirillum with pesticides applied to the seeds, with an emphasis on leaf spray {{at the beginning of the}} vegetative phase. Alternative <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> may increase the utilization of such bacteria in the field and help reduce agricultural costs.|$|R

2500|$|Since {{at least}} the 11th century, and {{probably}} earlier, hops {{have been used in}} beer for their natural preservative qualities {{as well as for the}} pleasant bitterness, flavour, and aroma they impart. Since the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> and long fermentation time of lambic beers increases the risk of spoilage, lambic brewers use large amounts of hops for their antibacterial properties. Lambic in the early 19th century was a highly hopped beer, using 8–9 g/l of the locally grown Aalst or Poperinge varieties. Modern lambic brewers, however, try to avoid making the beer extremely hop forward and utilise aged, dry hops which have lost much of their bitterness, aroma and flavour. Consequently, lambics often have a strong, cheese-like, [...] "old hop" [...] aroma, in contrast to the resiny, herbal, earthy hop bitterness found in other styles. The favourite hop used for lambic in the nineteenth century was a variety called Coigneau which was cultivated in the Aalst-Asse area in Belgium.|$|E

[...] Source material tells us on Montagu; [...] "When Lady Mary was in the Ottoman Empire, she discovered the local practice of inoculation against smallpox called variolation." [...] In 1718 she had [...] her son, aged five variolated. He recovered quickly. She returned to London and had her daughter variolated in 1721 by Charles Maitland, during an epidemic of smallpox. This encouraged the British Royal Family to take an interest and a trial of variolation was carried out on prisoners in Newgate Prison. This was successful and in 1722 Princess Augusta, the Princess of Wales, allowed Maitland to vaccinate her children. The success of these variolations assured the British people that the procedure was safe.|$|E
