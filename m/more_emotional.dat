5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become <b>more</b> <b>emotional.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E

In the {{original}} video animations of the series, he is given a more humanized design and a <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> personality. In the non-canon , an older Sanosuke discovers Kenshin gravely injured when he is traveling in Asia and sends Kenshin back to Tokyo by himself, contradicting his character development by his creator, Watsuki. Sanosuke is also a playable character in almost all the Rurouni Kenshin video games except Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars, in which he isn't playable but is available as a Battle koma.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there were}} also some more {{positive}} reviews of Eldest. Bookmarks magazine saw Eldests similarity to other works, but said that Eldest displayed <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> depth than Eragon. Publishers Weekly also gave a positive review for Eldest, praising the revelations in the final pages. Barnes & Noble gave a positive review for Eldest, in particular for its style, characters and themes such as friendship, forgiveness, responsibility, and honor. Eldest won the 2006 Quill Award in Young Adult Literature. Eldest also {{was nominated for a}} British Book Award in the Children's Book of the Year section, the Disney Adventures Book Award, the Colorado Blue Spruce Award, Young Adult Book Award, and the Wyoming Soaring Eagle Book Award.|$|E

Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming <b>more</b> <b>emotional.</b> In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E
5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII is {{an album}} {{featuring}} piano arrangements of selected Final Fantasy VII pieces composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi, and performed by Seiji Honda. The album was released through DigiCube on December 3, 2003 and later reissued by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. It covers a duration of 47:37 over 13 tracks. The album includes light-hearted tracks {{as well as}} slower, <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> pieces, covering a variety of genres such as marches, new-age themes, and jazz. Unlike previous and subsequent Final Fantasy piano albums, Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII was produced many years {{after the release of}} the original game. As three of the tracks from this album were reused in the soundtrack to , it has been speculated that the album was produced with the intention to provide tunes for Advent Children.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedOne {{explanation}} for the effectiveness of experimental disclosure is Exposure Theory (Frattaroli, 2006) which hypothesizes that future well-being {{is the result of}} the expression of negative emotion. The goal of this study was to assess whether writing or talking facilitated emotional expression and to determine whether increased emotional expression then predicted improved well-being. Given cultural differences between European Americans and East Asian Americans regarding the utility of, and comfort with, verbalizing negative emotional experiences (Kim, 2002), we hypothesized that writing would evoke <b>more</b> negative <b>emotional</b> expression and would therefore lead to greater improvements in well-being. The results indicated that writing did elicit <b>more</b> negative <b>emotional</b> expression than talking. However, use of negative emotion was not related to improvements in well-being...|$|R
5|$|Sensibility in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
25|$|As the rationalist Enlightenment {{gave way}} to the <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> period of Romanticism, the {{questioning}} of popular heroes grew more unpopular still, and the traditional account of Tell was reestablished for generations by Friedrich Schiller's play William Tell of 1804.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to demonstrate the}} relationship between teachers’childhood experiences with their parents and their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to a hypothetical student’s request to speak with them, expressed in short or detailed form. A similar procedure {{has been used by}} Perrine and Steele King for students, and now has been used for teachers. For this purpose, self-report questionnaires were administered to a sample of 395 female teachers. The results showed a signiﬁcant relationship between parental bonding experiences and behavioral and emotional, but not cognitive, reactions to an hypothetical student’s request. The optimal parenting group reported <b>more</b> positive <b>emotional</b> and behavioral reactions, while the affectionate control group reported <b>more</b> negative <b>emotional</b> reactions to the hypothetical student’s request than the other groups. These results offer useful implications to be utilized in teachers’ training programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{construct}} of alexithymia was examined using factor analyses and a modified Crovitz-Robinson autobiographical memory technique. Results indicated a two-factor {{solution to the}} Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Subjects high in alexithymic characteristics were actually faster at recalling emotional events. They also reported <b>more</b> intense <b>emotional</b> experience at time of encoding but not at time of recall, showed a <b>more</b> complex <b>emotional</b> profile for their memories, but {{a greater number of}} response failures. When factor scores from principal components analyses were used to predict the above variables opposite results were obtained. Factor 1 and factor 2 scores showed very different patterns of relationships with the variables. It is proposed that the first factor found contains the "core" alexithymia characteristics. The breakdown of alexithymic characteristics and their differential relationship to the present cognitive task are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Les bayadères is an {{important}} transitional work {{in the tradition of}} operas on Oriental themes. In the 18th-century, these tended to be set in the Middle East and were usually comic in spirit. Examples include Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail and Grétry's La caravane du Caire. As the 19th century progressed, French Oriental operas moved further eastwards, especially to South Asia, with works such as Bizet's Les pêcheurs de perles and Delibes' Lakmé. These were generally <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> than comic and Les bayadères, set in India and with a serious plot, is an obvious forerunner.|$|E
25|$|For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, {{most notably}} Scarface and Carlito's Way, pushed the {{envelope}} of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary {{from one another}} in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of Scarface contrast with the <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> tragedy of Carlito's Way. Both films feature Al Pacino {{in what has become}} a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song Dancing in the Dark. The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films Dressed To Kill, Blow Out, and Body Double.|$|E

25|$|For the 1989 NBA Finals, CBS {{completely}} revamped {{the opening}} montage. The computer-generated imagery (once again set {{in and around}} a virtual arena) was made to look more realistic (live-action footage was incorporated in the backdrops). Also, the familiar theme music was rearranged to sound more intricate {{and to have a}} <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> impact, {{along the lines of the}} network's later World Series coverage. Between the 1989 NBA Finals and the 1990 NBA Finals' intros, the theme music was slightly revised; the 1989 Finals intro incorporated more of a guitar riff, while the 1990 Finals intro featured a little more usage of trumpets.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{profitable}} aspects of the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) is its numismatic product line. The first numismatic coin from the RCM was arguably the 1935 dollar commemorating the Silver Jubilee of His Majesty King George V. Though intended for circulation, {{it was the first}} Canadian coin commemorating an event. The decision to issue this coin was made in October 1934 by then-Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. There were economic and patriotic motivations for the release of a silver dollar, including a hope to boost the silver mining industry. In future years, the silver dollar would have a <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> meaning for many Canadians because it was also the first coin to have the Voyageur motif on its reverse.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, the marble floor. (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires <b>more</b> <b>emotional</b> involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.|$|E
