40|$|This article {{addresses}} the hybrid control method for <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robot in constrained environment. <b>Wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots, which {{are characterized by}} nonholonomic constraints, are particularly difficult to control since environment constraints {{should be taken into}} account sometimes. Traditional control methods, which are based on precise models of environment, may lead to great challenges in determining suitable control laws to steer <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots. To enhance autonomy of <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots, hybrid system frameworks which consider simultaneously the control and decision-making issues are required. In this paper, the <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robot which operates in a constrained environment is modeled as a 3 -layered hybrid architecture: finite state machine for the decision-making process, <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robot system for the continuous state plant, while the interface as the interaction between the continuous dynamics and the decision-making process. It is obvious that this hybrid architecture is particularly useful in describing the interactions between discrete and continuous components that exist simultaneously in robotic systems.

40|$|A symbolic-based {{motion control}} method for <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots is put forward in this paper. <b>Wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots, which are {{characterized}} by the nonholonomic constraints, are particularly difficult to control since real environment may be full of obstacles.

In this method, different control procedures can be generated from a finite set composed of symbols which correspond to different control actions.

40|$|Abstract- A {{solution}} {{is presented to}} the robust control problem of <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots moving on an uneven surface that is not exactly known. Quadratic surface with unknown but bounded coefficients is utilized to locally approximate the uneven surface. The design procedure {{is based on the}} transverse function method, integrator backstepping, and Lyapunov redesign technique. After exploring the left-invariance property of the kinematic subsystem of the <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots with respect to the standard group operation of the Lie group SE(2), we use transverse function to derive smooth “virtual ” control laws which render the error subsystem exponentially stable. Then, the integrator backstepping technique is applied to the nominal dynamic system due to the smoothness of the “virtual ” control laws. Finally, a Lyapunov redesign component is constructed to handle the gravity disturbance caused by the surface. Driven by the proposed control laws, the <b>wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robot has the ability to adapt to varying uneven surface condition. Some simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Index Terms- <b>Wheeled</b> <b>mobile</b> robots. Lie group. Transverse function. Backstepping. Robust stabilization.
