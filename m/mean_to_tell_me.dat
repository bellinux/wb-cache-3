500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|By July, it was {{becoming}} obvious that the ice was likely to crush the Endurance, which creaked and trembled under the pressure, and Shackleton instructed Worsley {{to be prepared to}} quickly abandon ship if the need arose. Worsley was initially incredulous, asking Shackleton: [...] "You seriously <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that the ship is doomed?" [...] Shackleton responded [...] "The ship can't live in this, Skipper." [...] Finally, on 24 October, the pressure of the ice caused the stern post of the Endurance to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water. After desperate attempts to fix the leak and pump the ship dry, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship three days later. [...] Salvaging what essential supplies they could, the expedition set out on 30 October for Robertson Island, [...] to the northeast. After just three days, {{it was clear that the}} condition of the ice was too rough for sledging. Having travelled only a mile and a half (2.4km) from where the Endurance was sinking, they set up camp to wait for the ice to break up. Lumber and tents were salvaged from the crushed ship, which was still not fully submerged, and a reasonable camp, known as Ocean Camp, was established. [...] The expedition stayed here for two months until 23 December, when they struck camp.|$|E

"Do you <b>mean</b> seriously <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> sir, {{that you}} have {{never even heard of}} the {{existence}} of a city, where millions of human beings live crowded together in a small space? Of course I mean a small space comparatively; for in some cities you might walk all day without getting into the fields; and a city like that might be compared to a beehive so large that a bee might fly in a straight line all day without getting out of it." ...|$|R

He had lots of tin, everything he could want, {{and there could be}} no reason why he should not marry,--except that he was a snob, of whom your sister was well quit. But this is very different. If I, as your friend, were to put it to Miss Thorne, what do you think she would say herself?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What {{makes me}} think so, stooard?" [...] replied the cook, who was a huge good-natured young man. [...] "Well, I'll tell 'ee. I was standin' close to the fore hatch at the time, a-talkin' to Jim Brag, an' the father o' the babby, poor feller, he was standin' by the foretops'l halyards holdin' on to a belayin'-pin, an' lookin' as white as a sheet--for I got a glance at 'im {{two or three times}} doorin' the flashes o' lightnin'. Well, stooard, there was lightnin' playin' round the mizzen truck, an' the main truck, an' the fore truck, an' at the end o' the flyin' jib-boom, an' the spanker boom; then there came a flash that seemed to set afire the entire univarse; then a burst o' thunder like fifty great guns gone off all at once in a hurry. At that {{identical}} moment, stooard, there came up from the fore-cabin a yell that beat--well, I can't rightly say what it beat, but it minded me o' that unfortnit pig as got his tail jammed in the capstan off Cape Horn. The father gave a gasp. `It's born,' says he. `More like's if it's basted,' growled Jim Brag. `You're a unfeelin' monster, Brag,' says I; `an' though you are the ship's carpenter, I will say it, you 'aven't got no more sympathy than the fluke of an anchor!' Hows'ever the poor father didn't hear the remark, for he went down below all of a heap--head, legs, and arms-- anyhow. Then there came another yell, an' another, an' half a dozen more, which was followed by another flash o' lightnin' an' drownded in another roar o' thunder; but the yells from below kep' on, an' came out strong between times, makin' no account whatever o' the whistlin' wind an' rattlin' ropes, which they riz above--easy.--Now, stooard, do you <b>mean</b> for <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that all that signifies nothink? Do you suppose that that babby could go through life like an or'nary babby? No, it couldn't--not even if it was to try--w'ich it won't!" ...|$|R

Rather famously, one of his most financially prolific deeds for the State was during negotiations with the British Petroleum Company in 1925. Through a pure stroke of genius and foresight, Sir Sassoon demanded that Iraq’s oil revenue be remunerated in gold rather than sterling; at the time, this request seemed bizarre since sterling was backed by the gold standard. Nevertheless, his demand was reluctantly accepted. Later this concession benefited Iraq’s treasury during World War II, when the gold standard was abandoned and sterling plummeted. He thus secured countless additional millions of Iraqi dinars for the State. This is something that the Iraqi nation remembers with appreciation and admiration.|$|R
