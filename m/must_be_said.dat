25|$|The Kevrangow {{were not}} however, English hundreds: Triggshire came from Tricori 'three warbands', {{suggesting}} a military muster area capable of supporting three hundred fighting men. However it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> {{that this is}} an inference from name alone, and does not constitute historical evidence of any fighting force raised by a Cornish hundred.|$|E
25|$|Gode argues, additionally, {{that the}} western {{languages}} are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an a priori one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.|$|E

25|$|Under Rule 9, players {{must for}} example capture enemy stones {{even when it}} may be obvious to both players that they cannot evade capture. Otherwise the stones are not {{considered}} to have been captured. Because Rule 9 differs significantly from the various systems for ending the game used in practice, a word <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about them.|$|E
25|$|Piérola {{has been}} criticised {{because of his}} sectarianism, {{frivolous}} investment, bombastic decrees, lack of control in budget, but it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that he put forth an enormous effort to obtain new funds and to mobilize {{the country for the}} war. Basadre considers his work an act of heroism, abnegation in a country invaded, politically divided, militarily battered and economically bloodless.|$|E
25|$|The medium {{obligatory}} prayer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> {{three times}} during the day: once between sunrise and noon, once between noon and sunset, and once after sunset till two hours after sunset. It includes a series of positions and movements from one position to the next, along with specific supplications. The prayer stresses the power and loftiness of God, and the grace that is shown through his revelation. The text of the medium obligatory prayer {{can be found in}} Bahá'u'lláh's Prayers and Meditations.|$|E

25|$|Kenya's {{failure in}} the above tournament is perhaps {{indicative}} of how they failed to capitalise on their World Cup success, though it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> {{that not all of}} that failure was on the field. Although Kenya were given plenty of matches against national A sides, and played in the Carib Beer Cup in the West Indies in 2004, Kenya only played two ODIs in the three years after the Sharjah tournament, against India and Pakistan in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy.|$|E
25|$|According to halakha, all {{individual}} {{prayers and}} virtually all communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying understands. For example, the Mishnah mentions that the Shema need not be said in Hebrew A list of prayers that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> in Hebrew is given in the Mishna, and among these only the Priestly Blessing is in use today, as the others are prayers {{that are to be}} said only in a Temple in Jerusalem, by a priest, or by a reigning King.|$|E
25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism {{have altered}} the text to varying degrees to bring it into {{alignment}} with their view of modern needs and sensibilities. Conservative Judaism retains the traditional number and time periods during which the Amidah <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> while omitting explicit supplications for restoration of the sacrifices. Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism, consistent with their views that {{the rhythm of the}} ancient sacrifices should no longer drive modern Jewish prayer, often omit some of the Amidah prayers, such as the Mussaf, omit temporal requirements, and omit references to the Temple and its sacrifices.|$|E

25|$|Violence in Portuguese schools {{became an}} {{educational}} {{issue for the}} first time during the 1990s, mainly through the persistence of parental associations and teacher claims. However, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that {{this was not the first}} time that violence appeared in Portuguese schools as a significant situation. After the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974 the occurrence of violent situations reached the highest point. This was a politically socialized and framed violence, quite different from the kind of violence we can find today. That one had political programs, this one is quite anomic. Its origin is very diverse, from poverty to psychological problems. Theft, random or systematic physical aggression, bullying, destruction of school or teachers properties are realities which become current in many schools.|$|E
25|$|All of {{this would}} go to waste however, when Henry VI died of a fever in Messina on 28 September 1197. Following his death many of the higher ranking nobles {{abandoned}} the crusade to protect their interests in the Holy Roman Empire. When civil war broke out shortly after, the crusade found itself leaderless and in 1198 the crusaders retreated back to Tyre and sailed for home. The result was that the crusade had the detrimental effect of destroying Byzantium's dignity and wealth whilst failing to assist her against the Turks. It <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> however that the Byzantines after 1180 entertained no serious plans to reclaim Anatolia from the Turks, so how much territory Henry VI or his predecessor Frederick I seized may have been of little consequence in the long run.|$|E
25|$|While the Persians {{were making}} headway in their {{conquest of the}} eastern provinces, Phocas chose to divide his {{subjects}} rather than unite them against {{the threat of the}} Persians. Perhaps seeing his defeats as divine retribution, Phocas initiated a savage and bloody campaign to forcibly convert the Jews to Christianity. Persecutions and alienation of the Jews, a frontline people in the war against the Persians helped drove them into aiding the Persian conquerors. As Jews and Christians began tearing each other apart, some fled the butchery into Persian territory. Meanwhile, it appears that the disasters befalling the Empire led the Emperor into a state of paranoia — although it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that there were numerous plots against his rule and execution followed execution. Among those individuals who were executed was the former empress Constantina and her three daughters.|$|E

25|$|Another {{study of}} the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine {{geneticist}} Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. The {{results of this study}} in which DNA from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals had at least one Amerindian ancestor. Another study on African ancestry was also conducted by the University of Buenos Aires in the city of La Plata. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> here that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the mtDNA or in the Y-Chromosome, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.|$|E
500|$|Commonweal {{lamented the}} lack of {{punishment}} to the main character for his actions, but praised the director for his influence on Presley: [...] "No doubt adults won't be moved much by [...] "King Creole" [...] {{one way or the}} other, but unfortunately teenage audiences may be taken in, especially since Danny {{is supposed to be a}} sympathetic character and at the end goes unpunished by the police for his crimes ... It <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> in favor of Director Michael Curtiz that he does succeed in getting Presley to act every now and then, but the cards are stacked in such an obvious manner against Danny that even Montgomery Clift couldn't have handled the role with conviction." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{red star}} grows {{steadily}} larger, and the worried people of Ankh-Morpork mob the Unseen University because the wizards appear unable {{to save the}} disc from it. Trymon learns from Death that all eight spells of the Octavo <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> together at the solstice to save the disc from destruction and that Great A'Tuin is flying towards the red star for a purpose that Death says is [...] "nothing to do with me." [...] Trymon dispatches a group of mercenaries, led by Herrena, to capture Rincewind and retrieve the eighth spell, along with a force of wizards. Meanwhile, Rincewind and Twoflower encounter Cohen the Barbarian (87 years old and retired), and Twoflower rescues Bethan, a human sacrifice in a druid ritual. A battle between the wizards and Rincewind leaves Twoflower in a coma; Rincewind rescues him from Death's door, and Cohen in turn rescues Rincewind and Twoflower from Herrena and the mercenaries.|$|E

500|$|In the Tests, Rhodes scored 238 runs at {{an average}} of 23.80, with a highest score of 73 in the fourth Test. In the first Test, a score of 45 took him past 2,000 Test runs. As a bowler, Rhodes took four Test wickets in the series {{at an average}} of 61.25; his best figures were three for 61 in the third Test. Rhodes later said that Douglas was {{reluctant}} to use him, believing his bowling would be ineffective on Australian pitches. Wisden commented: [...] "It <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> however, that in a summer of continuous sunshine– remarkable even for Australia– the bowlers received no help." [...] Nevertheless, much of Rhodes's tour, according to A. A. Thomson, [...] "may be fairly regarded as failure." [...] Tour manager and Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone, with whom Rhodes had already had a disagreement during the 1920 season, apparently said that [...] "Wilfred's finished", a remark later reported to Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|Opinion as to {{the success}} of the race was divided in the press; The Automobile {{magazine}} declared that [...] "it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that it was a success", while The Yorkshire Post went even further, claiming that [...] "the end of the monster racing-car is in sight". They suggested that racing cars were only useful to help develop technology for ordinary cars, and that the cars used in the Gordon Bennett races and similar were no longer relevant. Along with the withdrawal of France and Britain from the Gordon Bennett races, and the amount of support for the Tourist Trophy, they commended the Automobile Club for [...] " [...] the changed conditions of affairs." [...] In contrast, Filson Young of The Manchester Guardian was strong in his criticism of the event. He opined that it had been a disappointment, though it had [...] "never many possibilities as a spectacle" [...] due to the fact that the cars only passed each point four times during the day. Though he conceded that the concept of the race had been admirable he felt that the cost of fuel was negligible in the running of a motor car and that other factors, such as general reliability over a thousand or more miles, were more important.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote that}} {{watching}} it left him [...] "reeling with turmoil and confusion, {{with feelings of}} sadness and despair," [...] and called it a [...] "thoroughly painful and depressing experience - but, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> {{one that has been}} powerfully written, directed and acted." [...] He awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that this [...] "slick, riveting, viscerally scary film about what in other hands would be a decidedly unsalable subject, namely death," [...] is [...] "both quaint and devastating." [...] However, Desson Thomson of The Washington Post felt disappointed with the film that is [...] "ultimately flat on its surrealistic face, the victim of too many fake-art sequences." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jacob's Ladder is so 'dark' it sucks Robbins right down with it. By the time Jacob is being strapped to a bed and wheeled down a hospital corridor strewn with bloody limbs, it's hard to care whether the Orwellian image is a hallucination or not. You just want out." [...] Kim Newman called the film [...] "effectively the blunt remake" [...] of Carnival of Souls.|$|E
