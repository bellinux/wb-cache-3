5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to <b>make</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>with</b> Mary Magdalene.|$|E

He was oddly the same curly-headed, red-faced ventriloquist, and oddly different, rather seedy as well as untidy, and at first a little {{inclined}} to <b>make</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>with</b> my sleek successfulness. But that disposition presently evaporated, and his talk was good and fresh and provocative. And something that had long been straining at its checks in my mind flapped over, and he and I found ourselves of one accord.|$|E

60|$|The Pyreneean {{valley in}} which the baths of Vernet are {{situated}} is not much known to English, or indeed to any travellers. Tourists in search of good hotels and picturesque beauty combined, do not generally extend their journeys to the Eastern Pyrenees. They rarely get beyond Luchon; and in this they are right, as they thus end their peregrinations at the most lovely spot among these mountains, and are as a rule so deceived, imposed on, and bewildered by guides, innkeepers, and horse-owners, at this otherwise delightful place, as to become undesirous of further travel. Nor do invalids from distant parts frequent Vernet. People of fashion go to the Eaux Bonnes and to Luchon, {{and people who are}} really ill to Bareges and Cauterets. It is at these places that one meets crowds of Parisians, and the daughters and wives of rich merchants from Bordeaux, with an admixture, now by no means inconsiderable, of Englishmen and Englishwomen. But the Eastern Pyrenees are still unfrequented. And probably they will remain so; for though there are among them lovely valleys--and of all such the valley of Vernet is perhaps the most lovely--they cannot compete with the mountain scenery of other tourists-loved regions in Europe. At the Port de Venasquez and the Breche de Roland in the Western Pyrenees, or rather, to speak more truly, at spots in the close vicinity of these famous mountain entrances from France into Spain, one can <b>make</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>with</b> Switzerland, Northern Italy, the Tyrol, and Ireland, which will not be injurious to the scenes then under view. But among the eastern mountains this can rarely be done. The hills do not stand thickly together so as to group themselves; the passes from one valley to another, though not wanting in altitude, are not close pressed together with overhanging rocks, and are deficient in grandeur as well as loveliness. And then, as a natural consequence of all this, the hotels--are not quite as good as they should be.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, {{compacts}} {{were the}} smallest class of North American cars, {{but they had}} evolved into only slightly smaller versions of the 6-cylinder or V8-powered two-bench six-passenger sedan.

The author uses mythical elements in her story. Themes include the Chipko movement, the history of the Punjab, the origin of Bangla Desh, and the heroine's search for a father.

5000|$|Critics {{and audiences}} alike failed to {{appreciate}} Williams' new {{style and the}} approach to theater he developed during the 1970s. Williams said, “I’ve been working very hard since 1969 to make an artistic comeback...there is no release short of death” (Spoto 335), and “I want to warn you, Elliot, the critics are out to get me. You’ll see how vicious they are. They <b>make</b> <b>comparisons</b> <b>with</b> my earlier work, but I’m writing differently now” (Spoto 331). Leverich explains that Williams to the end was concerned with [...] "the depths and origin of human feelings and motivations, the difference being that he had gone into a deeper, more obscure realm, which, of course, put the poet in him to the fore, and not the playwright who would bring much concern for audience and critical reaction” (xxiii).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Harvey Grace {{published}} {{a series of}} articles on Bach's organ works.

He describes the fugue as slender and simple, but only a [...] "very sketchy example of the form".
