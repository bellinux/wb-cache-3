40|$|Tensile {{strength}} and fracture toughness of castings of the hydantoin resins cured with <b>methylenedianiline</b> are {{significantly higher than}} MY 720 control castings. Water absorption of an ethyl, amyl hydantoin formulation is 2. 1 percent at equilibrium and Tg's are about 160 C, approximately 15 deg below the final cure temperature. Two series of urethane and ester-extended hydantoin epoxy resins were synthesized {{to determine the effect}} of crosslink density and functional groups on properties. Castings cured with <b>methylenedianiline</b> or with hexahydrophthalic anhydride were made from these compounds and evaluated. The glass transition temperatures, tensile strengths and moduli, and fracture toughness values were all much lower than that of the simple hydantoin epoxy resins. Using a methylene bishydantoin epoxy with a more rigid structure gave brittle, low-energy fractures, while a more flexible, ethoxy-extended hydantoin epoxy resin gave a very low Tg...|$|E

40|$|The cure {{kinetics}} and {{activation energy}} (Ea) of bismaleimide homopolymer and modified bismaleimide resin systems with different chain extenders were investigated. The bismaleimide resin under investigation was bismaleimidodiphenyl methane (BMPM) and the chain extenders were (i) O-O� diallyl bisphenol A (DABA) and (ii) <b>methylenedianiline</b> (MDA). Dynamic multiheating DSC method {{was used to}} study the kinetics of the curing process. Activation energies were determined for both unmodified and modified resins from nonisothermalmultiheating rate DSC tests by using Ozawa and Kissinger models. Activation energy for BMPM homopolymer increased from 95 kJ/mol to 125 kJ/mol {{as a function of}} conversion. For the MDA-modified system the activation energy was independent of percentage conversion, at 108 kJ/mol.

40|$|A {{series of}} N-phenylnadimide (PN) {{modified}} PMR polyimide composites reinforced with graphite fibers was investigated. The improved flow matrix resins consist of N-phenylnadimide (PN), monomenthyl ester of 5 -norbornene- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid (NE), dimethyl ester of 3, 3, 4, 4 -benzophenonetetracarboxylic acide (BTDE), and 4, 4 <b>methylenedianiline</b> (MDA).

These formulations and the control PMR resin were evaluated for rheological characteristics. The initial thermal and mechanical properties of the PN modified PMR and the control PMR/Celion 6000 composites were determined.

40|$|<b>Methylenedianiline</b> (DAPM) {{initially}} injures {{epithelial cells}} of major bile ducts, which {{is followed by}} cholestasis, cholangitis, and hepatocellular damage. This pattern of biliary injury resembles that produced by -naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), a classic bile duct toxicant. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} prior depletion of hepatic total glutathione (GSx), a condition reported to protect against biliary tract injury by ANIT, would also protect against DAPM-induced bile duct injury. A new protocol for extensive, sustained depletion of GSx was established. We found that ad-ministration of 1 -bromoheptane followed 1 h later by buthionine sulfoximine resulted in an 96 % depletion of hepatic GSx that persisted through 6 h without biochemical or morphological signs of hepatic injury. Treatment of rats with a minimally hepatotoxic dose of DAPM (without GSx depletion) produced at 6 h injury similar to previous studies: moderate oncosis of biliary epithelia...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methylenedianiline</b> (DAPM) rapidly injures biliary {{epithelial}} cells (BEC) in vivo. Prior to evident BEC injury, biliary glucose and inorganic phosphate appreciably rise, which could stem from loosened tight junctions (TJ). Concurrently, ultrastructural abnormalities in BEC mitochondria of DAPM-treated animals are observed, suggesting other impairments. Our {{objective was to}} develop an in vitro BEC model to assess {{the time course of}} impair-ments in TJ integrity, glucose uptake, and mitochondrial function following DAPM exposure. We exposed monolayers of primary, polarized rat BEC to bile collected from rats prior to (Basal Bile) or after oral treatment (DAPM-Bile) with 50 mg DAPM/kg. DAPM-Bile collected during 0 – 60 min (1 st Hr) and during 61 – 120 min (2 nd Hr) after treatment was pooled from four to six rats.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Purified <b>methylenedianiline</b> (MDA) regioisomers were {{structurally}} characterized and differentiated using tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (MS/MS), ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), and IM-MS/MS {{in conjunction with}} computational methods. It was determined that protonation sites on the isomers can {{vary depending on the}} position of amino groups, and the resulting protonation sites {{play a role in the}} gas-phase stability of the isomer. We also observed differences in the relative distributions of protonated conformations depending on experimental conditions and instrumentation, which is consistent with previous studies on aniline in the gas phase. This work demonstrates the utility of a multifaceted approach for the study of isobaric species and elucidates why previous MDA studies may have been unable to detect and/or differentiate certain isomers. Such analysis may prove useful in the characterization of larger MDA multimeric species, industrial MDA mixtures, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) mixtures used in polyurethane synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Several {{substituted}} 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydrophthalic anhydride {{end caps}} - including the 3 -phenyl, 3 -methoxy, 3 -trimethylsilyloxy, and 3, 6 -diphenyl analogs - were synthesized via the Diels-Alder condensation of the corresponding butadienes and maleic anhydride. These anhydrides, {{as well as}} the commercially available 3 -hydro and 4 -methyl analogs, were each ground together with <b>methylenedianiline</b> in a 2 : 1 ratio and heated gradually from 204 C to 371 C, with the thermolysis followed by NMR. Generally speaking, a transformation via monoimide to bisimide was observed in the lower temperature range, followed by competition between crosslinking and aromatization. We believe that this competition produces a substantial percentage of aromatic product, with the concomitant lowering of the relative amount of crosslinking and is responsible for improving both thermal oxidative stability of tetrahydrophthalic end capped polyimides and their substantial frangibility. The thermolysis of the tetrahydrophthalimides under inert atmosphere dramatically lowers the amount of aromatization hence, the mechanism for aromatization is an oxidative one...|$|E
40|$|Two {{series of}} low-melt {{viscosity}} imide resins (2 - 15 poise at 260 - 280 C) were formulated from either asymmetric oxydiphthalic anhydride (a-ODPA) or asymmetric biphenyl dianhydride (a- BPDA) with 4 -phenylethynyl endcap (PEPA), along with 3, 4 '-oxydianiline, 3, 4 - <b>methylenedianiline,</b> 3, 3 -methylenedianiline or 3, 3 -diaminobenzophenone, using a solvent-free melt process. These low-melt viscosity imide resins were fabricated into polyimide/T 650 - 35 carbon fabric composites by resin transfer molding (RTM). Composites from a-ODPA based resins display better open-hole compression strength and short beam shear strength from room temperature to 288 C {{than that of}} the corresponding a-BPDA based resins. However, due to the lower Tg s of a-ODPA based resins (265 - 330 C), their corresponding composites do not possess 315 C use capability while the a-BPDA based composites do. In essence, RTM 370 (T g = 370 C), derived from a-BPDA and 3, 4 -ODA and PEPA, exhibits the best overall property performance at 315 C (600 F) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidative}} {{degradation of}} PMR (for polymerization of monomeric reactants) polyimides at elevated temperatures {{was followed by}} cross-polarized magic angle spinning (Cp-MAS) NMR. C- 13 labeling of selected sites in the polymers allowed for direct observation of the transformations arising from oxidation processes. As opposed to model compound studies, the reactions were followed directly in the polymer. The labeling experiments confirm the previously reported oxidation of the methylene carbon to ketone in the <b>methylenedianiline</b> portion of the polymer chain. They also show the formation of two other oxidized species, acid and ester, from this same carbon. In addition, the technique provides the first evidence {{of the kind of}} degradation reactions that are occurring in the nadic end caps. Several PMR formulations containing moieties determined to be present after oxidation, as suggested by the labeling study, were synthesized. Weight loss, FTIR, and natural abundance NMR of these derivatives were followed during aging. In this way, weight loss could be related to the observed transformations...|$|E

The AR-VGCNFs as a cocuring agent were mixed with epoxy resin by simple mechanical stirring in methanol which {{was added to}} help efficient mixing. After evaporation of methanol, 4, 4 ′-methylenedianiline as a curing agent {{was added to the}} mixture, which was then cured at elevated temperatures. The resultant composites displayed uniform dispersion of AF-VGCNFs into cured epoxy matrix. During curing process, the amine functionalities on AF-VGCNF together with 4, 4 ′- <b>methylenedianiline</b> were expected to be involved in covalent attachment to the epoxy resin. As a result, both tensile modulus and strength of the composites were improved when compared with those of pure epoxy resin. Thus, the AFVGCNFs play a role as an outstanding functional additive, which could resolve both dispersion and interfacial adhesion issues at the same time by functionalization of VGCNFs and covalent bonding between the additive and matrix, respectively. close 9...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Industrial waste (which is {{composed}} of various toxic chemicals), changes to the disposal process, and addition of chemicals should all be monitored and controlled carefully in the industrial waste industry to reduce the health hazard to workers. CASE PRESENTATION: Five workers in an industrial waste plant developed acute toxic hepatitis, one of whom died after 3 months due to fulminant hepatitis. In the plant, we detected several chemicals with hepatotoxic potential, including pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and <b>methylenedianiline.</b> The workers had {{been working in the}} high-vapor-generating area of the plant, and the findings of pathologic examination showed typical features of acute toxic hepatitis. DISCUSSION: Infectious hepatitis and drug-induced hepatitis were excluded by laboratory findings, as well as the clinical course of hepatitis. All cases of toxic hepatitis in this plant developed after the change of the disposal process to thermochemical reaction–type treatment using unslaked lime reacted with industrial wastes. During this chemical reaction, vapor containing several toxic materials was generated. Although we could not confirm the definitive causative chemical, we suspect that these cases of hepatitis were caused by one of the hepatotoxic agents or by a synergistic interaction among several of them...|$|E

The molecules, in addition to providing an elongated aromatic central core associated with liquid crystal (LC) molecules, also provide binding sites for metals. The <b>methylenedianiline</b> spacer incorporates phenylene groups that sterically prevent the two binding sites from co-ordinating to a single metal centre and the central methylene unit introduces enhanced flexibility into the ligand backbone. Furthermore, complexes have been formed by the co-ordination between 3, 3 ’-methylenedianiline containing ligands and Cu (I) ions [Cu 2 (3 a-c) 2][PF 6] 2. Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (ESMS) and Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectrometry (FABMS) showed the formation of dimeric species; [Cu (L) 2][PF 6] 2.

40|$|The {{aromatic}} isocyanates, {{toluene diisocyanate}} (TDI) and methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), {{are used in}} the production of polyurethane (PUR) foams, paints, elastomers and glues. The use of isocyanates is increasing, and exposure to isocyanates is {{the most common cause of}} occupational asthma. Biomarkers of TDI and MDI were determined as the corresponding amines, toluenediamine (TDA) and <b>methylenedianiline</b> (MDA), in hydrolysed urine, plasma and erythrocytes from exposed workers. The amines were determined, after derivatisation with pentafluoropropionic anhydride, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with chemical ionisation, monitorinh negative ions. The levels of TDA and MDA in urine varied considerably during and between work days, while only limited variations were seen in plasma. At least two urinary elimination phases were observed. A relation was found between the concentrations of TDA and MDA in plasma and the urinary elimination rates of TDA and MDA after the cessation of work. A significant correlation was also found between the concentrations of TDA in plasma and the TDI air levels. TDI was found to be covalently bound to albumin in plasma and most likely to haemoglobin in erythrocytes. In urine, different TDI-modified biomolecules were observed. The use of biomarkers has made it possible to discover new groups of exposed workers, and to make preventive measures to reduce/eliminate exposure and avoid illness...|$|E
40|$|Structure-property {{relationships}} {{are central to}} the analysis and understanding of material systems. The exploration of such relationships for the known material systems and further creating new material systems are essential to solve the existing problems and guide the development of advanced technologies. In this thesis, structure-property relationships at different length scales and material systems are studied. We first study the structure-property relationships of fluid/air interfaces. Capillary interactions occurring at the water/air interface are experimentally quantified with a model containing a superhydrophobic floating object, a liquid marble, and a wall (Chapter 2). The overlapping of interfacial deformations is realized to be crucial for the capillary interactions. We further propose a new explanation of capillary interaction-driven motion of floating objects from the perspective of pressure-induced hydraulic motion of water. Then the structure-property relationships of assembled silica nanoparticles (NPs) /polyimide (PI) composites are explored (Chapter 3). A new fabrication route for integrating assembled silica NP micro-structures into PI is demonstrated. Thermal-mechanical properties of the composite films show the advantageous enhancements of the continuous silica NPs micro-structures for PI. Additionally, the composite films, which provide exposed silica NPs on one surface, were found {{to be able to be}} modified post-production to introduce new surface properties. In Chapter 4, we describe the structure-property relationships of a MDA 3 -NaCl complex, formed from <b>methylenedianiline</b> (MDA) and sodium chloride (NaCl), in polyurethane curing. It can dissociate to release MDA to achieve controllable formation of urea links from amine and isocyanate groups. The curing behavior was found to be heterogeneous and localized, and the size and dispersity of the complex particles are essential for the efficiency and thermo-mechanical properties of the resultant polyurethane elastomers. Finally, structure-property {{relationships are}} considered for a silicone coating system. The fracture mechanics of silicone coatings are studied (Chapter 5). Mismatches between thermal expansion coefficients of silicone coatings and silicon substrates were used to introduce thermal strains. The release of the residual elastic strain energy supports the propagation of an initiated crack to form various crack patterns which is influenced by the modulus and thickness of the silicone coating, and the surface property of the coating/substrate interfaces...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the four}} steps within Council Regulation 793 / 93 /EEC on the {{evaluation}} and control of existing chemicals is the priority setting step. The priority setting step is concerned with selecting high-priority substances from {{a large number of}} substances, initially starting with 2, 474 high-production-volume chemicals. In {{order to be able to}} efficiently carry out the priority setting step, an automated priority setting method was developed, the so-called European Union risk ranking method (EURAM). The EURAM produces rankings among the high-production-volume chemicals appearing in the International Uniform Chemical Information Database (IUCLID). As part of a publication series, this paper deals with the data selection criteria used in EURAM and furthermore with data validation of the selected data. To validate the selected data in EURAM, comparisons are made with validated data of priority chemicals for which European Union risk assessment reports have been completed or with data of priority chemicals from the Screening Information Data Set initial assessment reports of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Regression analysis between the selected data in EURAM and the data selected by expert judgment in the assessment procedure resulted in good correlation for physicochemical properties and aquatic toxicity data. In addition, the type of biodegradation (i. e., readily biodegradable, inherently biodegradable, or nonbiodegradable) selected by EURAM also was in agreement with the type of biodegradation selected by expert judgment in the risk assessment procedure. Hence, the good correlation between the automated data selection procedure of EURAM and the data selection by expert judgment indicates that the data selection criteria of EURAM, which are developed in order to select data for priority purposes among high-production-volume chemicals in IUCLID, seem to perform well.
