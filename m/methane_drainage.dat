50|$|Mining {{ventilation}} is {{a significant}} safety concern for many miners. Poor ventilation inside sub-surface mines causes exposure to harmful gases, heat, and dust, which can cause illness, injury, and death. The concentration of methane and other airborne contaminants underground can generally be controlled by dilution (ventilation), capture before entering the host air stream (<b>methane</b> <b>drainage),</b> or isolation (seals and stoppings). A ventilation system is set up to force a stream of air through the working areas of the mine. The air circulation necessary for effective ventilation of a mine is generated {{by one or more}} large mine fans, usually located above ground. Air flows in one direction only, making circuits through the mine such that each main work area constantly receives a supply of fresh air. Watering down in coal mines also helps to keep dust levels down: by spraying the machine with water and filtering the dust-laden water with a scrubber fan, miners can successfully trap the dust.|$|E

Furthermore, it is not known how water-saving irrigation modifies nutrient use efficiencies and if it requires different N-fertilizer management compared with continuous flooding. This study was conducted to quantify and compare rice growth, yield, and methane emissions and water productivity under the commonly practiced water-saving irrigation and continuous flooding in typical irrigated rice environments in Taiwan. The comparison was carried out under different N-fertilizer management regimes to identify possible water by nitrogen interactive effects on nutrient uptake, nutrient-use efficiencies, and whether N-fertilizer management needs to be modified to fit the water regimes of water-saving irrigation compared with those of continuous flooding. 稻為全球三大主要作物之一，全球稻米的生產約有 75 ％來自於灌溉方式所栽培的水稻，在農作物的栽培中，水稻是所有作物中耗水量最大的作物。近年來，隨著氣候異常，加上都市化民生用水及工業化用水量激增，引發水資源運用分配的問題，因此改善農業用水資源利用的情形，才可達到農業永續經營的目標。現行水稻湛水栽培耗用大量水源，成為農業灌溉用水的最大宗，因此在水資源分配競爭的情況下，提升灌溉用水效率，發展節水栽培技術，對水稻的生產、糧食的供應相當重要。由於水田經營一般採湛水栽培，長期湛水栽培除耗費水資源外，湛水栽培易導致肥料隨著水滲漏、溢流而流失，降低肥料的可利用性；另外由於土壤長期處於浸水條件，易變成厭氧狀態，有利於甲烷生成菌分解有機質產生甲烷。為了提昇水稻的水份生產力，降低肥料的施用量以提高其利用效率，以及減少水田長期湛水的甲烷排放量，本計畫擬開發適合臺灣地區的節水栽培技術，配合減肥措施，評估節水栽培對肥料的利用效率以及對甲烷釋放量的影響，藉此發展出低投入、高效率的環境親合性栽培技術...|$|R

40|$|High methane {{emissions}} {{originating from}} the active face areas {{and from the}} fractured formations overlying and underlying the mined coalbed can adversely affect both safety and productivity in underground coal mines. Since ventilation alone may {{not be sufficient to}} control the methane levels in the longwall mining environment, gob gas ventholes have become a standard supplementary methane control option in many mines. As mines progress into deeper and gassier coalbeds, or as longwall panel size increases, ventilation and gob gas ventholes together may not be sufficient to maintain methane levels within statutory limits. To decrease the risk associated with methane emissions under these circumstances, in-seam horizontal <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> is often used to reduce the gas content of the coalbed prior to mining. Horizontal <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> borehole completion designs, drilling strategies, and degasification lead times may need to be adjusted for site-specific conditions due to mine design, geology, and the gas content of the coalbed. This study investigates different horizontal <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> borehole patterns, borehole lengths, and degasification times prior to and during panel extraction to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing methane emissions using a "dynamic" 3 D reservoir modeling of a 38 1 -m wide longwall panel operating in the Pittsburgh coalbed.

Drainage and {{removal of the}} acrotelm can result in surface subsidence of up to 3. 7 cm y- 1 m- 1 of peat shortly after drainage (compression), and long-term rates up to 0. 3 cm y- 1 m- 1 (compression and oxidation). This can decrease the hydraulic conductivity by over 75 %, and decrease thewater retention capacity and specific yield. In old abandoned systems, drainage ditches may continue to facilitate a significant seasonal water loss.

Without natural or planned occlusion of ditches, some peatlands become drier over time. Blocking ditches may largely restore water balance components, although the hydrological regime requires years to stabilise sufficiently for Sphagnum recolonization, especially where residualpeat is well decomposed, having inadequate water storage capacity. Consequently,winter precipitation (Europe) and spring snowmelt (North America) are criticalrecharge periods. Over the long term, consolidation of the peat due to drainageand <b>methane</b> production (where <b>drainage</b> systems are blocked and soils reflooded) decreases hydraulic conductivity, thereby reducing lateral seepage losses. This may actually assist in Sphagnum recolonization. A regenerated cover ofSphagnum increases soil wetness and reduces water tension (increases pore-water pressure) in the substrate, thus ameliorating its own environment. However, natural recolonization and recovery of many hydrological and ecological processes may not occur, or may require many decades. Water management and selective plant reintroduction can accelerate this.

The techniques are discussed briefly in the following sections. However, detailed information on the techniques is provided in the cited references. INTRODUCTION Coalbed methane, if not properly controlled in the underground mine environment, is a safety concern due to the potential risk for an explosion. This is a particular problem during longwall mining, where the high rate and volume of coal extraction can result in the release of large amounts of methane from the mined coalbed and other adjacent gas-bearing strata. The variability and potential hazards of these sometimes unexpectedly high gas flows provide the impetus to develop methods to predict methane emissions into the underground workplace. A forecast of the volume of gas that might be released during coal mining is helpful for designing ventilation systems and for implementing optimum <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> strategies to help mitigate expected gas emission problems. A complete assessment of the need for <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> prior to mine development generally requires both an empirical and a theoretical approach. If there are active mines in the general area with similar geologic conditions and coal characteristics, a review of gas problems in those mines provides an initial insight into the level of gas emissions to be expected at a new location. In addition, relatively simple methods exist to determine the in situ gas content (volume of gas per unit weight of coal) of the coalbeds in a particular mining area, as well as the gas-in-place (volume of gas in the coalbed(s) within a defined geographic area) ...|$|E

To solve these problems, a novel method that uses a self-propelled water-jet nozzle to dredge blocked boreholes in coal seams has been proposed {{on the basis of the}} existing technology. Based on a theoretical analysis of the reason for borehole caving and the theory of blockage removal, we optimized the nozzle inlet pressure and selected an appropriate high-pressure resin pipe. A field experiment on the blockage removal of blocked CBM drainage boreholes using the proposed method was run in the Fengchun coal mine, Qijiang, Chongqing, southwest China.

Stress analysis was also carried out {{in order to provide}} an understanding of stress fields around a longwall face to evaluate the induced permeabilities under these stress fields. Three main routines of the original package required modifications to accommodate the solution of a different equation. These were element routines, solution routines and flux calculation routines. These routines, after modification, were used to simulate advance and retreat longwall mining, with and without drainage. Several different sensitivity tests were carried out by changing parameters such as borehole pressure, length, and spacing in order to aid the planning of <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> systems for longwall mining...|$|E
40|$|In-seam directionally drilled {{horizontal}} boreholes have prOVided effective {{solutions in}} underground coal mines for methane and water drainage and inherently provide an excellent tool for coalbed exploration. Emphasis {{of the paper}} will be placed on demonstrating where directionally drilled <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> boreholes have identified rapid changes in coalbed elevation, coalbed thickness and faults. Specific directional drilling and coring procedures for exploration in-advance of mining are reviewed. Other directional drilling applications include in-mine horizontal gob ventilation boreholes, identification of abandoned workings, and water drainage boreholes. Applications of the techniques described herein have stimulated considerable interest within the underground coal mining community...|$|E
30|$|In {{academic}} circles at present, for goaf closure, researchers mainly {{perform a}} theoretical {{analysis of the}} fissure development of overlying rock strata based on the “three belts” assumption. Furthermore, by identifying drill-hole locations, or through numerical simulation, they directly remake the gas mitigation law and predict drainage effects under the design scheme. Several studies have summarized the continuous “O” circle characteristics of goaf roofs and the variation features in the junction of two adjacent “O” circles. Consequently, the rational design of the height and spacing of drill-hole sites, {{as well as the}} length of drill holes, has been discussed (Zhou and Lin 1999; Zhang and Hou 2008). Li et al. (2004) calculated the goaf flow parameters under tailgate <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> conditions to determine a reasonable drainage flux with a 2 D model. Hu et al. (2007) and Jin and Yao (2010) numerically solved the 3 D methane migration law in goafs, which is in better agreement with that of the 2 D assumption. Wang (2011) carried out a theoretical study on methane flow laws when stereoscopic <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> between short distance coal seam groups was applied; however, how the methane distribution after drainage changed was not examined. Yao et al. (2010) exploited a 3 D numerical simulation of goaf methane distribution under high-level drill-hole conditions, but the configuration of the drill hole in the model was too simple to reflect the true situation.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the ventilation system on the abandoned gob weakens, so the gas seepage characteristics in the abandoned gob are significantly different from those in a normal mining gob. In connection with this, this study physically simulated the movement of overlying rock strata. A spatial distribution function for gob permeability was derived. A numerical model using FLUENT for abandoned gob <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> through surface wells was established, and the derived spatial distribution function for gob permeability was imported into the numerical model. The control range of surface wells, flow patterns and distribution rules for static pressure in the abandoned gob under different well locations were determined using the calculated results from the numerical model...|$|E
40|$|Methane explosions have {{historically}} {{been one of the}} major causes of fatalities and injuries in underground coal mining operations. Advanced numerical models and predictive modeling approaches have the potential to offer optimized methane control solutions for general mine planning purposes and to address specific methane-related operational problems. This paper describes the development of reservoir models for the longwall mining environment and their application for investigating the influence of various completion design parameters on the <b>methane</b> <b>drainage</b> effectiveness of gob gas ventholes. The influence of increasing longwall panel width on the effectiveness of current gob gas venthole completion and placement strategies in the Pittsburgh Coalbed were evaluated and optimized designs developed to capture the expected increase in methane emissions on the larger panel...|$|E
