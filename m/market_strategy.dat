The American ECD was equivalent in the US as the 1975 four-door Hornet DL model.|$|E

The report stated that Israel's most attractive feature for international markets was its religious culture and history and the great diversity it offers within a very small country. According to the researchers, Israel's different cultures and religions, its diverse landscapes, the contrasts between cities (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv), and combination of European, North African and Middle Eastern culture produced a [...] "very high density of experience."

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{although}} {{hedge funds}} {{go to great}} lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward, inevitably a number of risks remain. Systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is [...] "herd" [...] behaviour, which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades. In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their <b>market</b> <b>strategy.</b> [...] The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. [...] The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} was to address the issues {{involved}} in <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation, implementation and company performance by developing a framework for the marketing of insurance services in Jordan. In order to achieve this aim the research developed a comprehensive framework involving three parts; <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation components, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation, and company performance. The research population included all the insurance companies that were operating in the Jordanian market. The research design was mainly quantitative with some qualitative data included to support and expand upon the research findings. The research methodology included designing a comprehensive self-completion questionnaire, as well as, conducting a number of in-depth interviews with managers in the insurance companies in Jordan. The most important finding {{to come out of}} the research was that <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation and implementation are not separate parts, but rather they should be incorporated in one process for a company to achieve success in the marketplace. The classic framework of <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy,</b> which is concerned with the traditional elements of the marketing mix framework, is inadequate for the marketing of insurance services. The <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components for the marketing of insurance services were eight, these are the seven Ps of the services marketing mix framework, and service quality. These elements were found to have a positive and significant effect on the insurance companies' performance measured by financial and non-financial (marketplace and customer) criteria. The effect of the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components was found to have varied according to the insurance companies' performance criteria measured by financial and, non-financial (marketplace and customer based) criteria. The <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables were found to have affected the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies' performance measured by financial and non-financial (marketplace and customer based) criteria. Generally speaking, the effect of <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables on the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by customer based measures was found to be greater than their effect on the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by financial and marketplace performance criteria. Company marketing assets and capabilities, and company marketing experience were found to be the master variables of <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation that moderated the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance, measured by financial and non-financial (marketplace and customer based) criteria. This is evidenced when these two variables have systematically changed all the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies' performance. <b>Marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> consensus, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> resource commitment, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> cross-functional integration, <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> communication activities quality were found to have a higher effect on the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by customer based criteria, rather than the relationships between the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> components and the insurance companies performance measured by financial and marketplace performance criteria. The research found that the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables hold strategic implications for the insurance companies' performance because they affect their performance especially those criteria that deal with the customers e. g., customer satisfaction. The rationale is that the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> implementation variables are concerned with activities that are dealing with the customer on a daily basis.
