40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to produce {{biodiesel}} from methyl esters of groundnut (Arachis hypogea) oil and blend with Petrol diesel. The fuel quality of the biodiesel and its blend (B 10) was assessed and compared with the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards. The groundnut oil was characterized for specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, moisture content, ash content, acid value, free fatty acid, saponification value, iodine value and peroxide value, refractive index and flash point. The biodiesel produced was analyzed for the same parameters including calorific value. The results obtained for the biodiesel showed that while the moisture and ash content were satisfactorily found in trace quantities, the other parameters also had satisfactory results within the specification of 0. 88 (specific gravity), 5. 16 mm 2 sec - 1 (kinematic viscosity), 4. 96 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g - 1 (acid value), 2. 49 % (free fatty acid), 244. 74 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g - 1 (saponification value), 52. 45 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g - 1 (iodine value), 3. 23 mEq kg - 1 (peroxide value), 1. 463 (refractive index), 202 C (flash point) and 39, 114. 29 J g - 1 (calorific value). However, the acid value {{was found to be}} higher than the maximum permissible level of 0. 8 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g - 1. There was obviously very little change in the parameters of the biodiesel when it was blended except for the flash point which was only slightly below the recommended minimum ASTM value of 130 C. This indicates that the biodiesel produced could be blended with petrodiesel (B 10) to give satisfactory fuel with properties not too different from the biodiesel produced...|$|E
40|$|The aim of our {{experiment}} {{was to determine}} the effect of the alfalfa meal component in feed mixtures of Ross broiler chickens on oxidative stability of meat. Proportion of alfalfa meal in feed mixtures was 4 and 6 %. The results were compared to the control group without alfalfa meal in feed mixtures. At the end of the experiment (day 38), 6 pcs of broiler chickens from each group with an average live body weight over 1 800 g were randomly selected. The samples for chemical analysis consisted of identical proportion of breast and thigh muscle, and about 1 cm 2 of skin with subcutaneous fat. Fat from the meat was obtained after the samples drying. A fat was determined by extraction by means of laboratory instrument Det N Gras Selecta P. The oxidative stability of meat on the basis of acid number of fat was determided by chemical analysis. Chicken meat was stored at - 18 °C for 12 months and 18 months. The acid number of fat of stored meat for 12  months was 7. 38 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per g in the control group, 7. 42 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per g in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 11. 18 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per g in the group with proportion 6 % alfalfa meal. An acid number of fat of stored meat for 18 months was 5. 90 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per g in the control group, 4. 65 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per g in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 7. 07 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per g in the group with a proportion of 6 % alfalfa meal. Chicken meat is notably sensitive to lipid oxidation because of its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Legislation in Title 5 of Part 3 of the Codex Alimentarius of the Slovak Republic and the Government Regulation No. 286 / 2003 Coll. in the Annex 4 in Part B provide the requirements for animal fats and meat products. Regulation of the European Parliament and Council (EC) No. 853 / 2004 lays down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. In particular, determination of free fatty acids content of rendered animal fat (tallow, lard, other animal fat). Legislative regulation does not contain requirements for the quality of chicken meat, the acid number of   fat of fresh or frozen chicken meat, respectively. A chicken meat is preferred over other kinds of meat. It is characterized by certain dietary and nutritional properties that consumer prefers. A price of this kind of meat remains attractive. In terms of human health, oxidative stability of chicken meat is important, especially of stored meat. In general terms, the various food additives are currently used to maintain the food stability. Great attention is currently paid to additives of natural origin. Similar focus is presented in our study. We can state, {{on the basis of the}} oxidative stability results of chicken meat, that natural feed component has its justification. This issue requires further research.

Generally, ESI(-) -FT-ICR mass spectra present a power of resolution of ca. 500, 000 and a mass accuracy less than 1 ppm, producing a data matrix containing over 5700 variables per sample. These variables correspond to heteroatom-containing species detected as deprotonated molecules, [M - H](-) ions, which are identified primarily as naphthenic acids, phenols and carbazole analog species. The TAN values for all samples ranged from 0. 06 to 3. 61 <b>mg</b> of <b>KOH</b> g(- 1). To facilitate the spectral interpretation, three methods of variable selection were studied: variable importance in the projection (VIP), interval partial least squares (iPLS) and elimination of uninformative variables (UVE).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Development of {{circular}} economy requires significant {{advances in the}} technologies for valorisation of waste, as waste becomes new feedstock. Food waste is a particularly important feedstock, containing large variation of complex chemical functionality. Although most food waste sources are complex mixtures, waste from food processing, no longer suitable for the human food chain, may also represent relatively clean materials. One such material requiring valorisation is cocoa butter. RESULTS: Epoxidation of a triglyceride from a food waste source, processing waste cocoa butter, into the corresponding triglyceride epoxide was carried out using a modified Ishii-Venturello catalyst in batch and continuous flow reactors. The batch reactor achieved higher yields due to the significant decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the laminar flow tubular reactor. Integral and differential models describing the reaction and the phase transfer kinetics were developed for the epoxidation of cocoa butter and the model parameters were estimated. Ring-opening of the epoxidised cocoa butter was undertaken to provide polyols of varying molecular weight (M_w = 2000 - 84 000 Da), hydroxyl value (27 - 60 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g^- 1) and acid value (1 - 173 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g^- 1), using either aqueous ortho-phosphoric acid (H_ 3 PO_ 4) or boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF_ 3 ·OEt_ 2) -mediated oligomerisation in bulk, using hexane or tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvents. The thermal and tensile properties of the polyurethanes obtained from the reaction of these polyols with 4, 4 '-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) are described. CONCLUSION: The paper presents a complete valorisation scheme for a food manufacturing industry waste stream, starting from the initial chemical transformation, developing a process model {{for the design of}} a scaled-up process, and leading to synthesis of the final product, in this case a polymer. This work describes aspects of optimisation of the conversion route, focusing on clean synthesis and also demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of the development projects, requiring input from different areas of chemistry, process modelling and process design.

40|$|Alcoholysis-polyesterification {{method was}} used in the {{investigation}} of utilization of Ximenia americana seed oil in the formulation of alkyd resins. The extracted oilseed gave an oil yield of 45. 7 % (w/w) and the physicochemical characterization indicated it is semi-drying in nature with iodine value of 152. 3 g I 2 100 g - 1. The fatty acid analysis of the oil carried out earlier revealed oleic and linolenic as dominant fatty acids, having values of 72. 1 and 10. 3 % respectively. Four grades of alkyds were formulated at 40 % (I), 50 % (II), 60 % (III) and 70 % (IV) oil lengths. The reaction progression was followed by determining the acid value of the aliquots for the reaction mixture at various time intervals beside the volume of water evolved. Kinetic studies showed that the reaction was second-order with values of 3. 12 x 10 - 4, 2. 44 x 10 - 4, 2. 3 x 10 - 4 and 2. 28 x 10 - 4 g (<b>mg</b> <b>KOH)</b> - 1 min - 1 for samples I, II, III and IV respectively. The extent of reaction (% P av) determined at the initial stage of reaction ranged from 63. 3 to 78. 6 %, indicating an appreciable degree of conversion. The corresponding average degree of polymerization (D p) ranged from 2. 7 to 4. 7 and this indicated the formation of high molecular weight alkyd.

40|$|BACKGROUNDBased on the {{biorefinery}} concept, {{the main}} focus of this work was the increase in value of spent coffee grounds via an acid liquefaction process using polyhydric solvents in the presence of sulfuric acid, at moderate temperature. For that purpose the effect of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration and time on biomass conversion was studied using design of experiments combined with statistical analysis. RESULTSThe ANOVA results (95 % confidence level) showed that temperature is the factor with most influence on biomass conversion, within the studied range, while reaction times above 40 min don't seem to bring significant advantages. The maximum conversion obtained in this study was 70 wt% which was achieved at 160 degrees C, 4 wt % of catalyst and 80 min.
