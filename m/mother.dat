5|$|In April 2003, a Japanese {{television}} advertisement {{revealed that}} both <b>Mother</b> 3 and a combined <b>Mother</b> 1+2 cartridge were in {{development for the}} handheld Game Boy Advance. <b>Mother</b> 3 abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D, but kept its plot. It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release {{on the basis that}} it would not sell. Around <b>Mother</b> 3 2006 release, Itoi stated that he had no plans to make <b>Mother</b> 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as <b>Mother</b> 1, <b>Mother</b> 1+2 and <b>Mother</b> 3 were not released outside Japan.

5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's <b>Mother</b> India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that <b>Mother</b> India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of <b>mother,</b> God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the <b>Mother</b> India figure is an icon in several respectsâ€”being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E
5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, <b>Mother</b> 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for <b>Mother</b> 1+2, a port of <b>Mother</b> and <b>Mother</b> 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to <b>Mother</b> 2. The game's themes included human physiology, renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. <b>Mother</b> 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} suggests that day-to-day problems with child care produce significant costs for low-income <b>mothers.</b> But the relevance of daily child care problems for <b>mothers</b> of all socioeconomic backgrounds has been largely over-looked. This article asks two interrelated questions: What factors shape how often <b>mothers</b> experience child care disruptions? and What factors shape how often care disruptions lead <b>mothers</b> to miss work? Using the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (N = 1, 309), which includes <b>mothers</b> across the socioeconomic spectrum, this research finds that low-income <b>mothers,</b> <b>mothers</b> whose shifts vary, <b>mothers</b> who rely on patchwork care, and <b>mothers</b> with low social support are likely to experience care disruptions. But only <b>mothers</b> with low social support and <b>mothers</b> who use certain types of child care face an ele-vated risk of missing work.

After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good <b>mother.</b> They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's <b>mother.</b> Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day.

40|$|The {{ideology}} of intensive <b>mothering,</b> whereby <b>mother's</b> time is {{thought of as}} crucial for child development, {{continues to be the}} dominant cultural framework in the United States. Yet there is little evidence about how <b>mothers</b> differ in their child care experiences from large representative surveys. We use data from the Well-being Module of the American Time Use Survey to understand emotions in <b>mothering</b> experiences, and how these vary by maternal educational attainment and the type of child care activity <b>mothers</b> engage in. We document that, compared to less-educated <b>mothers,</b> higher educated <b>mothers</b> report lower happiness and meaning, and higher levels of fatigue when engaging in <b>mothering</b> activities. The gap in momentary wellbeing among <b>mothers</b> across the educational distribution does not depend on the type of child care activity and suggests that intensive <b>mothering</b> practices are more likely to pressurize the most-educated women, who may subscribe to more time-intensive forms of <b>mothering...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether the apparent additional and exceptional stresses associated with bearing and parenting twins affect the emotional wellbeing of <b>mothers.</b> SETTING [...] Great Britain, 1970 - 5. DESIGN Cohort study of 13, 135 children born between 4 April and 11 April 1970. <b>Mothers</b> of all children, both singletons and twins, were interviewed by health visitors (providing demographic data) and completed a self report measure of emotional well-being (the Rutter malaise inventory) when the child was 5 years of age. The malaise scores of <b>mothers</b> of twins were {{compared with those of}} all <b>mothers</b> of singletons and then with those of <b>mothers</b> categorised by the age spacing of their children (only one child, widely spaced, or closely spaced), taking account of maternal age, social class, and whether the study child had a disability, by using logistic regression. SUBJECTS 139 <b>mothers</b> of twins [...] 122 pairs of twins and 17 twins whose cotwin had died [...] and 12, 573 controls, who were <b>mothers</b> of singletons. RESULTS A significantly higher proportion of <b>mothers</b> of twins at 5 years had malaise scores indicative of depression than <b>mothers</b> of singletons at the same age. <b>Mothers</b> who had borne twins, one of whom had subsequently died, had the highest malaise scores and were three times more likely than <b>mothers</b> of singletons to experience depression. Both <b>mothers</b> of twin pairs and <b>mothers</b> of singletons closely spaced in age were at significantly higher risk of experiencing depression than <b>mothers</b> of children widely spaced in age or <b>mothers</b> of only one child (p less than 0. 0001). Odds ratios indicated that the risk of depression in <b>mothers</b> of twins was higher than that in <b>mothers</b> of closely spaced singletons. CONCLUSION <b>Mothers</b> of twins are more likely to experience depression. This suggests a relation between the additional and exceptional stresses that twins present and the <b>mother's</b> emotional wellbeing...|$|R

40|$|The acute {{dilemmas}} facing lone <b>mothers</b> {{in raising}} {{their children and}} earning a living form a common theme across the articles in this special issue of Feminist Economics on Lone <b>Mothers.</b> Like other parents, lone <b>mothers</b> face difficult decisions in allocating their time to caregiving and income generation, but in their families {{there is only one}} adult to do both. Further, that one adult is a woman, who will generally earn less than a man, compounding the difficulties. Lone <b>mothers</b> must rely on a range of support mechanisms (fathers, other family members, employers, and government policy) to manage; they can therefore rarely be economically independent.
