5|$|Throughout the 17th century Plymouth had {{gradually}} {{lost its}} pre-eminence as a trading port. By the mid-17th century, commodities manufactured elsewhere in England {{cost too much}} to transport to Plymouth, and the city had no means of processing sugar or tobacco imports, <b>major</b> <b>products</b> from the colonies. It {{played a part in}} the Atlantic slave trade during the early 18th century, although it was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three <b>major</b> <b>products</b> are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The Crow Green tannery was {{situated}} at the south-west end {{of the town and}} was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the <b>major</b> <b>products</b> of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{conditions}} for using NBS in allylic and/or benzylic bromination involves refluxing {{a solution of}} NBS in anhydrous CCl4 with a radical initiator—usually azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) or benzoyl peroxide, irradiation, or both to effect radical initiation. The allylic and benzylic radical intermediates formed during this reaction are more stable than other carbon radicals and the <b>major</b> <b>products</b> are allylic and benzylic bromides. This is also called the Wohl–Ziegler reaction.|$|E

Much of the archaeological evidence of the ancient city of Khotan however had been obliterated due to centuries of treasure hunting by local people.|$|E
