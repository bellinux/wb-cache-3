A {{key element of}} high temperature packaging technology is the Si die attach material, and a comparative study of two die attach systems for use in harsh environment has been performed. Die bond sample packages, using commercial adhesives and an Au-Si eutectic solder, have been manufactured and were subsequently thermally exposed for various times at 250 and 300 °C respectively. The adhesive die bond packages comprised a high temperature co-fired ceramic (HTCC) substrate with W, Ni and Au <b>metallisations</b> whereas the Au-Si die bond packages used thick film Au metallised on a Al₂O₃ substrate. Optimisation of the eutectic die bonding parameters was successfully performed for the Au-Si system by an experimental design method, which improved mean and spread of maximum bonded areas and consequently, the shear load to failure. Bonded area was systematically assessed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) followed by digital image analysis (DIA).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The control of interfacial microstructural stability is of utmost importance to the reliability of liquid solder interconnects in high temperature electronic assemblies. This is primarily due to excessive intermetallic compounds (IMCs) that can form and continuously grow during high temperature operation, which practically renders conventional barrier <b>metallisations</b> inadequate. In this study, electrically conducting, NbOx containing Ni coatings were developed using electrodeposition. Their suitability as a solder diffusion barrier layer was assessed {{in terms of the}} electrical conductivity and barrier property. The present work explores a novel electrochemical route to produce Ni-NbOx composite coatings of good uniformity, compactness and purity, from non-aqueous glycol-based electrolytes consisting of NiCl 2 and NbCl 5 as metal precursors. The effects of cathodic current density and NaBH 4 concentrations on the surface morphology, composition and thickness of the coatings were examined. A combined study of Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM) was conducted to understand the fundamental aspects of this novel electrodeposition process.

40|$|Multi-level masking {{techniques}} are increasingly employed in lithographic schemes, especially when sub-micron size features {{are to be}} defined. The capability to planarise topography before critical exposure steps is essential to successful multi-layer <b>metallisations,</b> whilst the high aspect ratios offered by multi-level masks are advantageous in subsequent etch or deposition processes. A conventional tri-level technique was used here to facilitate mechanistic studies of {{the final stage of}} pattern definition, that of reactive ion etching (RIE) of the bottom-layer, planarising photoresist. The complete layer sequence employed was (from the substrate upwards) : HPR 204 photoresist, approximately 1 mym thick, overbaked to 200 degree C to ensure reflow; sputtered Si sub 3 N sub 4, approximately 100 nm; and PMMA, approximately 300 nm. The PMMA was e-beam exposed with a mixture of feature sizes down to 0, 05 mym and acted as the mask while the pattern was transferred to the silicon nitride layer by RIE with a CF sub 4 -based plasma. The bottom-level photoresist could then be "developed" by oxygen RIE through the nitride mask. A variety of profile in the HPR 204, such as barrelling, proximity effects, micromasking, and sidewall modification, has been observed during pattern definition in the sub-micron range. These call for explanation beyond the normal, but simplistic, contrasts of isotropic neutral etching and anisotropic ion etching. In order to properly study such effects and produce a self-consistent evaluation of their various facets, {{a new version of the}} simulation program ADEPT (Advanced simulation of Dry-Etching Process Technology) was used.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of Aluminium nitride (AlN) ceramics are a high bulk thermal conductivity, insulating resistance, dielectric strength, flexural strength and a coefficient of thermal expansion, which is well matched to semiconductor materials, like silicon carbide. AlN ceramics show high potential as substrate materials for thick film- / hybrid {{applications in the}} field of power electronics and multichip modules. These applications require <b>metallisations</b> with high ampacity. Herein, the direct copper bond technology (DBC) is state of the art. Nevertheless, DBC shows several disadvantages in the circuit building process, for instance the etching process for patterning the foil, what limits the structure resolution on the one hand. On the other hand, this subtractive process is expensive along with a high chemicals consumption. The use of copper thick film pastes (thick print copper-TPC) instead of DBC results in higher structure resolutions, is an easier industrial applicable, energy-saving and environmentally friendlier process [Gun 16]. Due to the fact that copper thick films have to be fired in nitrogen atmosphere and the actual bottlenecks in copper production, what might rise the copper price [Wie 17], thick print silver (TPS) seems to be a promising alternative to TPC. Moreover, the conductivity of silver is slightly higher than those of copper and silver can be fired in air. The aim {{of this study is to}} get insight the silver films sinter kinetics and the interface formation on AlN. Therefore, systematic variations in the paste recipe where done and the resulting film shrinkage, blister behaviour, solderability and adhesion strength where correlated with the sintering kinetics and the microstructure of the films. A significant role in this process play the inorganic components bismuth oxide and the glass. This is because of the ability of bismuth oxide solution in the glass matrix, what shifts the softening down to lower temperatures. The influence of the glass and bismuth oxide volume fractions on the glass-viscosity, sintering behaviour of silver pastes as well as the interfacial reactions with AlN were investigated by means of thermomechanical analysis, FESEM-cross sections of fired films and XRD. Phase transformation mechanisms and root causes for blister formation are investigated. It was found out that sinter kinetics in combination with the simultaneous glas softening and phase redistribution are crucial for the interface reaction, film adhesion and blistering. Ways to attain evaporation possibilities via controlled sintering retardation of the thick films are examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} and functionality of {{high frequency}} digital and millimetre wave circuits {{can be enhanced}} by the integration of sensor elements into the circuits. It is furthermore advantageous to utilise or modify the pre–existing fabrication process flow in creating this added functionality. This thesis describes a work on magnetic field sensors based on an InP/InGaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) which has been fabricated to be compatible with high frequency epilayer structure and processes. In this work, the complete fabrication process for the HBT magnetic sensors has been developed, using standard, transferrable process modules. Ohmic contact <b>metallisations</b> were optimised and D. C. electrical characterisations are also reported upon. The effects of several surface treatments on device performance have been studied and characterised. Surface passivation using two distinct sulphur containing compounds of different phases was shown to enhance performance and an ion bombardment process was developed that degraded surface quality and increased surface leakage currents for enhanced sensor performance. In order to improve the sensitivity of an HBT to magnetic field 3 –dimensional magnetic structures were designed to be incorporated {{onto the surface of}} the extrinsic base. This design process was informed by simulation of magnetic field profiles of the magnetic elements and fabrication processes were created that would allow for arbitrary 3 –dimensional structures. The response to magnetic field applied both parallel and perpendicular to the normal of the wafer of an as–fabricated HBT was investigated. Two different emitter structures were compared, a simple square emitter and a multiple finger emitter, and the ability of the devices to resolve applied field angle was uncovered. The effects of device bias on the field response was also looked at and the optimal bias conditions determined. An analysis of the temperature variation of the magnetic field response was conducted with lower temperatures resulting in higher sensitivity to applied field. Finally, the response of an HBT with integrated 3 –dimensional magnetic structures was investigated. A passivated device was found to be less sensitive to applied magnetic field and a device treated with ion bombardment to be more sensitive to magnetic field applied parallel to the normal. The signal to noise ratio for an HBT with integrated magnetic structures was 36. 4 dB with an equivalent noise of 0. 002 T. The maximum magnetic field strength sensitivity was 0. 339 T^(− 1) and the maximum magnetic field applied angle sensitivity was 0. 119 rad^(− 1). The maximum change in normalised D.

Finline filters can be made by printing a <b>metallisation</b> pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal.

50|$|Applications such as {{aerospace}} systems, {{life support}} systems, telecommunications, railway signals, and computers use great numbers of individual electronic components. Analysis {{of the statistical}} properties of failures can give guidance in designs to establish a given level of reliability. For example, power-handling ability of a resistor may be greatly derated when applied in high-altitude aircraft to obtain adequate service life.A sudden fail-open fault can cause multiple secondary failures if it is fast and the circuit contains an inductance; this causes large voltage spikes, which may exceed 500 volts. A broken <b>metallisation</b> on a chip may thus cause secondary overvoltage damage. Thermal runaway can cause sudden failures including melting, fire or explosions.|$|E
50|$|Ohmic contact {{degradation}} between <b>metallisation</b> and semiconductor layers. With gallium arsenide, a {{layer of}} gold-germanium alloy (sometimes with nickel) is used to achieve low contact resistance; an ohmic contact is formed by diffusion of germanium, forming a thin, highly n-doped region under the metal facilitating the connection, leaving gold deposited over it. Gallium atoms may migrate through this layer and get scavenged by the gold above, creating a defect-rich gallium-depleted zone under the contact; gold and oxygen then migrate oppositely, resulting in increased resistance of the ohmic contact and depletion of effective doping level. Formation of intermetallic compounds also {{plays a role in}} this failure mode.|$|E
5000|$|Finline {{is similar}} to ridge {{waveguide}} in that the <b>metallisation</b> of the substrate represents the ridge (the [...] "fin") and the finline represents the gap.

A common way of manufacturing these is to take a thin sheet of metal with pieces cut out (typically, a series of rectangular holes) and insert this in the waveguide {{in much the same way}} as finline. However, a finline filter is able to implement patterns of arbitrary complexity whereas the metal insert filter is limited by the need for mechanical support and integrity.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{abrasive}} {{effect of}} the creping blade {{the surface of the}} yankee becomes irregular and rough. Therefore periodically (with very varying frequency: from every 6 months to some years)cast iron yankees have to be ground or polished. This decreases the thickness of the shell, and since the yankee is a pressure vessel, also the maximum pressure which can be used for paper production. A way to avoid this declassing of pressure is to make a <b>metallisation,</b> i.e. to spray onto the surface a special Chrom-Nickel alloy, similar to a high allyed stainless steel, which is then ground with the foreseen crown of the shell surface, leaving a coated thickness of ca. 0,7-1 mm. The metallised surface is then much more resistant to the abrasion and only a very mild polishing may be necessary ca. every 2 to 4 years.The thermal conductivity of the <b>metallisation</b> is a bit less than that of the original material, so that cast iron cylinders are metallised after some grindings of the shell, in order to gain thorugh thickness decrease some conductivity which is then again lost with the <b>metallisation.</b> Steel yankees are instead always metallised since the beginning. The big dimension generates a problem with the elimination of the condensate forming inside the cylinders, therefore all yankees use a system with blow through steam which than it is re-compressed by help of a thermocompressor (ejector). In the inner surface of the yankee circular grooves are present which accommodate small pipes (s.c. [...] "straw pipes" [...] or [...] "straws") through which the mixture of steam and condensate is sucked ba means of a pressure difference between the yankee and the tank collecting the condensate (separator). The straws are combined in racks and these go to typically 6 collectors which take the condensate-steam mixture towards the center of the cylinder from which then it is taken out into usual piping and brought to the separator. Here the condensate and the blow through steam separate at a lower pressure than that inside the yankee.In order not to spoil the blow through steam, a thermocompressor uses motive steam (at a pressure ca. the double of that in the yankee) in order to increase again the pressure of the blow through steam to the value of the yankee.|$|E
5000|$|Thus if shading is to {{be avoided}} the {{f-number}} of the microlens must be smaller than the f-number of the taking lens by at least a factor equal to the linear fill factor of the pixel. The f-number of the microlens is determined ultimately by {{the width of the}} pixel and its height above the silicon, which determines its focal length. In turn, this is determined by the height of the <b>metallisation</b> layers, also known as the 'stack height'. For a given stack height, the f-number of the microlenses will increase as pixel size reduces, and thus the objective lens f-number at which shading occurs will tend to increase. This effect has been observed in practice, as recorded in the DxOmark article 'F-stop blues' ...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} pixel counts smaller sensors will tend to have smaller pixels, {{while at the same}} time smaller objective lens f-numbers are required to maximise the amount of light projected on the sensor. To combat the effect discussed above, smaller format pixels include engineering design features to allow the reduction in f-number of their microlenses. These may include simplified pixel designs which require less <b>metallisation,</b> 'light pipes' built within the pixel to bring its apparent surface closer to the microlens and 'back side illumination' in which the wafer is thinned to expose the rear of the photodetectors and the microlens layer is placed directly on that surface, rather than the front side with its wiring layers. The relative effectiveness of these stratagems is discussed by Aptina in some detail.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of interest include the thickness and mechanical strength required of the substrate. In some formats, such as suspended stripline and finline, it is advantageous {{to make the}} substrate as thin as possible. Delicate semiconductor components mounted on a flexing substrate can become damaged. A hard, rigid material such as quartz might be chosen as the substrate to avoid this problem, rather than an easier to machine board. In other formats, such as homogeneous stripline, it can be much thicker. For printed antennae, that are conformal to the device shape, flexible, hence very thin, substrates are required. Thickness required for electrical performance depends on the permittivity of the material. Surface finish is an issue; some roughness {{may be required to}} ensure adhesion of the <b>metallisation,</b> but too much causes conductor losses. Thermal properties can be important. Thermal expansion changes the electrical {{properties of}} lines and can break plated through holes.|$|E
5000|$|A via fence {{consists}} of a row of via holes, that is, holes that pass through the substrate and are metallised on the inside to connect to pads {{on the top and}} bottom of the substrate. In a stripline format both {{the top and bottom of}} the dielectric sheet are covered with a metal ground plane so any via holes are automatically grounded at both ends. In other planar formats such as microstrip there is a ground plane only at the bottom of the substrate. In these formats it is the usual practice to connect the top pads of the via fence with a metal track (see figure 2). This still does not completely fence off the field as can be done in stripline. In stripline the field can only propagate between the ground planes, but in microstrip it is able to leak over the top of the via fence. Nevertheless, connecting the top pads improves isolation by 6-10 dB. [...] In some technologies it is more convenient to form the fence from conducting posts rather than vias.Isolation can be further improved by placing a metal wall on top of the via fence. These walls commonly form part of the device enclosure. The large holes in the via fences seen in figures 1 and 5 are screw holes for clamping these walls in place. The wall casting belonging to this circuit is shown in figure 3.The design of the fence needs to consider the size and spacing of the vias. Ideally, vias should act as short circuits, but they are not ideal and a via equivalent circuit can be modelled as a shunt inductance. Sometimes, a more complex model is required such as the equivalent circuit shown in figure 4. L1 is due to the inductance of the pads and C is the capacitance between them. R and L2 are, respectively, the resistance and inductance of the via hole <b>metallisation.</b> Resonances must be considered, in particular the parallel resonance of C and L2 will allow electromagnetic waves to pass at the resonant frequency. This resonance needs to be placed outside the operating frequencies of the equipment concerned. Spacing of the fences needs to be small in comparison to a wavelength (λ) in the substrate dielectric so as to make the fence appear solid to impinging waves. If too large, waves will be able to pass through the gaps. A common rule of thumb is to make the spacing less than λ/20 at the maximum operating frequency.|$|E
