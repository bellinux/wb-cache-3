Witherspoon was drawn to the part of Tammy Metzler, the cynical outcast who becomes the election's dark horse presidential candidate. Referring to the scene in which Tammy delivers a shocking campaign speech denouncing the school's administration and the entire concept of elected student government, Witherspoon said, [...] "That speech alone <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play Tammy!

Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said [...] "Thankfully, the show moves far away from the health-class ideal that anorexia and bulimia simply stem from self-conscious teens.

The display of the disease was truthful and progressive, while the acting was at an all time high... Miriam McDonald's performance was phenomenal. [...] performs with strength and credibility." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun criticized the episodes' [...] "ham-fisted handling of anorexia" [...] and wrote: [...] "It’s just that, well, the Degrassi foray, while well-intentioned, leaves you hungry for a fresh insight, some relevant information, a compelling storyline, good writing, believable dialogue, anything."

The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth."

[...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Like the Toy Story films, Cars is a state-of-the-computer-art plea on behalf of outmoded, wholesome fifties technology, {{with a dash of}} Zen by way of George Lucas." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Cars <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders.

[...] However, he expressed disappointment in {{the end of the second}} season, which he deemed surprisingly less strong, compared to the [...] "powerful" [...] first half and the [...] "immaculate" [...] first season, describing Stevens' [...] "awkward and self-destructive" [...] relationship with a patient as a way to [...] "slow episodes to a screeching halt with maudlin and painfully underdeveloped turns towards melodrama", while expressing the predictability of Duquette's death.

I had too often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives me pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn't even mention Mrs. Saltram and the children. Late into the night we smoked and talked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see that I was conscious of what I owed him. He was as mild as contrition and as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and even better at forgiving than at being forgiven. I dare say it was a smaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the problematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy's initiation; but I was as much in it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.

Listen. In my younger days--it seems long now, yet it's not so many years--I was wild. I wronged the sweetest and loveliest girl I ever knew. I went away not dreaming that any disgrace might come to her. Along about that time I fell into terrible moods--I changed--I learned I really loved her. Then came a letter I should have gotten months before. It told of her trouble--importuned me to hurry to save her. Half frantic with shame and fear, I got a marriage certificate and rushed back to her town. She was gone--had been gone for weeks, and her disgrace was known. Friends warned me to keep out of reach of her father. I trailed her--found her. I married her. But too late!... She would not live with me.

The general task seemed straightforward: Show control over behavior by relevant environmental variables, and the alleged inner causes are no longer needed. The experimental psycholo-gist should establish functional relations and then order them into a broader system to develop generality beyond the individual facts and functions (e. g., Skinner, 1947).

It drew me in, especially the scene with Saitō’s Gatotsu pose. It sent chills down my spine! I thought Emi Takei playing Kamiya Kaoru was really cute and Yu Aoi playing Takani Megumi was also fantastic, and in the film parts I felt I didn’t explain well enough in the manga were improved.

40|$|The {{past five}} years have shaped my life {{in more ways than}} I could have ever imagined. I {{enrolled}} in graduate school, got married, had a daughter, and am now at the finish line of my doctorate studies. First and foremost, I thank God for providing me with the opportunity to pursue a Ph. D. and for blessing me with the capability and resources to accomplish this feat.

My daughter, Sakinah, is the peace and tranquility of my heart and fills my life with joy and happiness. I am a content and happy man because of her and Nashiah. My siblings have also been instrumental in making it possible for me to pursue and complete my Ph. D. and for that I will forever be grateful to them. When I first visited University of Minnesota, my brief meeting with my advisor, Tim, <b>made</b> <b>me</b> realize I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> come to Minnesota and work in his group. He is a great advisor, a terrific scientist, a wonderful person, and a great intellectual thinker. I have learned a great deal about scientific research from him and truly appreciate his mentorship. I thank him for giving me an opportunity to work under his guidance...|$|R
