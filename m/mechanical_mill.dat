50|$|A sawmill or lumber mill is a {{facility}} where logs are cut into lumber. Before {{the invention of}} the sawmill, boards were made in various manual ways, either rived (split) and planed, hewn, or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known <b>mechanical</b> <b>mill</b> is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.|$|E

In this first report on this novel <b>mechanical</b> <b>mill,</b> several variables, including the milling time and powder charge and their effects on the microstructural evolution of powder particles, are monitored and studied. The study reveals that the dominant parameters of the milling process are the milling time and the starting powder charge, similar to the other high-energy ball-milling processes. The longer the milling time and the smaller the starting powder charge, the more homogeneous the mixing and the finer the microstructure of the powder particles.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{conventional}} recycling method, {{metal chips}} are cast after pressing and melting in electric arc furnace.

Direct recycling method which produces the aluminium powder from aluminium chips using <b>mechanical</b> <b>mill</b> can be an alternative to conventional recycling method.

In this study, the particle morphology of powder direct recycled from AA 6013 aluminium alloy chips with cryogenic, disc and ball type grinders is investigated. Mechanical milling resulted flaky and irregular shaped AA 6013 particles. It was ascertained that the chips did not break sufficiently in despite of the long duration milling mechanisms by ball mill.

30|$|In Van Gogh’s time, mass-produced machine-ground paints {{were already}} available, like {{those from the}} firm of LeFranc&cie [55]. On the other hand, paints were still hand-ground and {{prepared}} in small colorman shops that received their powdered pigments from manufacturers [30]. Among these merchants were Julien Tanguy and probably Tasset et L’Hôte who were Van Goghs main suppliers from his Arles period onwards [12]. The way of grinding has both {{an impact on the}} consistency and thus handling properties, {{as well as on the}} brightness of the paint [55, 56]. Machine-ground paints were considered too fine, which would result in a loss of substantial consistency and reduced brilliance [57]. This latest effect is due to the fact that with decreasing pigment size the reflection (scattering) of light increases, which might result in a less saturated paint color. In addition, since finely ground pigments need more binding medium, the color of the paint is more affected by the yellowing of the oil as well. Also Van Gogh was aware of the effects of pigment particle sizes and ordered coarser ground paints in order to have paints that were “both fresher and longer-lasting”. 12 In our project we had access to a small mechanical grinding glass mill as well as several glass slabs and mullers for grinding by hand. Both methods were explored and it was decided to use the glass slabs and the glass mullers on muscle power because this was probably the method mainly used by Van Gogh’s suppliers. Furthermore, this method had the advantage that larger amounts of paint could be made at once than in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>mill</b> that was to our disposal. Above that the grinding process could be better monitored and adjusted if needed when ground by hand. We did not have the possibility to compare the particle sizes of the reconstruction pigments with those used by Van Gogh, but it might be expected that nowadays pigment particle sizes are somewhat smaller than in the late 19 th century. The extent to which this affects the color of the reconstruction paints is unclear; a recent study by Gueli et al. revealed that grinding of pigments, including cobalt blue and viridian green, to sizes ranging from 0 to 75  µm, does not induce changes detectable by the human eye neither in terms of hue nor in terms of color saturation [58].|$|E

The demands for miniaturising, increasing the efficiency and lowering the cost of such devices drives a search for stronger magnets, that is, to improve the maximum energy product value. This thesis investigates two magnetic systems: Fe-B-Nd and Mn-Bi. To {{lower the cost of}} the first magnetic system: Fe-B-Nd, an approach to simplify and understand the manufacturing process was investigated by developing a physically based precipitation model coupling the competing nucleation and growth of six phases (bcc-Fe, Fe₃B, Nd₂Fe 1 ₁₄B, Nd₂Fe₂₃B₃, NdFe₄B₄ and Fe₂B). The model monitored the nucleation, growth and dissolution of the precipitates at all times and temperatures. It explained the change in the crystallisation sequence as a function of heating-rates observed for the composition Fe₇₇. ₅B₁₈Nd₄. ₅ {{as a consequence of the}} heterogeneous nucleation of the Nd₂Fe₁₄B phase at the Fe₃B interface. In addition, the model indicated that the metastable Nd₂Fe₂₃B₃ phase (magnetically unfavourable), once formed, does not dissolve back into the amorphous matrix. This is consistent with the experimental in-situ crystallisation sequences which were found to be the same as the reported experimental ex-situ crystallisation sequences. In the second magnetic system, Mn-Bi, the effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> on the magnetic properties of Low Temperature (LT) MnBi was investigated in order to increase the efficiency of the magnet. First, <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> of LT MnBi powder from 0. 6 ks to 43. 2 ks showed an increase in coercivity and suppression in the spin reorientation temperature. The current investigation suggests that the magnetic hardening as a result of <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> is due primarily to the reduction in grain size and a minor contribution from the suppression in spin reorientation temperature. Secondly, nanocomposite LT MnBi/Fe magnets were developed using <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> through the addition of Fe by fragmentation of the stainless steel vials and Fe-rich milling medium to LT MnBi. The microstructure (i. e. MnBi particles surrounded by Fe particles at the nanoscale) was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy images. These magnets exhibit a saturation magnetisation higher than undoped LT MnBi magnets due to the presence of Fe. Thus, this is another avenue to enhance maximum energy product. Lastly, the effect of B, C and Bi additions on the magnetic properties of LT MnBi was investigated by <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> these elements at different concentrations. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> of C or Bi to LT MnBi resulted in a similar observation, an increase in coercivity and a decrease in saturation magnetisation. An increase in coercivity is probably due to (i) the segregation of C or Bi at the grain boundaries and (ii) grain refinement. In contrast, <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> B to LT MnBi resulted in no obvious change in coercivity and a decrease in saturation magnetisation. The reduction in saturation magnetisation is possibly due to the formation of new phases...|$|R
