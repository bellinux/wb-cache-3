25|$|While {{the name}} bikini {{was applied to}} the skimpy fashion that first {{revealed}} the wearer's navel, the fashion industry considers any two-piece swimsuit a bikini. Modern bikini fashions today are characterized by a simple, brief design: two triangles of fabric that form a bra and cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom forming a panty cut below the navel that cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The amount of coverage can vary widely, from a string bikini with very little coverage to a full design with <b>maximum</b> <b>coverage.</b> A topless swimsuit may still be considered a bikini, although naturally it is no longer a two-piece swimsuit.|$|E

2500|$|Though he held Christian beliefs, and {{attended}} the same parliamentary prayer group as hard-right factional power-broker David Clarke, {{he was always}} aligned with the party's moderate faction. This allegiance began threatening his career as early as 2005, only two years into his term, when reports emerged that the hard-right was engaging in branch stacking in Hawkesbury {{as a prelude to}} a possible preselection challenge. Several months later, {{in the wake of the}} resignation of moderate Opposition Leader John Brogden (politician), Pringle was one of a number of MPs who reportedly had their preselection threatened if they did not vote for the hard-right's preferred candidate, Peter Debnam, as Brogden's replacement, a campaign which ultimately sparked the withdrawal of Debnam's only opponent Barry O'Farrel from the race. A State Electorate boundary redistribution altered the balance between moderate and right branches. [...] The tensions from the previous year were confirmed when, on 2 September 2006, Australian politician Ray Williams, a Baulkham Hills Shire Councillor backed by the hard-right faction, challenged Pringle. This came in the wake of reports that numbers in one branch in Pringle's electorate had swelled from 17 to 500 (with none actually living in the suburb) due to an influx of Lebanese Australian members, and public allegations by Howard Crawford, party president for the nearby electoral district of Londonderry that a campaign of [...] "branch-stacking, malpractice and political promises" [...] was being used to undermine Pringle. Reports also emerged during the campaign that Williams had claimed that he could secure a $100,000 donation to the party from a property development company if he were elected, which later sparked controversy and an enforced veto of the move from party leader Peter Debnam. Pringle was endorsed by Debnam to remain as a member of parliament. Although Debnam's intervention had saved numerous sitting members under attack over the previous year, it was not enough to save Pringle, who was defeated by Williams on 15 October. It was subsequently reported that Pringle had obtained approximately 50% of the local branch vote in spite of the branch stacking, but had been soundly defeated by the votes of the hard right-dominated state council and state executive. Pringle responded to news of his preselection defeat by declaring [...] "betrayal and disgust" [...] at what had occurred, labeling Debnam either [...] "lying or impotent". He resigned from the Liberal Party during Question Time in Parliament on 17 October, announcing his intention to serve out his term as an independent, and recontest his seat as an independent. The government used its numbers to suspend standing orders so Pringle could speak at a time of <b>maximum</b> <b>coverage,</b> and in an explosive attack [...] Pringle criticized Clarke, Debnam and the Liberal Party, claiming that the party was being controlled by [...] "an exclusive sect" [...] referring to Clarke's membership of Opus Dei [...] labelling Clarke [...] "the Godfather", and calling the preselection [...] "an absolute rort". He further accused the party of being preoccupied with issues such as homosexuality and drug injecting rooms, instead of the real issues of health, transport, education an the environment and claimed that it [...] "does not deserve to govern".|$|E
