5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower maintenance costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the <b>mechanical</b> systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer <b>mechanical</b> systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.|$|E
5|$|Any <b>mechanical</b> {{component}} will unavoidably possess both {{mass and}} stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence <b>mechanical</b> components are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a <b>mechanical</b> implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1865 Selfe gave regular classes in <b>mechanical</b> drawing to tradesmen at the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts in Pitt Street.

5|$|Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and <b>mechanical</b> compass vehicles, {{there were}} other {{impressive}} devices of <b>mechanical</b> engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for <b>mechanical</b> revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty, they came to prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of the revolving book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} <b>mechanical</b> {{calculator}} in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational <b>mechanical</b> calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional <b>mechanical</b> calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5000|$|The Dartmouth Rude <b>Mechanicals</b> (TDRM) is {{a highly}} {{competitive}} student-run Shakespeare company that focuses on communal casting, directing, production and acting among its members. Founded in the Fall of 2008, the Rude <b>Mechanicals</b> produce one Shakespeare play per term in minimalist fashion using the First Folio, no set, and costumes mostly garnered from members' closets. The Rude Mechanicals' productions have included such favorites as Twelfth Night, As You Like It, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest, Much Ado About Nothing, Hamlet, Cymbeline, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. In 2010, the Council on Student Organizations (COSO) presented the Rude <b>Mechanicals</b> with the award for [...] "Best New Student Organization."

5|$|Early {{designs in}} the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a {{resonator}} material. This {{has given way}} to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the Q since this is often the primary appeal of <b>mechanical</b> filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for <b>mechanical</b> filter resonators and their Q are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|Edward Norton, around 1930, {{designed}} a <b>mechanical</b> filter {{for use on}} phonograph recorders and players. Norton designed the filter in the electrical domain and then used the correspondence of <b>mechanical</b> quantities to electrical quantities to realise the filter using <b>mechanical</b> components. Mass corresponds to inductance, stiffness to elastance and damping to resistance. The filter was designed to have a maximally flat frequency response.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of Han-era <b>mechanical</b> {{engineering}} comes {{largely from}} the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in <b>mechanical</b> engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.|$|E
5|$|In modern designs it {{is common}} to use quartz crystal filters, {{especially}} for narrowband filtering applications. The signal exists as a <b>mechanical</b> acoustic wave while it is in the crystal and is converted by transducers between the electrical and <b>mechanical</b> domains at the terminals of the crystal.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with <b>mechanical</b> resonators. <b>Mechanical</b> resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue <b>mechanical</b> filters using <b>mechanical</b> components which filter <b>mechanical</b> vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of <b>mechanical</b> quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding to the energy in inductors, capacitors and resistors respectively.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the <b>mechanical</b> properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These <b>mechanical</b> properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer <b>mechanical</b> properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer <b>mechanical</b> properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
