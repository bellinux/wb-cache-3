40|$|We study a {{model with}} product {{differentiation}} by <b>manufacturers</b> <b>and</b> spatial differentiation by supermarkets where the customers visit only one shop and the supermarkets carry both goods.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{marketing}} and production strategy of own brand products requires an understanding of both the benefits gained by retailers <b>and</b> <b>manufacturers</b> involved in this activity and also {{the effects of this}} strategy on the relationship between these companies. According to this idea, a qualitative and descriptive work was conducted, based on six case studies, three of them on large product <b>manufacturers</b> <b>and</b> three on large retailers. The aim of this study is defined is threefold: (1) to analyze the expectations of <b>manufacturers</b> <b>and</b> retailers with their own brands’ current operations, (2) to analyze the expectations of <b>manufacturers</b> <b>and</b> retailers with their own brands’ future operations, and (3) to analyze the influence of the own brands adoption on the relationship between <b>manufacturers</b> <b>and</b> retailers. The results indicate that (a) current operations are primarily based on economic reasons (market share, and use of spare capacity), (b) future operations are perceived from a marketing perspective (survival), and (c) the adoption of own brand strategy does not harm the relationship between the parties – both <b>manufacturers</b> <b>and</b> retailers –, unlike the earlier studies indicated...|$|R

5|$|For {{many years}} in his {{parliamentary}} career Disraeli hoped to forge a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the Reform Act 1867, the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with John Bright, a Lancashire <b>manufacturer</b> <b>and</b> leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade Bright to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, Bright refused.|$|E

5|$|Howe was {{determined}} to support technologically advanced industries, and saw no reason why Canada should not continue to produce aircraft after the war. His Director-General for Aircraft Production, Ralph Bell, disagreed with him, noting that Canada had no aircraft engine <b>manufacturer,</b> <b>and</b> that {{despite the presence of}} manufacturing plants and skilled workers, there was no guarantee that they could sell their products. Nevertheless, Howe took steps to keep aircraft manufacturers in business, allowing the British Hawker Siddeley Group to take over Victory Aircraft as A.V. Roe Canada (Avro Canada), while Canadair was sold to the US-based Electric Boat Company (later General Dynamics).|$|E
