50|$|The {{breeding}} season of <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasants</b> lasts from March to June. <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasants</b> build their nests mainly with dead branches, fallen leaves, dry grass and feathers in tree holes or depressions under rocks. Females usually lay three to eight creamy-coloured eggs {{at one time}} and it is they who are solely responsible for the incubation of the eggs (which take about 26-28 days to hatch) and the nurture of fledglings, once they are born. The young are usually independent by six months the latest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> is {{endemic to}} mountainous regions of Taiwan. The species {{occupies}} dense shrubs, bamboo growth and grassy terrain with conifer overstory {{in central and}} southern Taiwan, from 2000 to 3200 meters above sea level.|$|E
50|$|In the 2007 National Bird Voting Campaign {{held by the}} Taiwan International Birding Association, {{there were}} over 1 million votes cast from 53 countries. The Taiwan blue magpie {{defeated}} the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> in the vote, but the vote was not formally accepted.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} rare animal species in Taiwan {{that are found}} no where else or {{otherwise}} in less numbers. Of particular note are: the Swinhoe Pheasant and the <b>Mikado</b> <b>Pheasant,</b> which are almost extinct in nearby regions. The Formosan rock macaque, a species of monkey, is found only in Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, China Airlines {{announced}} that the Airbus A350-900 fleet will have a naming theme that combines endemic birds and unique features of Taiwan. The first two A350s were named as <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> and Taiwan blue magpie by the airline. The names of the remaining 12 aircraft were selected by the Taiwanese public online from a total of 24 choices.|$|E
50|$|The Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area in Heping District, Taichung, {{contains}} {{a section of}} Dasyueshan, consisting of several shorter peaks, with Siaosyueshan (Little Snow Mountain) being the tallest at 2997m. Formerly a logging area, many of the affected areas have been reforested {{and it has become}} a popular scenic destination and birdwatching spot. Bird species seen here include the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant,</b> Swinhoe's pheasant, and Taiwan partridge.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mikado</b> <b>{{pheasant}}</b> (Syrmaticus mikado) is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of {{the order}} Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. Sometimes considered an unofficial national bird of Taiwan (along with the Swinhoe's pheasant and Taiwan blue magpie), a pair of Mikado pheasants and Yushan National Park, {{one of the areas}} it is known to inhabit, is depicted in the 1000 dollar bill of the Taiwanese dollar.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} Mikado {{pheasants}} bred in captivity, {{but there are}} only about 10,000 individuals in the wild, particularly in the Yushan National Park. Heavy hunting pressure was a problem in the past, but is not a serious threat today. The <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
50|$|Swinhoe's {{pheasant}} (Lophura swinhoii), {{also known}} as the Taiwan blue pheasant, is a bird of the pheasant subfamily in the fowl family Phasianidae. It is endemic to Taiwan. Along with the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> and Taiwan blue magpie, two other Taiwan endemics, the Swinhoe's pheasant is sometimes considered an unofficial national symbol for Taiwan as it bears the colours of the national flag (red, white and blue).|$|E
5000|$|Goodfellow’s best-known ornithological {{achievement}} was the scientific {{discovery of the}} <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> in the central mountain ranges of Taiwan and its introduction to aviculture. In about 1906 he secured the type specimen, comprising two long black tail feathers obtained {{from one of his}} porters who was wearing them in a head-dress. [...] On a later visit to Taiwan he obtained eleven live birds, eight males and three females, which were taken to Britain and bred successfully in captivity.|$|E
5000|$|The obverse of the {{banknote}} features {{four children}} studying around a globe, symbolizing education. It is nicknamed 小朋友, [...] "little children" [...] (literally young kids) {{by the general}} public. The reverse of the banknote features the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> and Jade Mountain.First introduced on July 3, 2000, the banknote {{was found to have}} contained several factual discrepancies that was subject to criticism. The globe that the children were surrounding appears to be a mirror image, possibly resulting from an invert error. The background shows a 45 degree angle labeled as 60 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The male Swinhoe's {{pheasant}} {{can grow}} up to 79 cm. He has a glossy blue-purple chest, belly and rump, white nape, red wattles, white tail feathers, and a white crest. The female is brown marked with yellow arrow-shaped spots and complex barring patterns, and has maroon outer rectrices. The juvenile male is dark blue with brown and yellow patterns on its wings. Swinhoe's pheasants can also be distinguished from the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> by having red legs.During display, the male's wattles become engorged and he performs a display consisting of a hop followed by running {{in a circle around}} females. A frontal display with the tail fanned is occasionally observed. He also does a wing-whirring display like other Lophura pheasants.|$|E
50|$|This {{pheasant}} {{has a small}} {{population in}} a limited range which is shrinking due to habitat degradation. Logging is a problem. It was hunted {{in the past and}} some populations were extirpated in the 1960s and 1970s. Today its global population is estimated to be over 10,000 individuals. Some populations are secure within protected areas, but others may be declining. Alongside the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> and Taiwan magpie, they are sometimes unofficially considered national symbols of Taiwan, which has helped in their conservation and protection. In some areas such as Dasyueshan National Forest Recreation Area, they are regularly sighted feeding along roadsides which have become birdwatching hotspots. Often they are fed by bird photographers, which has considered a controversial practice by some conservationists and liable to a fine by park officials.|$|E
50|$|The tragopans (Tragopan), <b>mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Syrmaticus mikado), {{and several}} species of grouse and {{ptarmigan}} are exceptional in their largely vegetarian and arboreal foraging habitats; grouse are especially notable {{for being able to}} feed on plants rich in terpenes and quinones - such as sagebrush or conifers -, which are often avoided by other herbivores. Many species of moderate altitudes—for example the long-tailed pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus—also find a great deal of their daily nutritional requirements in the tree canopies, especially during the snowy and rainy periods when foraging on the ground is dangerous and less than fruitful for a variety of reasons. Although members of the genus Syrmaticus are capable of subsisting almost entirely on vegetarian materials for months at a time, this is not true for many of the subtropical genera. For example, the great argus (Argusianus argus) and crested argus may do most of their foraging during rainy months in the canopy of the jungle, as well. There they are known to forage on slugs, snails, ants, and amphibians to the exclusion of plant material. How they forage in the forest canopy during the rainy months is unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. Hume's pheasant (S. humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the <b>Mikado</b> <b>pheasant</b> (S. mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic Elliot's pheasant (S. ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|E
