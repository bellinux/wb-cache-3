50|$|The {{ostensible}} trilogy {{began its}} expansion {{to cover the}} entire European theater when the developers published a game on the German 1940 invasion of Norway, Narvik, in 1974. They then started working on a game to cover Germanys unplanned 1941 Balkans campaign to overthrow the governments of Yugoslavia and Greece, which some believe delayed the onset of Operation Barbarossa by several weeks and {{may have contributed to}} its failure. The game was finally published in 1979 as Marita-Merkur, named after German operations Marita and Merkur carried out during that campaign. However, it was published as a stand-alone game; by this time the Europa concept of covering the entire European theater had evolved, and the plan called for publishing a series of stand-alone games that provided Europa material, but concentrated on a single campaign and left most of the link-up issues to be addressed by future publications. The series also grew to cover such topics as the Spanish Civil War, which, though not strictly part of World War II, helped with the <b>map</b> <b>coverage</b> and provided a basis for what-if scenarios, had the various campaigns and battles of World War II gone differently in the games than the historical outcome.|$|E

5000|$|Often <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> show general <b>coverage</b> {{for large}} regions and {{therefore}} any boundary indicated {{should not be}} interpreted as a rigid limit.

A <b>coverage</b> <b>map</b> may be produced to indicate the area in which a certain signal strength is delivered. Even if it is 100% accurate (which it never is), a major factor on whether a signal is receivable depends very much on whether the receiving apparatus is sensitive enough to use a signal of that level. Commercial receivers can vary widely in their sensitivity, thus perception of coverage can vary widely.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Exploration and mapping {{belongs to}} the {{fundamental}} tasks of mobile robots. In the past, many approaches have used occupancy grid maps to represent the environment during the map building process. Occupancy grids, however, {{are based on the}} assumption that each cell is either occupied or free. In this paper we introduce <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> as an alternative way of representing the environment of a robot. <b>Coverage</b> <b>maps</b> store for each cell of a given grid a posterior about the amount the corresponding cell is covered by an obstacle. We also present a model that allows us to update <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> upon input obtained from proximity sensors. We furthermore describe how to use <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> for a decision theoretic approach to exploration. Finally we present experimental results illustrating that <b>coverage</b> <b>maps</b> can be used to efficiently learn highly accurate models even if noisy sensors such as ultrasounds are used.

40|$|Many genomes {{have been}} sequenced to {{high-quality}} draft status using Sanger capillary electrophoresis and/or newer short-read sequence data and whole genome assembly techniques. However, {{even the best}} draft genomes contain gaps and other imperfections due to limitations in the input data and the techniques used to build draft assemblies. Sequencing biases, repetitive genomic features, genomic polymorphism, and other complicating factors all come together to make some regions difficult or impossible to assemble. Traditionally, draft genomes were upgraded to "phase 3 finished" status using time-consuming and expensive Sanger-based manual finishing processes. For more facile assembly and automated finishing of draft genomes, we present here an automated approach to finishing using long-reads from the Pacific Biosciences RS (PacBio) platform. Our algorithm and associated software tool, PBJelly, (publicly available at [URL] automates the finishing process using long sequence reads in a reference-guided assembly process. PBJelly also provides "lift-over" co-ordinate tables to easily port existing annotations to the upgraded assembly. Using PBJelly and long PacBio reads, we upgraded the draft genome sequences of a simulated Drosophila melanogaster, the version 2 draft Drosophila pseudoobscura, an assembly of the Assemblathon 2. 0 budgerigar dataset, and a preliminary assembly of the Sooty mangabey. With 24 × <b>mapped</b> <b>coverage</b> of PacBio long-reads, we addressed 99 % of gaps {{and were able to}} close 69 % and improve 12 % of all gaps in D. pseudoobscura. With 4 × <b>mapped</b> <b>coverage</b> of PacBio long-reads we saw reads address 63 % of gaps in our budgerigar assembly, of which 32 % were closed and 63 % improved. With 6. 8 × <b>mapped</b> <b>coverage</b> of mangabey PacBio long-reads we addressed 97 % of gaps and closed 66 % of addressed gaps and improved 19 %. The accuracy of gap closure was validated by comparison to Sanger sequencing on gaps from the original D. pseudoobscura draft assembly and shown to be dependent on initial reference quality...|$|R
