40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at extracting {{cellulose}} and nanocelluloses (cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibres (CNFs)) from <b>maize</b> <b>stalks</b> and flax fibres. Both flax fibres and <b>maize</b> <b>stalks</b> are composed of cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and extractives. The extraction of cellulose involves the removal of lignin, hemicellulose and extractives. The presence of these components in plant fibres hinders the extraction of cellulose and nanocelluloses. Prior to extraction of cellulose, the different concentrations (1 wt. %, 1. 5 wt. % and 2 wt. %) of NaOH were optimised. However, chemical compositions and XRD results revealed that the treatment of flax fibres with 1. 5 wt. % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gives optimum results and this concentration was further selected for the extraction of cellulose. Cellulose was extracted by chemical treatments (sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) and potassium hydroxide (KOH)) and a combination of chemical treatments and mechanical process (supermass colloider). The materials obtained after each treatment stage during the extraction process were characterised by different characterisation techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results from the aforementioned characterisation techniques confirmed that cellulose was successfully extracted from flax fibres and <b>maize</b> <b>stalks.</b> Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were extracted by sulphuric acid hydrolysis accompanied with ultra-sonication from cellulose obtained from flax fibres and <b>maize</b> <b>stalks.</b> The extracted CNCs were rod-like material with diameters and lengths in nanoscale and microscale, respectively. On the other hand, cellulose nanofibres (CNFs) were extracted by mechanical process (supermass colloider). The extracted CNFs were web-like material with diameters and lengths in nanoscale and microscale, respectively. The dimensions of nanocelluloses were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Their dispersion was investigated by light polarised microscopy. The extracted nanocelluloses and cellulose were used to produce nanopapers and micropaper. Nanopapers mimic the traditional paper, the only difference of the nanopapers {{is that they are}} produced from high aspect ratio nanomaterials. Both nanopapers and micropapers were prepared by solvent evaporating method. Their thermal, optical and mechanical properties were investigated and compared. The mechanical and thermal properties of nanopapers produced from CNFs were better than those produced from CNCs and micropapers. On the other hand, nanopapers produced from CNCs were more transparent in comparison to nanopapers produced from CNFs and micropapers. Cellulosic fibres have attracted a considerable attention in composite materials due to their high tensile strength and tensile modulus. This study is focused on the development of biocomposites of polyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) by in-situ polymerisation in the presence of acid catalyst (p-toluene sulphonic acid). Biocomposites were produced by reinforcing PFA with flax fibres (untreated and treated), nanoparticles and CNCs. The biocomposites reinforced with CNCs and flax fibres showed an improvement in mechanical, thermal and thermo-mechanical properties.

The fibre was characterised using FTIR showing a spectrum with a well defined peak at 1742 cm- 1 (attributed to the carbonyl groups –C=O), indicating that new acetyl groups were introduced to cellulose. The curing and physico–mechanical properties of the composite as a function of filler loading was determined and compared with the values obtained using commercial grade hydrated silica. The natural rubber-maize stalk filled composites showed good processing safety in terms of torques and scorch. Compared with untreated maize-natural rubber composites, the acetylated composites exhibited higher mechanical properties, reduced moisture absorption and higher resistant to hydrothermal aging. Based on mechanical properties and statistical treatment of data, composites filled with 20 phr treated <b>maize</b> <b>stalk</b> had the optimum set of mechanical properties (tensile strength of 22. 4 MPa, elongation at break 404 % and hardness Shore A of 55) that were closely comparable with commercial hydrated silica filled composites. <b>Maize</b> <b>stalk</b> has therefore demonstrated its potential to be used to reinforce natural rubber for shoe sole production...|$|E

40|$|The study {{objective}} was to identify blending ratio of T. diversifolia and <b>maize</b> <b>stalks</b> that optimizes compost pile’s heat built-up, precursor to compost maturity. In this study, 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 % of T. diversifolia biomass were blended with <b>maize</b> <b>stalks,</b> and then composted using chimato composting technology. Temperatures were measured to determine heat built-up. TKN, nitrate-N and C/N ratios were determined using standard methods. Results showed high and more prolonged peak temperatures in compost piles with T. diversifolia content of 0 %, 20 % and 40 % implying occurrence of more prolonged decomposition that generated prolonged heat. Resultant composts contained large amounts of non-compost materials (> 37 %) and less dark colour indicating high level of immaturity. High but less prolonged peak temperatures were observed in compost piles with 50 % and 60 % T. diversifolia suggesting shortened active and rapid microbial activities that generated less heat. Their composts were very dark in colour and yielded least amounts of non-compost materials (< 17 %) which indicated high level of maturity.

40|$|The mesophyllic fungus Trichoderma reesei (anamorph to Hypocrea jecorina) is an important biotechnological tool, {{known for}} its ability to secrete large {{quantities}} of hydrolytic enzymes. Renewable biomass, such as agricultural and forest wastes are used to produce microbial enzymes in various industrial processes such as food, feed and bioethanol industries. In raw biomass materials, such as wheat straws, barley straws and <b>maize</b> <b>stalks,</b> the main polysaccharide is cellulose which is closely associated with hemicelluloses like xylan, manan and xyloguclan. In consequence, the hydrolysis of these materials requires the concerted action of several enzymes, namely cellulases and xylanases. Endo-xylanase (endo- 1, 4 [...] xylanase, EC 3. 2. 1. 8) is the key enzyme involved in xylan hydrolysis, the main hemicellulosic component of plant cell walls. The metabolic activity and enzyme productivity of Trichoderma reesei is influenced by various environmental conditions. In this context, we analysed the effect of pH, cultivation period, the nature of the substrate used and the nitrogen source on enzymatic activity. The maximum xylanase yield was recorded at a initial pH of 4 (116. 189 IU/ml) for barley and 5 for wheat (88. 578 IU/ml), respectively maize (116. 583 IU/ml). The best substrate for endo-xylanase activity was <b>maize</b> <b>stalks</b> (90. 446 IU/ml) at a a concentration of 30 g/L. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pink ear rot {{of maize}} caused by Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium graminearum {{can lead to}} severe yield losses and {{contamination}} of grain {{with a range of}} mycotoxins. <b>Maize</b> <b>stalks</b> colonized by Fusarium spp. are the main primary inoculum source for Fusarium incited epidemics in maize or other susceptible crops grown in rotation. The colonization of individual <b>maize</b> <b>stalks</b> originating from fields in The Netherlands, Italy and Nigeria by Fusarium spp. was quantified using specific TaqMan-PCR assays. Highest values were found for F. graminearum and Fusarium avenaceum in Dutch samples, for F. graminearum and FUM producing species (F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum) in Italian samples and FUM producing Fusarium spp. in Nigerian samples. The increase in Fusarium spp. colonization under field conditions during a period of 3 – 6 months after harvest of the maize crops varied considerably between individual stalks. The fungal and bacterial diversity was analyzed for sub-sets of stalks with high versus low increase of Fusarium colonization. Bacterial taxonomic groups such as Bacillus, Curtobacterium, Erwinia, Flavobacterium, Novosphingobium, Pantoea, Sphingomonas, Rahnella and Staphylococcus and fungal taxonomic groups such as Acremomium sp., Cryptococcus flavescens, Cryptococcus zeae, Leptosphaeria sp. and Microdochium bolleyi were more abundant in the stalks with lower increase in pathogen colonization. Such fungal and bacterial groups associated with ‘suppressive stalks’ may be antagonistic to Fusarium spp. and a source of candidate strains for the selection of new biological control agents.
