5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a key to his room. Dwight scratches off the <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E
5|$|Fares are AR$7.50 per {{trip on the}} Subte, {{though these}} can be as low as AR$4.50 per trip {{depending}} on how many trips are made per month, while the Premetro has a flat rate of AR$1.50. While tokens {{have been used in}} the past, at present, riders use contactless cards called SUBE, which are rechargeable with multiple forms of payment. Previously, single or multi-use paper cards with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> (called Subtepass) were used, however, these were phased out of the system in May 2016, opting instead only to use the digital cards, with the exception of some retired, disabled and student cards. Trains run from 05:00 until 23:00, every 3–4minutes, for all lines except Line H which has a frequency of around 6minutes. Under modernisation plans commenced in 2013, service frequencies are set to increase to an average of one train every 2:20 by 2019.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip,</b> to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic card {{readers were}} among the first {{persistent}} memory options available.

25|$|Metcard was {{the brand}} name of an {{integrated}} ticketing system used to access public transport in Melbourne, Australia. It was a universal ticket which allowd users to ride on the city's Metlink network, consisting of suburban trains, trams, and buses, including the NightRider network. The Metcard was a credit card-sized ticket made out of cardboard and used a <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> to store fare data. Metcard was operated by OneLink Transit Systems under {{a contract with the}} Government of Victoria which was managed by the Transport Ticketing Authority.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} on August 14, 2013, that bus-issued transfers (<b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> paper cards) {{would continue to}} be issued for cash fares paid on buses, but that these transfers would not work at SkyTrain or SeaBus station fare gates, which require the Compass Card. This means that a bus rider paying cash is required to pay a second fare to transfer to SkyTrain or SeaBus. Those transit users paying cash but beginning their trips at a SkyTrain or SeaBus station are not subject to this second fare because they are issued paper-based Compass Tickets which are accepted as valid transfers on TransLink buses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> plastic {{tickets were}} used, in various forms. Stored-value tickets were called farecards {{and came in}} three types: the blue farecard was issued to adults, the magenta farecard to senior citizens, and the red farecard to children. Single-trip forms of these tickets were {{retained}} at the faregates on exiting the paid area of a destination station. Monthly discounted tickets were available in four values: beige, pink, and purple tickets for primary and tertiary students, and full-time national servicemen came with a value of S$13, S$30 and S$36, respectively; the peach ticket was for secondary, pre-university and VITB students, costing S$17 each. These discounted tickets were valid for a month from the date of purchase, allowed up to four trips a day, and were non-transferable.|$|E

25|$|On November 14, 2006, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, a fourth-year University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) student, was drive stunned {{multiple}} {{times with a}} Taser by campus police, for allegedly refusing to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. The police had been called after Tabatabainejad had refused to provide his BruinCard (student ID) to a UCLA Community Service Officer (aka student volunteer). Tabatabainejad felt he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity. A UCLA ID card with <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> is needed {{to enter into the}} Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|Point of sale {{systems that}} accept payment from mobile phones or smart cards are vulnerable. Induction coils can be hidden on these systems to record {{financial}} transactions from smart cards or mobile phone payments. With keys extracted, a malicious attacker could forge his own card or make fraudulent charges {{with the private}} key. Belgarric et al. propose a scenario where mobile payments are performed with bitcoin transactions. Since the Android implementation of the bitcoin client uses ECDSA, the signing key can be extracted {{at the point of}} sale.

2500|$|Almodóvar {{bought his}} first camera, a Super-8, {{with his first}} paycheck from Telefónica when he was 22 years old, and began to make {{hand-held}} short films. Around 1974, {{he made his first}} short film, {{and by the end of}} the 1970s they were shown in Madrid's night circuit and in Barcelona. These shorts had overtly sexual narratives and no soundtrack: Dos putas, o, Historia de amor que termina en boda (Two Whores, or, A Love Story that Ends in Marriage) in 1974; La caída de Sodoma (The Fall of Sodom) in 1975; Homenaje (Homage) in 1976; La estrella (The Star) in 1977; Sexo Va: Sexo viene (Sex Comes and Goes); and Complementos (Shorts) in 1978, his first film in 16mm. He remembers, [...] "I showed them in bars, at parties… I could not add a soundtrack because it was very difficult. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> was very poor, very thin. I remember that I became very famous in Madrid because, as the films had no sound, I took a cassette with music while I personally did the voices of all the characters, songs and dialogues".|$|E
50|$|The {{reasoning}} behind {{moving from}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> to smartchip technology was down {{to the fact that}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>strip</b> could be cloned and the data written onto a dummy card.
