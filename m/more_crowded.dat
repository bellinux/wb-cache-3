5|$|London {{had been}} a Roman {{settlement}} for four centuries and had become progressively <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> inside its defensive city wall. It had also pushed outwards beyond the wall into squalid extramural slums such as Shoreditch, Holborn, and Southwark, and had reached far enough to include the independent City of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Paris grew in {{population}} from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. A new boulevard, the Champs-Élysées, extended the city west to Étoile, while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine {{on the eastern}} site of the city grew more and <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.|$|E
5|$|From the 11th century, newly {{incorporated}} {{features were}} either {{based on the}} traditional dravida plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at Pattadakal, or were further elaborations of this articulation. The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> decoration, {{as can be seen}} in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.|$|E

5|$|Auschwitz was {{considered}} a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to its many amenities and the abundance of slave labor. Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred Jehovah's Witnesses for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior. Höss lived {{with his wife and}} children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew <b>more</b> <b>crowded,</b> Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.|$|E
5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes <b>more</b> <b>crowded,</b> it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E

5000|$|This {{match was}} played at Pod Goricom Stadium in Titograd instead of at Partizan's home ground in Belgrade since UEFA barred Partizan again from playing home matches within a 300 km radius {{of their home}} ground after <b>more</b> <b>crowd</b> trouble in the {{previous}} round's home tie against Groningen.|$|R
5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the National Park Service {{estimated}} 400,000 {{people attended}} the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., the official count for the event. The organizers {{said more than}} a million people turned out, and they threatened to sue the Park Service unless it revised its estimate. Congress, in response, barred the agency from producing any <b>more</b> <b>crowd</b> estimates.|$|R
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{frequent}} {{use by the}} elementary school, the city also uses KPAC. Professionals and other traveling groups have graced the auditorium, usually drawing <b>more</b> <b>crowds</b> than locally sponsored programs, though both types' audience turn-outs don't always depend on the performer(s). Paris city schools (grades pre-school through eighth) have free in-school music programs that use KPAC for general music, strings, and band concerts.|$|R
50|$|News {{that the}} relic would be exposed soon reached the community, {{and a large}} crowd showed up for evening services. When a young man having an epileptic fit was touched by it, his convulsions ceased. That {{apparent}} miracle was widely reported and even <b>more</b> <b>crowds</b> showed up, many expecting cures. The pastor asked Marquis {{to stay for a}} few more days with the relic to satisfy the many pilgrims.|$|R
5|$|Lou coerces Nina into a {{date and}} threatens {{to end his}} {{business}} with her unless she has sex with him, knowing her job depends on his footage; she reluctantly agrees. The next day he turns down a business offer from Loder, who beats him to an important plane crash story later that night. Nina berates Lou to get better footage and keep his end of their bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joe's van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath. Later, Lou and Rick arrive before the police {{at the site of}} a home invasion in an affluent neighborhood. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the victims in the house. The news staff fret over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri (Michael Hyatt) questions Lou about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the home invasion, cutting out the parts with the gunmen. That night, he and Rick track down the gunmen; Lou plans to follow them to a <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Lou's crimes; Lou agrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may start running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly <b>more</b> <b>crowded</b> than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E
50|$|Ships left Guernsey on 26 and 27 September. 825 left, {{including}} {{nine people}} from Sark amongst the deported. Guernsey borrowed two field kitchens from the Germans and cooked the “evacuees” as the Germans referred to them, a meal. The ships departed after curfew. A third batch of 560 left Jersey on 29 September 1942. The Jersey sailing resulted in <b>more</b> <b>crowds,</b> singing {{and yet another}} fight with even more arrests.|$|R
