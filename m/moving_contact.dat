"Armature"-type relays have a {{pivoted lever}} {{supported}} on a hinge or knife-edge pivot, which carries a <b>moving</b> <b>contact.</b> These relays may work on either alternating or direct current, but for alternating current, a shading coil on the pole {{is used to}} maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle. Because the air gap between the fixed coil and the moving armature becomes much smaller when the relay has operated, the current required to maintain the relay closed is {{much smaller than the}} current to first operate it. The [...] "returning ratio" [...] or [...] "differential" [...] is the measure of how much the current must be reduced to reset the relay.|$|E

50|$|Many {{manufacturing}} variations exist, but {{in general}} a vacuum interrupter will have a fixed contact, a <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> a flexible bellows to allow movement of the <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> and arc shields, enclosed in a hermetic glass, ceramic or metal housing that is evacuated to a high vacuum. The <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> is connected by a flexible braid to the external circuit, and is moved by an actuating mechanism when the device is required to open or close. Since air pressure tends to close the contacts, the operating mechanism must hold the contacts open against the inherent closing force of air pressure on the bellows.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{electromagnetic}} relay {{consists of a}} coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts (there are two contacts in the relay pictured). The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked {{to one or more}} sets of <b>moving</b> <b>contacts.</b> The armature is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the <b>moving</b> <b>contacts</b> on the armature, and the circuit track on the printed circuit board (PCB) via the yoke, which is soldered to the PCB.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>moving</b> <b>{{contacts}}</b> {{are held}} {{away from the}} fixed contacts by a phenolic paper pattern called a [...] "card". By changing {{the depth of the}} cuts on this form, the contacts can be made to make or break earlier or later than others. This can be used to transfer electrical control or power from one source to another by having a [...] "make" [...] contact operate before the corresponding [...] "break" [...] contact does.|$|R

50|$|A wire spring relay {{typically}} {{has many}} individual contacts. Each contact {{is either a}} fixed contact, which does not move, or is a <b>moving</b> <b>contact,</b> and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the wire springs. The majority of the wire spring relays manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed contacts. A normally open (make) contact, a normally closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each fixed contact. A <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> consists of two wires projecting out of {{the base of the}} relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature.|$|E
50|$|For dynamic interfaces, the {{boundary}} condition showed above works well if the contact line velocity is low. If the velocity is high, {{the contact angle}} will change ("dynamic contact angle"), and as of 2007 {{the mechanics of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line (or even the validity of the contact angle as a parameter) is not known and an area of active research.|$|E

50|$|During the 1970s {{numerous}} incidents, probably including Project Dark Gene {{occurred on}} the Soviet-Iranian and Afghan-Iranian border, forcing the Soviets to station a regiment of MiG-23s at the Ak-Tepe AB, near the border with Afghanistan, {{in what was then}} the Turkestan Military District. One of the most serious of these occurred in the early morning of 21 June 1978, at 06:21 AM, when a Soviet radar site near the village of Bagir, not far from Ashkabad, detected four slow <b>moving</b> <b>contacts</b> which came from Iran and penetrated 15 to 20 kilometers into the Soviet airspace near Dushak, in Turkmenistan.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{systems with}} <b>moving</b> <b>contacts,</b> as e. g. {{automotive}} vehicles on dirt-roads, friction brakes, {{and of course}} railway vehicles moving on railway tracks, spatially periodic wear patterns may appear on the contact partners’ surfaces. There is general agreement that the patterns are related to structural resonances. Using simple models with a <b>moving</b> point <b>contact</b> and an idealized wear model the present work first reviews some of the present understanding of wear-pattern generation. Then additional intuitively accessible explanations for the phenomena observed are developed {{and the effect of}} randomly specified relative velocities on the wavelength selection process is investigated. For this purpose the stability analysis of the surface evolution equation is pursued with the full, as well as with a reduced system, and a simple linear approach to deal with distributions of relative velocities is introduced. For fixed relative velocity the analysis yields an intuitively accessible picture of wear-pattern appearance or evanescence, as well as of wear-pattern motion. Based on these results it is shown, how dominant wavelengths are selected as a consequence of randomly distributed relative velocities...|$|R

5000|$|Tire {{maintenance}} for {{motor vehicles}} is based on several factors. The chief reason for tire replacement is friction from <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> with road surfaces, causing the tread on the outer perimeter of tires to eventually wear away.

50|$|When current {{passes through}} the electromagnet, a {{magnetic}} field is produced, which attracts the moving core of the contactor. The electromagnet coil draws more current initially, until its inductance increases when the metal core enters the coil. The <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> is propelled by the moving core; the force developed by the electromagnet holds the moving and fixed contacts together. When the contactor coil is de-energized, gravity or a spring returns the electromagnet core to its initial position and opens the contacts.|$|E
50|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{version of}} the switching device includes two stationary contacts and a spring supported <b>moving</b> <b>contact.</b> The spring holds the movable contact {{against one of the}} stationary contacts and an electromagnet pulls the movable contact to the opposite stationary contact. The current in the electromagnet is interrupted by the action of the switch so that the switch continually switches rapidly back and forth. This type of electromechanical inverter switch, called a vibrator or buzzer, was once used in vacuum tube automobile radios. A similar mechanism has been used in door bells, buzzers and tattoo machines.|$|E

40|$|Spreading of aqueous {{surfactant}} solution droplets over hydrophobic substrates proceeds in one slow {{stage at}} concentration of surfactants below some critical value {{and in two}} stages if the surfactant concentration is above the critical value: the fast and relatively short first stage {{is followed by a}} slower second stage. It is shown that the kinetics of a slow spreading at concentrations below the critical value and the second stage at concentrations above the critical value are determined by a transfer of surfactant molecules on a bare hydrophobic substrate in front of the <b>moving</b> three-phase <b>contact</b> line (autophilic phenomenon). The latter process results in an increase of the solid–vapour interfacial tension of the hydrophobic solid surface in front of the <b>moving</b> three-phase <b>contact</b> line and spreading as a result. It is proven that the adsorption of surfactant molecules in front of the <b>moving</b> three-phase <b>contact</b> line results in a decrease of the total free energy of the droplet. Hence, the adsorption of surfactants molecules on a bare hydrophobic substrate in front of the <b>moving</b> three-phase <b>contact</b> line is a spontaneous process in spite of an increase of the local solid–vapour interfacial tension. The duration of the first stage of spreading {{in the case of the}} surfactant concentration above the critical value correlates well with the duration of adsorption of surfactant molecules onto a liquid– vapour interface. The latter allows assuming that the adsorption on the liquid–vapour interface is the driving mechanism of spreading during the first fast stage of spreading at surfactant concentrations above the critical value. It is discussed why the first stage of spreading does not take place in the case of surfactant concentrations below the critical concentration in spite of the longer duration of adsorption on liquid– vapour interface in this case...|$|R

50|$|The no-slip {{condition}} poses {{a problem}} in viscous flow theory at contact lines: places where an interface between two fluids meets a solid boundary. Here, the no-slip boundary condition implies that {{the position of the}} contact line does not move, which is not observed in reality. Analysis of a <b>moving</b> <b>contact</b> line with the no slip condition results in infinite stresses that can't be integrated over. The rate of movement of the contact line is believed to be dependent on the angle the contact line makes with the solid boundary, but the mechanism behind this is not yet fully understood.|$|E

The switch could handle its portion of as many calls as it had levels or verticals. Thus an exchange with forty 10×10 switches in four stages could have a hundred conversations in progress. The link principle was more efficient, but required a more complex control system to find idle links through the switching fabric.|$|E
