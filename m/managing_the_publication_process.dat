40|$|This paper {{provides}} a brief {{account of the}} development of this journal over the last fifty years. Having started in 1962 as a modest outlet for reporting research results in radiochemistry, Radiochimica Acta soon became a respected specialist journal. There has been long-term continuity both in editorial activity and publishing management, resulting in well-defined publishing policies. Starting with the Founding Editors, the Board of Editors was changed only in 1977 and 1996. Similarly the original Publisher, Akademischer Verlag, published the journal until 1983. Since then Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag has been <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process.</b> The journal has been broad-based, encompassing all chemical aspects of nuclear science and technology. It has {{played a significant role in}} the dissemination of new knowledge, occasionally by bringing forth special issues in fast emerging areas. It has kept pace with the changing trends in worldwide radiochemical research. Whereas by about the middle of 1980 s all areas of radiochemistry were equally represented, today the emphasis is more on applied topics, such as chemical behaviour and mobility of actinides and fission products, accelerator-based radiochemistry, medical applications of radioactivity, etc. The number of published scientific contributions to date amounts to about 5100, covering about 30 000 printed pages. The total number of authors is around 7000. The journal follows a strict peer-review system and is supported by a network of about 400 referees. About 200 manuscripts are received per year, out of which 30 - 35 % are rejected. The impact factor (IF) of the journal is almost the highest among the radiochemistry related journals, and the cited half-life (CHL) among the highest of all chemistry and physics oriented journals. In short, today Radiochimica Acta is a well established, internationally recognised periodical. Presently, approximately 50 percent of the published contributions originate from Europe, 25 percent from North- and South America and the remaining 25 percent from Asia, Australia and Africa together. All articles are published in English, and the journal is available to readership both on-line and in printed form...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate whether it is feasible for a UK university to publish its research output itself through an open access library publishing service. It achieves this by undertaking a qualitative study at one institution, Anglia Ruskin University. It identifies the scholarly communication needs of the institution and its academics, and evaluates whether a library publishing service meets these needs. It also assesses the potential level of support for such a service within the university and recommends actions to take. The literature review explores the idea of library publishing and places {{this research}} in a wider context. Given that the policy context in the UK is putting increasing pressure on researchers to publish open access, this dissertation examines whether creating a library publishing service is a good way for an institution to facilitate this. This is a qualitative study consisting of five semi-structured interviews which were transcribed, coded and analysed. The results show mixed support for open access because although researchers support it in principle, they are unwilling to change their practices if they think that doing so might harm their reputation. One of the primary needs that they have from the scholarly communication process is to perform well in the REF. Other needs identified by this research include: being seen by one's peers; having access to an appropriate range and scope of publication outlets; a strong quality control process governed by peer review; and support with <b>managing</b> <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> and post-publication <b>process.</b> A library publishing service can meet these needs {{as long as it is}} designed with them in mind. Existing library publishing services can be used as a guide to best practice. In answer to the aim of the research: creating a library publishing service at Anglia Ruskin University is feasible and could provide a valuable service to the university and its researchers. The question of whether there is sufficient support for such as service among academics at Anglia Ruskin University is still uncertain and requires further research to answer. The recommendations for Anglia Ruskin University are: to create a research support post in the library, to conduct a survey of academic staff to further investigate the level of support for library publishing, and to initiate a journal hosting service...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the state of contemporary publishing, specifically the realms of fanfiction and self-publishing, for the ways in which readership is represented in conjunction with authors and publishers within <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> structure of this process is then compared with Robert Darnton’s communications circuit in order to propose a new model for <b>the</b> <b>publication.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process</b> has a profound impact on the teaching and practice of collection development and reader studies in LIS, the discipline must be aware of any changes to <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Using the case study approach, this research examines the cultural product, Fifty Shades of Grey (FSOG). Evidence included fanfiction and self-published manuscripts, reader reception of these texts, and a timeline of how the texts developed. Findings – Evidence gathered from the case study illustrate a variety of players and infrastructure present in the development and trajectory of FSOG. Throughout the entire development of the cultural product, readers were found to be active agents in <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process</b> promoting strong connections between reader and author.

Much {{has been written about}} the importance of the care in educational contexts (Noddings, 2005). Care refers to “a set of relational processes that foster mutual recognition and realization, growth, development, protection, empowerment, and human community, culture and possibility”—in learning situations (Owens, Ennis, 2005, p. 392). However, little attention has focused on the role that care can play in <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Publications</b> are frequently tied to outcomes such as promotion and tenure with little consideration about how the actual process can contribute to the development of both practitioner and academic authors and their participants.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mathematics {{seems to}} have a special status when {{compared}} to other areas of human knowledge. This special status is linked with the role of proof. Mathematicians often believe that this type of argumentation leaves no room for errors and unclarity. Philosophers of mathematics have differentiated between absolut-ist and fallibilist views on mathematical knowledge, and argued that these views are related to whether one looks at mathematics-in-the-making or finished mathematics. In this paper we {{take a closer look at}} mathe-matical practice, more precisely at <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process</b> in mathematics. We argue that the apparent view that mathematical literature, given the special status of mathematics, is highly reliable is too naive. We will discuss several problems in <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>process</b> that threaten this view, and give several suggestions on how this could be countered...|$|R
