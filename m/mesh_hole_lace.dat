This novel method allows lithography-free fabrication of the SiNW and SiNH arrays with control of the size and distribution.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism of enhanced absorption intensities of vibrational bands of adsorbates on copper <b>meshes</b> with subwavelength <b>holes</b> by measuring and simulating temporal profiles of infrared pulses transmitted through the meshes. As reported previously [Williams et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2003, 107, 11871], the absorption intensities of CH stretching bands of alkanethiolate adsorbed on the mesh increase substantially with decreasing hole size. The enhancements of absorption intensities are associated with temporal delays of infrared pulses transmitted through the mesh. Finite difference time domain calculations reproduce the observed pulse delays {{as a function of}} hole size. These facts indicate that the delays of transmitted pulses are not caused by coupling of infrared radiation to surface plasmon polaritons propagating on the front and rear surfaces of the mesh, but they are caused by the reduction in group velocity owing to coupling to waveguide modes of <b>mesh</b> <b>holes.</b> Consequently, the strong enhancements of the absorption intensities are attributed to adsorbates inside the holes rather than to those on the mesh surfaces that have been proposed previously...|$|R

We have verified that this combination functions properly and have analyzed the CCD structure with sub-pixel resolution. The EPIC MOS CCD has an open electrode structure to improve detection efficiency at low energies. We obtained the distribution of various grades of X-ray events inside the pixel. A horizontally split twopixel event is generated near the channel stop which forms a straight vertical pixel boundary whereas a vertically split two-pixel event is generated where the potential due to the thinned gate structure forms a wavy horizontal pixel boundary. Therefore, the effective pixel shape is not a square but is distorted.
