5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions,</b> a certain variation of the ash type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.|$|E

40|$|This survey {{considered}} {{the impact of}} meteorological parameter on rice yields, poverty reduction, environmental resource sustainability and management. Data were generated {{through the use of}} multiple linear regression and cross-correlations analysis. Other tools include correlograms, histogram, and bar graphs. The correlation variable results indicated that the tonnage of rice yield over the years was a function of <b>meteorological</b> <b>condition</b> in the area. The consequences of continuous variation in <b>meteorological</b> <b>condition</b> were severe reduction and deterioration in annual tonnage of rice yield and environmental resource sustainability. In the light of the above, it then became expedient to promote agro-meteorological advisory services as well as promotion of best practices that are climate change resilient in rice production...|$|R

5|$|Meteorology is a {{relatively}} young science {{and the study of}} tornadoes is newer still. Although researched for about 140 years and intensively for around 60 years, there are still aspects of tornadoes which remain a mystery. Scientists have a fairly good understanding of the development of thunderstorms and mesocyclones, and the <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> conducive to their formation. However, the step from supercell, or other respective formative processes, to tornadogenesis and the prediction of tornadic vs. non-tornadic mesocyclones is not yet well known and is the focus of much research.|$|E

5|$|Further west, Typhoon Sudal {{intensified}} {{quickly as}} it moved through the Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132km/h (82mph) was reported, and 6.34inches of rainfall occurred in a 24‑hour period. High waves of over 5m (18ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes. On nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage tanks. Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141km/h (87mph).|$|E

5|$|The two commanders {{believed}} that training by both airborne troops and aircrews could {{be completed by}} the end of February, when there would be suitable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> for such an operation to take place.

Another problem encountered was the state of training of the unit of airborne troops chosen to raid the installation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event {{was held at the}} Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest {{worldwide}} statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27percent of the world's glider pilots, and the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Haze {{pollution}} {{has become}} a transboundary problem to the South East Asian region, especially Malaysia, Indonesia and their adjacent countries. <b>Meteorological</b> <b>condition,</b> particularly temperature, is severely affected during the haze episode which occurred between 1 August 2005 and 15 August 2005 in Klang Valley, Malaysia. This paper reports {{on the use of}} MM 5 modelling system to predict the hourly temperature distribution during the haze period. Meteorological simulation was conducted to spatially and temporally analyse the temperature distribution during haze episode in Klang Valley. Domain resolution of 27 km, 9 km, 3 km and 1 km (innermost) have been employed for this study. Urban areas in Klang Valley experience higher temperature during the haze episode simulation. Highest daily maximum temperature for each day was recorded during late afternoon. Evaluation of the model performance was also conducted with a measured data through a range of statistical measures. The model tends to under predict the temperature distribution of the simulation period. The paper discusses the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature during the haze episode in Klang Valley and also the model performance in predicting the <b>meteorological</b> <b>condition</b> of the study area...|$|R
40|$|Identifying the {{differences}} in habitat use for sympatric species is important for understanding the species preferences {{and the limits of}} population distribution. We studied {{the differences}} in the habitat use of two understudied sympatric species of Ameiva (A. festiva and A. quadrilineata) in a natural reserve of the Caribbean coast of Coast Rica. Ameiva quadrilineata showed a more restrictive habitat use pattern than A. festiva. A. quadrilineata’s smaller body size {{may be one of the}} factors limiting its habitat range. Both species showed higher density in regenerated forests, while A. quadrilineata was never found in swamp forests. The air temperature and the <b>meteorological</b> <b>condition</b> at the moment of the survey also influenced the occurrence of the A. quadrilineata, while the juveniles of A. festiva were only affected by the <b>meteorological</b> <b>condition.</b> None of the studied variables seemed to affect the occurrence of A. festiva adults. The results of this study can be useful to evaluate possible changes in the species distribution patterns as a consequence of direct (i. e., deforestation) or indirect (i. e., climate change) human activities in the distribution area of these species...|$|R
