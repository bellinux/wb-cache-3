5000|$|In Punjab, Sikh militants {{had stepped}} up their attacks on law {{enforcement}} {{as well as}} civilians, including minority groups. The Punjab had now reached {{a state of emergency}} and Director General of Police, Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, responded by raising Mazhabi Sikhs as [...] "Special Police Officers". This tactic was designed both for community protection and to dull any incentive for Mazhabis to join with the militants, although in fact Mazhabis had often been victims of attacks by those people. Their loyalty was to the government and was never questioned. Mostly unemployed people, they were provided with guns by the state and were literally given a licence to kill. Gill received heavy criticism for the brutality and ruthlessness of his tactics but the Sikh militants were neutralised. A large number of these special police officers were said to have been used during the February 1992 elections. An open season was declared on Sikh terrorists and the police were able to use whatever <b>means</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to achieve victory. Major Sikh militant leaders were targeted, and many did not survive.|$|E

This Act may be cited as the [...] "Subversive Activities Control Act, 1948".NECESSITY FOR LEGISLATIONSec. 2. As a result of evidence adduced before various committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress hereby finds thatâ€”# The system of government known as totalitarian dictatorship is characterized by the existence of a single political party, organized on a dictatorial basis, and by an identity between such party and its policies and the government and governmental policies of the country in which it exists, such identity being so close that the party and the government itself are for all practical purposes indistinguishable.# The establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship in any country results in the ruthless suppression of all opposition to the party in power, the complete subordination of the rights of individuals to the state, the denial of fundamental rights and liberties which are characteristic of a representative form of government, such as freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, and of religious worship, and results in the maintenance of control over the people through fear, terrorism, and brutality.# There exists a world communist movement which, in its origins, its development, and its present practice, is a world-wide revolutionary political movement whose purpose it is, by treachery, deceit, infiltration into other groups of governmental and otherwise), espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and any other <b>means</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> to establish a communist totalitarian dictatorship in all the countries of the world through the medium of a single world-wide communist political organization.# The direction and control of the world communist movement is vested in and exercised by the communist dictatorship of a foreign country.# The communist dictatorship of such foreign country, in exercising such direction and control and in furthering the purposes of the world communist movement, establishes or causes the establishment of, and utilizes, in various countries, political organizations which are acknowledged by such communist dictatorship as being constituent elements of the world communist movement; and such political organizations are not free and independent organizations, but are mere sections of a single world-wide communist organization and are controlled, directed, and subject to the discipline of the communist dictatorship of such foreign country.# The political organizations so established and utilized in various countries, acting under such control, direction, and discipline, endeavor to carry out the objectives of the world communist movement by bringing about the overthrow of existing governments and setting up communist totalitarian dictatorships which will be subservient to the most powerful existing communist totalitarian dictatorship.# In carrying on the activities referred to in paragraph (6), such political organizations in various countries are organized on a secret, conspiratorial basis and operate to a substantial extent through organizations, commonly known as [...] "communist fronts," [...] which in most instances are created and maintained, or used, in such manner as to conceal the facts as to their true character and purposes and their membership. One result of this method of operation is that such political organizations are able to obtain financial and other support from persons who would not extend such support if they knew the true purposes of, and the actual nature of the control and influence exerted upon, such [...] "communist fronts."# Due to the nature and scope of the world communist movement, with the existence of affiliated constituent elements working toward common objectives in various countries of the world, travel of members, representatives, and agents from country to country is essential for purposes of communication and for the carrying on of activities to further the purposes of the movement.# In the United States those individuals who knowingly and willfully participate in the world communist movement, when they so participate, in effect repudiate their allegiance to the United States and in effect transfer their allegiance to the foreign country in which is vested the direction and control of the world communist movement; and, in countries other than the United States, those individuals who knowingly and willfully participate in such communist movement similarly repudiate their allegiance to the countries of which they are nationals in favor of such foreign communist country.# In pursuance of communisms stated objectives, the most powerful existing communist dictatorship has, by the traditional communist methods referred to above, and in accordance with carefully conceived plans, already caused the establishment in numerous foreign countries, against {{the will of the people}} of those countries, of ruthless communist totalitarian dictatorships, and threatens to establish similar dictatorships in still other countries.# The recent successes of communist methods in other countries and the nature and control of the world communist movement itself present a clear and present danger to the security of the United States and to the existence of free American institutions and make it necessary that Congress enact appropriate legislation recognizing the existence of such world-wide conspiracy and designed to prevent it from accomplishing its purpose in the United States.|$|E

50|$|In the Petrashevsky {{circle the}} Speshnev group's push for greater {{activism}} had been provoking conflict with those, led by Petrashevsky himself, who favoured {{a more moderate}} approach. However, Dostoevsky's reading of Belinsky's searingly anti-establishment Letter to Gogol produced a response of universal approval and excitement that transcended the deepening divisions. Filippov and Mombelli made copies of the letter and began distributing them, but {{it was at this}} time that the government decided to act. Unknown to the members, a government agent had been attending the meetings and reporting back to his superiors. On the night of April 22, 1849, approximately sixty members and associates of the circle were arrested. Among the documents found in Speshnev's apartment after his arrest was a prototype 'oath of allegiance', in which the signer would pledge obedience to a central committee and a willingness to be available at any time for whatever violent <b>means</b> were <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> for the success of the cause.|$|R
40|$|In Southeast Asia {{there is}} rising {{expression}} {{of the right to}} be heard to address grievance or to change policy of government in a desired direction. Although this might have been ignored in the past, by repressive <b>means</b> if <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary,</b> it has become increasingly difficult to push back or aside the wave of such views that today find convergence in a marketplace that engages a global constituency of shared ideas facilitated by civil society organizations and, most importantly, by information and communication technology (ICT). There is a distinction that needs to be made between fulfilment of the principles and practices of liberal democracy on the one hand, and activism in the democratic process on the other, the latter comprising at the one end participation in a large marketplace of expression of views and at the other an experience of concentrated new forms of securing support in electoral contest. It must be borne in mind the principles and institutions of liberal democracy could be absent or limited in the political system, and yet there may be animated activity in the digital sphere of a truncated democracy. Such intense activity in the new media could still come to be dominated by the ruling rich and powerful who already control the conventional media. Â© 2010 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In March 1938, {{when the}} eyes of the entire Europe were trained on the events in Austria that culminated with the Anschluss, there was another {{conflict}} on the European continent that bothered the Western powers, and not only. On March 17, 1938 the Polish minister at Tallinn handed to the Lithuanian minister in the capital of Estonia a notification through which Warsaw asked Lithuania to establish immediate diplomatic relations without prior conditions. The Polish government considered this the only way to solve the problems related to the border between the two states without jeopardizing the peace. Lithuania had 48 hours after the delivery of the notification to accept the proposal without any debate or negotiation. Its rejection would have given Warsaw the right to ensure its objectives and interests by any <b>means</b> it <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> Great Britain and France reacted cautiously to this new crisis, hoping for a peaceful solution, {{in order to avoid the}} involvement of the League of Nations or the escalation of the events towards an open conflict between the two states. In its turn, Romania, as an ally of Poland, refrained from a possible involvement or condemnation of Warsawâ€™s actions, a fact for which the Polish diplomats expressed their gratitude. But even if Lithuania conceded and the crisis died out, the Western countries, as well as Romania, had certain anxieties raised by the Polish-Lithuanian crisis which were to come true a year later. Polandâ€™s actions in March 1938 had created a precedent that other powers did not hesitate to follow and the country that, in the end, would lose everything was Poland itself...|$|R
5000|$|The government's {{concerns}} were not without foundation. The aristocrat Nikolay Speshnev, who began attending the Fridays in early 1848, was resolutely {{in favour of}} promoting the socialist cause by any means possible, including terrorism, and sought to form his own secret society within the circle. According to Speshnev, infiltration, propaganda and revolt should be the three methods of illegal action for a secret society. He and Petrashevsky held meetings with charismatic Siberian figure Rafael Chernosvitov to discuss the possibility of co-ordinated armed revolts. Speshnev's associate, the army lieutenant Nikolay Mombelli, initiated a series of conversations promoting the idea of organized infiltration of the bureaucracy to counter government measures. Mombelli suggested that all members should submit their biography and that traitors be executed. Petrashevsky himself, though party to the conversations, consistently urged against the adoption of violent methods. Speshnev therefore continued {{the formation of the}} society without him and succeeded in recruiting a number of talented members, including Dostoevsky. Although no real action was taken by this group, Dostoevsky had no doubt that there was a [...] "conspiracy in intent" [...] that included promoting dissatisfaction with the current order and establishing connections with already discontented groups such as religious dissidents and serfs. Found among Speshnev's papers after his arrest was a prototype 'oath of allegiance', in which the signer would pledge obedience to a central committee and a willingness to be available at any time for whatever violent <b>means</b> were <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> for the success of the cause. This personal secret society of Speshnev's was never discovered by the authorities, but under threat of torture he confessed to the original discussions within the Petrashevsky circle.|$|R
