40|$|The {{provisioning}} {{of quality}} of service by means of statistical multiplexing has been an alluring research idea {{for the last decade}} of teletraffic research. In this paper we question the efficiency of statistical bitrate service which is the standardized representation of this operational mode for ATM networks. Our argument is that the amount of information needed about a traffic source in order to attain a fair multiplexing gain is beyond what is captured in the standard's three [...] parameter traffic descriptor. Keywords Statistical bitrate, variable bitrate, deterministic bitrate, ATM, video, teletraffic 1 INTRODUCTION Statistical multiplexing with quality guarantees is often seen as the prime service offering of asynchronous transfer mode networks that should justify the introduction of ATM in relation to existing deterministically <b>multiplexed</b> <b>telephony</b> networks as well as statistically multiplexed networks without quality guarantees, such as most local area networks and internet pro [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We study a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM) that <b>multiplexes</b> {{streaming}} Packetized <b>Telephony</b> (PT) and/or Video-on-Demand (VoD) traffic. To this end, {{the distribution}} of the amount of work in a discrete-time single-server queueing model with heterogeneous sources and general packet lengths is calculated. Obtaining actual data concerning {{the distribution of}} this quantity is notoriously hard. We outline how the tail distribution can be extracted from the steady-state probability generating function (pgf) through a multiple-pole series expansion...|$|R
