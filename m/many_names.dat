5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first {{specimens}} were described, the blue whale went by <b>many</b> <b>names</b> and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Army Reserve is a {{collective}} name {{given to the}} reserve units of the Australian Army. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, the reserve military force has been known by <b>many</b> <b>names,</b> including the Citizens Forces, the Citizen Military Forces, the Militia and, unofficially, the Australian Military Forces. In 1980, however, the current name—Australian Army Reserve—was officially adopted, and it now consists {{of a number of}} components based around the level of commitment and training obligation that its members are required to meet.|$|E
5|$|The Hanford Site is {{a mostly}} {{decommissioned}} nuclear production complex {{operated by the}} United States federal government on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. The site has been known by <b>many</b> <b>names,</b> including: Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project in Hanford, south-central Washington, the site was home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and in Fat Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan.|$|E

5|$|The gods were {{believed}} to have <b>many</b> <b>names.</b> Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power.|$|E
5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. <b>Many</b> <b>names</b> for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by <b>many</b> <b>names,</b> but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the Salt Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the Salt Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. <b>Many</b> <b>names</b> now have alternative or dual English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea, {{commonly}} known as the scarlet elf cup, scarlet elf cap, or the scarlet cup, is a species of fungus in the family Sarcoscyphaceae of the order Pezizales. The fungus, widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, has been found in Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and Australia. The type species of the genus Sarcoscypha, S.coccinea has been known by <b>many</b> <b>names</b> since its first appearance in the scientific literature in 1772. Phylogenetic analysis shows the species to be most closely related to other Sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores, such as the North Atlantic island species S.macaronesica. Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions, S.coccinea has often been confused with S.occidentalis, S.austriaca, and S.dudleyi.|$|E
5|$|The {{degree to}} which {{any one of these}} forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and <b>many</b> <b>names</b> require more than the allotted space.|$|E

50|$|This street {{numbering}} {{system does not}} hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered Avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered Streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods {{to the east and}} south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered Streets and Avenues. Furthermore, named Streets and Avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east-west, perpendicular to High Street, <b>many</b> <b>named,</b> non-numbered avenues run north-south, parallel to High. The same is true of <b>many</b> <b>named</b> streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north-south, perpendicular to Broad Street, <b>many</b> <b>named,</b> non-numbered streets run east-west, perpendicular to High Street.|$|R
