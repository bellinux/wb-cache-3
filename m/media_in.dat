The tool (MPM 2015) aims at measuring risks for <b>media</b> pluralism <b>in</b> European countries. The implementation was conducted in nineteen EU Member States: Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. The results of the MPM 2015 implementation, jointly analysed {{with the results of}} the MPM 2014 pilot, show the extent and complexity of measuring threats to <b>media</b> pluralism <b>in</b> the EU Member States. More importantly, the findings have highlighted that no EU country is immune from risks that are related to media freedom and pluralism.
