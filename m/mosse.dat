25|$|Some {{days after}} the find was {{revealed}} a local farmer (Karl Andersson) told Albert Sandklef of a legend he had heard as a child. Two old people from Åkulla had told his father {{about a man who}} was recruiting soldiers in the area. He had been killed by the peasants and buried in a bog. He would start haunting late at night, and in order to stop this, poles were struck through his body, whereafter the haunting stopped. As far as the farmer could remember they mentioned Store <b>Mosse,</b> a bog about 10 miles from the find, close to Nackhälle village, though he acknowledged that his memory might fail him as he had grown up in the vicinity of that bog.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} this period can be {{partially}} attributed to actions taken by the university's administration, led by newly installed chancellor Samuel McCormick who took special interest in athletics at the university. Encouraged by university trustee George Hubberd Clapp, the administration more actively engaged in supporting the athletic program during this period {{in order to promote}} the university. A football association was formed, the school's first booster organization, whose largest initial contributor was Andrew W. Mellon. The university also obtained a lease of Exposition Park to give the football team a more stable and permanent home, and its first full season at the park began with the 1904 undefeated team. This undefeated 1904 season was followed by a 10–2 record under <b>Mosse</b> in 1905, as well as six additional winning seasons.|$|E

25|$|Goulding was the {{founding}} Chairperson of the Contemporary Irish Art Society in 1962, along with Gordon Lambert, Cecil King, Stanley <b>Mosse,</b> James White and Michael Scott. The enthusiasm and vision of these founding {{members of the}} society was the catalyst which {{led to the development of}} many important art collections in Ireland.The purpose of the society was to encourage a greater level of patronage of living Irish artists which, at the time, was extremely low. This was mainly achieved by raising funds to purchase artworks by living artists, which were then donated to public collections. The first purchase in 1962 was an important painting by Patrick Scott, donated to the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art. Over the following 12 years the society purchased 37 works for the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, until in 1974, Dublin Corporation started to provide an annual purchasing fund for the gallery.|$|E

5000|$|Natalie Young in The Times {{compared}} it with <b>Mosse's</b> earlier novels Layrinth and Sepulchre {{set in the}} same area: [...] "The Winter Ghosts is a more temperate book than the historical blockbusters preceding it. Its spirit is more contemporary; inquiry rests on the plight of a solitary man {{trying to make sense}} of his grief, and <b>Mosse’s</b> descriptive writing has been scaled back so that what remains on the surface is light and clear...Mosse has made much of her identification with the Cathars, who were brutally hunted down for heresy. Despite her motivation to expose persecution and examine the weight of loss on a generation, the convolutions of historical conflict are kept beneath the surface of a novel about a man and his grief that is readable, affecting and nicely done." ...|$|R

500|$|In 1889 the ‘Constitution of the Empire of Japan’ was promulgated, greatly {{influenced}} by German legal scholars Rudolf von Gneist and Lorenz von Stein, whom the Meiji oligarch and future Prime Minister of Japan Itō Hirobumi (1841–1909) visited in Berlin and Vienna in 1882. At {{the request of the}} German government, Albert <b>Mosse</b> also met with Hirobumi and his group of government officials and scholars and gave a series of lectures on constitutional law, which helped to convince Hirobumi that the Prussian-style monarchical constitution was best-suited for Japan. In 1886 <b>Mosse</b> was invited to Japan on a three-year contract as [...] "hired foreigner" [...] to the Japanese government to assist Hirobumi and Inoue Kowashi in drafting the Meiji Constitution. He later worked on other important legal drafts, international agreements, and contracts and served as a cabinet advisor in the Home Ministry, assisting Prime Minister Yamagata Aritomo in establishing the draft laws and systems for local government. Dozens of Japanese students and military officers also went to Germany in the late 19th century, to study the German military system and receive military training at German army educational facilities and within the ranks of the German, mostly the Prussian army. For example, later famous writer Mori Rintarô (Mori Ōgai), who originally was an army doctor, received tutoring in the German language between 1872 and 1874, which was the primary language for medical education at the time. From 1884 to 1888, Ōgai visited Germany and developed an interest in European literature producing the first translations of the works of Goethe, Schiller, and Gerhart Hauptmann.|$|E
500|$|The prize was {{established}} to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom <b>Mosse</b> believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards, and {{in reaction to the}} all-male shortlist for the 1991 Booker Prize. [...] The winner of the prize receives £30,000, along with a bronze sculpture called the Bessie created by artist Grizel Niven, the sister of actor and writer David Niven. [...] Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June; [...] within days the winner is announced. [...] The winner is selected by a board of [...] "five leading women" [...] each year. [...] In 2005, judges named Andrea Levy's Small Island as the [...] "Orange of Oranges", the best novel of the preceding decade.|$|E

[...] The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of Mitsubishi but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn. [...] Funding from Orange, a UK mobile network operator and Internet service provider, allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female [...] "journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers", including current Honorary Director Kate <b>Mosse.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{three year}} gap in his service record {{possible}} reflects a well-deserved break. His career then resumes in February 1793 as Captain of the HMS Sandwich patrolling the sandbanks of the Thames at Nore.

50|$|One {{of eleven}} children, Michael Kelly {{was born in}} the townland of Killarney, Thomastown, County Kilkenny. After {{attending}} the local national school he was sent, as a boarder, to St. Francis' College, run by the Capuchin Friars at Rochestown in Cork. He left at the age of sixteen and returned to live near the village of Bennettsbridge where he combined farming with a job in <b>Mosse's</b> flour milling company.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mosse's</b> first {{academic}} {{appointment as}} an historian {{was at the}} University of Iowa, where he focused on religion in early modern Europe and published a concise study of the Reformation that became a widely used textbook. In 1955, {{he moved to the}} University of Wisconsin-Madison and began to lecture on modern history. His The Culture of Western Europe: The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, an Introduction (1961), which summarizes these lectures, was also widely adopted as a textbook.|$|R
500|$|With {{the start}} of the Meiji period (1868–1912), many Germans came to work in Japan as advisors to the new {{government}} as so-called [...] "oyatoi gaikokujin" [...] ( [...] , [...] "hired foreigners") and contributed to the modernization of Japan, especially in the fields of medicine (Leopold Mueller, 1824–1894; Julius Scriba, 1848–1905; Erwin Bälz, 1849–1913), law (K. F. Hermann Roesler, 1834–1894; Albert <b>Mosse,</b> 1846–1925) and military affairs (K. W. Jacob Meckel, 1842–1906). Meckel had been invited by Japan's government in 1885 as an advisor to the Japanese general staff and as teacher at the Army War College. He spent three years in Japan, working with influential persons including Katsura Tarō and Kawakami Soroku, thereby decisively contributing to the modernization of the Imperial Japanese Army. Meckel left behind a loyal group of Japanese admirers, who, after his death, had a bronze statue of him erected in front of his former army college in Tokyo. Overall, the Imperial Japanese Army intensively oriented its organization along Prusso-German lines when building a modern fighting force during the 1880s. The French model that had been followed by the late shogunate and the early Meiji government was gradually replaced by the Prussian model under the leadership of officers such as Katsura Taro and Nogi Maresuke.|$|E

50|$|Although {{best known}} for her {{adventure}} and ghost fiction, inspired by real history, <b>Mosse's</b> first two works were non-fiction. Becoming A Mother (in its seventh edition) was published by Virago in 1993, followed in 1995 by The House: Behind the Scenes at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, published by BBC Books to accompany the BBC 2 The House. She then wrote two contemporary novels. Eskimo Kissing, about a young, adopted woman searching for her background, was well received when it was published in 1996. This was followed in 1998 by the biotech thriller, Crucifix Lane.|$|R
5000|$|Emma Lee-Potter in the Daily Express is {{also very}} positive, [...] "Mosse excels at {{transporting}} her readers into another time and another world. You can almost hear the guns and screams of George’s final hours and feel Freddie’s painful realisation at his 21st birthday lunch at Fortnum & Mason that with his brother gone he and his parents are “strangers with nothing to say”. While Freddie’s “cracked heart” and struggle {{to make sense of}} his loss are by far the most touching parts of the book, <b>Mosse’s</b> depiction of life in southern France between the wars is utterly convincing. Not only that, the book itself is a work of art - with stunning illustrations by artist Brian Gallagher and copies of vintage French maps as endpapers." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{upbringing}} attuned him to {{both the}} advantages and the dangers of a humanistic education. His book German Jews Beyond Judaism (1985) describes how the German-Jewish dedication to Bildung, or cultivation, helped Jews to transcend their group identity. But it also argues that during the Weimar Republic, Bildung contributed to a blindness toward the illiberal political realities that later engulfed Jewish families. <b>Mosse's</b> liberalism also informed his supportive but critical stance toward Zionism and the State of Israel. In an essay written {{on the occasion of}} the 100th anniversary of Zionism, he wrote that the early Zionists envisioned a liberal commonwealth based on individualism and solidarity, but a [...] "more aggressive, exclusionary and normative nationalism eventually came to the fore." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, {{interest}} in college football grew both in Pittsburgh and throughout the nation. In 1903, Arthur St. Leger [...] "Texas" [...] <b>Mosse</b> was hired away from the University of Kansas, and brought several of his players with him. Other players were recruited from surrounding Western Pennsylvania colleges, including star half back Joseph H. Thompson. The 1903 season, the first under <b>Mosse,</b> was the university's first winless season at 0–9–1. In perhaps one of the greatest turnarounds in college football history, <b>Mosse</b> led WUP to an undefeated 10–0 season, the school's first, in 1904. The 1904 team surrendered only one touchdown on the way to collectively outscoring opponents 406–5. That season also saw the school's first victory over Penn State, a 22–5 rout, as well as a 53–0 shutout of West Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|Summarizing <b>Mosse's</b> argument, Davies argued that: [...] "The self-serving, materialistic oriental of the Essai {{was really}} an anti-capitalist's {{portrait}} of the money-grubbing French middle class..." [...] while [...] "the sensual, unintelligent and violent negro" [...] that Gobineau portrayed in the Essai was an aristocratic caricature of the French poor. In his writings on the French peasantry, Gobineau characteristically insisted in numerous anecdotes that he claimed were based on personal experience that French farmers were coarse, crude people incapable of learning, indeed of any sort of thinking beyond the most rudimentary level of thought, and as the American critic Michelle Wright wrote, [...] "the peasant may inhabit the land, but they are certainly not part of it…". Wright further noted the very marked similarity between Gobineau's picture of the French peasantry and his view of blacks.|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} research agenda for understanding the process of constructing a sustainable Olympic sports development legacy. The research uses a social constructivist perspective to examine {{the link between the}} 2012 London Olympic Games and sustainable sports development. The first part of the paper provides justification for the study of sport policy processes using a constructivist lens. This is followed by a section which critically unpacks sustainable sports development drawing on <b>Mosse’s</b> (1998) ideas of process-oriented research and Searle’s conceptualisation of the construction of social reality. Searle’s (1995) concepts of the assignment of function, collective intentionality, collective rules, and human capacity to cope with the environment are considered in relation to the events and discourses emerging from the legacy vision(s) associated with the 2012 London Olympic Games. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for engaging in process oriented research and highlights key elements, research questions, and methodological issues. The proposed constructivist approach can be used to inform policy, practice, and research on sustainable Olympic sports development legacy...|$|R
