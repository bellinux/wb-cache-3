50|$|A {{significant}} and real difference {{which is not}} often mentioned {{is the fact that}} acid catalyzed crosslinking technologies are more appropriate to the anodic process. Such crosslinkers are widely used in all types of coating applications. These include such popular and relatively inexpensive crosslinkers such as <b>melamine-formaldehyde,</b> phenol-formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde, and acrylamide-formaldehyde crosslinkers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melamine-formaldehyde</b> resin forms via the {{condensation}} of formaldehyde with melamine to give, under idealized conditions, the hexa-hydroxymethyl derivative.

Linkages between the heterocycles include mono-, di-, and polyethers. The microstructure of the material can be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|Different wet {{strength}} chemicals are in use, like {{wet strength}} resins or neutral sizing agents. Normal wet strength resins are: urea-formaldehyde (UF), <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> (MF) and polyamide-epichlorohydrin (PEA).

50|$|Melamine is {{commonly}} produced from urea, mainly by either catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production, and is soluble in water. Melamine is used combined with formaldehyde to produce melamine resin, a very durable thermosetting plastic, and melamine foam, a polymeric cleaning product. The end products include counter-tops, fabrics, glues and flame retardants.

50|$|Melamine {{is used to}} {{manufacture}} <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> resin, a type of plastic known for its flame-retardant properties and commonly employed in countertops, dry-erase boards, etc. Melamine itself is nitrogen-rich and is sometimes illegally added to food products to increase their apparent protein content. It has also been employed as a non-protein nitrogen, appearing in soy meal, corn gluten meal and cottonseed meal used in cattle feed. Melamine is known to cause renal failure and kidney stones in humans and animals when it reacts with cyanuric acid inside the body. The use of melamine in food production is not approved by WHO or national authorities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melamine-formaldehyde</b> type crosslinkers in {{particular}} are widely used in anodic electrocoatings. These types crosslinkers are relatively inexpensive and provide {{a wide range of}} cure and performance characteristics which allow the coating designer to tailor the product for the desired end use. Coatings formulated with this type of crosslinker can have acceptable UV light resistance. Many of them are relatively low viscosity materials and can act as a reactive plasticizer, replacing some of the organic solvent that otherwise might be necessary. The amount of free formaldehyde, as well as formaldehyde which may be released during the baking process is of concern as these are considered to be hazardous air pollutants.|$|E
50|$|Paint {{spray booths}} for {{vehicles}} are typically 100-300 {{feet in length}} and usually contain many robotic and manual spray zones. The temperature and humidity are rigorously controlled in these systems. As items are painted in these booths, {{a certain amount of}} paint does not contact the article being painted and forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the article. This paint must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint spray booth by exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air {{in such a way that}} the air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a sump basin (sludge pit), usually located below the paint spray booth. In this area, the paint particles are separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the paint particles disposed of as paint sludge. The paint detackifiers commonly added to these systems are either <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> based, based upon acrylic acid chemistry, or chitosan.|$|E
40|$|Processing {{issues and}} the {{electrical}} and mechanical properties of a novel combination of a natural carbonaceous filler, Karelian shungite, and a water soluble thermosetting polymer, <b>melamine-formaldehyde,</b> were investigated. Two types of shungite with different carbon contents were investigated and compared to a commercial carbon black. The larger particle size and chemically more active surface of the shungites compared to carbon black leads to easy handling with little dusting and allows water {{to be used as}} dispersant. Laminates of <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> reinforced with random cellulose fibers and filler were prepared by film stacking. The layered structure results in anisotropic resistivities for the shungites with fairly low in-plane percolation thresholds and a dissipative resistivity above the percolation transition. In comparison, carbon black had a lower percolation threshold and a low isotropic resistivity above the percolation transition. The mechanical properties of the composites were slightly deteriorated by all three fillers, indicating poor interfacial adhesion. The results of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements are interpreted as indicating hydrogen bonding and thus relatively weak adhesion between filler and polymer. Aqueous mixtures of <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> and shungite filler had lower viscosities than corresponding <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> and carbon black filler mixtures...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{functional}} additives {{are widely}} {{spread in the}} production of inorganic dry mixtures. However, their impact on the microstructure of products, generated in the process of hardening of inorganic binders, is understudied. In this context, the goal of the work is the study of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO • 2 H O) crystallization. Super plasticizer based on sulfonated <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> resin, methylcellulose and vinyl acetate, ethylene and vinyl chloride copolymer powder were selected for studies. First, pure calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals were synthesized. Then, synthesized calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals were exposed to the X-ray analysis to determine the nature of influence of polymer additives on the shape and dimensions of crystals. Possible combinations of simple forms of CaSO • 2 H O were identified by the X-ray analysis and the special software.

40|$|A {{combination}} of an alkyd resin with a <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> resin gives a cured enamel film with {{the flexibility of}} the alkyd constituent and the high chemical resistance and hardness of the melamine resin at the same time. The melamine resin is a minor constituent and plays the role of a crosslinking agent. In this paper, alkyd resins of high hydroxyl numbers based on trimethylolpropane, ricinoleic acid and phthalic anhydride were synthesized. Two alkyds having 30 and 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid were formulated by calculation on alkyd constant. Alkyds were characterized by FTIR and by the determination of acid and hydroxyl numbers. Then synthesized alkyds were made into baking enamels by mixing with <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> resins (weight ratio of 70 : 30 based on dried mass). Two types of commercial melamine resins were used: threeisobutoxymethyl <b>melamine-formaldehyde</b> resin (TIMMF) and hexamethoxymethyl melamine resin (HMMMF). Prepared alkyd/melamine resin mixtures were cured in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under non-isothermal mode. Apparent degree of curing as a function of temperature was calculated from the curing enthalpies. Kinetic parameters of curing were calculated using Freeman-Carroll method. TIMMF resin is more reactive with synthesized alkyds than HMMMF resin what was expected. Alkyd resin with 30 wt% of ricinoleic acid is slightly more reactive than alkyd with 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid, probably because it has the high contents of free hydroxyl and acid groups. The gel content, Tg, thermal stability, hardness, elasticity and impact resistance of coated films cured at 150 °C for 60 min were measured. Cured films show good thermal stability since the onset of films thermal degradation determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is observed at the temperatures from 281 to 329 °C. Films based on alkyd 30 are more thermal stable than those from alkyd 40, with the same melamine resin. The type of alkyd resin has no significant effect on the gel content and the hardness of film. Hardness of cured film increases with increasing of Tg. The values of the films elasticity are satisfied for all prepared samples and are independent on the type of alkyd or melamine resin. The impact resistances of coated films are very high...|$|E
