5|$|Pawns are {{the only}} pieces that capture {{differently}} from how they <b>move.</b> <b>A</b> pawn can capture an enemy piece on {{either of the two}} squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).|$|E
50|$|The {{diagrams}} {{show how}} the unpromoted pieces <b>move.</b> <b>As</b> in shogi, a dragon king (promoted rook) <b>moves</b> as <b>a</b> rook and as a king. A dragon horse (promoted bishop) <b>moves</b> as <b>a</b> bishop and king.|$|R
50|$|Unlike xiangqi, all pieces <b>move</b> identically: <b>a</b> piece may <b>move</b> {{only one}} square up, down, left, or right. A piece may never <b>move</b> onto <b>a</b> square {{that is already}} {{occupied}} unless such <b>a</b> <b>move</b> is <b>a</b> legal capture.|$|R
50|$|The killer {{heuristic}} {{attempts to}} produce a cutoff by assuming that <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that produced <b>a</b> cutoff in another branch of the game tree at the same depth is likely {{to produce a}} cutoff in the present position, {{that is to say}} that <b>a</b> <b>move</b> that was <b>a</b> very good <b>move</b> from <b>a</b> different (but possibly similar) position might also be <b>a</b> good <b>move</b> in the present position. By trying the killer move before other <b>moves,</b> <b>a</b> game playing program can often produce an early cutoff, saving itself the effort of considering or even generating all legal <b>moves</b> from <b>a</b> position.|$|R
5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured to allow it {{to take advantage of the}} 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash <b>move,</b> <b>a</b> CRT-style filter, and the option to start the game from any level.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can <b>move</b> <b>a</b> very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Although faster-than-light travel {{has been}} seriously {{considered}} by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the {{enormous amount of}} energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> box {{on top of a}} switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as a}} jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E

Granderson wrote a children's book, All You Can Be: Dream It, Draw It, Become It!, {{which was published in}} August 2009. The book is illustrated by students of the New York City public school system. In February 2010, Granderson represented MLB at a White House function announcing Let's <b>Move!,</b> <b>a</b> childhood anti-obesity effort sponsored by First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama. Granderson donated $5 million to help UIC build a new baseball stadium in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The PP (power points) of <b>a</b> <b>move</b> {{indicate}} {{how many times}} a Pokémon may use that <b>move.</b> <b>As</b> with Accuracy, <b>a</b> powerful <b>move</b> is often offset by having a low amount of PP. Once a Pokémon uses up all the PP for <b>a</b> certain <b>move,</b> {{it can no longer}} use that <b>move.</b> If <b>a</b> Pokémon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to <b>a</b> <b>move</b> called Struggle. However, in the first generation games, the game does not reduce the PP of Pokémon controlled by non-player trainers, enabling those trainers to use powerful <b>moves</b> <b>an</b> abnormal number of times.|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the <b>move,</b> <b>a</b> 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided to disengage from Napoleon and <b>move</b> <b>a</b> significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E

5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along {{with the type of}} cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{mission to}} <b>move</b> <b>a</b> {{metallic}} disc {{from one side}} of an arena to another with a completely autonomous flying robot was seen by many as almost impossible. The college teams continued to improve their entries {{over the next two years}} when the competition saw its first autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing by a team from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Three years later in 1995 a team from Stanford University was able to acquire a single disk and move it {{from one side of}} the arena to the other in a fully autonomous flight—half a decade earlier than some pundits had predicted.|$|E
