5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Escherichia coli secrets many iron-siderophore transports, but produce {{only one}} siderophore—enterobactin. The ferric enterobactin {{receptor}} FepA recognises the catecholate part of ferric enterobactin (FeEnt), and transports {{it across the}} outer membrane from the extracellular space into the periplasm. The binding {{is thought to be}} in two phases, a fast step which recognises FeEnt, and a slower step which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> step in translocation—preparing the complex for translocation. Both steps occur independently of the TonB–ExbB–ExbD complex and the proton motive force it provides.|$|E
