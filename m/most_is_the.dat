5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken me <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} found charges in heraldry, if not the <b>most,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cross, which has developed into, some say, 400 varieties. When the cross does not reach the edges of the field, it becomes a mobile charge. The plain Greek cross (with equal limbs) and Latin cross (with the lower limb extended) are sometimes seen, but more often the tip of each limb is developed into some ornamental shape. The most commonly found crosses in heraldry include the cross botonny, the cross flory, the cross moline, the cross potent, the cross patée or formée, the cross patonce and the cross crosslet.|$|E

Whatever items they brought from those places after trading Oriya goods used to be put up {{for sale in the}} capital (which was then Cuttack). People from all over the state and beyond used to come to Cuttack to buy these items. Bali Jatra is the festival of continuing this ancient tradition.

People from all over Odisha come to the Bali Jatra to buy items, as was the custom back in those days.|$|E

500|$|On 16 November 1797, {{her husband}} succeeded {{to the throne}} of Prussia as King Frederick William III {{after the death of}} his father. Louise wrote to her grandmother, [...] "I am now queen, and what rejoices me <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> hope that now I need no longer count my benefactions so carefully." [...] The couple had to abandon their {{solitude}} at Paretz and begin living under the restraints of a royal court. They began a tour of the country's eastern provinces for two purposes: the king wanted to acquaint himself with their new subjects, and despite the unusualness of a consort accompanying the king further than the capital, Frederick William wanted to introduce the queen as well to their people. Louise was received everywhere with festivities. For the first time in Prussian history, the queen emerged as a celebrated public personality in her own right, as she occupied a much more prominent role than her predecessors. Louise's presence on her husband's eastern journey was a break from the traditional role of the consort– importantly however the queen's power and enduring legacy did not stem from holding a separate court and policy than her husband's, but rather the opposite: she subordinated her formidable intelligence and skill for her husband's sole advantage. She also became a fashion icon, for instance starting a trend by wearing a neckerchief to keep from getting ill.|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster.

[...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me <b>most</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
