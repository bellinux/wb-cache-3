25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the breakup}} of Led Zeppelin in 1980 (following the death of John Bonham), Robert Plant pursued a {{successful}} solo career comprising eleven studio albums, two compilation albums, three video albums, four collaborative albums and 42 singles. He began his solo career with Pictures at Eleven in 1982, followed by 1983's The Principle of Moments. Popular tracks from this period include [...] "Big Log" [...] (a Top 20 hit in 1983), [...] "In the Mood" [...] (1984), [...] "Little by Little" [...] (from 1985's Shaken 'n' Stirred), [...] "Tall Cool One" [...] (a #25 hit off 1988's Now and Zen), Manic Nirvana [...] "Hurting Kind (I've Got <b>My</b> <b>Eyes</b> <b>on</b> You)" [...] (1990), and [...] "I Believe" [...] (from 1993's Fate of Nations), another song written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. In 1984, Plant formed a short-lived all-star group with Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck called the Honeydrippers, who had a #3 hit with a remake of the Phil Phillips' tune, [...] "Sea of Love" [...] and a follow-up hit with a cover of Roy Brown's [...] "Rockin' at Midnight." [...] Although Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period, his tours in 1983 (with drummer Phil Collins) and 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues.|$|E
