40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The aim was {{to study}} the {{incidence}} of cancer among Swedish leather tanners. METHODS [...] A cohort of 2026 subjects who had been employed {{for at least one}} year between 1900 and 1989 in three Swedish leather tanneries, was established. The cancer incidence and mortality patterns were assessed for the periods 1958 - 89 and 1952 - 89 respectively, and cause-specific standardised incidence and mortality ratios (SIRs and SMRs) were calculated. RESULTS [...] A significantly increased incidence of soft tissue sarcomas (SIR 4. 27, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 39 - 9. 97) was found, based on five cases. Excesses, (not statistically significant) was also found for <b>multiple</b> <b>myelomas</b> (SIR 2. 54, 95 % CI 0. 93 - 5. 53), and sinonasal cancer (SIR 3. 77, 95 % CI 0. 46 - 13. 6). CONCLUSIONS [...] The increased incidence of soft tissue sarcomas adds support to previous findings of an excess mortality in this diagnosis among leather tanners. A plausible cause is exposure to chlorophenols, which had occurred in all three plants. The excess of <b>multiple</b> <b>myelomas</b> may also be associated with exposure to chlorophenol. The association between incidence of cancer and specific chemical exposure will be elucidated in a cohort-based case-referent study...|$|R

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{target of}} rapamycin, mTOR, {{is a key}} node in cellular regulation: its dysregulation is important {{in a number of}} disease states, including various cancers.

40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of nonsecretory myeloma in one patient {{is shown to}} be due to a crippling frameshift mutation in the kappa constant region. Most patients (80 %) with multiplemyeloma have a monoclonal immuno-globulin (Ig) detectable in the serum, usually IgG or IgA. About 18 % have only monoclonal light chains detectable in the urine (light-chain <b>multiple</b> <b>myelomas</b> [LCMMs]). Finally, about 2 % do not secrete any immunoglobulin (non-secretory <b>multiple</b> <b>myelomas</b> [NSMMs]). Re-cent analyses of LCMMs have shown that the tumors lack a functional IgH rearrangement, providing a {{molecular basis}} for this condition. 1 There has not been a comprehensive analy-sis of NSMMs, and previous reports have emphasized acquired mutations in the im-munoglobulin light chain variable genes that lead to a block in secretion. 2 - 4 Thus from the information available {{there appears to be a}} fundamental difference in these 2 condi-tions, which otherwise share many features (eg, very high incidence of t(11; 14)). On the one hand, LCMM lacks a functional IgH DNA rearrangement, and hence there is no RNA or protein. On the other hand, NSMM has an IgL DNA rearrangement, RNA, and protein, but suffers from crippling mutations. In this issue, the molecular basis of nonse-cretory myeloma in one patient is shown {{to be due to}} a crippling frameshift mutation in the constant region. Coriu and colleagues show that a 2 -base deletion in codon 187 resulted in the loss of the normal stop codon. There was a loss of 2 cysteine molecules that are necessary for intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds. The authors postulate that the absence of C 194 disrupted the 3 -dimensional features of the molecule and prevented binding with the cysteine in the first heavy-chain C-domain. The misfolded chains were retained within the plasma cell. They show that this results in an abnormal-sized protein that reacts with some but not all anti- antibodies. In contrast to previously described mutations of the vari-able region, this represents a novel mechanism for nonsecretory myeloma...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCD 45 is a transmembrane {{molecule}} with {{phosphatase activity}} expressed in all nucleated haematopoietic cells and {{plays a major}} role in immune cells. It is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that is essential for antigen-receptor-mediated signal transduction by regulating Src family members that initiate TCR signaling.

Cross-linking of the extracellular portion of the CD 45 by monoclonal antibodies and by galectin- 1, can induce apoptosis in T and B cells. Interestingly, this phosphatase has also been involved in nuclear apoptosis induced by mitochondrial perturbing agents. Furthermore, it is involved in apoptosis induced by HIV- 1.

40|$|Normal IgM(-) IgD(+) CD 38 (+) B {{cells and}} IgM(-) IgD(+) <b>multiple</b> <b>myelomas</b> (MM) are {{characterized}} by Cmu deletion, biased Iglambda expression and hypermutated IgV regions. The predominant Iglambda usage has been proposed as resulting from secondary Ig gene rearrangements during extensive clonal expansion in the germinal center environment. Here, four cases of IgDlambda MM were studied {{to address the question}} of light chain receptor revision in a 'single cell' model. Detailed analyses of both IGK and IGL alleles of each case were performed by Southern blotting, (RT-) PCR, and sequencing. The expressed IgV genes were extensively mutated and Cmu deletion was confirmed in two cases. In addition, in the four MM a total of six non-functional deletional IGK rearrangements were identified, which proved to be unmutated.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{antitumor}} efficacy of lidamycin (LDM) against human <b>multiple</b> <b>myelomas</b> (MM). Materials and Methods: Human MM RPMI 8226 cells and the xenograft model in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were used to examine the antitumor activity of LDM. Results: Notably, LDM markedly suppressed the growth of human MM RPMI 8226 xenograft in NOD/SCID mice. In vitro, there was a significant reduction in cell proliferation after treatment with LDM. The overall growth inhibition correlated with the increase of apoptotic cells. The apoptosis-related proteins including caspase- 3, 7, and 9 were activated, and poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase was cleaved. Further investigation revealed that cellular Bcl- 2 and survivin decreased, whereas the level of Bax increased in the LDM-treated cells. Conclusions: LDM is highly effective against the growth of MM xenograft in NOD/SCID mice.
