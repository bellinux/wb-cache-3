5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path to the summit was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all the more so after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway to the summit, none of which came to fruition.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{route and}} mode of {{operation}} was initially the subject of intense debate. The Suisse Occidentale-Simplon proposed a pure adhesion line, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of 4.5%, while the engineer Ernest von Stockalper, who {{was working on the}} construction of the Gotthardbahn, proposed a combined adhesion and rack railway, as originally planned. A Special Commission established to investigate the ideal {{mode of operation}} visited, for the purpose of its investigations, numerous rack railways in Switzerland and Germany, including the Brünigbahn and the Rübelandbahn in the Harz, which was equipped with the Abt rack rail system. These visits led to a decision to equip the line with the system used on the Rübelandbahn, and using a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of 12.5%. A total of six sections of track were to be laid out with a total of 7450 m of rack railway.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin Street's {{claim to}} fame has caused some {{controversy}} after it emerged that the original entry in the Guinness Book of Records {{was based on a}} typographical error, claiming a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1:1.266 (38° or 79%). This appears to be an error for 1:2.66, which itself is slightly steeper than the currently accepted figure of 1:2.86. Alternatively, the mistake may have been caused by confusion between grade in degrees and percentage grade, mixing up 38% with 38°. Nevertheless, Guinness officially recognises Baldwin Street as the world's steepest street at a 35% grade.|$|E

The last locomotives – the D 52 class, manufactured by the German firm Krupp in 1954 – operated until 1994, {{when they were}} replaced by diesel locomotives. Indonesia also purchased the last batch of mallet locomotives from Nippon Sharyo, to be used on the Aceh Railway. In Sumatra Barat (West Sumatra) and Ambarawa some rack railways (with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of 6% in mountainous areas) are now operated for tourism only.

However, the vote did not include any allocation of money. Additional surveying started on 18 August 1911 and was led by W. Sandberg. This time two alternatives were to be surveyed, one with a <b>maximum</b> <b>gradient</b> of 2.6 percent, and one with 2.0.
