40|$|Human {{factors in}} a low-gravity {{environment}} became important {{with the beginning}} of manned space flight programs. The costs and dangers associated with actual space experiments necessi-tated the development of reduced-gravity simulation techniques. Since parabolic flight is rhe only way to produce approximately the same physical conditions as orbital space flight, it is the only technique acceptable for many human factors studies. However, the shortness of periods at fhe desired gravity level and the high gravity levels of the pre- and post-parabola flight compromise the effectiveness of the technique. In spite of its faults, this technique has been used to produce many meaningful studies. These studies have done much to increase our limited knowledge of reduced-gravity human factors. I t appears that this technique {{will continue to be a}} main source of low-gravity data, until the era of <b>manned</b> <b>orbiting</b> <b>laboratories...</b>|$|R
40|$|Review of the {{feasibility}} of <b>manned</b> earth <b>orbiting</b> <b>laboratories</b> in the 1980 s for solving problems identified with operational communication and navigation systems. A program of experiments recommended for implementation in the 1980 to 1990 period is presented. Equipment for conducting experiments is listed. Conceptual designs of laboratories which could be carried to orbit by the forthcoming NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter and then operated on orbit by an experimenter crew are discussed. Studies of the expected benefits, together with investigations of the configurations, mission considerations, and equipment selection result in the conclusion that manned communication/navigation research <b>laboratories</b> in earth <b>orbit</b> would be practical and effective, and that the experiments performed could derive meaningful information having application to future unmanned operational systems...|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the flight of Yuri Gagarin as the first man in space, Kennedy in 1961 committed the United States to landing {{a man on the}} Moon {{by the end of the}} decade. [...] At the time, the administration believed that the Soviet Union would be able to land a man on the Moon by 1967, and Kennedy saw an American Moon landing as critical to the nation's global prestige and status. [...] His pick for NASA administrator, James E. Webb, however pursued a broader program incorporating space applications such as weather and communications satellites. [...] During this time the Department of Defense pursued military space applications such as the Dyna-Soar spaceplane program and the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbiting</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> [...] Kennedy also had elevated the status of the National Advisory Space Council by assigning the Vice President as its chair.|$|E
2500|$|The division's [...] medical {{testing was}} {{conducted}} {{not only for}} Air Force personnel, but also for NASA astronauts in Project Mercury. [...] Throughout Project Mercury, the division's medical facilities prepared astronauts for their missions and examined them after their return to earth. [...] However, the expectation that the Aerospace Medical Division would be the [...] "national center for aerospace medical studies" [...] faded as NASA developed its own medical research facilities. [...] By agreement with the Department of Defense, NASA {{took the lead in}} this area, although the division continued to participate in occasional projects. [...] The division continued {{to take the lead in}} medical support for programs for which the Air Force was the lead agency, such as the <b>Manned</b> <b>Orbiting</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> [...] The transfer of space medicine to NASA made it apparent by 1970 that the facilities at Holloman Air Force Base were no longer cost effective, and the 6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory was inactivated in December.|$|E
