It measures the total number of product lines. Some companies would focus solely and sell only one type of product to specialise in, having said that, some would offer numerous types of products for the diversified markets, depending on the size and objectives of the entities. Each approach’s results vary from a lot of factors including location, market, trends and etc, therefore business should carefully consider their product mix. The width of product mix is one of the four dimensions of product mix along with the length, depth and consistency of product mix (Suttle, n.d.).|$|E

He calculated the expected intercellular material handling cost for each machine cell arrangement under all possible product mixes. Madhusudanan Pillai and Chandrasekharan (2010) evaluated the CF problem under probabilistic product mix. Each product mix is specified with a scenario and to each scenario has been attributed probability of occurrence. They minimized inter-cell material handling. Jayakumar and Raju (2011) presented a mathematic model for the CF problem in which for each scenario probability of occurrence has been attributed. The objective function of this model is to minimize the total machine constant (investment) cost, the operating cost, the inter-cell material handling cost, and the intra-cell material handling cost for a particular product mix.|$|E

This question has a rather easy answer, but there are many cases where the answer is negative.

Advanced {{process control}} (APC) has been {{recognized}} as a proper tool for maximizing profitability of semiconductor manufacturing facilities by improving efficiency and product quality. Run-to-run (RtR) process control with good quality and reliable performance for APC applications are most applicable. Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is part of critical processing module in semiconductor manufacturing.

The m-dEWMA controller combined thread dEWMA with the drift compensation scheme {{to deal with the}} drift and shift disturbances caused by tool and products, respectively. Comparing recently <b>mixed</b> <b>product</b> control schemes: threaded EWMA controller, JADE control and threaded prediction correction controller (threaded PCC), the simulation results show that the m-dEWMA has better control performance than other controllers.
