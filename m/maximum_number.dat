40|$|Abstract: It is {{a common}} {{impression}} that by only setting the <b>maximum</b> occupation <b>number</b> to infinity, which is the demand of the indistinguishability of bosons, one can achieve the statistical distribution that bosons obey — the Bose-Einstein distribution. In this letter, however, we show that only with an infinite <b>maximum</b> occupation <b>number</b> one cannot uniquely achieve the Bose-Einstein distribution, since in the derivation of the Bose-Einstein distribution, the problem of iterated limit is encountered. For achieving the Bose-Einstein distribution, one needs to take both the <b>maximum</b> occupation <b>number</b> and {{the total number of}} particles to infinities, and, then, the problem of the order of taking limits arises. Different orders of the limit operations will lead to different statistical distributions. For achieving the Bose-Einstein distribution, besides setting the <b>maximum</b> occupation <b>number,</b> we also need to state the order of the limit operations. PACS codes: 05. 30. Pr; 05. 30.

30|$|This {{section is}} devoted to {{investigate}} {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm to solve medium size 0 – 1 knapsack problems. Ten instances are taken from [42], where sizes of these instances include 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 items. The information about these instances such as dimension, parameters and optimum solution are listed in Table  3.

Based upon these tests, the <b>maximum</b> <b>numbers</b> of iterations are accordingly set to 400 iterations for KP_ 10 –KP_ 15 and 500 iterations for KP_ 16 –KP_ 20.
