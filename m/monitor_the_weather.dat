40|$|Abstract — <b>Weather</b> is <b>the</b> {{state of}} the atmosphere, {{to the degree that}} it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather {{phenomena}} occur in the troposphere, just below <b>the</b> stratosphere. <b>Weather</b> generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, “weather”, is understood to mean <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> of earth. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> conditions manually is difficult. The present work is to develop an automated system which <b>monitors</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> condition. <b>The</b> <b>weather</b> condition is driven by air pressure (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These pressure and temperature differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot. Through this system we can automatically collect the information about humidity and temperature. The details are stored in a database and according to current and previous data we can produce the results in graphical manner in the system. The objective {{of this paper is to}} formulate <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and be able to forecast <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> without human error...|$|R

30|$|A WRNS is {{composed}} of multiple weather radars, which are deployed in different geographical positions for <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> phenomena nearby.

40|$|Cholesteric liquid {{crystals}} {{have been}} used to study <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> surfaces of marble from the Sanctuary of Demeter in Eleusis, near Athens. Previous investigations have shown that when a cholesteric phase is spread {{across the surface of the}} stone, the pitch of the mesophase is sensitive to the topography of the surface. The wavelength of the maximum in the reflected spectrum varies therefore with the microtexture of the surface. Small samples of surface stone from the temple which had been weathered in distinctive ways, were investigated in the laboratory. There appears to be a significant correlation between the optical reflectance spectra and the surface microtopography investigated by SEM, as indicated by computer aided analysis (Digital Image Processing). The results point to the development of an effective in situ method of <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> of marble surfaces using cholesteric liquid crystals...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the aerial tanker conversion, <b>the</b> Air <b>Weather</b> Service by 1955 had basically worn out the WB-29s used for hurricane hunting and other weather reconnaissance missions. Thirty-six former SAC B-50Ds were stripped of their armament and equipped for long-range <b>weather</b> reconnaissance missions. <b>The</b> WB-50 could fly higher and faster and longer than the WB-29. However, between 1956 and 1960 it experienced 13 major operational accidents, six of them involving {{the loss of the}} entire crew, and 66 crew member fatalities. After <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> reconnaissance fleet was grounded in May 1960 because of fuel leaks, plans were set in motion in 1962 to modify Boeing B-47 Stratojets being phased out of SAC to replace it in the role. The WB-50 had an important role during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when it <b>monitored</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> around Cuba to plan photo-reconnaissance flights. The WB-50 was also retired in 1965 due to metal fatigue and corrosion.|$|R

These citizen science observations are being used to fill the data gaps in order to understand and manage location-specific issues.

5000|$|In use since 1960, {{the weather}} {{satellite}} {{is a type}} of satellite that is primarily used to <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and climate of the Earth.

[...] Meteorological satellites see more than clouds and cloud systems. Beginning with the Nimbus 3 satellite in 1969, temperature information through the atmospheric column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern Atlantic and most of the Pacific Ocean, which led to significant forecast improvements. [...] City lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc., and other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites. Other environmental satellites can detect changes in the Earth's vegetation, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. El Niño and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images. Collectively, weather satellites flown by the U.S., Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch.|$|E

25|$|Aneroid {{barometers}} have {{a mechanical}} adjustment {{that allows the}} equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an aneroid barometer is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as <b>the</b> local <b>weather</b> station) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being set—regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few aneroid barometers intended for <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing either the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.|$|R

5000|$|The {{objective}} {{is for the}} player to survive {{as long as possible}} by scavenging and utilizing whatever resources they may find within the world. This includes commodities such as food, water, firewood, medicine, and tools such as weapons, axes, knives {{and a host of other}} items. Wildlife is also present, such as deer which can be hunted for food, and wolves and bears which are a constant threat to the player as they venture outside. All items and wildlife are randomly spawned for every new game, so no two games will be alike for the player. Tools and items degrade over time, forcing the player to make careful decisions regarding their condition and their eventual need for repair. Fire, being a primary component, is necessary for warmth and cooking. The player has to forage for wood and fuel on a regular basis to stay alive. The player can also get sick from food poisoning and disease. The Long Dark simulates a full day/night cycle which is a fundamental part of the game. The game also simulates temperature and windchill, both of which are random during every playthrough, encouraging the player to <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> carefully at all times to prevent death from exposure. Initially the game did not feature varied experience modes, but due to player demand, Hinterland added three experience modes to accommodate a range of playstyles, and a fourth mode added later. The easiest mode, [...] "Pilgrim", is for players looking for a more exploratory experience, [...] "Voyageur" [...] is a middle ground and the most well rounded with regard to exploration and survival, [...] "Stalker" [...] offers a more hardcore survival experience, and [...] "Interloper" [...] is for players looking for a punishing, difficult experience.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{agriculture}} zone {{it will be}} {{very difficult}} to check and <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> parameter through wires and analog devices during some weather hazards. To overcome this problem here the wireless sensors are used to check and <b>monitor</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> parameters. Monitoring the weather parameters in agriculture zone plays an important role in farming production processes. In this system, a wireless sensor network based on Zigbee is utilized as a weather station network sending weather information or guideline to the farmers to plan their farm. The weather parameters which are measured by the system are temperature, humidity in the soil. The system takes advantage of wireless sensor networks which can send signals over far distances by using a mesh topology; this transfers the data and also consumes low power. Therefore, this system can be installed in locations that are difficult to hardwire...|$|E
