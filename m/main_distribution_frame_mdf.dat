50|$|Forecasters in {{the late}} 1960s underestimated demand, {{resulting}} in a shortage of capacity in Manhattan, NYTel's principal profit area. Customers had to wait weeks for a new line or a repair, and sometimes minutes for dial tone on an existing line. The new 1ESS Stored Program Control exchanges had software bugs that kept them from carrying full load. Deferred maintenance choked <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>MDFs)</b> with dead jumpers. There were not enough cables to office buildings, nor enough underground conduits to install them. Morale was poor in all levels and departments; strikes were frequent.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Today, the {{permutation}} of circuits in the <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames</b> (<b>MDF),</b> which {{connect the}} subscriber lines to POTS and to DSLAMs, is still operated manually. However, new market regulations, allowing subscribers to change network operator frequently, {{and the new}} schemes to concentrate active ADSL users into few DSLAMs during off-peak hours, adopted by network operators to reduce the energy consumption in the access network (and the related operational costs), require more advanced, reliable and faster mechanisms than human operations. Indeed, Automated MDFs (AMDF) have recently become available on the market to provide cheap and almost real-time circuit switching. Even if grounded on more than 50 years of research activities on architectures for circuit switching, the considered scenario is quite peculiar and offers new interesting technical challenges, since classical multistage strictly non-blocking networks are too expensive {{for the number of}} required ports (sometimes very large, exceeding 100, 000), and rearrangeable multistage networks can interrupt temporarily active circuits, affecting in a indefinite way the performance of ADSL lines. For these reasons, we propose the design of AMDFs based on recently proposed non-interruptive rearrangeable (NIR) networks and show how to optimize the routing control to minimize the setup time of a circuit. Finally, our findings are relevant both for the theory of multistage interconnection networks, and for those companies producing, engineering and operating large AMDFs.

50|$|An {{intermediate}} {{distribution frame}} (IDF) is a distribution frame in a central office or customer premises, which cross-connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and {{may serve as a}} distribution point for multipair cables from the <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>MDF)</b> or combined distribution frame (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.|$|E
50|$|Openreach manages BT's local {{access network}} which connects {{customers}} to their local telephone exchange, starting at the <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>MDF)</b> in the exchange and ending at the network termination point (NTP) at the end user's premises. Openreach also manages the connections between the MDF and the BT Wholesale/local-loop unbundling (LLU) termination points located in the exchange, {{often referred to as}} jumper connections.|$|E
50|$|For example, the <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (<b>MDF)</b> {{located at}} a {{telephone}} central office terminates the cables leading to subscribers on the one hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as DSLAMs and telephone switches) on the other. Service is provided to a subscriber by manually wiring a twisted pair (called a jumper wire) between the telephone line and the relevant DSL or POTS line circuit.|$|E
50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a <b>Main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the first}} {{responders}} to the fire were employees of Bell Companies and Western Electric. Five thousand employees collaborated to restore service. A <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> was ordered and shipped to Manhattan for installation. The <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> typically takes six months to install because its massive framework supports {{hundreds of miles of}} wire.

5000|$|For a {{small or}} {{medium-sized}} business, the capital investment {{to set up}} VoIP infrastructure in-house could be too high compared to the potential return, but cloud telephony could offer the same services on a lower-cost subscription basis. [...] The cloud telephony provider is also {{an expert in the}} technology, whereas a small business is unlikely to have an employee with the same level of expertise, or cannot justify the expense of a full-time telecommunication infrastructure position. Traditional telephony applications required on-premises maintenance, PBX, {{and a great deal of}} wiring through a <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (<b>MDF).</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>Main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> {{is located}} in the commune.

50|$|In telephony, a <b>main</b> <b>{{distribution}}</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>MDF</b> or main frame) is {{a signal}} distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main distribution frame (TMDF).|$|E
40|$|In today’s access networks, the {{permutation}} of circuits {{connecting the}} subscriber lines to Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) and to Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) {{occurs in the}} <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (<b>MDF)</b> and is still manually configured. However, new market regulations and new policies adopted by operators require increasingly more frequent permutations, making the manual configuration activity particularly expensive. Very recently, Automated MDFs (AMDF) {{have been developed to}} provide inexpensive and almost real-time switching capability. Our study, based on more than 50 years of research activities on architectures for circuit switching, is focused on overcoming the limits of classical architectures. In fact, strictly non-blocking multistage networks are too expensive, {{as a consequence of the}} large number of ports they require (sometimes exceeding 100, 000). In addition, rearrangeable multistage networks can temporarily interrupt active circuits, affecting the performance of ADSL subscriber lines. As a possible solution to these problems, we propose the design of AMDFs based on Non-Interruptive Rearrangeable (NIR) networks. We show how to optimize the routing control to minimize the setup time of a circuit and to exploit output grouping. We believe that the solution described above is not only relevant for the theory of multistage interconnection networks, but also for the design and operation of large AMDFs.

5000|$|<b>Main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF): a wiring rack {{that connects}} outside {{subscriber}} lines with internal lines. It {{is used to}} connect public or private lines coming into the building to internal networks.

50|$|Some {{telephone}} technicians used various phrase, such as red-right-ring-rear, or ring-right-red-rough, {{to remember}} that the red wire connects to the right-side post in the wall jack and to the ring on the plug and to the rear lug on <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames.</b> Sometimes rough or ridge was added for jumper wires with a tactile code.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated <b>Main</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R
50|$|On February 27, 1975 {{a fire at}} New York Telephone's {{building}} at 204 Second Avenue (at East 13th Street) in Manhattan destroyed the <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> and damaged much of the underground cabling, disconnecting 170,000 subscribers. This office connects many circuits to Brooklyn which were disrupted. Equipment was redirected from other Bell System operating companies in multiple US states to establish temporary service and rebuild the destroyed exchange.|$|R
5000|$|Advantages of {{automated}} <b>main</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> include reduced switching time, reduced {{errors in}} execution and documentation, no truck-roll for each subscriber connection to be established, and reduction of operational expenditures (OPEX).

5000|$|Installing a {{telephone}} {{line is a}} complex process, involving coordinated work on outside plant and inside.
