40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} single doses of thioridazine and <b>mesoridazine</b> on the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval in healthy adult volunteers. QTc intervals and plasma concentrations of thioridazine, <b>mesoridazine,</b> and metabolites were measured after single oral doses of thioridazine hydrochloride 50 [*]mg, <b>mesoridazine</b> besylate 50 [*]mg, or placebo in a double-blind, crossover study. Mean maximum increases in the QTc interval following thioridazine (37. 3 ± 4. 1 [*]ms, P= 0. 023) and <b>mesoridazine</b> (46. 6 ± 7. 4 [*]ms, P= 0. 021) were similar and significantly greater than following placebo (12. 9 ± 8. 1 [*]ms). The area under the effect–time curve over 8 [*]h following drug administration was similar between the two drugs (129. 3 ± 22. 1 vs 148. 3 ± 43. 0 [*]ms[*]h). In conclusion, thioridazine and <b>mesoridazine</b> are associated with similar effects on the QTc interval...|$|E
40|$|Phenothiazines {{are known}} to produce electrocardiographic repolarization abnormalities. Thioridazine and <b>mesoridazine</b> appear to induce such changes more {{frequently}} than other neuroleptics and are also known to induce fatal ventricular arrhythmia. The woman {{described in this article}} died after taking her usual dose of thioridazine, 100 mg/d, in combination with a single capsule of Contac. C, a decongestant-antihistamine containing phenylpropanolamine and chlorpheniramine. Phenylpropanolamine, an ephedrine-like drug, was thought to have favoured the initiation by thioridazine of the ventricular arrhythmia that led to the woman's death. It is therefore suggested that ephedrine-like medications not be given to patients receiving thioridazine...|$|E
40|$|In {{a variety}} of {{cellular}} and subcellular preparations, total ATP-hydrolyzing activity was potently inhibited by tricyclic antidepressants (TA) and phenothiazine tranquilizers (PT). In leukocytes, preincubation of the cells with 5 x 10 - 4 M TA and 1 x 10 - 4 M PT resulted in up to 87 % and 94 % inhibition of the ATPase activity. Among TA, dibenzocycloheptadienes were somewhat more potent inhibitors than were derivatives of dibenzazepine. Substitution, at the position 2 of the phenothiazine nucleus, by a halogen and particularly by the CF 3 group, increased the inhibitory strength of PT. However, most effective in inhibiting ATPase was thioridazine, structurally differing from <b>mesoridazine,</b> the weakest inhibitor in this study, by a methylmercapto group instead of a methylsulfinyl substituent. The inhibition by the drugs was markedly reduced {{in the presence of}} millimolar ATP. The results indicate a possible adverse effect of these drugs on the cellular energy-yielding capacity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Various {{antipsychotic}} medications, both older, 1 st {{generation and}} newer, atypical ones, block potassium channels in myocardium causing prolongation of cardiac repolarization. This leads to QT interval prolongation in the electrocardiogram which, in turn, {{may lead to}} a type of malignant ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (TdP) : clinically, it may manifest with symptoms such as severe palpitations or tachycardia and may as well lead to sudden cardiac death. The possibility for sudden death seems to increase with dose and age increase. Among 1 st generation antipsychotics, drugs that have been implicated most include thioridazine, pimozide, <b>mesoridazine</b> (which is metabolized to thioridazine), chlorpromazine and haloperidol. In this brief report, we focus mainly on haloperidol for two reasons: it is the most frequently used classical antipsychotic and it has the most data available concerning its relationship with QT interval prolongation and TdP. Furthermore, we describe the meaning and the clinical relevance of QT interval prolongation and TdP tachycardia, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism and their relationship with selected older antipsychotic medications...|$|E

30|$|Fluoxetine is metabolized {{into its}} active {{metabolite}} norfluoxetine (Lemberger et al. 1985). Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal {{to those of}} the parent drug during chronic therapy (Brunswick et al. 2002 a). After a fixed daily dose of fluoxetine (20.0  mg day- 1), the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continued to grow through the first few weeks of treatment, and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks (Pérez et al. 2001; Brunswick et al. 2002 b). Paroxetine is completely absorbed after oral administration and metabolized in the liver forming three main metabolites: the two isomers (3 S, 4 R)- 4 -(4 -fluorophenyl)-[*] 3 -[(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenoxy)methyl]-piperidine (M 1), (3 S, 4 R)- 4 -(4 -fluorophenyl)- 3 -[(3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxyphenoxy)methyl]-piperidine(M 2) and (3 S, 4 R)- 3 -hydroxymethyl- 4 -(4 -fluorophenyl) piperidine (M 3) (Hiemke & Hartter 2000). Steady-state plasma paroxetine concentrations were achieved after approximately 10  days following 40 -mg once daily dose (Mandrioli et al. 2007). Thioridazine is mainly metabolized into <b>mesoridazine</b> and sulphoridazine. Steady-state plasma thioridazine concentrations were achieved after approximately 7  days following four 100 -mg doses per day (Vanderheeren & Muusze 1977). Sertraline is mainly metabolized into N-desmethylsertraline. Steady state plasma concentration level for sertraline and its metabolite were achieved after approximately one week of a 50 -mg once- daily dosing (Package Insert, Zolofi@, Pfizer Inc 1992; Mandrioli et al. 2006). Amineptine is mainly metabolized by beta-oxidation of the side chain, its principle metabolites has the same structure as the parent compound except that its side chain is reduced to five carbon atom (Lachatre et al. 1989). Steady state plasma level is achieved at 8 th day following two 100.0  mg doses per day (Rop Pok et al. 1990).|$|E
40|$|When {{disposition}} is monoexponential, extravascular concentrationtime (C, t) data yield both disposition and absorption parameters, {{the latter}} via the Wagner-Nelson method or deconvolution which are equivalent. Classically, when disposition is multiexponential, disposition parameters are obtained from intravenous administration and absorption data are obtained from extravascular C, t data via the Loo-Riegelman or Exact Loo-Riegelman methods or via deconvolution. Thus, in multiexponential disposition one assumes no intrasubject variation in disposition, a hypothesis {{that has not}} been proven for most drugs. Based on the classical two and threecompartment open models with central compartment elimination, and using postabsorptive extravascular C, t data only, we have developed four equations to estimate k 10 when disposition is biexponential and two other equations to estimate k 10 when disposition is triexponential. The other disposition rate constants are readily obtained without intravenous data. We have analyzed extravascular data of flurbiprofen (12 sets), <b>mesoridazine</b> (20 sets), flunarizine (5 sets), labetalol (9 sets), and diazepam (4 sets). In the case of diazepam intravenous C, t data were also available for analysis. After disposition parameters had been estimated from the extravascular data the Exact Loo-Riegelman method with the Proost modification was applied to the absorptive extravascular data to obtain A T /V p as a function of time. These latter data for each subject and each drug studied were found to befitted by a function indicating either simple firstorder absorption, two consecutive firstorder processes, or zero order absorption. After absorption and disposition parameters had been estimated, for each set of extravascular data analyzed, a reconstruction trend line through the original C, t data was made. The new methods allow testing of the hypothesis of constancy of disposition with any given drug. There is also a need for new methods of analysis since the majority of drugs have no marketed intravenous formulation, hence the classical methods cannot be applied...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} and functionally characterized yeast fRMsr homolog which showed specificity for reduction of free Met-R-SO {{and contributed to}} oxidative stress resistance of yeast cells. We further identified three conserved Cys which participate in catalysis through disulfide exchange. Evolutionary analyses revealed that the occurrence of fRMSr is restricted to unicellular organisms. ^ We further found that mammalian MsrA can reduce free Met-S-SO, whereas MsrBs do not reduce free Met-R-SO. Consistent with these findings {{and the lack of}} fRMsr, mammalian cells could not grow in media that replaced Met with Met-R-SO. However, they grew in the presence of free Met-S-SO, which was reduced by MsrA. Expression of yeast fRMsr in mammalian cells supported the growth of mammalian cells on Met-R-SO, increased resistamce to oxidative stress, and affected expression levels of proteins that are regulated by Met availability. ^ We extended the finding of deficiency in free Met-R-SO reduction in mammals to examine the ability of Msrs to reduce compounds containing methylsulfinyls. Methylsulfide group has a prochiral sulfur, resulting in two diastereomers upon sulfoxidation. We found that methylsulfinyls in sulmazole sulfoxide, triclabendazole sulfoxide, and <b>mesoridazine</b> could be stereospecifically reduced by MsrA, but MsrB and fRMsr were not active. We also found that dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which has a methylsulfinyl group, can only be reduced by MsrA. ^ To examine the role of Met in aging, we performed lifespan analyses in fruit flies. There was no difference in lifespan of flies maintained on restricted (0. 1 mM Met) and regular (1 mM) Met diets. Instead, we observed uncoupling between reproduction and longevity. A popular theory of aging suggests that dietary restriction is inversely proportional to reproduction due to nutritional redistribution of resources from egg generation to somatic maintenance, but we found that this theory did not follow our data that are based on variation in Met concentration. ^ Overall, our studies characterized all three known types of methionine sulfoxide reductase and uncovered biological significance of free methionine sulfoxide reduction and its deficiency in mammals. ...|$|E
