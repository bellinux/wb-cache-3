5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause <b>Microcephaly</b> {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe <b>microcephaly,</b> often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed <b>microcephaly</b> in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to the spread of the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight the spread of the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated as part of the response to Ebola, to fight the spread of the Zika virus. Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight the spread of Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with <b>microcephaly</b> testing positive for Zika.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microcephaly</b> is a {{disorder}} {{in which the}} circumference of the head is smaller than average for the person's age and gender. Most children with <b>microcephaly</b> also have a smaller than typical brain and intellectual disability. Some {{of the most common}} signs and symptoms associated with <b>microcephaly</b> are seizures, poor feeding, high pitched cry, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and increased movement of arms and legs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microcephaly</b> is {{determined}} by comparing head circumference (often called occipitofrontal circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts. Other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for <b>microcephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cranio-osteoanatomical and {{pathological}} {{analysis of}} LB1 skull by micro-computed tomography however, revealed no pathologies, and no features of Homo sapiens <b>microcephaly,</b> and scientists Balzeau and Charlier {{conclude that the}} specimen is not of Homo sapiens origin.|$|E
25|$|Zika, {{recently}} notorious, though rarely deadly. It causes fever, joint pain, rashes and conjunctivitis. The {{most serious}} consequence appears when the infected {{person is a}} pregnant woman, since during pregnancy this virus can originate a birth defect called <b>microcephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2002, {{there were}} 25 reports of autopsies on infants {{known to have}} FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth. The {{examination}} revealed extensive brain damage, including <b>microcephaly,</b> migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive neuroglial, leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the left hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{abnormalities}} {{of the brain}} are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include <b>microcephaly</b> (small head size) {{of two or more}} standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia).|$|E
25|$|In response, Weber et al. {{conducted}} a survey the same year comparing the computer model of LB1's skull {{with a sample of}} microcephalic human skulls, concluding that the skull size of LB1 falls {{in the middle of the}} size range of the human samples and is not inconsistent with <b>microcephaly.</b> Next to dispute the finding of Falk et al. (2005) were Martin et al. (2006), who objected to the failure to compare the model of LB1's skull with a typical example of adult <b>microcephaly.</b> Martin and his coauthors concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic, arguing that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; if it were, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, one-third the size of the discovered skeleton. Shortly thereafter, a group of scientists from Indonesia, Australia, and the United States came to the same conclusion by examining bone and skull structure (Jacob (2006)).|$|E
25|$|The facial {{features}} of 1p36 deletion syndrome {{have been considered}} to be characteristic, although few patients have been diagnosed {{solely on the basis}} of facial appearance. These features may include <b>microcephaly,</b> small, possibly slanted, deep-set eyes, a flat nose and nasal bridge, anomalous, low-set and small ears, a small mouth with down-turned corners and a pointed chin. Distinguishing features in another study were a large or late-closing anterior fontanelle (up to 85% of patients) and facial asymmetry.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} phenylketonuria, it is {{important}} for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta. The child may develop congenital heart disease, growth retardation, <b>microcephaly</b> and intellectual disability as a result. PKU-affected women themselves are not at risk of additional complications during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physical}} malformations {{associated with}} Edwards syndrome include small head (<b>microcephaly)</b> {{accompanied by a}} prominent back portion of the head (occiput), low-set, malformed ears, abnormally small jaw (micrognathia), cleft lip/cleft palate, upturned nose, narrow eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), drooping of the upper eyelids (ptosis), a short breast bone, clenched hands, choroid plexus cysts, underdeveloped thumbs and/or nails, absent radius, webbing of {{the second and third}} toes, clubfoot or rocker bottom feet, and in males, undescended testicles.|$|E
25|$|Zika fever, {{also known}} as Zika virus disease or simply Zika, is an {{infectious}} disease caused by the Zika virus. Most cases have no symptoms, but when present they are usually mild and can resemble dengue fever. Symptoms may include fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, and a maculopapular rash. Symptoms generally last less than seven days. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause <b>microcephaly</b> and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults {{have been linked to}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS).|$|E
25|$|Nijmegen {{breakage}} syndrome (NBS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} that has similar chromosomal instability to that seen in people with A-T, but the problems experienced are quite different. Children with NBS have significant <b>microcephaly,</b> a distinct facial appearance, short stature, and moderate cognitive impairment, but do not experience any neurologic deterioration over time. Like those with A-T, children with NBS have enhanced sensitivity to radiation, disposition to lymphoma and leukemia, and some laboratory measures of impaired immune function, but do not have ocular telangiectasia or an elevated level of AFP.|$|E
25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged by Robert Martin (after Jacob's death the leading {{proponent of the}} <b>microcephaly</b> hypothesis) and Alan Thorne. Martin noted that no {{research has been done}} on wrists of microcephalic people. Thorne maintained that the differences were small and that similar variation could occur with living modern humans. He also pointed out that the carpal bones had been found scattered in the cave and it was not certain that they all belonged to the same individual. Project leader Morwood countered that there were also other features, such as the stature, body proportions, brain size, shoulder, pelvis, jaw, and teeth which suggested that H.nbsp&floresiensis is a separate hominin species that evolved in isolation on the island.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} include cerebellar ataxia (unsteady walking with uncoordinated limb movements), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), tremor, epilepsy (both partial and generalized), vertical supranuclear palsy (upgaze palsy, downgaze palsy, saccadic palsy or paralysis), sleep inversion, gelastic cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone or drop attacks), dystonia (abnormal movements or postures caused by contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles across joints), most commonly begins with in turning of one foot when walking (action dystonia) and may spread to become generalized, spasticity (velocity dependent increase in muscle tone), hypotonia, ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid), <b>microcephaly</b> (abnormally small head), psychosis, progressive dementia, progressive hearing loss, bipolar disorder, major and psychotic depression that can include hallucinations, delusions, mutism, or stupor.|$|E
25|$|Susan G. Larson et al. {{analyzed}} the upper limb of LB1. They {{found that in}} LB1 the angle of humeral torsion is much less than in modern humans. This had been previously studied by Richards et al., who declared {{that it is a}} sign of modern pygmy populations, and T. Jacob et al., who pointed out that muscle attachments on the bone suggest LB1 had weak muscles which resulted in little development of humeral torsion. Larson et al. rejected Richards' conclusion, arguing that the humeral torsion of pygmy populations is usually similar to that of peoples of average stature. They argued that Richards et al. cited a 1972 paper which had studied a sample of six female Eastern Central African pygmies and this sample was too small to represent the whole population. Larson et al. also failed to find signs of <b>microcephaly</b> on the studied bones.|$|E
25|$|Falk et al. (2007) offered further {{evidence}} that the claims of a microcephalic H.sapiens were not credible. Virtual endocasts of an additional nine microcephalic brains and ten normal human brains were examined, and {{it was found that}} the floresiensis skulls are similar in shape to normal human brains, yet have unique features which are consistent with what one would expect in a new species. The frontal and temporal lobes of the floresiensis brain were found to be highly developed, in strong contrast to the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from modern human brains. This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required for the members of H.floresiensis to create the tools found in their proximity. Falk et al. (2007) conclude that the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim <b>microcephaly</b> to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{mutations}} in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT (also known as protein kinase B) pathway have been identified in MCAP and MPPH. This pathway has proven to {{be an integral part of}} brain growth and development and is an area of interest to many researchers who study the cause of megalencephaly. Mutations in this pathway have been shown to cause a gain of function in the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. This cellular pathway is critical in the regulation of diverse cell functions including, cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and most importantly in regards to megalencephaly, brain development. AKT is a crucial signaling molecule part of the PI3K pathway and is also involved in many cellular functions. These functions include, brain development, synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment. Loss of function in AKT can cause <b>microcephaly</b> in humans while inactivation of the pathway can cause hemimegalencephaly. There are also several cancers that have been shown to be linked with mutations in the AKT pathway, including melanoma and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|Microcephalic osteodysplastic {{primordial}} dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, <b>microcephaly</b> with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, {{and distinctive}} skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation. She had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her {{first six months of}} life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A brain MRI revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of lissencephaly. This child’s neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked lissencephaly in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays.|$|E
25|$|The gene {{showing a}} human-specific {{increase}} in DUF1220 copy number was first {{identified as the}} result of a genome-wide array CGH study of lineage-specific copy number differences between human and great ape species. The study found 134 genes that showed human lineage-specific increases in copy number, one of which, MGC8902 (also known as NBPF15, cDNA IMAGE:843276), encoded 6 DUF1220 domains. DUF1220 protein domains are found almost exclusively in the NBPF gene family (which includes the MGC8902 gene), which was independently identified as a result of the first member of this family being disrupted in an individual with neuroblastoma. It was recently found that the exceptional increase in human DUF1220 copy number was the results of intragenic domain hyper-amplification primarily involving the three-domain unit called the HLS DUF1220 triplet. Hyper-amplification of the triplet resulted in the addition of ~149 copies of DUF1220 specifically to the human lineage since its divergence from the Pan species, chimpanzee and bonobo, approximately 6 million years ago. The ancestral DUF1220 domain is not part of the NBPF family but rather is found as a single copy within the PDE4DIP (Myomegalin) gene. PDE4DIP encodes a centrosomal protein and is a homolog of CDK5RAP2, a gene that lacks DUF1220 sequences and, when mutated, has been implicated in <b>microcephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ABCC grew {{rapidly in}} 1948 and 1949. Their staff numbers quadrupled {{in just one}} year. By 1951 the total stood at 1063 {{employees}} – 143 allied and 920 Japanese personnel. Perhaps the most important research undertaken by the ABCC was the genetics study, which focused its study on the uncertainties surrounding the possible long-term effects of ionizing radiation in pregnant women and their unborn children. The study did not find evidence of widespread genetic damage. It did, however, find increased incidence of <b>microcephaly</b> and mental retardation in children most proximally exposed in utero to the bombs' radiation. The genetics project studied the effects of radiation on the survivors and their children. This project {{turned out to be}} the largest and most interactive of the ABCC programs. In 1957, Japan passed the Atomic Bomb Survivors Relief Law, which qualified certain people for two medical exams per year. The Japanese term for the survivors of the atomic bombs is hibakusha. The qualifications for medical care were those within a few kilometers of the hypocenters at the time of the bombings; those within 2 kilometers of the hypocenters within two weeks of the bombings; those exposed to radiation from fallout and children who were in utero by women who fit into any of the other categories.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. [...] Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause <b>microcephaly,</b> cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] <b>Microcephaly</b> is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. [...] All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation. [...] Hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems. [...] It can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae. [...] Kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness.
