25|$|In {{addition}} to identifying {{rocks in the}} field (lithology), petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory. Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron <b>microprobe.</b> In an optical mineralogy analysis, petrologists analyze thin sections of rock samples using a petrographic microscope, where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light, including their birefringence, pleochroism, twinning, and interference properties with a conoscopic lens. In the electron <b>microprobe,</b> individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

25|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the fine-grained rock using optical mineralogy, X-ray crystallography, and electron <b>microprobe</b> has determined that the boulders consist of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented by calcite. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively weak {{in the interior of}} a boulder to quite hard at its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist of as much as 10 to 20% calcite because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.|$|E
30|$|In this study, nanostructured SU- 8 <b>microprobes</b> were {{developed}} to enhance neuronal growth {{with the aim of}} facilitating long-term recording of neuronal signals. SU- 8 <b>microprobes</b> were produced by conventional photolithography and nanostructures of ~  200  nm diameter and depth were generated on their surfaces. Neuronal development on nanostructured and non-nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> was characterized using PC 12 neuron-like cells. PC 12 cells on nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> showed significantly increased attachment and neurite outgrowth compared with those on non-nanostructured <b>microprobes.</b> This improved neuronal development did not require an adhesive coating (e.g., PLL) and so the nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> show promise for use in implantable devices that support neurons, for example, implantable brain-machine interfaces.|$|R

25|$|Indirect dating of mica grains {{from the}} Dox Formation {{indicate}} that it was deposited over {{a relatively short time}} span, between 1140 and 1104 Ma. Individual mica grains from the Escalante Creek Member of the Dox, were collected and dated by 40Ar/39Ar mass spectrometry. This dating of mica grains yielded a distribution of ages ranging from ca. 1260-1120 Ma, with a well-defined peak at 1140 Ma. Although it was suspected that these dates recorded the age at which the mineral cooled through a critical temperature window of ~300°C, the dating of additional samples from other members, and petrographic and <b>microprobe</b> examination of the mica, indicated the ages of source rocks from which the micas were eroded, and support the interpretation that the Dox Formation is younger than 1140 Ma. Additional dating of detrital zircons from the Dox Formation, corroborated the dating of mica grains, and showed that much of the Unkar Group (excluding the Bass Formation) was deposited between 1170 and 1100 Ma, and that the Dox formation was deposited after 1140 Ma. The age of the overlying Cardenas Basalt demonstrates that the Dox Formation accumulated before 1104 Ma.|$|E

30|$|Here {{we present}} a method for the {{preparation}} of nanostructured SU- 8 <b>microprobes</b> to improve neuronal binding and growth. We used SU- 8 because of its biocompatibility and suitability for neural interface implants [19, 20]. We can apply the proposed procedure to the preparation of planar <b>microprobes,</b> as discussed in our previous work [17]. Therefore, the <b>microprobes</b> were prepared by conventional photolithography and the nanostructures on their surface were then realized by nanospheric lithography (NSL) [21, 22]. In addition, a nanostructured surface can be patterned as desired simply by covering undesired areas with {{a thin layer of}} metal. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the surface nanostructures. The adhesion and outgrowth of PC 12 cells was improved on the nanostructured SU- 8 <b>microprobes.</b> Our results suggest that nanostructured SU- 8 <b>microprobes</b> provide a flexible neural interface that enhances their long-term performance and stability.|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} introduced {{a series of}} stimuli-responsive, mechanically adaptive polymer nanocomposites. Here, we report the first application of these bio-inspired materials as substrates for intracortical microelectrodes. Our hypothesis is that the ideal electrode should be initially stiff to facilitate minimal trauma during insertion into the cortex, yet become mechanically compliant to match the stiffness of the brain tissue and minimize forces exerted on the tissue, attenuating inflammation. <b>Microprobes</b> created from mechanically reinforced nanocomposites demonstrated a significant advantage compared to model <b>microprobes</b> composed of neat polymer only. The nanocomposite <b>microprobes</b> exhibit a higher storage modulus (E' = ~ 5 GPa) than the neat polymer <b>microprobes</b> (E' = ~ 2 GPa) and can sustain higher loads (~ 12 mN), facilitating penetration through the pia mater and insertion into the cerebral cortex of a rat. In contrast, the neat polymer <b>microprobes</b> mechanically failed under lower loads (~ 7 mN) before they were capable of insertion into cortical tissue. Further, we demonstrated the material's ability to morph while in the rat cortex to more closely match the mechanical properties of the cortical tissue. Nanocomposite <b>microprobes</b> that were implanted into the rat cortex for up to eight weeks demonstrated increased cell density at the microelectrode–tissue interface {{and a lack of}} tissue necrosis or excessive gliosis. This body of work introduces our nanocomposite-based <b>microprobes</b> as adaptive substrates for intracortical microelectrodes and potentially for other biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a low cost, Low Area Probing Detector (LAPD) is presented. Probing or <b>microprobing</b> is {{an attack}} {{technique}} against integrated circuits implementing security functions, such as OTP tokens or smartcards.

5000|$|In 1948-1950, Raymond Castaing, {{supervised}} by André Guinier, {{built the first}} electron “microsonde électronique” (electron <b>microprobe)</b> at ONERA. This <b>microprobe</b> produced an electron beam diameter of 1-3 μm with a beam current of ~10 nanoamperes (nA) and used a Geiger counter to detect the X-rays produced from the sample. However, the Geiger counter could not distinguish X-rays produced from specific elements and in 1950, Castaing added a quartz crystal between the sample and the detector to permit wavelength discrimination. He also added an optical microscope to view the point of beam impact. The resulting <b>microprobe</b> was described in Castaing's 1951 PhD Thesis, in which he laid {{the foundations of the}} theory and application of quantitative analysis by electron <b>microprobe,</b> establishing the theoretical framework for the matrix corrections of absorption and fluorescence effects.

30|$|To compare {{neuronal}} development between nanostructured and non-nanostructured <b>microprobes,</b> {{the number}} of neurites extended per PC 12 cell was determined in phase-contrast optical images. Figure  5 d shows {{the number of}} neurites per differentiated PC 12 cell on non–nanostructured and nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> for 5  days after NGF treatment. Differentiation of PC 12 cells was significantly greater on nanostructured than on non-nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> (p <  0.001). In contrast, few PC 12 cells were attached to non-nanostructured <b>microprobes,</b> and those that did attach were {{in close proximity to}} each other (Fig.  5 a). Because PC 12 cells differentiate as they attach to the surface, similar to our previous study, they showed low neurite outgrowth over time at 5  days after NGF treatment [18]. It {{is interesting to note that}} the length of PC 12 neurite extension on nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> is similar to that on rat tail collagen type I coated culture dishes [28]. As shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 2, PC 12 cells extended to the longest neurite length for about 150  μm 10  days after NGF treatment. Surface attachment and growth by PC 12 cells typically require an adhesive coating (e.g., PLL), but nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> enhance cell adhesion and differentiation without the requirement for a surface coating. Nanostructures are permanent; in contrast, the effect on cell adhesion of a coating of adhesion molecules is limited by the inevitable degradation over time [29]. Therefore, nanostructured <b>microprobes</b> support neuronal growth for longer periods than those with conventional surface coatings.|$|R
