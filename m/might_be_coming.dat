25|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} in June 1864 that the Civil War <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to a close, employers attempted to cut wages. The union responded with a nationwide strike of its members, which lasted eight months. The strike ended on February 13, 1865, when the employers agreed to a wage scale based {{on the price of}} iron bars—the first time employers recognized the union, the first union contract in the iron and steel industry, and what may be the first union contract of any kind in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Wilson has {{proposed}} that the observed variations are caused by irregularities in the orbit of Mars. William Feldman speculates the warming could be because Mars <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> out of an ice age. Other scientists state the warming may {{be a result of}} albedo changes from dust storms. [...] The study predicts the planet could continue to warm, as a result of positive feedback.|$|E
2500|$|Unexpected as {{this opinion}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from a {{recently}} retired general, {{it at least}} expressed a fairly orthodox Socialist position. From this point on, however, Holdridge's public statements [...] would become increasingly unorthodox and inconsistent, reflecting no coherent ideological basis. Opposition to mental health reform and the Roman Catholic Church, commitment to pacifism, and championship of returning Native American tribes to government by traditional chieftains, were among the few positions that he did hold consistently over the years.|$|E

60|$|Fitzpiers {{feared that}} she <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to him even now, and hastily quitting the room, he {{ran down the}} path to meet her. The nature of her errand he could not divine, but he was {{prepared}} to give her any amount of encouragement.|$|R
60|$|But it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> just <b>coming</b> out, {{and what}} a shame to move! A skin that would bring five dollars was surely worth waiting {{for a little while}} longer, and he might never have such another chance. He {{certainly}} had never had such a one before.|$|R
2500|$|In 2006 Airbus {{started the}} A320 Enhanced (A320E) {{programme}} {{as a series}} of improvements targeting a 4–5% efficiency gain with large winglets (2%), aerodynamic refinements (1%), weight savings and a new aircraft cabin. At the time Airbus' Chief Operating Officer and executive member John Leahy said [...] "Who's going to roll over a fleet to a new generation aircraft for 5% better than an A320 today? Especially if another 10% improvement <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> {{in the second half of}} the next decade based on new engine technology".|$|E
2500|$|All's {{previous}} albums {{had been}} released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{imperial}} collection had {{its origins}} {{in the first century}} BC, and had gone through many vicissitudes of fire, civil wars and foreign invasions in the centuries that followed. But it was Qianlong who lavished the greatest attention on it, certainly of any of the Manchu rulers... One of the many roles played by Qianlong, with his customary diligence, was that of the emperor as collector and curator. ...how carefully Qianlong followed the art market in rare paintings and antiquities, using a team of cultural advisers, from elderly Chinese literati to newly fledged Manchu connoisseurs. These men would help the emperor spot which great private collections <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> up for sale, either because the fortunes of some previously rich merchant family were unraveling or because the precious objects acquired by Manchu or Chinese grandees during the chaos of the conquest period were no longer valued by those families' surviving heirs. Sometimes, too, Qianlong would pressure or even force wealthy courtiers into yielding up choice art objects: he did this by pointing out failings in their work, which might be excused if they made a certain [...] "gift", or, in a couple of celebrated cases, by persuading the current owners that only the secure walls of the forbidden City and its guardians could save some precious painting from theft or from fire.|$|E

I spoke to him in German." ...|$|R
40|$|So {{it looks}} like the Unitary Patent system now finally seems to <b>be</b> <b>coming.</b> But why does it look so awkward, why is the design so {{peculiar}} and complicated?

Whether or not they <b>might</b> still <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>is</b> assessed by way of an outlook...|$|R

60|$|More {{and more}} {{soldiers}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>coming</b> down the roads towards the town, {{not by any}} means always looking as gay as that first troop. Some of the feathers were as draggled as the old cock's tail after a thunderstorm, some reduced even to the quill, the coats looked threadbare, the scarves stained and frayed, the horses lean and bony.|$|R
60|$|Little {{girls were}} not allowed at the piano when {{officers}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> in from the dining-room, so Maria's face became vacant again, for Juliana's music awoke no echoes within her.|$|E

6000|$|With {{another word}} or two of thanks the boys said good-bye to her, and Miss Sinclair at once went on her way with a final warning, [...] "Be sure and be leisurely in your movements.

5000|$|Shared Belief {{appeared}} to hamper the runner-up when hanging in towards the rail {{at the top}} of the stretch, but after a stewards' inquiry the result was allowed to stand.

I should dislike to do any young man an injury; but it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> anyone <b>coming</b> to a gentleman without a character, like this young man.

50|$|Back at the White household, Carrie {{is still}} locked in her prayer closet {{surrounded}} by religious icons. Margaret, meanwhile, pleads {{for her own}} divine guidance. As Carrie puzzles over this new sensation she's been feeling, she grows more agitated. Suddenly, a little figurine of Jesus levitates, leaving Carrie to wonder if this strange power <b>might</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> from within her. Margaret releases her from the closet and tearfully apologizes for her actions, prompting Carrie to beg for forgiveness as well.

Gold also gave her instructions to use a cloaking spell because there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> others <b>coming</b> {{from the outside world}} to destroy Storybrooke, and after alerting the residents of the threat, she places the spell around the city limits by opening a vein of fairy dust in the mines; however, a pair of brothers arriving from Minnesota in a convertible managed to sneak in just in time, as they are revealed to be the contacts from Peter Pan's Home Office. Five days later, the seven dwarfs are having lunch by the beach talking about how quiet it has been since Regina, Snow and Charming have left and no killings have occurred, when Leroy witnesses Ariel emerging from the ocean. She tells Leroy that she was sent on a mission from Neverland to contact Belle and retrieve an item that's stored in Gold's pawn shop. Unfortunately, this exchange is being watched from afar as the brothers are given their orders to make sure that Ariel never makes it back to Neverland with the item.|$|R
