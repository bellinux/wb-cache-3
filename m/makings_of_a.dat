25|$|After leaving Cambridge, Henderson {{returned}} to county cricket, {{this time with}} Glamorgan. Between mid-1983 {{and the end of}} 1985 he made 27 first-class and 27 List A appearances for the Welsh county, and was considered in some quarters to have the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> captain.|$|E
25|$|Born in Dinan in Brittany, {{the son of}} {{a cabinet}} maker, Auguste Pavie did not have the usual <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diplomat. He had no {{training}} at all either as a military officer or in the grandes écoles. Instead, drawn by the prospect of adventure in distant lands, he joined the army in 1864 at the age of seventeen.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, the Army ordered three TA-3 (Trainer, Air-cooled, Type 3) {{machines}} for evaluation with the Le Rhone engine and dual controls. Evaluation {{showed that the}} type had the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good trainer, but was somewhat lacking in power, so in 1923 Dayton-Wright re-engined one TA-3 with a more powerful 110hp (82 kW) Le Rhone.|$|E

5000|$|The documentary/drama has, {{what some}} critics have called, an odd style. For example, {{director}} Carri appears on film as herself in some scenes, but also uses an actor to portray her in other scenes. A.O. Scott writes that the film [...] "is {{not so much a}} documentary as a fictional film about the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> documentary, or perhaps a documentary about the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fictional film about the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> documentary." ...|$|R
25|$|Richmond {{writes a}} press release in his office, despite Gwen's insistence that he rest. He replies {{that he does not}} want Jamie's actions to define his legacy as mayor. Former mayor Lesley Adams (Tom Butler) later speaks with Richmond in the City Council {{chambers}} and offers his condolences about Jamie. He also tells him that he has the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great leader.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a further}} dip in {{fortunes}} {{towards the end}} of the 1960s, but, though County Championship success continued to elude the county, Somerset finally found in the 1970s the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful one-day team under the combative, inspirational captaincy of Yorkshireman Brian Close. A trio of world class players, Viv Richards, Joel 'Big Bird' Garner and the England all-rounder Ian Botham made the team for the first time in its long history a formidable trophy winning proposition.|$|E
25|$|McCoy {{felt he had}} the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> great Gators squad in 1916, {{compiling}} {{the most}} ambitious and difficult Gators football schedule to date. The team, captained by Rex Farrior, faced the Alabama Crimson Tide and Tennessee Volunteers for the first time. The ill-fated 1916 team lost every game, faced multiple transfers, began the season with an injury to Ramsdell and ended it with one to Farrior. The Gators were shut out {{in all but the}} last game, a 14–3 loss to Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Literary critic Hugh M. Richmond {{notes that}} Richard's {{beliefs about the}} Divine Right of Kings tend to fall {{more in line with}} the medieval view of the throne. Bolingbroke on the other hand {{represents}} a more modern view of the throne, arguing that not only bloodline but also intellect and political savvy contribute to the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good king. Richard believes that as king he is chosen and guided by God, that he is not subject to human frailty, and that the English people are his to do with as he pleases. Elliott argues that this mistaken notion of his role as king ultimately leads to Richard's failure. Elliott goes on further to point out that it is Bolingbroke's ability to relate and speak with those of the middle and lower classes that allows him to take the throne.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine's biographers Michael Crick and Julian Critchley recount how, despite {{not having}} an innate gift for public speaking, {{he became a}} strong orator through much effort, which {{included}} practising his speeches {{in front of a}} mirror, listening to tape recordings of speeches by television administrator Charles Hill, and taking voice-coaching lessons from a vicar's wife. In the 1970s and 1980s Heseltine's conference speech was often to be the highlight of the Conservative Party Conference despite his views being well {{to the left of the}} then leader Margaret Thatcher. He was eventually elected to the Library Committee of the Oxford Union for Hilary (Spring) Term 1953. The Oxford Union minutes record after a debate on 12 February 1953 that “Mr Heseltine should guard against artificial mannerisms of voice and calculated flourishes of self-conscious histrionics; this is only worth saying because he has the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> first class speaker”.|$|E
25|$|By the 1830s, {{the house}} and estate was in the {{ownership}} of Edmund's descendant Peter Hesketh, High Sheriff of Lancashire and MP for Preston. A man of somewhat liberal views for his time, Hesketh believed that the sheltered harbour and views over Morecambe Bay gave the area the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> busy seaport and popular resort for the less-affluent. With no rail link between London and Scotland, he envisaged Fleetwood as the transfer point between the railway and the steamers to Scotland, and set about encouraging a railway link from Preston. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he engaged Frederick Kemp as his agent. He originally considered naming the new town Wyreton or New Liverpool, but after changing his name to Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831, he settled on the name Fleetwood. After some delays, he recruited the prominent architect Decimus Burton, whose work in St Leonard's-on-Sea he had admired, to lay out {{what would be the}} first planned town of the Victorian era. The plans were complete by 1835, and construction of the first buildings and the railway line began in 1836.|$|E

500|$|Some {{media outlets}} were more {{critical}} of the show. Chicago Tribune television critic Steve Johnson lamented that Goldberg [...] "settled into bland script reading that made one long for David Letterman's cranky unpredictability in the role last year." [...] He also stated that the [...] "Best Costume Design fashion show" [...] was the silliest opening Oscar production number since Rob Lowe and Snow White sang [...] "Proud Mary" [...] in 1989. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly bemoaned that the dominance of Best Picture winner Braveheart {{and the lack of}} fashion glamour [...] "had the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tiresome evening." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in its history, Harry Potter {{received}} positive reviews.

Soon the English newspapers joined in, {{with more than one}} comparing it to Roald Dahl's work: The Mail on Sunday rated it as [...] "the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl", a view echoed by The Sunday Times ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"), while The Guardian called it [...] "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit".|$|E
500|$|Although the 1984 season had all off the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> memorable one for West Virginia, the Mountaineers {{experienced}} another letdown.

[...] The Mountaineers were upset in each of their final three regular season games, however, losing to Virginia, Rutgers and Temple. WVU rebounded to defeat Texas Christian in the Bluebonnet Bowl, finishing the season at 8–4 with a No. 21 ranking in the final Coaches poll. [...] The Mountaineers also produced three All-Americans in return specialist Willie Drewrey, kicker Paul Woodside, and tight end Rob Bennett.|$|E

500|$|Larwood {{was first}} called for full county duty on 20 August 1924, against Northamptonshire, at Trent Bridge. He bowled 26 overs in all, conceded 71 runs {{and took the}} wicket of Vallance Jupp, an {{experienced}} Test all-rounder. His assessment of his performance was negative: [...] "I wasn't ready". Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning. Larwood had also gained {{the support of the}} county captain, Arthur Carr, a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future Test match bowler. [...] "The {{best way to deal with}} him", Carr said later, [...] "was as if he was my own son". Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler's talents, and acted as Larwood's guiding spirit throughout the latter's career.|$|E
500|$|Until the 19th century AD, European-written music {{histories}} {{began with}} mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included Jubal, descendant of Cain and [...] "father of all such as handle the harp and the organ", Pan, {{inventor of the}} pan pipes, and Mercury, {{who is said to}} have made a dried tortoise shell into the first lyre. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive [...] "invention" [...] of the musical instrument since the definition of the term [...] "musical instrument" [...] is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a Homo habilis slapping his body could be the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.|$|E
500|$|When Spider-Man first {{appeared}} in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist.

While Spider-Man had all the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that [...] "with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben.|$|E

500|$|Much {{was made}} of Arsenal's policy of using the League Cup to field youngsters. In order to explain his team selection, Wenger made an analogy between his youth players and hopefuls on The X Factor, a {{television}} programme he admired. He ruled out playing his more experienced players for the match: [...] "We battled {{very hard to be}} in this final {{and it would be a}} reward for this team, which has risen up to every challenge." [...] When contrasting the two teams, Wenger said: [...] "The game of Chelsea is based on experience and power, ours will be based on mobility and movement." [...] Mourinho did not anticipate Arsenal would make a [...] "crazy change" [...] to their team: [...] "Normally, they change players but keep their philosophy, their idea of football, their system." [...] He believed the final had the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> showpiece event as the competition was not a main target for both clubs; emotions therefore would not dictate matters.|$|E
500|$|Fazekas said that, [...] "Whitney is used {{to people}} {{treating}} her {{with a certain amount}} of deference, because she’s a famous actress, and she’s met her match in Peggy." [...] She added that in the series, [...] "You see the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> villain, but she doesn't start off evil. She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend. And like many friends and family, you end up , but he’s always there ... he knows I can do what I say I can do, especially in the science world. So he’s really the only one who gets me." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindsey Fraser, who had {{supplied}} {{one of the}} blurb comments, wrote what {{is thought}} to be the first published review, in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997. She described Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as [...] "a hugely entertaining thriller" [...] and Rowling as [...] "a first-rate writer for children". Another early review, in The Herald, said, [...] "I have yet to find a child who can put it down." [...] Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday, and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. The Mail on Sunday rated it as [...] "the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl"; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"), while The Guardian called it [...] "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" [...] and The Scotsman said it had [...] "all the <b>makings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> classic".|$|E
