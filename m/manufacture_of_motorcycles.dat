50|$|Asahi Metal Industry Co. was an {{international}} corporation based in Japan, which manufactured a valve {{used in the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>motorcycle</b> wheels.

As {{a result of the}} accident the driver <b>of</b> the <b>motorcycle</b> sustained serious injuries and his wife, who was riding on the motorcycle as a passenger, was killed. The accident victim sued Cheng Shin in a California state court, and Cheng Shin in turn filed a third-party complaint (impleader) seeking indemnification from Asahi. Asahi contested California's personal jurisdiction over Asahi, but the California courts found jurisdiction based on Asahi's alleged awareness of the international distribution of its products. Specifically, Asahi moved to quash Cheng Shin's summons. The California Superior Court denied the motion but the Court of Appeals issued a writ of mandamus to the state of California telling them to quash the summons. The California Supreme Court reversed this decision, leading Asahi to appeal to the United States Supreme Court.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study is to {{describe}} the characteristics of emblems as accessories for motorcycles particularly in the aspect of the design process, materials used, colours, shape and form, motifs, surface fmishing, size and placement. At the moment there is no proper documentation in relation to emblem development. This has caused difficulties for designers, students and manufacturers who want information for references. This study is confined to these eight areas and it is not intended to touch on other areas related to motorcycles. Data for this research was gathered through the use of observation and questionnaire. Researcher observes about 151 pieces ofemblems on the market. The questionnaire was divided into two parts, A and B. Part A was intended to gather information on the respondents while Part B contained eight sections, each related to the eight areas understudy. Every section contains between nine to twenty nine statements. There were eight experts selected as respondents. These respondents were motorcycle and emblem manufacturers. This research has reached the following findings. First, the design is an important aspect of the whole process of emblem development. Secondly, emblems are either made of metal or plastic, though plastic is more preferred than metal. Thirdly, manufacturers tend to use a common colour for their motorcycle emblems. Fourthly, emblems do not have a specific shape and fonn. Fifthly, brand names, models and corporate logos are primary motifs for emblems. Sixthly, the surface finishing is important for motorcycle emblems. Seventhly, emblems do not have a specific size. Lastly, emblems do have a specific location and as a decoration parts to be applied on motorcycles. An emblem is an important component in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> a <b>motorcycle</b> because its role is not only for aesthetical purposes but also for its corporate image ofthe company, trademark and identity for its product It is also used for effective marketing <b>of</b> the <b>motorcycle.</b> Because <b>of</b> its importance, <b>motorcycle</b> manufacturers must implement a systematic work system for emblem development to ensure a high quality in design and production...|$|R

METHODS: Based on the literature review of effect of 4 -wheel vehicle inspection, probability of occurring accidents among defective motorcycles are calculated by using the number <b>of</b> estimated defective <b>motorcycles</b> and accidents resulting from defects <b>of</b> <b>motorcycles.</b> Then, the number of decreased accidents which is resulting from eliminating defects <b>of</b> <b>motorcycles</b> by safety inspection is estimated by using probability of occurring accidents among defective motorcycles. RESULTS: If the ratio of eliminating defects <b>of</b> <b>motorcycles</b> is 95 % after motorcycle safety inspection, the effects of accident decrease <b>of</b> <b>motorcycle</b> safety inspection are analyzed from 2005 to 2008.
