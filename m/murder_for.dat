5|$|The State of California charged Alvarado and {{his friend}} with first-degree murder and {{attempted}} robbery. Alvarado attempted to suppress his statements given during the Comstock interview {{on the basis that}} he was not read his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time he gave his statement. Alvarado was subsequently convicted, primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation. Alvarado's conviction was reduced by the trial judge to second-degree <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> his comparatively minor role in the offense. The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the conviction and agreed that Alvarado was not in custody. The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review.|$|E

5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours. They presented three witnesses and then rested their case. Fischer's mother took the stand and gave her final testimony, and her version of the story. The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought the death penalty for both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree <b>murder</b> (<b>for</b> the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January 2005, when Basciano {{was indicted}} for the Pizzolo murder, Massino was {{identified}} by news sources as the then-anonymous fellow mobster who secretly recorded his confession, to the public disgust of Massino's family. Further confirmation of Massino's defection came in February as he was identified as the source for the graveyard, then in May when the Justice Department dropped {{the threat of the}} death penalty regarding the Sciascia case. In a hearing on June 23, 2005, Massino finalized his deal and plead guilty to ordering the Sciascia <b>murder.</b> <b>For</b> this and his 2004 conviction he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, with a possible reduction depending on his service as a witness. That same day Josephine Massino negotiated a settlement to satisfy the forfeiture claim, keeping the homes of herself and Massino's mother as well as some rental properties while turning over, among other assets, a cache of $7 million and hundreds of gold bars, and the Casablanca restaurant.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Gröning had been charged by state prosecutors with having been an accessory to <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> his role at Auschwitz receiving and processing prisoners and their personal belongings. The indictment stated that Gröning economically advanced Nazi Germany and aided the systematic killing of 300,000 of the 425,000 Hungarian Jews who were deported to Auschwitz by 137 railway transports during the summer of 1944. Gröning's prosecution has been reported {{to be a part of}} Germany’s final effort to bring the last Nazi war-crimes suspects to justice. State prosecutors managed to charge the defendant on a legal precedent set in 2011 by the conviction of the former Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk by a court in Munich.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{multiple}} {{people have}} been arrested for helping Clemmons {{during and after the}} Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he drove him to the coffee shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E
5|$|Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court {{declined}} to overturn a state court's conclusion that a minor was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview. Michael Alvarado helped his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in Santa Fe Springs, California. The truck owner was killed by Soto during the robbery and Alvarado was convicted of second-degree <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> his role in the crime. The evidence for Alvarado's conviction was primarily based on statements given by Alvarado during a two-hour police interrogation that occurred when Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station. Alvarado was 17 years old and was not read his Miranda rights before questioning. During Alvarado's murder trial in a state court, motions to suppress the statements given by Alvarado were denied on the ground that Alvarado was not in police custody {{at the time of the}} interrogation and thus did not have to be read his Miranda rights. Alvarado appealed his conviction, claiming that the determination that he was not in custody was incorrect because the courts did not take his age into account.|$|E

5|$|Cassander married Philip II's {{daughter}} Thessalonike, inducting {{him into}} the Argead dynastic house, and briefly extended Macedonian control into Illyria as far as Epidamnos, although by 313 BC, it was retaken by the Illyrian king Glaucias of Taulantii. By 316 BC, Antigonus had taken the territory of Eumenes and managed to eject Seleucus Nicator from his satrapy of Babylonia; in reaction to this a coalition of Cassander, Ptolemy, and Lysimachus issued an ultimatum to Antigonus in 315 BC for him to surrender various territories in Asia. Antigonus promptly allied with Polyperchon, now based in Corinth, and issued an ultimatum of his own to Cassander, charging him with <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> executing Olympias and demanding that he hand over the royal family, king Alexander IV and the queen mother Roxana. The conflict that followed lasted until the winter of 312/311 BC, when a new peace settlement recognized Cassander as general of Europe, Antigonus as 'first in Asia', Ptolemy as general of Egypt, and Lysimachus as general of Thrace. Cassander had Alexander IV and Roxana put {{to death in the}} winter of 311/310 BC, had Heracles of Macedon executed in 309 BC as part of a peace settlement with Polyperchon, and by 306–305 BC the diadochi were declared kings of their respective territories.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying <b>murder</b> <b>for</b> a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E
