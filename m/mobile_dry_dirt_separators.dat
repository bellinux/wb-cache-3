Because the outer groove pattern has a pumping direction opposite from that of the seal, dirt is pumped away from the seal and can be collected in a suitable debris trap remote from the seal location...|$|R
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation and warmth.

In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, <b>dry</b> <b>dirt</b> and grass to build nests.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of this thesis the new two-dimensional detector array maXs 30 was developed, fabricated and characterized. It is optimized for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the energy range up to 30 keV and consists of 8 x 8 individual metallic magnetic calorimeters. These detectors combine the good energy resolution of crystal spectrometers and the large energy bandwidth of semiconductor detectors and measure the energy of each absorbed photon by the resulting temperature change. This change is converted to a change of magnetization by the paramagnetic alloy Ag:Er, which is read out by sensitive SQUID magnetometers. The detector can be mounted on the side arm of a <b>mobile</b> <b>dry</b> dilution refrigerator and a new 32 channel acquisition system has been developed for this array. The intrinsic energy resolution of the maXs 30 detector {{was measured to be}} 7. 9 eV (FWHM) and a resolving power of almost 3000 was achieved for X-rays with an energy of 60 keV.

40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1].

40|$|The jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula), {{a member}} of the {{primitive}} Myrmecia genus of ants, is well known for its aggressive behaviour and painful, sometimes dangerous sting. However, although the ant is well known to Tasmanians, there are few published studies of its biology or ecology. This project is an attempt to address this lack of research and seeks to explore the interaction between humans and jack jumpers by understanding better the preferred habitat of the ant. Two studies were undertaken within the boundaries of the study area: Hobart City Council, Tasmania, Australia. In the first study, jack jumper nests were searched for ten times in transects, in each of the natural vegetation types. Data were collected on {{the presence or absence of}} jack jumper nests, vegetation type, vegetation structure, moss cover, bare ground cover, coarse woody debris cover, rock cover, litter cover, litter depth, and distance to nearest tree as well as observations made about each nest that was found. In the second study, residents of Hobart were surveyed using a questionnaire regarding the features of their property and whether they had ever seen a jack jumper nest or ant on their property. They were also asked to outline the circumstances in which they were stung. To analyse the data, thematic analyses, correlation analyses, analysis of variance, Wilcoxon tests, chi-square testing, logistic regression and ordination were used. The results of the study showed that, within the Hobart City Council boundary, jack jumpers are co-extensive with dry eucalypt open woodlands. These warm, dry and relatively open environments provide the ant with a combination of insolation for warmth and vegetation for food resources such as nectar and invertebrate prey. They also utilise the radiative warmth of rocks and dry soil and often. enhance their nest's thermal capacity with decorations of seeds, soil, charcoal, stones, sticks and sometimes small vertebrate bones. In a suburban context the ants are associated with native vegetation whilst utilising cracks in concrete, walls, rockeries, <b>dry</b> <b>dirt</b> and <b>dry</b> grassy areas to construct nests. The suburbs with a significant matrix of native vegetation such as Mt. Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart all contain the ants, whereas the heavily built up areas of Battery point and North Hobart do not. Humans are most likely to be stung by a jack jumper ant in their property when carrying out outdoor duties such as gardening or collecting firewood. They may also be stung whilst walking bare foot. A common sense approach should be employed in order to avoid a sting from a jack jumper. For those wishing to live in areas that do not contain the ant, the built up suburbs of Hobart are recommended...|$|R
40|$|The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH OMSHR) {{conducted}} {{laboratory testing}} of a self-tramming, remotely controlled <b>mobile</b> <b>Dry</b> Scrubber (DS) that J. H. Fletcher and Co. developed under {{a contract with}} NIOSH OMSHR to reduce the exposure of miners to airborne dust. The scrubber was found to average greater than 95 percent dust removal efficiency with disposable filters, and 88 and 90 percent, respectively, with optional washable filters in their prewash and post-wash test conditions. Although the washable filters can be reused, washing them generated personal and downstream respirable dust concentrations of 1. 2 and 8. 3 mg/m(3), respectively, for a 10 -min washing period. The scrubber's velocity-pressure-regulated variable-frequency-drive fan maintained relatively consistent airflow near the targeted 1. 42 and 4. 25 m(3) /s (3, 000 and 9, 000 ft(3) /min) airflow rates {{during most of the}} laboratory dust testing until reaching its maximum 60 -Hz fan motor frequency or horsepower rating at 2, 610 Pa (10. 5 in. w. g.) of filter differential pressure and 3. 97 m(3) /s (8, 420 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow quantity. Laboratory sound level measurements of the scrubber showed that the outlet side of the scrubber was noisier, and the loaded filters increased sound levels compared with clean filters at the same airflow quantities. With loaded filters, the scrubber reached a 90 dB(A) sound level at 2. 83 m(3) /s (6, 000 ft(3) /min) of scrubber airflow, indicating that miners should not be overexposed in relation to MSHA's permissible exposure level - under Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations Part 62. 101 - of 90 dB(A) at or below this airflow quantity. The scrubber's washable filters were not used during field-testing because of their lower respirable dust removal efficiency and the airborne dust generated by filter washing. Field-testing the scrubber with disposable filters at two underground coal mine sections showed that it could clean a portion of the section return air and provide dust reduction of about 50 percent at the face area downstream of the continuous-miner operation.
