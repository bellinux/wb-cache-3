30|$|The {{existing}} {{scenario of}} <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management in Indian cities is highly unsatisfactory (Rawat et al. 2013; Sharma et al. 2017). It is {{reported that the}} total <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> <b>generated</b> in India is 1, 35, 198 tons per day (TPD) (CPCB 2010). Of the total <b>waste</b> <b>generated</b> in India, the overall collection efficiency of waste is only 70 % and treated waste accounts for 12.5 % and the remaining proportion (17.5 %) not being collected. The average collection efficiency <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> in Indian cities is significantly influenced by lack of adequate waste transportation vehicles with a reported study mentioning that almost 70 % of cities in India in lacking such basic facilities (Sharma et al. 2018). Further, the enhanced rate of migration from rural to the urban areas has led to overwhelming demographic growth in many cities worldwide including India. In today’s burgeoning economy, with rapid industrialization majority of Indian population has rapidly migrated from rural to urban areas. This has led to further increased growth of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) <b>generated</b> in urban areas. The variation in the waste fraction mainly depends on the economic condition of the city (Sarkar and Chourasia 2017). Presently, the rate of MSW generation in India varies from 0.2 to 0.87  kg per capita per day (Kumar and Goel 2009; Rana et al. 2018) varying from rural to urban locations and this {{is expected to increase}} further for urban areas. The management of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> <b>generated</b> in most of the Indian cities is a problematic issue with slightly better management practices in Metro and Tier-I cities due to slightly increased resources. However, with increased generation rates of MSW along with growth and influx of population in these cities, a critical stage is being reached due to the unavailability of adequate facilities to treat and dispose such voluminous quantities of wastes (Gupta and Arora 2016). This poor management of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> in developing countries including India is of severe concern, particularly with open dumping of wastes being the easiest and cost-effective methods of disposal (Kumar et al. 2009; Shekdar 2009). The lack of waste management including collection and treatment of waste leads to global warming because organic waste fraction is one of the causes of gas emission (Pandyaswargo et al. 2014).|$|R

Four lysimeters with diameter and height of 0. 15 and 3. 00 m, respectively, were prepared. Three lysimeters were filled with municipal waste and three different cover soil types i. e. sandy loam soil, silty loam soil and clay soil while another lysimeter was filled solely with municipal waste. The study was conducted in the rainy season. Leachate quantities were measured every day and leachate characteristics were determined once a week. The cumulative leachate quantity from the lysimeter filled solely with municipal waste was found to be around 27 % higher than the lysimeters using cover soils. There were no any differences of the cumulative leachate amounts generated from the lysimeters using three types of soils. The comparison of the total mass of pollutants generated from all lysimeters showed that the lysimeter filled solely with <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> <b>generated</b> the maximum quantities of pollutants.

The effectiveness of the slurry mixes was assessed using typical tests including Marsh funnel viscosity, density, and filtrate loss. Filter cake permeability was also determined. Corrugated board was fiberized for the test program. Test results indicated that corrugated board could be used to replace 9 to 27 % (0. 5 to 1. 5 % corrugate content) of bentonite in slurry mixes with a total solids content of 5. 5 %. Slurry applications provide a new and viable beneficial reuse alternative for paper/paperboard products, which constitute the largest weight and volume fraction of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> <b>generated</b> and disposed of in the U.

40|$|The {{study of}} Toyohashi city 8 ̆ 1 fs {{economic}} growth and resultant growth in <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> management were empirically examined by the relation between city economic growth, city expenditure for solid <b>waste</b> management and <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste.</b> The growth {{in the economy and}} the population has increased discharge of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> in Toyohashi city. The economic size of the city is identified as a strong explanatory variable. Various kinds of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> were <b>generated</b> with the city growth. Our study found that during the period of 1980 to 2005, Toyohashi city grew fast and, disposal <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> of the city was increased as a by-product of economic activities. Such increase in solid waste disposal put in more on demand for policy and technological interventions. As a result, the city expenditures on waste management increased during the same period. The city opened its high-tech waste treatment facility in 1984. The facility provides waste to heat and power generation technology (Toyohashi city, 2011). Later on, the national concept of the sound-material based society supports the city to initiate efficient and effective <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> management strategy from 2001 onward (Tachibana, et al., 2008). The positive coefficient of economic level for generation of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> was positive. The result denotes that economic growth put upward pressure to the <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> generation. The negative coefficient of (economic level) 2 indicates governmental initiative to manage the <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> generation in terms of regulations and/or technology was successful in case of Toyohashi city. The coefficient of per capita city expenditures for generation of <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> was positive and the expenditures on management of the <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> grew steadily. The result implies that the higher the <b>waste</b> <b>generated,</b> the more the city needs to spend more for waste management. The negative coefficient of per capita (city expenditures) 2 indicates technological and regulatory intervention was appropriate to manage the <b>waste</b> <b>generated</b> by the city. The results provide theoretical and practical significance and proposition. The growth of Toyohashi city was positively correlated to produce higher <b>municipal</b> solid <b>waste</b> while better regulatory intervention and technological improvement could end up well management of the <b>waste</b> <b>generated...</b>|$|R
