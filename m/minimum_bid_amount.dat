30|$|There are {{currently}} many P 2 P lending platforms in the world; all these platforms have adopted similar lending mechanisms. Users can become lenders and borrowers after registering. Borrowers release loan information, loan amounts, allowable highest interest rate, borrowing reasons, {{and other personal}} information on the platform. After verification by the platform, this information is presented to lenders. According {{to the list of}} borrowing information, lenders decide whether to loan, the loan amount and what interest rate to apply (i.e., the bid amount and interest rates), etc. Websites will usually require a <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> <b>amount</b> (e.g., 50 yuan), and a borrower accepts many bidders. Within the borrowing deadline, when the total bid exceeds the borrowing amount, lower interest rates triumph. After achieving the loan, lenders’ capital is transferred to the borrower’s account, and the borrower repays the loan over an agreed period of time.|$|E
40|$|Sellers in eBay auctions {{have the}} {{opportunity}} to choose both a public <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> <b>amount</b> and a secret reserve price. We ask, empirically, whether the seller is made better or worse off by setting a secret reserve above a low minimum bid, versus the option of making the reserve public by using it as the minimum bid level. In a field experiment, we auction 50 matched pairs of Pok‚mon cards on eBay, half with secret reserves and half with equivalently high public minimum bids. We find that secret reserve prices make us worse off as sellers, by reducing the probability of the auction resulting in a sale, deterring serious bidders from entering the auction, and lowering the expected transaction price of the auction. We also present evidence that some sellers choose to use secret reserve prices for reasons other than increasing their expected auction prices. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{a one-sided}} {{ascending}} combinatorial auction, bidders place bids on packages of items. When values are interdependent, multi-round auctions are employed to allow price discovery. In such designs, bidders desire {{feedback on the}} estimated prices of items and packages in each round. In addition, prices are often used to set the <b>minimum</b> acceptable <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> for the next round. Due to the combinatorial nature of the winner determination problem, determining the prices of the individual items is not straightforward. The ascending proxy auction (Ausubel-Milgrom, 2001) has been proposed as a design, where the <b>minimum</b> acceptable <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> are a very small increment above the previous high bid on an item or package. These translate to nonlinear and non-anonymous (bidder specific) pricing. When agents are substitutes and the buyer sub-modularity condition is satisfied, the ascending proxy design achieves an efficient outcome at minimum competitive equilibrium prices. But the requirement for an infinitesimally small increment size, results in an auction with {{a very large number}} of rounds. In this paper, we propose two alternative linearpricing schemes that use the game-theoretic concept of the nucleolus to provide price estimates for each item and to determine <b>minimum</b> acceptable <b>bid</b> <b>amounts.</b> We study the effects of such pricing on the length of the auction, the efficiency of the outcome and the prices paid by the winning bidders. We use the linear pricing schemes in an ascending proxy auction framework and benchmark the results against an ascending proxy auction and a faster-to-compute variant of this algorithm that we label the “accelerated proxy auction design”. We also compare our results with those obtained using previously proposed linear pricing schemes...|$|R
40|$|A {{potential}} {{concern in}} “multiple bounded discrete choice” contingent valuation surveys – where the respondent {{is asked to}} express voting certainty, rather than a simple yes or no, on {{a large number of}} payment <b>amounts</b> (<b>bids)</b> – is whether responses are influenced by the particular position of bids in the bid-voting panel rather than solely on the respondent’s willingness to pay (WTP). For instance, respondents may systematically state they would pay the first few <b>bid</b> <b>amounts</b> and not pay all subsequent bids – regardless of the actual dollar values. Such systematic bid design effects would suggest that this method does not provide a valid measure of WTP. Using a split-sample survey, we compare responses to three different bid arrays that have an identical <b>minimum</b> <b>bid,</b> maximum bid, and number of bids. Using nonparametric estimation techniques, we find that estimated WTP distributions and corresponding welfare measures are not statistically different across survey samples.

50|$|In addition, Google {{chose to}} {{introduce}} variable <b>minimum</b> <b>bids</b> {{at the same}} time as it introduced Quality-Based Bidding. On the surface, this new feature allowed advertisers to bid as little as $0.01 to have their ad shown. However, in some cases advertisers found their <b>minimum</b> <b>bids</b> for some ads were raised to as high as $5.00 or $10.00. By implementing variable <b>minimum</b> <b>bids</b> Google created a mechanism whereby the company could set different minimums for different advertisers for the same keyword, and potentially increase the average <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> without the advertising community as a whole being made aware. Furthermore, by raising <b>minimums</b> <b>bids,</b> Google could test each advertiser's ability to pay these increases, thus increasing competitiveness within the auctions and extracting maximum revenue from each advertiser.|$|R

50|$|As noted above, {{the total}} bids must equal 11 {{in order for}} a hand to begin. However, some local house rules {{stipulate}} that when a member of any team reaches 30 points, the total bids in the hand must equal 12 for the hand to begin, because the person with 30 points now has a <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> of 3. The same occurs when a player reaches 40 points (his/her <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> is now 4, therefore the <b>minimum</b> number of <b>bids</b> is 13). Should a second player reach 30, the total bids in the hand should equal to 12.If any member opens their hand to no pictures including the Ace, the member can decide to re-deal the hand.Another variation requires one player to bid 5 tricks equalling to 10 points, but all other players must make <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> of 2 tricks. This variation is commonly referred to as five to run. It is a popular variation because it speeds up the flow of the game.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model of the eBay auction protocol and perform {{a detailed analysis of}} the effects that the eBay proxy bidding system and the <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> increment have on the auction properties. We first consider the revenue of the auction, and we show that when bidders use the eBay proxy bidding system there is an optimal value for the <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> increment at which the auctioneer’s revenue is maximised. We then show that the <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> increment also introduces an inefficiency to the auction, whereby bidders who enter the auction late may find that their valuation is insufficient to allow them to advance the current <b>bid</b> by the <b>minimum</b> <b>bid</b> increment (and this may occur despite them actually having the highest valuation for the item). Finally, we use these results to consider appropriate strategies for bidders. We show that whilst last minute bidding (sniping) is an effective strategy against bidders engaging in incremental bidding (and against those with common values), in general, delaying bidding is disadvantageous. Thus, when several bidders submit last minute bids, we show that rather than seeking to bid as late as possible, a bidder should try to be the first sniper to submit their bid (i. e. they should ‘snipe before the snipers’) ...|$|R
