40|$|Base {{pressure}} measurements {{have been made}} on the fuselage, 10 deg. -wedge vertical fin, and side fairing of the X- 15 airplane. Data are presented for Mach numbers between 1. 1 and 3. 2 for both powered and unpowered flight. Comparisons are made with data from small-scale-model tests, semiempirical estimates, and theory. The results of this preliminary study show that operation of the interim rocket engines (propellant flow rate approximately 70 lb/sec) reduces the base drag of the X- 15 by 25 to 35 percent throughout the test Mach number range. Values of base drag coefficient for the side fairing and fuselage obtained from X- 15 wind-tunnel models were adequate for predicting the overall full-scale performance of the test airplane. The leading-edge sweep of the <b>upper</b> <b>movable</b> vertical fin was not an important factor affecting the fin base pressure.

30|$|In this research, we {{introduce}} a prototype robot named BBot that utilizes the movement momentum to achieve hopping motion. BBot is an improved version of our previous prototype [11] with additional hopping capability. Our {{goal is to}} develop a mobile robot that is able to traverse common terrains such as steps and stairs in an efficient manner. BBot consists of a lower body with wheels and a <b>movable</b> <b>upper</b> body connected to the main chassis by springs. Previous prototype suffers from impact recoil upon landing due to the rigid body structure. The <b>movable</b> <b>upper</b> body acts as an absorber to mitigate the impact force during landing. In addition, BBot uses the spring loaded <b>movable</b> <b>upper</b> body to generate lifting force to hop. We have chosen the two-wheeled structure due to the dynamic nature and simple design. During airborne, BBot uses the drive wheels to generate torque to control the angle of body tilt. As a result, it is resistant to external disturbances when traversing step terrains. Here we describe the hopping mechanism, motion characteristics, sensors, and control algorithms. We discuss the experimental results compare to the theoretical findings, as well as the limitations of the current model.|$|E

30|$|In 2008, Kikuchi et al. [8] {{introduced}} a wheeled-based robot that climbs {{up and down}} stairs dynamically. A spring-loaded <b>movable</b> <b>upper</b> body mass allows their robot to land softly and double-hop in midair. Kikuchi robot consists of a statically stable wheel base. One of the drawbacks {{of this is that}} the robot has to land with minimum body tilt angle to ensure a successful landing. Safe landing is not guaranteed if there exists any external disturbances during airborne. Another jumping robot named iHop[9] is a transformable two wheeled robot. In hoping mode, it uses both wheels as weights and has a lockable hopping mechanism. iHop pushes its wheels upward while balancing on the central chassis. iHop exhibits hoping capability but it is not shown that the robot is capable of climbing up or down step terrains.|$|E
30|$|Most two-wheeled robots have {{algorithms}} {{that control}} balance by assuming constant {{contact with the}} ground. However, such algorithms cannot confer stability in robots deployed on non-continuous ground terrain. Here, we introduce BBot, a robot that can hop as well as move over stepped terrains. BBot has a two-wheeled lower body platform and a spring-loaded <b>movable</b> <b>upper</b> body mass. Hopping results from the impact force produced by release of pre-tensed springs. An inertia measurement unit detects the angle of body tilt, and an ultrasonic distance sensor records the height above ground. An accelerometer in the inertia measurement unit measures the impact force to determine {{the beginning and end}} of the phases of hopping and landing. Torque generated from rotation of the drive wheels controls the airborne robot’s body angle. Sensors detect the impact of landing, and controls immediately switch to ground balance mode to stay upright. Experiment results show that BBot is capable of traversing down a 17  cm step, enduring manual toss landing and hopping 4  cm above ground.|$|E

The obtained values were converted into mega-Pascal units (MPa), according to the following equation: SBS = F / A (N/mm 2 or MPa), where F is the debonding force in Newtons, and A is the cross-sectional surface area of the bracket base in square millimeters.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a mechanism representing {{a kind of}} mechanisms of parallel kinematics with three degrees of freedom based on the crank mechanism. This mechanism consists of two platforms, namely: the lower fixed and the <b>upper</b> <b>movable.</b> The <b>upper</b> platform {{is connected to the}} lower one by six movable elements, three of which are rods attached to the bases by means of spherical joints, and another three have a crank structure. The paper shows an approach to the solution of a direct task of kinematics based on mathematical modeling. The inverse problem of kinematics is formulated as follows: at specified angles of rotation drive (the values of generalized coordinates) to determine the position of the top mobile platform. To solve this problem has been used a mathematical model describing the proposed system. On the basis of the constructed model were made the necessary calculations that allowed us using the values of crank angles connected with the engines to determine the position of the platform in space. To solve the problem we used the method of virtual points {{to reduce the number of}} equations and unknowns, which determine the position of the upper platform in space, at a crucial system from eighteen to nine, thus simplifying the solution. To check the solution correctness was carried out numerical experiment. Each generalized coordinate took on values in the range from - 30 ° to 30 °; for them a direct positional problem was solved, and its result was inserted, as initial data, in the previous solved and proven inverse problem on the position of the platform under study. The paper presents comparative results of measurements with the calculated values of the generalized coordinates and draws the appropriate conclusions, that this model is in good compliance with the results observed in practice. One of the distinctive features of the proposed approach is that rotation angles of engines are used as the generalized coordinates. This allowed us to state the possibility to use the constructed model for the further development of control systems based on it. The paper shows the possibilities to use the presented solution to determine the working area of the mechanism. Computer simulation methods allowed us to find a working area of the manipulator without restrictions on the physical characteristics of a real model. </p...|$|R
30|$|Tradeoff between {{robustness}} {{and increased}} system complexity {{is the main}} challenges faced by many mobile robots. Highly dynamic and robust robots tend to have increased complexity as well as cost of development and manufacturing. Simpler robots, on the other hand, have limited capability {{to be put into}} practical use. In order to tackle this problem, we have created BBot, a dynamically stable two wheeled robot capable of hopping and negotiating step terrains. The dynamic nature and relatively simple mechanical construction enables the robot to have a good compromise between robustness and complexity. We have presented the theoretical analysis, design and mechanism of the robot, choice of sensors and sensing approach as well as the experiment results of a working prototype. The robot consists of a two wheeled lower body platform and a spring loaded <b>movable</b> <b>upper</b> body mass. Hopping motion is achieved through the impact force produced by releasing pre-tensed springs. An IMU detects the body tilt angle, along with an ultrasonic distance sensor to detect the height above ground. The accelerometer in the IMU measures the impact force to determine {{the beginning and the end}} of a hopping and landing phases. Due to statically unstable property of the robot, the attitude has to be actively controlled during airborne to ensure stability upon landing. While in air the body angle is controlled using the torque generated through the rotation of the drive wheels. Upon landing impact detection through onboard sensors, the controller switches to ground balance mode to maintain balance. Current prototype is capable of negotiating step terrains of a height of 17  cm, which is similar to normal stair height, and is capable of hopping 4  cm above ground. The hopping height is significantly less than simulated results due to mechanical constraints and perfect world assumption in the simulation. For future work, we plan to improve the mechanical design, increase the size of the prototype to accommodate larger springs to increase the lifting force and enable the robot to jump at a higher height. We plan to take advantage of the dynamic nature of the robot to travel up and down step terrains, leap over gap obstacles in a swift and reliable manner. We are also investigating laser scanners or radar sensors in replace of sonar sensor for height detection.|$|E

40|$|A novel angle {{comparator}} {{has been}} built and tested at INRIM. The device {{is based on a}} double air bearing structure embedding a continuously rotating encoder, which is read by two heads: one fixed {{to the base of the}} comparator and a second fixed to the upper moving part of the comparator. The phase measurement between the two heads’ signals is proportional to the relative angle suspended between them (and, therefore, the angle between the base and the <b>upper,</b> <b>movable</b> part of the comparator). The advantage of this solution is to reduce the encoder graduation errors and to cancel the cyclic errors due to the interpolation of the encoder lines. By using only two pairs of reading heads, we have achieved an intrinsic accuracy of ± 0. 04 ″ (rectangular distribution) that can be reduced through self-calibration. The residual cyclic errors have shown to be less than 0. 01 ″ peak-to-peak. The random fluctuations are less than 0. 01 ″ rms on a 100 s time interval.

The load was applied {{at the base of the}} bracket in the occlusogingival direction. The load profile was in the form of a wave at a rate of 1 Hz. Compressive shear fatigue test for 5, 000 load cycles or until bond failure was determined by testing according to the staircase (up-and-down) method [24, 25]. The first specimen was tested at the approximate value of about 25 % of the static shear bond strength previously evaluated [26]. Then, the load was raised by a fixed amount of 20 Newton (N) for the next tested specimen. On the other hand, if the bracket did not survive, i.e., the bond failed at some point during the 5, 000 cycles, the load was lowered also by the same fixed amount of 20 N for the next specimen. This procedure of raising the maximum load by 20 N following a test where the orthodontic bond has not failed and lowering the load by the same fixed amount following a bond failure was continued for each following specimen until all ten specimens in each group were evaluated.|$|R
30|$|Quick look methods (QLM) in log {{interpretation}} {{are helpful}} to the geologist because they provide flags, or indicators, that point to possible hydrocarbon zones. The importance of QLM is {{in their ability to}} provide information {{about the nature of the}} fluids in the pore spaces and the lithology of the reservoirs in a quick and simple way. Four ways of QLM are applied on the Middle Miocene Jeribe Formation from the well Ja- 49 in Jambour Oilfield. The apparent water resistivity (Rwa) method helped in quick detecting the hydrocarbon-bearing zones of the formation. The logarithmic movable oil plot method assisted in detecting the intensity of the movability of the hydrocarbons within the hydrocarbon-bearing zones of the formation. The SP versus Rxo/Rt overlay is an additional helpful way for detecting water and hydrocarbon-bearing horizons without need to know porosity. movable hydrocarbon index (MHI) is also used as QLM for detecting the movability of the hydrocarbons through calculating the ratio of water saturation in the uninvaded zone to that of the flushed zone. Accordingly, the formation in the studied well appeared to be generally a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir with zones of different movable hydrocarbon potentiality. The application of MHI method indicated that about 53 % of the gross 56  m thickness of the formation contains <b>movable</b> hydrocarbons. The <b>upper</b> and lower 5  m of the formation appear to be containing the most efficient productive horizons. No actual oil water contact is observed in the studied section of Jeribe Formation, which means the oil column extends down to certain depth in the formations underlying Jeribe Formation.|$|R
