5|$|A related {{problem is}} how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) cause that individual's neurons to fire and muscles to contract.

5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} the liberation of the human <b>mind</b> <b>from</b> the {{dominion}} of religion; the liberation {{of the human body}} from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Harry has {{a vision}} {{involving}} an attack upon Arthur Weasley, {{from the point}} of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to defend his <b>mind</b> <b>from</b> Voldemort's influence. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls apart, as he believes she betrayed them to Umbridge. Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape disliked Harry's father James, who often bullied him.|$|E

5|$|The Gathering Storm follows many plot threads but {{focuses on}} two characters, Rand al'Thor and Egwene al'Vere. While it follows al'Thor's {{attempts}} to unite and rally the world's forces for the Last Battle, it also addresses his struggle with his sanity, {{caused by the}} corruption of his <b>mind</b> <b>from</b> {{the use of the}} male half of the One Power. The unification of the White Tower, the headquarters of the female users of the One Power known as Aes Sedai, is addressed from al'Vere's perspective, as well as the exposure of the Black Ajah, a secretive and opposing faction within the story. While the stories of other main characters such as Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon are briefly touched upon, they have little bearing on the main plot line. Some main characters such as Elayne Trakand and Lan Mandragoran do not appear at all, but are referred to.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of that}} tradition, L'assidio {{included}} a ballet divertissement, a key ingredient of French opera of the period.

He sees the memory of Snape being bullied by James and Sirius, and of calling Harry's mother Lily a Mudblood (a highly offensive term). Only in the final book is it revealed that, prior to this confrontation, Snape and Lily had been close friends.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{deemed it}} obvious {{that we have}} some {{objective}} knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on synthetic, a priori laws of nature, like causality and substance. The problem, then, is how this is possible. Kant's solution was to reason that the subject must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, a priori laws of nature that we know apply to all objects before we experience them. So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the <b>mind</b> <b>from</b> what is supplied by the given intuitions. What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental deduction.|$|E
25|$|The Master later {{returns in}} The Keeper of Traken, the role {{taken over by}} Geoffrey Beevers. Still dying, the Master came to the Traken Union to renew his life by using the empire's {{technological}} Source. Though the plot fails, the Master manages to cheat death by transferring his essence {{into the body of}} a Trakenite scientist named Tremas (played by Anthony Ainley) and overwriting his host's <b>mind.</b> <b>From</b> there, through Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), the Master orchestrates the series of events that leads to the Doctor's regeneration into his fifth incarnation (Peter Davison). The Master then appeared on and off {{for the rest of the}} series, still seeking to extend his life – preferably with a new set of regenerations. Subsequently, in The Five Doctors, the Time Lords offer the Master a new regeneration cycle in exchange for his help. The Master's final appearance in the classic series is in Survival, having been trapped on the planet of the Cheetah People and under its influence, which drove its victims to savagery. Though the Master manages to escape the doomed planet, he ends up back on the planet prior to its destruction when he attempts to kill the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy).|$|E
