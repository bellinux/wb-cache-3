5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives of {{surgical}} interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help of}} their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> customarily praise and competition.|$|E

40|$|Socialization and {{individual}} differences were examined as antecedents of moral motivation in representative samples of 15 -year-old adolescents (N = 1, 258; 54 % female) and 21 -year-old young adults (N = 584; 53 % female). The adolescents' primary caregivers (N = 1, 056) also participated. The strength of moral <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> rated by participants' responses to two hypothetical moral dilemmas {{in terms of}} action decisions, emotion attributions, and justifications. Socialization {{was measured by the}} perceived quality of friendship, parent-child relationships, and educational background. The importance attached to social justice and various personality traits were also assessed. Adolescents' moral <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with the quality of their parent-child relationship and the importance of social justice. Young adults' moral <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> predicted by the perceived quality of friendships, the importance of social justice, and agreeableness. For both groups, moral <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> greater in females. The theoretical implications of the findings for the development of moral <b>motivation</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R

5|$|Possible {{motivations for}} this {{complete}} rebuilding by Al-Adil include the damage the old citadel may have sustained from earthquakes in 1200 and 1201 {{and the threat}} that other Ayyubid princes continued to pose toward Al-Adil. The most likely <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> that the defences of the old citadel became obsolete due to the introduction in the 12th century of the counterweight trebuchet, a siege engine easily capable of reducing thick stone walls to rubble. The new citadel introduced {{a number of important}} changes to the defensive system, including higher and thicker walls, a wide moat surrounding the citadel, and numerous closely spaced, high, massive towers. Unlike the older towers, these were square rather than round in design. The towers contained platforms on which trebuchets could be placed. Due to their high position, these trebuchets could outrange enemy artillery and thereby prevent them from breaching the walls.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Motivation</b> <b>is</b> {{the driving}} force of desire behind all {{deliberate}} actions of humans. <b>Motivation</b> <b>is</b> based on emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury or violence because their brain is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. <b>Motivation</b> <b>is</b> important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance and the libido are seen to be primary motivators. Within economics, <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions generally posit divine or demonic influences.|$|E

25|$|The {{aspect of}} {{motivation}} within a person's personality may predict creativity {{levels in the}} person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> an internal drive within a person to participate or invest {{as a result of}} personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another <b>motivation</b> <b>is</b> that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. These are just a few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E
30|$|<b>Motivation</b> <b>was</b> {{regarded}} as one of the driving forces for better academic performance (OECD 2013). There were two types of motivation, namely instrumental and intrinsic motivation in PISA 2012. Both constructs are central in self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci 2009) and expectancy-value theory (Wigfield and Eccles 2000). Instrumental <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> defined as the drive to learn mathematics because students perceive it as useful to them and to their future studies and careers (Eccles and Wigfield 2002). The intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> represented by mathematics interest in PISA 2012. Intrinsic <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> defined as the drive to perform an activity mainly for the joy gained from the activity itself (OECD 2013). The willingness to learn mathematics was due to the fact that they find mathematics interesting and enjoyable (Ryan and Deci 2009). As such, previous studies claimed that intrinsic motivation increased the degree of student engagement in learning and subsequently improved their performance in mathematics (e.g., d’Ailly 2003; Tavani and Losh 2003).|$|R
30|$|Domain-specific <b>motivation</b> <b>was</b> also {{assessed}} in TEDS-M, by asking whether loving mathematics {{is a reason}} to become a teacher.
