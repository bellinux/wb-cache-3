500|$|Abdulredha Buhmaid {{was among}} the protesters. He was shot by {{a bullet in the}} head, {{collapsed}} to the ground and {{in the words of a}} witness, [...] "blood was rushing from his head". Others sustained severe injuries inflicted by gunshots, two of whom also fell to the ground. Several eyewitnesses said army troops [...] "gave no warning", but one witness said he heard them issue a warning several minutes after the initial shooting. Another witness said they heard a [...] "faint voice of someone over a loudspeaker in the distance but could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> the speaker was saying".|$|E
500|$|Also gestalt, {{of which}} the term may be a {{corruption}} (or possibly deriving {{from the air force}} acronym GISS for [...] "General Impression of Size and Shape (of an aircraft)", associated with World War II lingo; though this derivation may by anachronistic as jizz was first used in birdwatching as early as 1922), it describes the overall impression or appearance of a bird—"the indefinable quality of a particular species, the 'vibe' it gives off"—garnered from such features as shape, posture, flying style or other habitual movements, size and colouration combined with voice, habitat and location. Example use: [...] "It had the jizz of a thrush, but I couldn't <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not know what I am standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot {{for the life of me}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> they are talking about—everything seems so curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E

60|$|But {{the honest}} {{projector}} is he who, having by fair and plain principles of sense, honesty, and ingenuity brought any contrivance to a suitable perfection, <b>makes</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he pretends to, picks nobody's pocket, puts his project in execution, and contents {{himself with the}} real produce as the profit of his invention.|$|R
60|$|His {{favourite}} {{and faithful}} housekeeper stands at his bedside. It {{is the first}} act he notices, and he clearly derives pleasure from it. After vainly trying to make himself understood in speech, he makes signs for a pencil. So inexpressively that they cannot at first understand him; it is his old housekeeper who <b>makes</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he wants and brings in a slate.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{understood}} {{enough of}} the language to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> she said.|$|E
60|$|Helen started, {{looked at}} her, {{but could not}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> she felt.|$|E
60|$|I cannot <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> {{pleasure}} {{people take}} in seeing {{things out of}} their proper place.|$|E
60|$|Dick was {{inspecting}} the machinery with care. It was worn out and rusted, {{and hard to}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> just <b>what</b> it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not definitely," [...] he replied. [...] "So far as I could <b>make</b> <b>out</b> from <b>what</b> the {{sergeant}} said, it was keeping bad company {{as much as}} anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|I did {{not know}} very much French, but I had enough to <b>make</b> that <b>out.</b> <b>What</b> sort of eagle was this which had flown into our humble little nest? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} made {{a little}} break, and Wanhope asked, [...] "Could you <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> she screamed, or was it quite inarticulate?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{satisfied}} him, {{and made}} his heart light. Perhaps it will also satisfy the reader--if he can <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> it means.|$|E
60|$|It was, {{and though}} all {{strained}} their eyes {{they could not}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> had been struck, nor did they ever find out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank 'ee kindly," [...] {{returned}} Bevan, who {{possessed a}} grateful spirit; [...] "I'll think better of yer grass-gatherin' after this, {{though it does}} puzzle me awful to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what's</b> the use ye put it to. If you kep' tame rabbits, now, I could understand it, but to carry it about in a green box an' go squeezin' it between the leaves o' books, as I've seed some of 'ee do, {{seems to me the}} most outrageous--" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was never}} able to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> quite <b>what</b> she felt, what she was feeling. But she had a quiet little air of {{proprietorship}} in him, which he did not like.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it's rank sorcery!" [...] exclaimed Tom, {{who was now}} {{becoming}} very much interested. [...] "And how did they <b>make</b> <b>out</b> with <b>what</b> {{was going to happen}} to you in the future?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, gradually, {{but in a}} brief {{space of}} time nevertheless, the vision drew near enough to Dorothy to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> it was.|$|E
60|$|In {{a corner}} of the room was {{something}} neatly covered up with a large white cloth. I could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> that was.|$|E
60|$|But he {{scrambled}} up quickly, and {{was relieved to}} see the bear stop, {{not being able to}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> was about to happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't suggest it," [...] {{his chief}} answered, [...] "but I can't quite <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what's</b> {{at the back}} of their heads. However, I won't bother you about that now. If I were to propound Heseltine's theory to you, you would think that he had been reading the works of some of our enterprising young novelists. Things will have cleared up, I dare say, by next week. I am coming round to the House for a moment if you're not in a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy asked, {{rubbing his}} nose {{in a manner that}} half {{expressed}} vexation at hearing so much, and half curiosity to hear more: 'How came you to <b>make</b> that <b>out?</b> <b>What</b> a girl you are!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'His {{feeling is}} his great point,' said Guy, 'when you can once get at it. I wish--' But {{breaking}} off short, 'I can't <b>make</b> it <b>out.</b> <b>What</b> did little Marianne tell you? Or was it Miss Wellwood?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{own name}} makes nine, Mr. Brown," [...] broke in Mr. Chance, [...] "only I can't <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> {{connection}} it has with a church." ...|$|E
60|$|Overhead, {{they could}} hear a {{constant}} tramping of feet and murmur of voices. They tried to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> was being said, but could not.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I cannot <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> {{has come}} over Rob lately. He is {{drinking}} heavily again, and avoiding me. The lightning is becoming very vivid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may not enter--I am a leper," [...] {{answered}} the first voice; and Branwen sat up, with her great beautiful eyes {{opened to the}} utmost, and listening intently, though she could not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> clearly <b>what</b> was said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{only got}} here this afternoon, {{about three hours}} before you did. I {{had a bit of}} a talk with him before dinner. I can't <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what's</b> up. He seemed awfully keen on my finding {{something}} to do now I've come down from Oxford. Wanted to know whether I couldn't get a tutoring job or a mastership at some school next term. I said I'd have a shot. I don't see what all the hurry's about, though. I was hoping he'd give me a bit of travelling on the Continent somewhere before I started in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{proved to}} be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show it. [...] "I <b>make</b> <b>out</b> now <b>what</b> he must have done at school." [...] And she gave, in her simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. [...] "He stole!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{to think}} of all your {{schooling}} clean [...] wasted, thrown away, [...] Darned if I can <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> you're [...] learnin' all the day, ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't look up, Taffy,' he said. 'Try {{if you can}} <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> {{that means}} in the Tegumai language. If you can, we've found the Secret.' ...|$|E
60|$|Tom {{understood}} him to say, {{what the}} devil did he want; {{but it was}} not easy to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> he said; he spoke so indistinctly.|$|E
60|$|The moment Alice appeared, she was {{appealed to}} by all three {{to settle the}} question, and they {{repeated}} their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> exactly <b>what</b> they said.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've {{got some}} sort of a deal on for {{handling}} horses and cattle. We couldn't <b>make</b> <b>out</b> exactly <b>what</b> it was," [...] answered Randy. [...] "But they certainly are a tough bunch. It looks to me as if they might have been drinking." ...|$|R
6000|$|DORA. But {{the love}} of sister for sister can never be old-fashioned. I have been unwilling to trouble you with questions, but you seem {{somewhat}} better to-day. We found a letter in your bedroom torn into bits. I couldn't <b>make</b> it <b>out.</b> <b>What</b> was it? ...|$|R
