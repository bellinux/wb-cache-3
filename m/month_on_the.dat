5|$|An-Nasir Ahmad {{was known}} to be a seclusive sultan, {{surrounding}} himself with his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, rarely making direct contact with the Mamluk emirs of Egypt and avoiding the public view. Two months into his reign, he relocated to al-Karak with substantial sums from the treasury and several horses and senior administrative officials. He ruled from the desert fortress, leaving a deputy, Emir Aqsunqur al-Salari, to oversee affairs in Egypt on his behalf. His unorthodox rule, alleged frivolity, and his execution of loyal partisans, namely Tashtamur and Qutlubugha, led to an-Nasir Ahmad being deposed from the sultanate by his half-brother, as-Salih Isma'il. He remained in the fortress of al-Karak, which the Mamluks besieged at least seven times, until being captured in July 1344. He was killed later that <b>month</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orders of as-Salih Isma'il.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} The Report was first {{seen in a}} series of Daily Show {{segments}} which advertised the then-fictional series as a joke.

The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2million viewers nightly during its first week on the air.

5|$|Meckiff {{missed the}} Third Test in Durban {{and spent a}} <b>month</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidelines, before {{returning}} against a combined team from Orange Free State and Border {{at the end of}} January. He took 6/29 in the first innings, his best return of the tour, and earned a recall for the final two Tests of the five-match series. He was not as effective as he was on debut, taking two and one wickets for the matches respectively, and scoring 26 runs in his only innings of the Fourth Test. Overall, the Victorian paceman had made a steady start to his international career, with 11 Test wickets at an average of 32.09, and 56 runs at 18.66. In the entire tour, he took 33 first-class wickets at 23.09. However, there was a hint of the controversy that was to end his career six years later. A year after the series, the South African Test umpire Bill Marais said he was prepared to no-ball Meckiff and his team-mate Jim Burke for throwing. There were reports that Craig had been tipped off about Marais's intentions and therefore operated the two bowlers exclusively from the end at which Marais was not officiating.|$|E
