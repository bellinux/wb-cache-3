2500|$|In 1987, McKesson {{sold off}} its wine and spirits {{operations}} {{so it could}} focus on pharmaceuticals. Aged 55, Asher took early retirement, and began to concentrate on his wine writing. His contributions to Gourmet magazine, which had evolved into a bi-monthly column called the [...] "Wine Journal", now became monthly. Many of Asher's [...] "Wine Journal" [...] entries have been republished in book form as On Wine (1982), Vineyard Tales (1996), The Pleasures of Wine (2002), A Vineyard in <b>My</b> <b>Glass</b> (2011), and A Carafé of Red (2012). In 1996, he wrote the Wine Journal, published as a cellar book by HarperCollins. A number of the Gourmet columns were translated and published in the Japanese version of Playboy magazine, and in 1997 some of these were published in translation as The Secret World of Wine by Shueisha of Tokyo. Asher stopped writing for Gourmet in February 2002, but he continued to contribute a selection of wines to the monthly menu published in each issue until the magazine discontinued in November 2009.|$|E

60|$|This morning I turned <b>my</b> <b>glass,</b> as usual, on his pet haunt. I nearly {{fell over}} in my astonishment, for he was also looking through a {{spyglass}} straight at me, too, it seemed. How foolish I felt! And yet my curiosity {{was so strong that}} a few minutes afterward I peeped back again, just to see what he was doing. Then he coolly laid down his glass, rose, lifted his cap and bowed politely to me--or, at least, in my direction. I dropped <b>my</b> <b>glass</b> and smiled in a mixture of dismay and amusement. Then I remembered that he was probably watching me again, and might imagine my smile was meant for him. I banished it immediately, shut <b>my</b> <b>glass</b> up and did not touch it again.

6000|$|Then I {{snatched}} <b>my</b> <b>glass.</b> His face {{expressed the}} direst consternation and dismay. He signalled: [...] "I must see {{you before you}} go." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{few days}} later I saw the grumpy old brute again in a curious way. I was {{sweeping}} the lake with <b>my</b> field <b>glasses</b> when I saw what I thought {{was a pair of}} black ducks near a grassy shore. I paddled over, watching them keenly, till a root seemed to rise out of the water between them. Before I could get <b>my</b> <b>glasses</b> adjusted again they had disappeared. I dropped the glasses and paddled faster. They were diving, perhaps--an unusual thing for black ducks--and I might surprise them. There they were again; and there again was the old root bobbing up unexpectedly between them. I whipped <b>my</b> <b>glasses</b> up--the mystery vanished. The two ducks were the tips of Umquenawis' big antlers; the root that rose between them was his head, as he came up to breathe.|$|R
