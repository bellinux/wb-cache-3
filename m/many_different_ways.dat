5|$|The Iowa {{class has}} become {{culturally}} symbolic in the United States in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> {{to the point}} where certain elements of the American public—such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association—are unwilling to part with the battleships despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile firepower. Although all have been officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register they have been spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can be achieved in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E

5|$|The Shiva-related {{tradition}} {{is a major}} part of Hinduism, found all over India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bali (Indonesia). Its historical roots are unclear and contested. Some scholars such Yashodhar Mathpal and Ali Javid have interpreted early prehistoric paintings at the Bhimbetka rock shelters, carbon dated to be from pre-10,000 BCE period, as Shiva dancing, Shiva's trident, and his mount Nandi. However, Howard Morphy states that these prehistoric rock paintings of India, when seen in their context, are likely those of hunting party with animals, and that the figures in a group dance can be interpreted in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Rock paintings from Bhimbetka, depicting a figure with a trishul, have been described as Nataraja by Erwin Neumayer, who dates them to the mesolithic.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E
5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints {{are characterized by}} the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E

In multiplayer mode, the player who collects the coins is the only person whose gun receives more ammo. Levels can be completed in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> based on what characters the player or players choose. When playing in single-player mode, once a character is unlocked it can be used on any level and any level can be completed as any character. In multiplayer mode, players work together to complete the levels. If one of the players dies, another must revive them before finishing the level.|$|E

40|$|Music {{played an}} {{important}} role in the performances of Greek Old Comedy. What is the best way to perform an ancient play so that music, far from being an unnecessary supplement, can give its fundamental contribution to the success of the show? The answer is: opera (or one of its by-products: operettes and musicals). Through the inspection of one single example of these musical forms (Braunfels' Die Vögel, Lecocq's Plutus and Sondheim' Frogs) and the analysis of some different examples in the case of a single play (Lysistrata), this paper will show the <b>many</b> <b>differents</b> <b>ways</b> musicians, together with their librettists, have worked on an ancient text so as to make it both charming and comprehensible to a modern audience...|$|R
