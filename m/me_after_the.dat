500|$|LeMond has {{acknowledged}} since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling {{contributed to his}} lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: [...] "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, {{became more and more}} demanding, more and more concerned..." [...] He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again. LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: [...] "I figure I had three months that went right for <b>me</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> hunting accident," [...] three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. [...] "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several biographers say Escrivá {{prohibited}} his devotees {{from asking}} {{for the title of}} Marquess of Peralta. They state that Escrivá accepted it due to the advice of some cardinals who told him that he had the obligation to do so {{for the sake of his}} brother, Santiago, and so as to practice what he preached about fulfilling civil duties and exercising rights. His brother Santiago said: [...] "The decision was heroic because he knew that he will be vilified as a result... Josemaría did what is best for <b>me.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> right amount of time has passed, without making use of the title (in fact he never had the intention of using it), he passed the title on to me." ...|$|E

Bart told me later that he tried to call <b>me</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls."

Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175.

Peter Howell of the Toronto Star thought that the [...] "main" [...] creature was disappointing, while he considered the [...] "mutant spider crabs" [...] that came from it as [...] "way scarier". Lawrence Person of Locus Online describes it as [...] "like a cross between a truly giant mantis and Johnny the Skeletal Torso." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety found that the creature was more reassuring as it appeared more in the film, explaining, [...] "Its very nature as a walking, stalking being suggests it can somehow be killed by conventional means".

2500|$|According to Bunk Gardner, [...] "Cruising with Ruben & the Jets {{was an easy}} {{album to}} record. We were {{recording}} {{it at the same}} time as Uncle Meat because the songs were easy and very simple and didn't require a lot of time for arrangements and technical overdubbing. It was the beginning of the end for Ray Collins because all the new material Frank was writing was a little too far out and away from Ray's roots - which was Ruben-era material. Motorhead too was in his glory during the recording of this album. He loved Ruben and that was really his kind of music to get nostalgic over - on stage and doing the dance steps and playing that music [...] I really enjoyed playing a solo on Ray's tune 'Anything'. I remember Frank, Ray and Roy standing in the control booth while I recorded my solo. Frank was telling <b>me</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> first take to keep it simple. So I nailed it on the second take and everyone was happy!" ...|$|E

I wasn't excited," [...] however, after watching it again, was [...] "sucked into the world, mesmerized not by the victory of our hero cops...but by the gut-wrenching moments that unfolded." [...] CraveOnline's William Bibbiani called the episode [...] "an odd duck". After citing Jamie's early revelation as [...] "melodramatic silliness", Bibbiani added: [...] "The rest of the episode gets its job done, with one major, glaring flaw. The characters end up more or less {{where they need to}} be, but some nearly ridiculous loose ends remain." [...] Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C-, calling it [...] "so unconvincing", adding [...] "I couldn't believe how little all this resolution affected <b>me</b> <b>after</b> <b>The</b> Killing so thrillingly took my grudging engagement for a ride a few weeks ago.

She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her.

2500|$|Upon hearing {{news of the}} speech, Paul Cravath, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, asked McKenzie for a report. On June 8, 1925, McKenzie {{forwarded}} Cravath a six-page letter {{addressing the}} matter. McKenzie recognized the ramifications of Du Bois's address. [...] "The whole situation {{is one that is}} very serious indeed", and reported after the speech, [...] "the audience was tumultuous in its applause and so carried away that it seemed to almost trample over Mrs. McKenzie and <b>me</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> address." [...] McKenzie acknowledged that [...] "the dominant view of the colored people today is more or less sympathetic with Dr. Du Bois on the race issue," [...] and conceded that today [...] "nothing is so popular with colored audiences as denunciation of the whites, and nothing so unpopular as its absence." [...] But McKenzie refuted Du Bois' accusations that were [...] "not more than partially true." [...] He learned that at the first of the two concerts [...] "the manager of the Auditorium helped in the sale of tickets and not very tactfully turned the colored people to one window, her object being to get two streams of people in accordance with their destination. This matter was brought to my attention that night by one of our alumni and the situation was changed the next morning." [...] He further noted that [...] "we recently widened the amount of space allowed the colored people, so much so that at the last concert, in May, hundreds of white people overflowed into the colored section, mingling indiscriminately with the colored people." [...] Shortly after Du Bois's speech, Fisk trustees drafted a formal letter vigorously supporting the policies McKenzie pursued at Fisk." [...] However, Fisk trustee William DeBerry, the Black leader of St. John's Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of the largest Black Congregational churches in the United States, refused to sign the letter. DeBerry told Wood, [...] "I must confess that I share to some extent with many others of the Fisk alumni in a grave anxiety and fear as to the ultimate outcome of what they consider an ultra conciliatory attitude on the part of Dr. McKenzie toward southern sentiment as regards the Negro problem." [...] "I do not agree with Dr. Du Bois in all he is reported to have said in his recent address at Fisk, nor do I approve of the maneuver in which attack on Dr. McKenzie was made." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} month at Sacrifice the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Beer Money, Inc. and Team 3D in a three–way match to earn {{another shot at}} the Tag Team Championship. On July 11 at Victory Road the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Beer Money, Inc. to win the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship for the first time. After Victory Road the Motor City Machine Guns entered a Best of Five Series with Beer Money, Inc., contested for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Beer Money won the first two matches, a ladder match and a Street Fight, after knocking their opponents out with beer bottles. However, Shelley and Sabin came back to win the two following matches, a steel cage match and an Ultimate X match, to even the score to 2–2 {{and set up a}} deciding match for the August 12 Impact!. On the August 12 Impact! the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Beer Money, Inc. in a Two Out of Three Falls match to win the Best of Five Series and retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The {{following month}} at No Surrender, the Motor City Machine Guns retained their titles in a match against Generation <b>Me.</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> match Generation Me turned heel by attacking the Machine Guns and injuring Shelley in storyline. On the following Impact!, Generation Me laid claim to the TNA World Tag Team Championship, claiming that the champions {{would not be able to}} defend them for 30 days, due to Shelley's injury, before stealing Sabin's title belt. Shelley would however make his return two weeks later and promised Generation Me a rematch for the World Tag Team Championship at Bound for Glory. At the pay–per–view the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Generation Me to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Also at Bound for Glory, Team 3D announced their retirement from professional wrestling, but requested one final match against the Motor City Machine Guns, whom they called the best tag team in wrestling. [...] The Motor City Machine Guns accepted and the match took place on November 7, 2010, at Turning Point, where they defeated Team 3D to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. After Jeremy Buck pinned Sabin in an eight-person tag team match, where the Motor City Machine Guns teamed with Jay Lethal and Velvet Sky and Generation Me with Robbie E and Cookie, on the November 18 Impact!, the Motor City Machine Guns challenged Generation Me to an Empty Arena match. The match took place later that same night on Reaction with the Motor City Machine Guns coming out victorious. On December 5 at Final Resolution the Motor City Machine Guns defeated Generation Me in a Full Metal Mayhem match to retain the World Tag Team Championship. The following month at Genesis, Shelley and Sabin lost the World Tag Team Championship to Beer Money, Inc., after Roode rolled up Sabin, following a miscommunication between the Machine Guns. Shelley and Sabin received their rematch for the title on the following Impact!, but lost again due to a miscommunication. On January 16 Shelley broke his collarbone during a match in Hagerstown, Maryland. Originally, Shelley was advertised to make his return on April 17 at Lockdown in a nine-man Xscape match, but on April 7 he was removed from the match and his return postponed. Shelley made his return on April 20 at the tapings of the April 28 Impact!, saving Sabin from Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez). Ironically, the same day Shelley made his return, Sabin suffered a knee injury in his match with Anarquia. Later that same week, Sabin underwent knee surgery, which would sideline him for the rest of the year.|$|E
