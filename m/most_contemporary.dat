5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Salford's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} {{its status as a}} Royal caput and the {{judicial}} seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire, to which it lent its name. It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in about 1230, making Salford a free borough. During the early stages of its growth, Salford was of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester, although <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> sources agree that since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed.|$|E
5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder, regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius received more rain and had a more stable climate than Rodrigues, there was probably less need for male dodos to fight over territory. The solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E

5|$|Local {{and foreign}} written accounts, {{as well as}} non-textual {{artifacts}} {{have been used to}} reconstruct Parthian history. Although the Parthian court maintained records, the Parthians had no formal study of history; the earliest universal history of Iran, the Khwaday-Namag, was not compiled until the reign of the last Sassanid ruler Yazdegerd III (r. 632–651AD). Indigenous sources on Parthian history remain scarce, with fewer of them available than for any other period of Iranian history. <b>Most</b> <b>contemporary</b> written records on Parthia contain Greek as well as Parthian and Aramaic inscriptions. The Parthian language was written in a distinct script derived from the Imperial Aramaic chancellery script of the Achaemenids, and later developed into the Pahlavi writing system.|$|E
5|$|No chronicler {{for this}} period is entirely {{trustworthy}} or unbiased, often because their accounts were written {{to support a}} particular cause, {{but it is clear}} that <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> chroniclers were highly critical of Edward. The Polychronicon, Vita Edwardi Secundi, Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi and the Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon for example all condemned the King's personality, habits and choice of companions. Other records from his reign show criticism of Edward by his contemporaries, including the Church and members of his own household. Political songs were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government. Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and Thomas Ringstead, rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.|$|E
5|$|The 1859 {{publication}} of Darwin's theory in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life is often considered the central {{event in the}} history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed Origin to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous Vestiges of Creation had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and common descent {{by the end of the}} 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.|$|E

5|$|Chnodomar's {{men were}} of much less even quality than Julian's. His best warriors were the {{professional}} retinues of the regales (royal class, called ring-givers by the Germans), organized in warbands. They were well equipped with armour and swords, as behove their masters' status. The {{majority of his}} men, however, were temporary levies, lightly equipped and often inexperienced, like <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> Germanic forces relying on light equipment and speed. On the Alamanni side, {{there is little evidence}} of formation manoeuvres. The professional retainers of the regales may have had some capacity for this, especially as Germanic armies were by now very familiar with the Roman way of war. Ammianus' account mentions a globus (mass) of the best warriors coming together {{in the thick of the}} battle and breaking through the Roman line. In addition, several would likely have served in the Roman army in the past. But the majority of Chnodomar's men consisted of temporary levies, whose equipment and experience would have been limited. According to Ammianus, they had to rely on a concentrated frontal charge to try to break through by weight of numbers, and proved no match for the Romans in the final phase of the battle, a prolonged struggle of attrition at close-quarters.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{mass was}} first {{performed}} on 14 March 1864 at the couple's new residence in Paris, the hôtel of Louise, comtesse de Pillet-Will. The countess is the dedicatee of this refined and elegant piece, which avoids the sentimental opulence of <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> liturgical works, {{such as those}} by Charles Gounod. Albert Lavignac, aged eighteen, conducted from the harmonium. The soloists were the sisters Carlotta and Barbara Marchisio, Italo Gardoni and Luigi Agnesi. The sisters Marchisio had performed together in Rossini's works before, such as the leading parts of the lovers in his opera Semiramide. Rossini, who had helped prepare for the performance, turned pages for the first pianist, Georges Mathias, and marked tempos by nodding his head. Among the first listeners were Giacomo Meyerbeer, Daniel Auber and Ambroise Thomas. The performance was repeated the following day, for a larger audience which included members of the press.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately, the {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479431 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> with it, is Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs and {{his wife}} lived in rented {{property}} for {{the first years of}} their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry: although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs' wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913, he was earning £375 each year, placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in Clapham Common, a prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 each year), the income from his business, product endorsement—he {{was one of the first}} cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products—and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 a year by 1925, more than a family doctor at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools. He had greater financial independence than <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood.|$|E
5|$|The dromons that Procopius {{describes}} were single-banked {{ships of}} probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger (parexeiresia), these extended {{directly from the}} hull. In the later bireme dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around {{the sides of the}} ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E

5|$|The {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} were in any case completed {{by the start of}} September 1066, and had possibly begun already in March or April. While he brought with him Elisiv, his daughters, and his son Olaf, he left behind Tora and made sure to have his oldest son Magnus hailed as king. Gathering his fleet at Solund in the Sognefjord, Harald departed Norway in August, and landed first in Shetland and thereafter in Orkney (both under Norwegian control). In both places he was joined by several important lords, chieftains, and soldiers, including the Earls of Orkney, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. He next went to Dunfermline, where he met with Tostig's ally Malcolm III of Scotland (and according to some sources, with Tostig) who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers. According to <b>most</b> <b>contemporary</b> sources, Harald and Tostig met at Tynemouth on 8 September, Harald with a total force of, at the most, around 10–15,000 men on 240–300 longships, and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers. Not mentioned in the sagas, but accounted for by John of Worcester, Tostig had departed from his exile in Flanders already in May or June. He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich. As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response, Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald, while Harold Godwinson remained in the south in expectation of invasion by William of Normandy, who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne.|$|E
