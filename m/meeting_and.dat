40|$|The recent {{economic}} crisis {{has created a}} maelstrom of inquiry about effective business practices with regard to business <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> travel. With travel budgets slashed due both {{to the economy and}} concerns over the public perception of corporate spending, business leaders are trying to determine when any business travel, let alone large-group <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> events, constitute a good investment of their limited time and resources.

40|$|Purpose- The aim of {{this study}} is to examine whether {{frequency}} of audit committee <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> attendance in audit committee are associated with accrual earnings management. Design/methodology/approach- The sample of the study is 14 companies under the Industrial Goods sub-sector listed under the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the years 2012 - 2014. Modified Jones Model (1995) was used to measure earnings management proxied by discretionary accruals. Findings- The findings show that frequency of audit committee <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> attendance during the <b>meetings</b> negatively <b>and</b> significantly associated with discretionary accruals. Theoretical implications- This study extends the previous related literature by examining the association between audit committee <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> attendance and earnings management. Practical implications- Regulators might use the findings of the study to regulate and further control the attendance of audit committee members during audit committee meetings. Originality/value- This paper uses agency theory to provide empirical evidence on the importance of frequent audit committee <b>meetings</b> <b>and</b> higher attendance in audit committee meetings...|$|R
5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967.

Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural <b>meeting,</b> <b>and</b> proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form.

5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney.

The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
