50|$|Henry Marcus Clark’s early {{experience}} in Newtown may have alerted {{him to the}} advantages of regional and suburban retailing. Although a number of retailers opened branches outside the city after World War II, Marcus Clark & Co’s growth was unprecedented: the 1915 Sands Directory listed stores in Newtown, North Sydney, Armidale, Dubbo, Goulburn, Gunnedah, Inverell, Lismore, Lithgow, Narrabri, Newcastle, Nowra, Tamworth and Wollongong. Many of these country locations were actually modest sized ‘sample rooms’ rather than large stores. However, they could still provide customers with personalized service and competed directly with city retailers like Anthony Hordern & Sons which made large profits from the lucrative <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>trade.</b> Country customers could order goods and have them shipped from Marcus Clark & Co’s city stores, conveniently located next to the parcels post office at Central Railway.|$|R

Unlike Kay & Company, all of these acquisitions were brought into the main GUS business and not run as distinct companies.

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1907, John Sexton & Co. had 125 {{employees}} in Chicago, a large Chicago customer base serviced by a city sales force, a national customer base serviced by a regional sales force, and a strong rural <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>trade.</b> Sexton had outgrown the State Street location, so moved the company four blocks west {{to the corner of}} Lake and Franklin Streets (236 W. Lake Street). In 1908, Sexton Quality Foods leased the entire six-story building for a term of 10 years that expired April 1918. Prior to moving in, electric service and elevators were installed. A side note in Chicago real estate history, in 1885, J.B. Clow & Sons, a cast iron pipe manufacturer entered into a 99-year ground lease with landowner John Peacock at a rate of $3,000 per year with 4% annual increases. That same year, J.B. Clow & Sons constructed a six-story office building. In 1908, J.B. Clow & Sons relocated to a larger building at Harrison and the River and leased the building to John Sexton & Co. By 1909, John Peacock's widow sold the ground to George L. Thatcher for $173,000. John Sexton & Co. organized the building into sales, warehouse, manufacturing and laboratory. At the new location, Sexton expanded into the manufacture of pickles, relishes, spices and preserves. Company horses were stabled at a livery one mile west of the building.|$|R

50|$|Tellus {{publishers}} (digital {{artist and}} noise music composer Joseph Nechvatal, curator, {{former director of}} the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia and current director of The Jewish Museum (New York) Claudia Gould and new music composer Carol Parkinson, director of Harvestworks from 1987 on) never considered running an underground culture audio publication, rather envisaging the compact cassette medium as a no wave fluxus art form in itself. This was quite a unique point of view at a time (the early 1980s), when many self-released cassettes blossomed through <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> and <b>trade</b> between audio artists, mail art folks and hardcore punk bands who were promoting a mostly minimalism punk inspired DIY technique of more-or-less anti-art nihilism. But Nechvatal and Parkinson had met in the mid-1970s dancing as a performance art / minimal art dance trio (with Cid Collins) influenced by the post Merce Cunningham postmodern dance/choreography of Lucinda Childs, Deborah Hay, Yvonne Rainer and Carolee Schneemann (with whom they toured Europe in 1978). And they continued to see each other in the art music milieu of the rigorous downtown minimal music scene as they worked for the Dia Art Foundation as assistants to La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela and Pandit Pran Nath. So by contrast to a lax attitude, the Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine never indulged in rank amateurism. Their audio releases were always tightly focused, well researched and aptly curated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Outpatient {{drugs are}} {{dispensed}} through both community and <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacies. There is no empirical evidence that substitution of community pharmacy with <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> reduces overall drug expenditures. The need {{for evaluating the}} potential effects on utilization and costs of the possible extension of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> services in Medicaid provides the rationale for conducting this study. This study compares drug utilization and drug product cost in community vs. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy dispensing services in a Medicaid population. Methods This study is a retrospective cohort study comparing utilization and cost patterns in community vs. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy. A simulation model was employed to assess drug utilization and cost in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy using community pharmacy claim data. The model assumed that courses of drug therapy (CDT) in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy would have utilization patterns {{similar to those found}} in community pharmacy. A 95 % confidence interval surrounding changes in average utilization and average cost were estimated using bootstrap analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed by varying drug selection criteria and supply, fill point, and medication possession ratio (MPR). Sub-analyses were performed to address differences between <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> and community pharmacy related to therapeutic class and dual-eligible patients. Data for the study derived from pharmacy claims database of Ohio Medicaid State program for the period January 2000 -September 2004. Drug claims were aggregated to obtain a set of CDTs representing unique patient IDs and unique drug products. Drug product cost estimates excluded dispensing fees and were used to estimate the cost reduction required in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to become cost neutral in comparison with community pharmacy. Results The baseline model revealed that the use of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> vs. community pharmacy would result in a 5. 5 % increase in drug utilization and a 5. 4 % cost reduction required in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to become cost neutral. Results from Ohio Medicaid drugs for chronic use revealed a 5. 1 % increase in utilization and a 4. 9 % cost reduction required to become cost neutral in comparison with community pharmacy. Conclusion The results of the simulation model indicate that <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy increases drug utilization and can also increase drug product cost if the cost per unit is not reduced accordingly. Prior consideration should be given to the patient population, day-supply, disease, therapy, and insurance characteristics to ensure the appropriate use of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy services. </p...|$|R
