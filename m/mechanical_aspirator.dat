40|$|Abstract Background Resting {{mosquitoes}} {{can easily}} be collected using an aspirating device. The most commonly used <b>mechanical</b> <b>aspirator</b> is the CDC Backpack aspirator. Recently, a simple, and low-cost aspirator called the Prokopack has been devised and proved to have comparable performance. The following study evaluates the Prokopack aspirator compared to the CDC backpack aspirator when sampling resting mosquitoes in rural Tanzania. Methods Mosquitoes were sampled in- and outdoors of 48 typical rural African households using both aspirators. The aspirators were rotated between collectors and households in a randomized, Latin Square design. Outdoor collections were performed using artificial resting places (large barrel and car tyre), underneath the outdoor kitchen (kibanda) roof and from a drop-net. Data were analysed with generalized linear models. Results The number of mosquitoes collected using the CDC Backpack and the Prokopack aspirator {{were not significantly different}} both in- and outdoors (indoors p = 0. 735; large barrel p = 0. 867; car tyre p = 0. 418; kibanda p = 0. 519). The Prokopack was superior for sampling of drop-nets due to its smaller size. The number mosquitoes collected per technician was more consistent when using the Prokopack aspirator. The Prokopack was more user-friendly: technicians preferred using the it over the CDC backpack aspirator as it weighs considerably less, retains its charge for longer and is easier to manoeuvre. Conclusions The Prokopack proved in the field to be more advantageous than the CDC Backpack aspirator. It can be self assembled using simple, low-cost and easily attainable materials. This device is a useful tool for researchers or vector-control surveillance programs operating in rural Africa, as it is far simpler and quicker than traditional means of sampling resting mosquitoes. Further longitudinal evaluations of the Prokopack aspirator versus the gold standard pyrethrum spray catch for indoor resting catches are recommended. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the feeding {{inhibition}} and repellency effect of three brands of mosquito coils in experimental huts (East African design). Evaluated products were all pyrethroid-based mosquito coils-Kiboko(R), Total(R) and Risasi(R). Mosfly (0. 1 % D-allethrin) was a positive control. Indoor resting behavior, feeding inhibition and induced exophily were measured as responses of burnt coil smoke in huts. Resting mosquitoes were collected inside the huts, in window traps and verandah traps using <b>mechanical</b> <b>aspirators.</b> Identified to species level and sex. A total of 1460 mosquitoes were collected, 58. 9 % (n= 860) were Anopheles gambiae s. l while 41. 1 % (n= 600) Culex quinquefasciatus. Indoor resting mosquitoes in all treated huts were significantly reduced than in negative control (DF= 4, F= 18. 6, P < 0. 001). Species found to rest indoors were not statistical different between the positive control (Mosfly coil) and other three treated huts (DF= 3, F= 1. 068, P= 0. 408). Cx. quinquefasciatus had significantly higher induced exophily in all treatments comparing to An. gambiae s. / (DF= 1, F= 5. 34, P= 0. 050). Comparison between species (An. gambiae s. l and Cx. quinquefasciatus) for the feeding inhibition among treated huts {{was not statistically significant}} (DF= 1, F= 0. 062, P= 0. 810). Introduction of several personal protection measures will be ideal to supplement the existing gap in reducing the man vector contacts hence lowering the disease transmission...|$|R

30|$|We {{extracted}} shrub {{seeds from}} the duff and soil samples collected in 1987 using procedures modified {{from those of}} Quick (1956). After air drying, we sieved the samples, retaining the 1.0 mm to 4.8 mm fraction. We discarded material < 1.0 mm, which was assumed not to contain shrub seeds. Material larger than 4.8 mm was first examined for the occasional cluster of Arctostaphylos seed still attached to the raceme before discarding. We then removed seed from the retained fraction using a <b>mechanical</b> seed <b>aspirator</b> that consisted of an industrial vacuum cleaner, mesh screens, {{and a series of}} Plexiglas® (Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) tubes, which separated the lighter organic particles from the seed. We conducted tests with known amounts of seed placed within soil and duff samples that showed that nearly all fully developed and potentially viable shrub seeds could be extracted using this method. We assessed potential viability of all seeds collected in 1987 and a subset of seeds collected in 1988 by cutting them in half and visually examining them for an intact healthy endosperm.|$|R
40|$|Globally, malaria {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} vector-borne diseases despite the extensive use of vector control, including indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). These control methods target endophagic vectors, whereas some malaria vectors, such as Anopheles arabiensis, preferentially feed outdoors on cattle, making it a complicated vector to control using conventional strategies. Our study evaluated whether treating cattle with a capsule containing the active ingredient (AI) fipronil could reduce vector density and sporozoite rates, and alter blood feeding behavior, when applied in a small-scale field study. A pilot field study was carried out in the Samia District, Western Kenya, from May to July 2015. Four plots, each comprised of 50 huts used for sleeping, were randomly designated to serve as control or treatment. A week before cattle treatment, baseline mosquito collections were performed inside the houses using <b>mechanical</b> <b>aspirators.</b> Animals in the treatment (and buffer) were administered a single oral application of fipronil at ∼ 0. 5 mg/kg of body weight. Indoor mosquito collections were performed once a week for four weeks following treatment. Female mosquitoes were first identified morphologically to species complex, followed by PCR-based methods to obtain species identity, sporozoite presence, and the host source of the blood meal. All three species of anophelines found in the study area (An. gambiae s. s., An. arabiensis, An. funestus s. s.) were actively transmitting Plasmodium falciparumduring the study period. The indoor resting density of An. arabiensis was significantly reduced in treatment plot one at three weeks post-treatment (T 1) (efficacy = 89 %; T 1 density = 0. 08, 95 % credibility intervals [0. 05, 0. 10]; control plot density = 0. 78 [0. 22, 0. 29]) and at four weeks post-treatment (efficacy = 64 %; T 1 density = 0. 16 [0. 08, 0. 14]; control plot density = 0. 48 [0. 17, 0. 22]). The reduction of An. arabiensis mosquitoes captured in the treatment plot two was higher: zero females were collected after treatment. The indoor resting density of An. gambiae s. s. was not significantly different between the treatment (T 1, T 2) and their corresponding control plots (C 1, C 2). An. funestus s. s. showed an increase in density over time. The results of this preliminary study suggest that treating cattle orally with fipronil, to target exophagic and zoophagic malaria vectors, could be a valuable control strategy to supplement existing vector control interventions which target endophilic anthropophilic species.

40|$|An entomological {{survey was}} carried out in two districts of central (Kruje) and {{northern}} (Lezhe) Albania. Six collecting sites, showing a variety of diurnal resting sites, were monitored for adult sandflies from June through October 2002. Flies were collected with CDC miniature light traps, sticky traps and <b>mechanical</b> or hand <b>aspirators</b> in peridomestic sites, in bedrooms and inside cow barns, chicken coops and pigpens. All collecting sites monitored were found positive for sandflies. A total of 849 specimens were caught (29. 2 % males) belonging to five Phlebotomus species. Phlebotomus neglectus (75. 6 %) was the most abundant species followed by P. perfiliewi (14. 4 %), P. papatasi (4. 6 %), P. tobbi (3. 6 %) and P. similis (1. 8 %). The first adult of P. neglectus appeared on June 11 and the last one was collected on October 16. The highest density for this species was observed at the end of July. A total of 111 blood-fed females were caught from the two areas studied. P. neglectus was the only species found blood fed in Lezhe and the same species was prevalent (56. 1 %) in Kruje followed by P. perfiliewi (30. 3 %), P. tobbi (10. 6 %); P. papatasi was represented by only two specimens. Blood meal origin was determined in 45 / 66 (68. 2 %) of the females tested from Kruje district. P. neglectus was found fed on four hosts, showing the following feeding patterns: cow (71. 4 %), dog (17. 1 %), chicken (5. 7 %) and human (5. 7 %); P. perfiliewi was found fed on cow (80. 0 %) and chicken (20. 0 %), P. tobbi on cow (50. 0 %), chicken (25. 0 %) and dog (25. 0 %). One specimen of P. papatasi was found fed on cow. When such prevalences were analysed by the available biomass for each host present at the collecting site, P. neglectus resulted to be an opportunistic feeder rather than exhibiting preferences for any specific animal. PCR analysis of 39 P. neglectus from the Lezhe district gave negative results for the presence of Leishmania DNA...|$|R
