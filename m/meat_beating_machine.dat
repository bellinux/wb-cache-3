50|$|Among their contemporaries, {{the band}} had strong artistic, political, and {{personal}} ties to both <b>Meat</b> <b>Beat</b> Manifesto and Consolidated.

5000|$|Autoimmune is {{an album}} by <b>Meat</b> <b>Beat</b> Manifesto. Originally {{announced}} as a twenty track 2xCD release, Dangers decided {{to shorten the}} album to a single disc with different track listings between the US and European releases. Stylistically, it steps up the pace from other recent <b>Meat</b> <b>Beat</b> Manifesto albums, using elements of dub, hip-hop, industrial, breakbeat and more, and this saw the album being billed as a partial return to the early industrial sound of the band in the late 1980s. The album has also been described as Jack Dangers' take on dubstep, though Dangers has stated that <b>Meat</b> <b>Beat</b> Manifesto has always utilized the underlying concepts of that particular genre. This is the first <b>Meat</b> <b>Beat</b> Manifesto album with Danger's vocals since Actual Sounds + Voices in 1998; he appears on the track [...] "Solid Waste". The album cover continues the checker-board/grid theme also seen on earlier <b>Meat</b> <b>Beat</b> Manifesto albums Actual Sounds + Voices, RUOK?, and the Off-Centre EP. Most of the remaining songs that were excised from the original double-disc concept were later released on an EP available only on the Autoimmune tour.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new <b>beating</b> <b>machine</b> {{based on a}} dual cam and lever {{mechanism}} to operate flapping and torsion motions of a dragonfly wing. The <b>beating</b> <b>machine</b> was designed according to the time dependent variation in flapping angle and in torsion angle of a free flight dragonfly. Our experiment {{results show that the}} variations in flapping angle and in torsion angle of a wing on <b>beating</b> <b>machine</b> agree well with those of a real free flight dragonfly wing, confirming that our <b>beating</b> <b>machine</b> is available for studying the beating performance. We then use the <b>beating</b> <b>machine</b> to study the aerodynamic force and inertia affecting on the wing by comparing the flapping angle and torsion angle under the normal and vacuum conditions...|$|R
