For coupling in one direction an arrangement of monomode fibres and gradient fibres is used, with {{one end of the}} <b>monomode</b> <b>fibre</b> abutting one end of the gradient fibres. The fibres are so adjusted that the core of the <b>monomode</b> <b>fibre</b> meets a point on the core of the gradient fibre at which the refractive index of the core of each fibre is the same.

This general formalism is used to derive an expression for the microbending coupling spectrum which encapsulates the essential analytical characteristics of both non-zero polarisation and curvature effects.

40|$|Optical time-domain {{reflectometry}} {{is now a}} {{well established}} means of examining the length-dependence of attenuation in multimode optical fibres. Theoretical work {{has shown that the}} technique is similarly applicable to <b>monomode</b> <b>fibres</b> and experimental results have lately appeared in the literature. It has recently been noted that in <b>monomode</b> <b>fibres</b> the scatter return contains additional information concerning the local state of polarisation (SOP) in the fibre, since at any point the scattered light mirrors the SOP at that position. A polarisation optical time-domain reflectometry technique (POTDR) has thus been proposed, in which the backscattered light is analysed by means of a polariser to reveal the variation of polarisation along a mononode fibre. Such a technique would be invaluable {{in the study of the}} properties of polarisation-maintaining fibres for sensor applications (e. g. gyroscopes, hydrophones) and of low-birefringence fibres for the Faraday Current Monitor and telecommunications. In the latter case, information could be obtained relating to the polarisation dispersion in the fibre and to the variation of the SOP with time, an effect which is expected to produce problems when interfacing to integrated-optics devices. We present here the first measurement to be made using POTDR. Our results clearly establish the feasibility of the technique and, furthermore, show that polarisation effects can cause substantial errors in conventional backscatter attenuation measurements on <b>monomode</b> <b>fibres.</b> Consequently, care must be taken to eliminate the polarisation sensitivity of the measurement and caution exercised in the interpretation of backscatter curve...|$|R

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen intense {{interest}} and activity {{in the field of}} rare earth doped <b>monomode</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers and amplifiers [1, 2],since these components could be used in fields as diverse as medicine and communications. Furthermore their small active volume offers a number of important advantages over conventional bulk glass lasers. We have chosen to investigate ytterbium doped fibre as it provides a very "clean" system (ie free from excite-q state absorption. Apart from the energy levels around 11, 000 cm there are no other levels until the ultra-violet). The ytterbium fibre laser should therefore offer a good system on which to test some of the basic physics of fibre lasers. In addition it offers 3 -level, 4 -level and quasi 3 -level laser transitions. Published work on ytterbium doped glass lasers in bulk form has been sparse with the main publication being that of Snitzer [3].

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research into}} non-linear optical effects in <b>monomode</b> <b>fibres</b> for sensing and signal processing schemes. The work is initially placed into {{the context of}} relevant fibre sensor applications for aerospace. Candidate non-linear processes are then described and Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) targeted as a suitable mechanism. The SBS process in <b>monomode</b> <b>fibres</b> is then fully described, including a theoretical assessment {{of the magnitude of}} both pump and Stokes signals with fibre length. The project developed, firstly, an all-optical frequency shifter using SBS which generated output carriers in the 1 - 70 OMHz regýon, depending on fibre type and system topology. In particular, a single-fibre system was demonstrated for the first time. Limitations of the technique arose through fibre photosensitivity and non-linear dynamical effects which, respectively, increased the input pump power requirements and introduced intensity and frequency instabilities into the output signal. Both processes were investigated fully. Optical fibre and pump characteristics, and system configurations, were therefore identified which minimised their impact. The same SBS heterodyning principles were then used to investigate single-pump sensor systems. Both 'quasi-point' and two-element, multiplexed temperature sensors were demonstrated. A linear relationship between the Stokes frequency and temperature was obtained from 5 to 55 'C, determined primarily by the thermal response of the acoustic phonon velocity. The sensing resolution was typically ± 2 'C, limited by the non-linear dynamical effects, and the spatial resolution was determined by the pump/fibre interaction length. One unique sensing element per optical input was demonstrated. These results are then placed in the context of systems utilising alternative SBS-based strategies, other non-linear effects and fibre ring resonators. Management elements of the project were covered by detailing both the technical and strategic motivations for undertaking the research and, by describing the issues on which a cost benefit analysis of fibre sensors for aircraft can be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} {{a great deal of}} interest in the development of single-mode fibres, capable of transmitting linearly-polarized light. Conventional <b>monomode</b> <b>fibres</b> exhibit linear birefringence; they therefore have an output state which is, in general, elliptically polarized and different from that at the input. Apart from the possible curtailment of the transmission bandwidth caused by this birefringence, the indeterminacy of the output polarization is a considerable disadvantage when coupling fibres to polarization-sensitive integrated-optics receivers. In addition, several interesting devices which utilise single-mode fibres have recently emerged and it has been found that the intrinsic retardance present in the fibres accompanied by the uncertainty in output polarization imposes a limitation on performance. Amongst these, the best known are the Faraday-effect current transducer, the fibre Raman laser and the fibre gyroscop...|$|R

Subnanosecond mode-locked pulses of ~ 20 pJ and Q-switched pulses of 200 nsec and ~ 10 W peak power are observed at 1. 08 µm. There {{has been much}} recent interest in laser systems using as the gain medium rare earth-doped optical fibres which only support a single waveguide mode at the lasing wavelength. The small diameter of the active region, i. e. the fibre core, combined with longitudinal pumping by a laser allows the achievement of low thresholds, high conversion efficiencies and high gain. The small core diameter also eliminates the thermal distortion and thermal birefringence problems that plague bulk glass systems. As an illustration of these benefits of a fibre laser, we note that cw operation has been achieved, with low threshold, even for three-level laser schemes. Thus Er doped fibre, operating at 1. 55 µm, (4 I 13 / 2 to 4 I 15 / 2) has been operated as a cw laser and cw operation of a Nd-doped fibre has been achieved on the 4 F 3 / 2 to 4 I 9 / 2 transition at ~ 0. 9 µm.

The methods of evanescent wave access include side-polishing of all glass monomode, tapering of all glass monomode {{and the use of}} porous clad multimode optical fibre. Preparation of zirconium fluoride fibres for sensing requires great care and the polishing and tapering techniques presented are substantially different from those currently used for Silica fibre. A number of experimental systems have been employed, using both broadband and laser sources, with thermoelectrically and liquid nitrogen cooled detectors, side-polished and tapered <b>monomode</b> <b>fibre</b> sensors are shown to have very low sensitivty to gaseous analytes. The use of a novel mid-IR LED source is also reported. The effect of analyte refractive index on evanescent wave sensitivity is discussed.

40|$|The {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{a number of}} optical fibre sensor concepts suitable for measurement of isotropic pressure or anisotropic strain. These sensors are capable of measuring pressure in hydraulic actuation systems and/or strain in structures. Three basic types of sensor have been researched: in-fibre gratings, micro-miniature Fabry-Perot devices and sensors based on optical delay measurement within conventional hire. An intrinsic feature of all the options {{is that they are}} hermetically-sealed against the ingress of water, and are therefore more likely to be practical for real engineering applications. The in-fibre grating sensor is a highly attractive option for single point sensing over a short gauge length. The sensor is a length of fibre with a periodic variation in refractive index along its length. This index variation is produced by focusing two converging ultraviolet laser beams onto the fibre. Work at the ORC has recently resulted in the production of high-performance gratings, with up to 100 % reflectivity if desired. The gratings can also be written into conventional monomode fibres, in some cases with a single "shot" from a pulsed laser. Hollow glass microspheres have been investigated for their feasibility as pressure sensors. These spheres can be bonded, (in an on-axis position), {{to the end of a}} <b>monomode</b> <b>fibre</b> and, without need for additional optics, form a miniature low-finesse Fabry-Perot sensing head. This has a reflected spectrum which vanes periodically with optical frequency. The frequencies of peak reflectivities are dependent on pressure. The spheres are of similar dimensions to the optical fibre (~ 100 µm) and hence should have an extremely rapid response and high mechanical resonant frequency. Several longer-gauge length sensors for pressure or strain monitoring are being investigated. One method involves a transversal filter concept. (A two-path optical fibre system, where signals are first split then recombined, the resulting signal then being dependent on the relative delays between the paths).
