40|$|In {{the current}} paper, {{after a brief}} {{discussion}} on the historical evolution of both the RC mushroom floors and the code approaches adopted for deformability checks, an appropriate methodology {{to be used for}} calibration of numerical models for the Serviceability Limit State assessment of these structural systems, including also the use of commercial calculation programs, is defined. The procedure has been employed to investigate the causal link between the <b>mushroom</b> <b>floor</b> deformability and the damages caused by the renovation works performed inside the bank offices within a Technical Consultancy, taken in this work as a case stud...|$|E

Houses were half buried, mostly square or circular (they were also combined in <b>mushroom</b> shape), with <b>floors</b> of burned clay and circular fireplaces.|$|R

These edible wild fungi keep morel hunters on their toes - their distinctive wrinkled caps form a giraffish pattern unique to their kind. They can be incredibly hard to find, very good at looking exactly like a pile of curled, dead brown leaves on the forest <b>floor.</b> <b>Mushroom</b> ethics among collectors mandate the mesh collecting bag, so the spores can scatter as one carries home their harvest.|$|R
50|$|The most {{interesting}} Copper Age or Eneolithic finds are from Vučedol culture (named after Vučedol near Vukovar). Ceramics are of extraordinary quality with black color, high glow and specific decorative geometrical cuts that were encrusted with white, red or yellow color. Sculptures are few, but very skilfully done and very expressive (like the pot in shape of Dove with engraved double axe - labrys). People were living on hilltops with palisade walls. Houses were half buried, mostly square or circular (they were also combined in <b>mushroom</b> shape), with <b>floor</b> of burned clay and circular fireplace.Out of that culture sprung out Bronze Age Vinkovci culture (named after city of Vinkovci) that is recognizable by bronze fibulas that were replacing objects like needles and buttons.|$|R
