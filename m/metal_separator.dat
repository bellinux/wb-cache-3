40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{examining}} the decay {{rate of charge}} on powders deposited on the separator plates were examined. In the first method the charge transferred from ground to the separator plate was measured directly with an electrometer after completion of the powder deposition and after turning off the electric field. In a second method an electrostatic field meter (Trek model 354 A) {{was used to measure}} the field due to the charge on the plates or on thin Teflon or aluminum plates which had been placed over the <b>metal</b> <b>separator</b> plates. In addition the paper discusses the fabrication and use of a resistivity cell for coal powder; charging of small particles by milling; observations with silica gel; and a review of articles on particle charging.

40|$|Recently, {{as a new}} {{clean and}} {{renewable}} energy much {{attention has been paid}} to the PEFC (Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell) because of energy and environmental problems, such as depletion of petroleum, global warming and so on. PEFC has the characteristics of a simple structure, easy to maintain and a low cost. One of the parts of the PEFC is called the ‘separator’; <b>metal</b> <b>separators</b> have a major issue regarding compatibility with corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity, in addition to low cost. Using current technology, we have selected a stainless steel AISI 316 L with an Au/Ni skin film. Therefore, there is a need to make a thinner skin film especially an Au top film for suppressing the PEFC total cost. When thinking about skin film, defects in the Au top film increases gradually as the thickness of Au film decreases. As a result, intensive corrosion is generated due to defects in the Au/Ni skin film. However, there are few reports evaluating correlation between the corrosion characteristics of stainless steel with an Au/Ni skin film under a PEFC environment and existing defects in the Au/Ni skin film. Therefore in this study, the pinhole defect ratio especially in Au film was evaluated using the CPCD method. Au/Ni double layered coating was formed on AISI 316 L stainless steel employing the sputtering method because of its high adhesion strength. As the quasi-PEFC environment 1 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was selected and then the pinhole defect ratio was evaluated by the CPCD method. As a result, the pinhole defect area ratio of 80 nm thick Au film was obtained to be about 1. 1 % in 1 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{separator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts in PEM fuel cells. Stainless steels are widely used as separator for its good mechanical properties and mass production. However, for a good chemical compatibility, stainless steels need to have high chromium content or surface treatment, which makes separator high cost. Low cost of separator is important for commercial use. In this study, conventional low carbon steel is used as base <b>metal</b> of <b>separator.</b> Low carbon steel is low at cost, but has poor chemical properties for separator. For a good corrosion resistance, low carbon steel needs to be surface treated. To make a uniform surface treated layer on low carbon steel, chromium is conventionally electroplated on the steel and thermally nitrided. Surface treated low carbon steel is investigated using microstructure and element analysis tools. Interfacial contact resistance and polarization test is applied for the properties of fuel cell separator. The results show that chromium nitrided layer uniformly formed on low carbon steel. And the surface treated steel showed a good corrosion resistance as a separator...|$|R
30|$|For {{the working}} {{electrode}} preparation, 80  wt% of CGO nanowires, 10  wt% of Super P carbon, and 10  wt% poly(acrylic) acid binder were mixed with appropriate amount of distilled water {{to form a}} slurry and then uniformly casted onto a copper foil. Afterwards, the electrodes were dried in vacuum oven at 60  °C for 24  h for moisture removing. The Ge electrode was prepared via similar processes. The electrolyte consisted of 1  M NaClO 4 salt dissolved in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC, 1 : 1  v/v) with 5  vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as additive. The working electrodes were assembled into coin-type (CR 2032) cells in an argon-filled glove box with glass microfiber filter and Na <b>metal</b> as <b>separator</b> and counter electrode, respectively, and appropriate amount of above electrolyte. The electrochemical measurements were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, CHI 660 B electrochemical workstation) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests (LAND 2001 A Battery Tester) in the voltage range of 0.05 – 2.0  V vs. Na/Na+. The weight loading of CGO active material in working electrode was ca. 1.0  mg cm− 2, and the specific capacity was calculated based on the active material.|$|R
40|$|We were tasked by Micro-Vu to design, build, {{and test}} a {{small-scale}} low-cost <b>metal</b> chip <b>separator</b> {{to operate on}} one of their 24 / 7 mills. The goal of the project was to separate the steel and aluminum chips coming off of the mill’s chip conveyor to end up with a bin of 99 % pure aluminum by mass. To accomplish this goal we first brainstormed various possible ideas and performed small scale tests the best ones. After further review we determined the best solution to this problem was a design that involved a cycling magnetic backing that would pull steel out of the flow and drop it into a separate bin. To prove our concept we build a small scale wooden mockup. After running various tests using this mockup we determined that our design was a viable solution to the problem. We then moved on to completing our final design and building the prototype. In the end the prototype was fully functional and in testing was able to separate metal chips and achieve a separation rate of 92 - 99 % separation by mass...|$|R
5000|$|In 1974 H&K {{initiated}} {{design work}} on a sound-suppressed variant of the MP5, designated the MP5SD (SD—Schalldämpfer German for [...] "sound suppressor"), which features an integral but detachable aluminium sound suppressor and a lightweight bolt. The weapon's 146 mm barrel has 30 2.5 mm ports drilled forward of the chamber through which escaping gases are diverted to the surrounding sealed tubular casing that is screwed onto threading on the barrel’s external surface {{just prior to the}} ported segment. The suppressor itself is divided into two stages; the initial segment surrounding the ported barrel serves as an expansion chamber for the propellant gases, reducing gas pressure to slow down the acceleration of the projectile. The second, decompression stage occupies the remaining length of the suppressor tube and contains a stamped <b>metal</b> helix <b>separator</b> with several compartments which increase the gas volume and decrease its temperature, deflecting the gases as they exit the muzzle, so muffling the exit report. The bullet leaves the muzzle at subsonic velocity, so it does not generate a sonic shock wave in flight. As a result of reducing the barrel’s length and venting propellant gases into the suppressor, the bullet’s muzzle velocity was lowered anywhere from 16% to 26% (depending on the ammunition used) while maintaining the weapon’s automation and reliability. The weapon was designed to be used with standard supersonic ammunition with the suppressor on at all times.|$|R
40|$|Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) {{is a major}} pest {{of olive}} fruits. Biological control of olive fruit fly mainly relies on the {{activity}} of the Braconid species Psyttalia concolor (Szépligeti), which parasitizes Bactrocera oleae at the larval stage. Parasitism tests have been carried out at the insect growing facility (insectariums) of the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Bari (C. I. H. E. A. M.). The critical point of the use of P. concolor as a biological control agent in organic olive crop is the assessment of its effectiveness against B. oleae. Its lower presence in fruits of cultivated olives rather than in small fruits of wild olives suggests an influence {{of the size of the}} fruit, and of the thickness of its pulp on the parasitization of P. concolor. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the capacity of the females of P. concolor to lay their eggs into the target host according to the distance existing between the female and the host larva. In these tests, the substitution host Ceratitis capitata was used and parasitism of P. concolor was tested at different distances (0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 and 3 mm) to the host larvae at different times (7 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min) of interaction. Predetermined distances between the parasitoids and the target larvae were arranged by locating the flying females into cubical cages of 40 x 40 x 40 cm with Plexiglas walls and the open roof covered with a tulle tissue in order to avoid that any insects from outside may enter the cages, and to allow the females to protrude their ovipositors. On these roofs, plastic cylinders containing the target larvae were placed with the open bases arranged with a tulle tissue, to allow the contact with the parasitoid females. Considering the width of the tissues negligible, distances were set by <b>metal</b> <b>separators</b> with increasing thickness. Parasitism level at 7 min was not significantly different at 2, 2. 5 and 3 mm distances. Parasitism level was the highest at 0, 0. 5, and 1 mm distances with no significant changes. Parasitism at 15 min showed a high variability according to the distances. The highest level resulted at 0. 5 and 1 mm distances, the lowest at 3 mm distance. At 30 min interaction, the highest level of parasitism was at 0 mm distance, whilst at 1 and 1. 5 mm the level was lower with no significant changes. Again, parasitism level was the lowest at 3 mm distance. The highest level of parasitism at 60 min was detected at 1. 5 mm distance and was as lower as the distance increased. In conclusion, the study showed that the females of P. concolor were not able to parasite the target larvae at distances higher than 2. 5 mm. Generally, the parasitism level decreases with the increase of the distance between target larvae and parasitoid females. At the lowest distances (0, 0. 5 and 1 mm) hyper parasitism occurred and the target pupae were killed, but also the development of the parasitoids into adults was very difficult for nutrient unavailability. Biological control of P. concolor against B. oleae larvae may give satisfactory results only if the depth at which the target larvae are located into the olive drupes is not higher than 2 or 2. 5 mm from the surfac...|$|R

The charge/discharge measurements of the Sb 2 S 3 electrodes were taken on a Neware battery test system at room temperature.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design and build an {{equipment}} which can detect ferrous and non-ferrous objects in conveyed commodities, discriminate between them and locate the object along the belt and on {{the width of the}} belt. The magnetic induction mechanism was used as a means of achieving the objectives of this research. In order to choose the appropriate geometry and size of the induction field source, the field distributions of different source geometries and sizes were studied in detail. From these investigations it was found the square loop geometry is the most appropriate as a field generating source {{for the purpose of this}} project. The phenomena of field distribution in the conductors was also investigated. An equipment was designed and built at the preliminary stages of thework based on a flux-gate magnetometer with the ability to detect only ferrous objects. The instrument was designed such that it could be used to detect ferrous objects in the coal conveyors of power stations. The advantages of employing this detector in the power industry over the present ferrous <b>metal</b> electromagnetic <b>separators</b> were also considered. The objectives of this project culminated in the design and construction of a ferrous and non-ferrous detector with the ability to discriminate between ferrous and non-ferrous metals and to locate the objects on the conveying system. An experimental study was carried out to test the performance of the equipment in the detection of ferrous and non-ferrous objects of a given size carried on the conveyor belt. The ability of the equipment to discriminate between the types of metals and to locate the object on the belt was also evaluated experimentally. The benefits which can be gained from the industrial implementations of the equipment were considered. Further topics which may be investigated as an extension of this work are given...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} inorganic elements in ashes from biomass gasification power generation (BGPG) plant. The ash samples of the gasifier ash, separator ash and wet scrubber ash were collected in a 1 MW circulating fluidized bed (CFB) wood gasification power generation plant. Particle size distribution of ashes was determined by gravimetric measurement and super probe analyzer. The concentrations of trace elements and major ash-forming elements, such as As, Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Na, Ni, Ph, Ti in different ashes {{as a function of}} particle size were determined by Inductive Coupled Plasma Spectrometer. The concentrations and distribution coefficient and enrichment factors of the inorganic elements in ashes were studied. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and X-ray powder diffraction were used to provide information on the characteristics of the ashes. The results showed that most of the trace elements had an enrichment tendency in the finer size particles. A considerable amount of the ashes was residual carbon. Most of the volatile e. g. halogen elements and alkali elements existed mainly in wet scrubber ash and enriched in fly ash. Most of the Si, Ni, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd were found in separator ash, indicating an enrichment of heavy <b>metal</b> elements in <b>separator</b> ash. K, S, Mn, Cu mainly existed in gasifier ash.

40|$|Department of Energy Engineering(Battery Science and Technology) A {{vigorous}} {{expansion of}} newly emerging application fields, including smart mobile electronics, power tools, (hybrid) electric vehicles, and grid-scale energy storage systems inspires the relentless pursuit of advanced rechargeable power sources with reliable/sustainable electrochemical performance and safety tolerance. Among the numerous power sources, undoubtedly, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) {{are listed in}} the top tier and still garner considerable attention as an appealing electrochemical system to address the challenging issues. A battery separator membrane is supposed to be electrically inert for preventing electrical contact (resulting in safety failures) between electrodes, in addition to its another key role as an ion-conducting route. Here, as a multifunctional membrane strategy to break up the stereotypical belief about battery separators, we demonstrate a new class of Janus-faced, dual (ion/electron) -conductive/chemically-active (i. e., heavy <b>metal</b> ion-chelating) battery <b>separators</b> based on elaborately-designed heterolayered nanomat architecture. The Janus-faced, heterolayered nanomat separators (referred to as “Janus separators”) are fabricated through the in-series, concurrent electrospraying/electrospinning process. The Janus separator is composed of an ion-conductive/metal ion-chelating support layer (= a mat of densely-packed, thiol-functionalized silica particles spatially besieged by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) /polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers) and a dual-conductive top layer (= a thin mat of polyetherimide (PEI) nanofibers wrapped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)). The support layer acts as a chemical trap that can capture heavy metal ions dissolved in liquid electrolytes and the thin top layer serves as an upper current collector of cathodes to facilitate redox reaction kinetics. Notably, the unusual porous structure (specifically, preferential deposition of the MWNTs along the PEI nanofibers) of the top layer is theoretically elucidated using molecular dynamics simulation. As a consequence, the Janus separator enables significant improvements in the fast-rate charge/discharge reaction of lithium-ion batteries and also high-temperature cycling performance, which lie far beyond those achievable with conventional polyethylene separators. The Janus separator featuring such exceptional multifunctionality is envisioned to open a new membrane solution for high-energy/high-performance lithium-ion batteries that will power forthcoming smart ubiquitous era. ope...|$|R
