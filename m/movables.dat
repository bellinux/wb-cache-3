Custody was passed to Henry the Lion and a tax of 25 percent of <b>movables</b> and income was required in England to pay the ransom of 100,000 marks, with a promise of 50,000 more, before Richard was released in 1194. In his absence Philip II of France had overrun much of Normandy, while John of England controlled much of the remainder of Richard's lands. On his return to England, Richard forgave John and re-established his control. Leaving England in 1194 never to return, Richard battled Phillip {{for the next five}} years for the return of the holdings seized during his incarceration. Close to total victory he was injured by an arrow during the siege of Château de Châlus-Chabrol and died after lingering injured for ten days.|$|E

30|$|It is {{also found}} that the 13 samples have a wide range of <b>movable</b> fluid {{saturation}}, and the <b>movable</b> fluid saturation does not necessarily increase with porosity and permeability. For instance, among samples 4, 8, and 3, their permeability increases from 0.28 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 to 0.33 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 µm 2 and then 0.69 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 µm 2, while their <b>movable</b> fluid saturations are, respectively, 34.92, 18.85 and 30.97 %. However, the overall trend is that the <b>movable</b> fluid saturation generally increases with permeability. Meanwhile, it can be also clearly seen that <b>movable</b> fluid porosity is more positively correlated with permeability than porosity, with respective correlation coefficients of 0.6582 and 0.5307. Overall, compared to <b>movable</b> fluid saturation, <b>movable</b> fluid porosity is more positively correlated with physical properties. In other words, <b>movable</b> fluid saturation is less influenced by the physical properties. Therefore, physical properties cannot completely reflect the occurrence characteristics of <b>movable</b> fluids, as they are not controlled by single-reservoir parameters.|$|R
500|$|One of Walter's first {{suggestions}} was {{to lower}} the fees for having charters confirmed, from nine pounds and five shillings to eighteen shillings and four pence. Accompanying this measure was a requirement that no charter would be accepted in a king's court without having been confirmed by King John. Not only did this reduce forgeries, {{it led to the}} establishment of the Charter Roll, an administrative copy of all charters issued and confirmed by the government. In his relations with other officers, Walter worked closely with the justiciar Geoffrey Fitz Peter, on the collection of taxation, and both men went to Wales in 1203 on a diplomatic mission. Another joint action of the two men concerned a tax of a seventh part of all <b>movables</b> collected from both lay and ecclesiastical persons. The medieval chronicler Roger of Wendover said that the king [...] "had Archbishop Hubert of Canterbury to act for him in the matter of the church property, Geoffrey fitz-Peter in the matter of lay property; and these two spared no one in carrying out their orders." [...] Walter was also responsible for the keeping of copies of other royal letters in the Close Rolls and the Patent Rolls. The Patent rolls record letters that were issued in [...] "patent", or openly and not sealed, and the Close rolls record letters issued sealed, or letters close. The various rolls are extant from 1199 for the Charter roll, 1201 for the Patent roll, and 1204 for the Close roll. Walter also continued to innovate in local government, as the earliest record of the coroner's rolls, or county records, being used to cross-check oral testimony in the county courts date from 1202 and 1203, during Walter's chancellorship.|$|E

2500|$|According to the legend, an English king died {{without leaving}} a {{properly}} perfected testament, so his last will was expressed {{from the world}} beyond. He left a crown and all immovable property to his son, and all <b>movables</b> – to his daughter. Being instigated by his councilors, the Prince decided to fulfill his father's will nominally. He ordered to drive a black bear (which undoubtedly was a unit of king's movable property) to a Princess' bedchamber. In case of Princess’ death that seemed inevitable, the King's wish would be fulfilled and Princess' failure to manage the <b>movables</b> would be proven. However, the Princess did not only tame the beast but even rode out her chamber on its back, upraising her hands and calling for justice. Her brother made sure that truth and heaven take sister's side. He asked her pardon and married her off to a Duke of Lorraine, with all due property as a portion.

2500|$|José Nicolau da Fonseca has {{recorded}} that Diogo Rodrigues died in Colvá, Gôa and was buried inside this mother church (Matriz) of Salcette {{of which he}} was the Captain of the fort at that time called Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves at Rachol with his grave's inscription reading: Aqui jaz Diogo Rodrigues o do Forte, Capitão desta Fortaleza, O qual derrubou os pagodes destas terras. Falleceu a 21 de Abril de 1577 annos. In English translation this reads: [...] "Here lies Diogo Rodrigues (called) 'O do Forte/ Captain of this Fortress, who destroyed the pagodas of these territories. He died on the 21st April of the year 1577." [...] The grave inscription stone and his relics are still inside the church, near the altar of Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves from 1577. [...] Hindu pagodas of Salcette in Goa were destroyed by Diego who personally oversaw this destruction in 1567. This led to the mass exodus of Hindus from the Portuguese held territories and the Hindus taking the idols of their deities across the Zuari river to the territories of the Hindu Sonde Kings. Amongst the temples destroyed are the temples of Shri Ramnathi, Shree Shantadurga and Shree Mangeshi. Also destroyed were nine pagodas in the village of Margão (Mathagrama) by Diogo, who was rewarded with the revenues of the lands belonging to them the destruction was triggered when a Jesuit was attacked and when the community of Loutolim disobeyed Diogo Rodrigues, the then Captain of the Fort of Rachol as he had called the residents of the village of Lotoulim for a meeting, but they did not turn up. As a punishment to them, he burnt down the temple of Ramnath. The villagers filed a case with Capitão às Justiças de sua Magestad in Goa. The magistrate ordered the Captain to rebuild the temple. With the support of the Archbishop Primaz and the Provincial Council, the Captain obtained an Order from the Viceroy to burn down en masse the temples of Salcete, consequently the viceroy: Dom António de Noronha (1564–1568) {{at the request of the}} Archbishop and the Jesuits ordered Diogo Rodrigues to burn down all the remaining temples he found in Salcette, the viceroy also issued a decree in December 1565 forbidding the erection of new temples and the repairs of the existing ones, this was as stated: [...] "I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the King, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression." [...] Diogo Rodrigues was also known as [...] "O do Forte", In English: [...] "Of the Strong", the Captain of Salcette who ordered the destruction of the temples of Assolna, Ambelim, Velim, Veroda, Cuncolim and Talvorda, when the villagers failed to obey some of his orders. The property and income of the temples were given to the church authorities. The exact date when the Captain Diogo Rodrigues descended upon the temple of Malsa devi (to be converted into a Church of Our Lady of Conception in future) [...] in all fury was on 7 March 1567 just at the time when the priest was about to bedeck the idol of Mahalasa with silver ornaments. Those ornaments were confiscated along with other valuables of the temple and a proper inventory of the <b>movables</b> was made, then began the act of destruction. The image in the sanctum sanctorum was broken to pieces allegedly because Fr. Luis Goes had denounced her as a ‘bad woman’. The villagers managed to spirit away other idols. Sacred books and works of art that enhanced the beauty of this temple together with the roof were ruthlessly destroyed. The Captain retreated after planting a Cross at the most prominent spot at the site. The details of the destruction of this temple are to be found in the Report of Irmão Gomes Vaz dated December 12, 1567 which notes that the temple was totally destroyed on March 14, 1567. Diego Rodrigues took toll of 280 temples in Salcette alone. The cults from those temples were shifted mainly to the New Conquest areas where, the Desais and the Sardesais, the feudal lords of Sultan Adil Shaha of Bijapur, being Hindus themselves, took it as their holy duty to facilitate creation of new abodes for the said cults.|$|E
