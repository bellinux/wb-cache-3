However, during this period there was substantial immigration of workers from Brittany and Normandy to Jersey. Most probably intended to be short term migrants, planning to return to France. But some decided to settle in Jersey, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> Jersey’s population being descended from them. The French migrants were predominantly agricultural workers working in the rapidly growing agricultural sector; they were not replacing British migrants, who had largely been working in construction and oyster farming.|$|E

Families created by {{gay and lesbian}} couples are on the increase and the issues relating to the legal protections of these families remain uncertain. Many state courts and legislatures have refused to legally recognize, through second-parent adoptions, the relationship of children born to a homosexual couple with their non-biological second parent. The refusal to permit secondparent adoptions denies the children of homosexual couples, as a class, many of the legal benefits and protections afforded to children of heterosexual couples. This Note argues that such classifications of children born to same-sex couples punish children {{for the actions of}} their parents and thus results in unfair treatment violative of the Equal Protection Clause...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{brief history}} of {{application}} frameworks has been focused primarily on technical issues. That is changing today, {{as more and more}} organizations are recognizing the potential of application framework investments to improve their strategic position in the markets they serve. But to realize this potential, an approach firmly grounded in the disciplines of business strategy is needed. Value Based Reuse Investment (VBRI) integrates principles drawn from Value Based Management (McTaggart, Kontes, & Mankins 1994) [...] which has been adopted by <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> s most successful companies [...] with concepts drawn from recent thinking on capturing information technology business value. The VBRI approach was developed for investments in reusable software in general, but is especially wellsuited to investments in application frameworks, due to their role in the acquisition of organizational reuse capability. An essential premise of VBRI is that the pr...|$|E

It does this by measuring the energy used to build the search structure during preprocessing {{for each of the}} five algorithms and the average energy taken to classify a packet. To do this we implemented all five algorithms in C code and used a microarchitectural power simulation tool called Sim-Panalyzer to estimate the power dissipated by the five algorithms while running on a SA 1100 StrongARM RISC processor similar to the type found on <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>today</b> 2 ̆ 7 s programmable network processors...|$|E
