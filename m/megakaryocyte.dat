25|$|In {{terms of}} evolution, the oldest {{physiological}} role of Ahr is in development. Ahr {{is presumed to}} have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand-independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted {{in the ability to}} bind ligand and might have helped humans evolve to tolerate smoke of fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears {{to play a role in}} the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis, lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their self-renewal and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in <b>megakaryocyte</b> differentiation.|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) is a hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{disorder}} with hypercellular bone marrow {{and an increase in}} abnormal <b>megakaryocytes,</b> varying degrees of marrow fibrosis, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Increased production platelet derived grows factor by <b>megakaryocytes</b> couses increased activity of fibroblasts and development of bone marrow fibrosis in idiopathic myelofibrosis. Numarical and morphological alteration and defective megakaryocytic development in idiopathic myelofibrosis was shown in the previous study. However, the degree of differentiation and functional activities of <b>megakaryocytes</b> still unknown. The morphology of <b>megakaryocytes</b> was evaluated in smears of bone marrow from 12 patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis in chronic stage and 12 patients without hematology disorders (control group). <b>Megakaryocytes</b> was separated on megakaryoblasts, promegakaryocytes, basophilic, polychromatophilic, oxyphilic <b>megakaryocytes</b> and naked (bare) nuclei of <b>megakaryocytes.</b> Functional activity of <b>megakaryocytes</b> (<b>megakaryocytes</b> with platelet formation) connect with degree of differentiation were evaluated. Number of lobule of <b>megakaryocytes</b> was accounted. The analysis of megakaryocytogram revealed the presence of atypical <b>megakaryocytes</b> (cell with abnormal immature cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei, cell with separated one or all lobules of nuclei, vacuolated <b>megakaryocytes).</b> In group with idiopathic myelofibrosis the number of naked nuclear was prominently increased (p< 0, 01) compare with control group. These cell accounted up to 36 % in average of all megakaryopoietic elements. The number of functional activity <b>megakaryocytes</b> in group with idiopathic myelofibrosis was increased on 30 %.

Non-irradiated <b>megakaryocytes</b> were negative for active TGF 1.

Therefore, a direct effect of HIV on <b>megakaryocytes</b> was investigated.

40|$|With the {{development}} of methods to isolate human <b>megakaryocytes,</b> {{it is now possible}} to study marrow <b>megakaryocytes</b> for various biological properties (1 - 3). <b>Megakaryocytes</b> are unique cells in that they undergo nuclear endoreplication and cytoplasmic demarcation, giving rise to blood platelets (4). Platelets are essential components in hemostasis and participate in the pathophysiology of thrombosis and atherosclerosis (5 - 7).
