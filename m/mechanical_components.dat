5|$|Edward Norton, around 1930, {{designed}} a mechanical filter {{for use on}} phonograph recorders and players. Norton designed the filter in the electrical domain and then used the correspondence of mechanical quantities to electrical quantities to realise the filter using <b>mechanical</b> <b>components.</b> Mass corresponds to inductance, stiffness to elastance and damping to resistance. The filter was designed to have a maximally flat frequency response.|$|E

It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a {{pedestal}} machine gun mount as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount machine gun mount and three pintle machine gun mounts.|$|E

5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the <b>mechanical</b> <b>components,</b> such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Hardanger Line used Class 64 {{electric}} multiple units. On 28 March 1940, NSB sent {{an invitation}} to tender for two multiple units which {{would be similar to}} Class 64. The company asked both for aluminum and steel bids. However, NSB abandoned the plans and instead signed an agreement on 4 October 1940 for delivery of three electric locomotives. The units were intended to be delivered in 1942. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> and assembly was done by Thune, and electrical parts were delivered by NEBB, except the transformer and electric controllers, which were built by Per Kure.|$|E
5|$|The Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man {{was ordered}} {{to be put into}} {{production}} in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of Project Camel. A new plant was established at the Iowa Army Ordnance Plant. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>components</b> were made or procured by the Rock Island Arsenal. Electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions, known as Mods 1 and 2, which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2. Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.|$|E

5|$|When {{the order}} was placed, {{it was the first}} Norwegian {{electric}} locomotive with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> built in Germany. At the same time, NSB ordered five six-axle diesel-electric locomotives from Thyssen-Henschel (Mark Di 4), almost the same as the Danish Mark ME 1500. The Di 4/ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17. The two were planned to have the same rectifiers and motors, but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120.|$|E
5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese Grand Prix on 8 October, {{three teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions around European race tracks between 10–13 October {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Grand Prix. Ferrari opted to spend the four days with test driver Luca Badoer where he tested new <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> on the F1-2000 car at the Fiorano Circuit on a wet/dry track. He later moved to the Mugello Circuit where he tried out brake testing, car set-ups, tyre evaluation, endurance runs for the car's engines and continued trying out new car components. Benetton cancelled a test in Barcelona during the period and decided to run at the Silverstone Circuit one week later using new Supertec engines angled at 110° degrees.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue mechanical filters using <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> which filter mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of mechanical quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding to the energy in inductors, capacitors and resistors respectively.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E
5|$|The first diesel {{locomotive}} used by NSB {{was a single}} Di 1 unit delivered in 1942. It was more cost-efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non-electrified lines, and in 1945, NSB decided {{that it would not}} order more steam locomotives. General Motors' Electro Motive Division (EMD) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7, and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial. The body and <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> were built by NOHAB, the motors by ASEA and prime mover by EMD. While under production in 1954, GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden. It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August, but proved to have insufficient power, causing the train to be 20 minutes late.|$|E

Williams, with rookie competitor Jenson Button, went to the Autódromo do Estoril for two days and tried wet weather tyres and different aerodynamic configurations. Prost travelled to Magny-Cours and their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin collected three days of chassis design data for the upcoming AP04 chassis. Benetton opted to miss testing prior to the event but their test driver Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their nuclear power plants, the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>components.</b> Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} and universally useful means of adjustment {{in the realm}} of precision engineering and microoptics becomes possible with the realization of a new drive. In contrast to traditional adjustment methods, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> will be situated in its final position before the adjustment process starts. Specific mechanical impulses (momenta) generated by a striking mechanism are transmitted to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>component</b> or its housing (carrier). This results in minute linear or fine angular motions. Prototypes of the electromechanical striking mechanism have been researched and developed. The arrangements make possible the adjustment of mirror, of fibre to fibre or of fibre to opto-electronic sensors.

5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>components.</b> In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>components</b> in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E
