500|$|As {{they would}} do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards <b>me.</b> <b>Last</b> night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the last}} game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a {{commensurate}} payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 {{that he would not}} consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said at the time, [...] "I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- [...] "give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with <b>me</b> <b>last</b> year." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded {{within one}} day of the episode's {{original}} broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves, although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt. [...] After the episode was broadcast, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." [...] Dave Itzkoff, arts reporter for The New York Times, complimented Mencia for his response. West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered <b>me</b> <b>last</b> night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West's reaction, and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West. Parker said, [...] "It was like, dude, we just said you were a gay fish. What are you talking about? It was so dumb." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{celebrities who}} were spoofed in 13th-season episodes responded to their portrayals. The day after [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, West wrote on his blog, [...] "South Park murdered <b>me</b> <b>last</b> night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my {{feelings}} {{but what can}} you expect from South Park!" [...] West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged {{he has a problem}} with his ego, but said he was trying to change. The blog post drew substantial media attention; Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, but in the end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego." [...] Carlos Mencia, host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia, was also spoofed in [...] "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people. After the episode aired, Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed, [...] "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told <b>me</b> <b>last</b> summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E

[...] "It was good," [...] the senator said, [...] "for five million dollars for <b>me</b> <b>last</b> year." [...] In 1954, after the Hadacol fiasco, LeBlanc tried to re-enter the patent medicine market with a lemon flavored non-alcoholic vitamin tonic named [...] "Kary-On".

2500|$|White {{was made}} Australian of the Year for 1974, {{but in a}} {{typically}} rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians {{to spend the day}} reflecting {{on the state of the}} country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: [...] "Something terrible happened to <b>me</b> <b>last</b> week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in Melbourne Town Hall on Australia Day. This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen".|$|E

I mean, I {{wanted to do something}} England. The last thing I'd done was with Michael Palin. We did [...] in 1992, I think.

McFadden told the Irish Examiner, [...] "Eddie Harvey said to <b>me</b> <b>last</b> year when he was in the leisure centre, he'd pop into the jacuzzi and everyone would be talking doom and gloom and the recession.

2500|$|Obama's win in Iowa {{was seen}} as a boost to his already-improving chances in New Hampshire. On January 4, he told {{supporters}} in New Hampshire, [...] "If you give me the same chance that Iowa gave <b>me</b> <b>last</b> night I truly believe that I will be the president of the United States of America." [...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ... We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1989 season, Newman {{was interviewed}} along with {{teammate}} Gary Gaetti about playing the [...] "hot corner" [...] (third base) for the Minnesota Twins. Newman recounted an experience playing the position when future Hall of Famer (and future Twin) Dave Winfield {{came to the}} plate, [...] "Dave Winfield hit one right at <b>me</b> <b>last</b> year. I had no chance to move. I looked and the ball was in my glove. I made like I knew what I was doing." [...] In 1990, Al Newman {{was a part of}} setting a major league record as the Minnesota Twins turned 2 triple plays in one game against the Boston Red Sox, making the final throw in both. Also during the 1990 season, teammate and future Hall of Famer, Kirby Puckett, was moved around the field from his normal centerfield position to play right field, third base, shortstop, and second base in a single game. Newman jokingly remarked to the press following the game, [...] "I'm glad Puck's one of us utility guys now. Maybe he'll raise the salary structure a little." ...|$|E
2500|$|Janet Carr told News.com.au, [...] "When {{we first}} started [...] we knew there was nothing out there in {{mainstream}} media that satisfied us as gamers, and so we made the show from within the community... The TV show {{is just part of}} this community and there is really no screen between us and them." [...] News.com.au said, [...] "Good Game thrives from online interaction with its viewers, offering free episodes and even gaming sessions with the team", citing Carr's explanation: [...] "Our forums are incredibly active, we play games regularly with people who watch the show, and the emails they send are like, 'Hey Jungy (co-host Junglist), thanks for knifing <b>me</b> <b>last</b> night!'" [...] After spontaneously deciding to attend the EB Games Gold Coast conference, thinking the experience would be lonely and awkward, Hex and Bajo were overwhelmed by the response; the hundreds of people in queues to go see them. It was due to fan requests that Ask Good Game – an exclusive segment to Good Game: Spawn Point for some time – was added back to the parent show. In 2013, Bajo and Hex had an AMA with their fans on Reddit.|$|E
