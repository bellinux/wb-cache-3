In partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, students are documenting stages of transition along University Avenue through the stories of elders, business owners, and residents affected by the METRO Green Line light-rail transit project. The students {{learn more about the}} neighborhood's history, document stories of the LRT project that <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> be told, and share images that <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> be seen.|$|E
5|$|Research in 2009 {{has found}} that an {{indicator}} for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors that <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> be lethal.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Virginia State Bar's Young Lawyers Conference {{implemented}} the Oliver Hill/Samuel Tucker Institute, named for both Oliver Hill and Samuel Tucker.

During (inpatient) epilepsy monitoring, a patient's typical seizure medications may be withdrawn.|$|E

Globally, more than1,400 homes have been completed by Women Build volunteers.|$|E

25|$|World War II {{brought some}} new opportunities. The Office of Scientific Research and Development, under Vannevar Bush, began in 1941 {{to keep a}} {{registry}} {{of men and women}} trained in the sciences. Because there was a shortage of workers, some women were able to work in jobs they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> have accessed. Many women worked on the Manhattan Project or on scientific projects for the United States military services. Women who worked on the Manhattan Project included Leona Woods Marshall, Katharine Way, and Chien-Shiung Wu.|$|E
25|$|Secured {{credit cards}} are an option to allow {{a person with a}} poor credit history or no credit history to have a credit card which <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> be available. They are often offered as a means of {{rebuilding}} one's credit. Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards. For people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.|$|E
25|$|The Matrix had {{a strong}} effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's {{incorporation}} of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in X-Men (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on Daredevil (2003). The Matrixs Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) that they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> have had.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{wrote that}} male {{heterosexual}} improvisers typically dismissed women in audiences as not important, seeing them as [...] "either wives, girlfriends, or groupies". She said FIG seized {{this opportunity to}} change the relationship between improvisers and female audiences. Using their [...] "skills of social and technical virtuosity", FIG improvised around issues important to women, and thereby [...] "drew women into their music who <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> be concerned {{with the concept of}} free improvisation." [...] Smith explained that even women not familiar with the technicalities of free improvisation still related to a group of women on stage [...] "foreground their bodies and their sounds for the pleasure of other woman".|$|E
500|$|Gernsback's {{declared}} {{goals for}} Amazing were {{to educate and}} to entertain. [...] In the editorial for the first issue he asserted that [...] "Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading – they are also always instructive. [...] They supply knowledge that we <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> obtain – and they supply {{it in a very}} palatable form. [...] For the best of these modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge and even inspiration without once making us aware that we are being taught". It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of Amazing contained a high proportion of reprints. [...] He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool" [...] in the May 1927 issue of Amazing. [...] The story was completely unscientific; Gernsback's introduction to the story claimed that Merritt was introducing a new science, but Ashley comments that Gernsback was simply [...] "looking for an excuse for including such fantastic fiction in the magazine when it did not fit in with his basic creed".|$|E

Another reason to implement lives is that the ability to earn extra lives provide an additional reward incentive for the player.|$|R
