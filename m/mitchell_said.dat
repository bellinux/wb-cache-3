500|$|The suit {{claimed that}} Thompson {{had been told}} by a sheriff's deputy that the game and a Sony PlayStation 2 were found at the ranch.

[...] The defensive line would need to slow down the Seahawks running attack to keep the Steelers in the game, a challenge which Mitchell took personally. [...] The players came through holding Alexander under the 100-yard plateau and most importantly preventing him from scoring, which was crucial to a Steelers win. [...] After the game, <b>Mitchell</b> <b>said</b> of the strategy, [...] "Our thing was 'keep him out of the end zone.' We [...] didn't care if he got 300 yards; don't let him in the end zone." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{presence}} of Terrell Owens in 2004 led to limited opportunities for Mitchell to catch passes {{and he showed}} his frustration {{on and off the}} field.

After the game, <b>Mitchell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I just want to thank my hands for being so great." [...] In the week prior to Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots, he created controversy by offending members of the Patriots' secondary, including Rodney Harrison.

[...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never really had a father figure. There's a lot of looking to belong and looking for love because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family. Romeo has some issues of his own. He is struggling with his relationship with Indi. The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding."
