40|$|Interactions between ortho and para substituents of anilines such as chloroaniline, methylaniline and <b>methoxyaniline</b> with 1 -octanol {{have been}} studied in carbon tetrachloride. The most likely {{association}} of complex between 1 -octanol and substituents of anilines is 1 : 1 stoichiometric complex, through hydroxyl group of 1 -octanol and amine group of ortho and para substituents of anilines. Interactions are studied on the bases of formation constant and free energy changes. Formation constant of the complex has been calculated using Nash method. The result shows that molecular interaction of 1 -octanol as proton donor with methyl and chloride substitution of anilines in ortho position is smaller than the para position substitution of anilines. The results shows, the ability of acceptors is in the order p-methoxyaniline < o-chloroaniline<o-methylaniline<o-methoxyaniline <p-chloroaniline <p-methylaniline...|$|E

40|$|Two {{integrated}} systems for light-induced vectorial electron transfer are described. Both utilize photosensitized semiconductor particles grown in linear channel zeolites as {{components of the}} electron transfer chain. One system consists of internally platinized zeolites L and mordenite containing TiO 2 particles and methylviologen ions, with a size-excluded photosensitizer, tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridyl- 4, 4 ′-dicarboxylate) ruthenium (RuL 32 +), adsorbed on the external surface of the zeolite/TiO 2 composite. In the other system, Nb 2 O 5 replaces TiO 2. The kinetics of photochemical electron transfer reactions and charge separation were studied by diffuse reflectance flash photolysis. Despite very efficient initial charge separation, the TiO 2 system does not generate hydrogen photochemically {{in the presence of}} an electrochemically reversible, anionic electron donor, <b>methoxyaniline</b> N,N′-bis(ethyl sulfonate). Only the Nb 2 O 5 -containing composites evolved hydrogen photochemically under these conditions. These results are interpreted in terms of semiconductor band energetics and the irreversibility of electron transfer from Nb 2 O 5 to intrazeolitic platinum particles...|$|E
40|$|Soluble glucose {{dehydrogenase}} is a homodimeric enzyme {{found in}} various bacteria such as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, requiring Ca 2 + and pyrroloquinolinequinone (PQQ) cofactors for full enzymatic activity. sGDH catalyses the oxidation of glucose and other aldose sugars. The mechanistic details {{have yet to}} be disclosed. Towards that goal, a specific series of 3 isomeric analogs (2 - 4) of PQQ are being synthesized from <b>methoxyaniline</b> derivatives in the laboratory. The synthesis includes the reaction of a diazonium salt with ethyl- 2 -methyacetoacetate to yield the corresponding hydrazones of ethyl pyruvate. Each hydrazone underwent acid catalyzed Fischer indole synthesis followed by reduction of the nitro group using H 2 /Pd/C in to the corresponding aminoindole. Michael addition with dimethyl trans 2 -ketoglutaconate was performed to form the third pyridine ring, which was further oxidized into triesters. Hydrolysis of the oxidation product yields the 3 isomeric analogs of PQQ. These isomers differ in the positioning of the nitrogen atom on the ring system and will serve to define structural significance in terms of binding with a metal cation and reconstitution process with the apoprotein. Detailed analysis of the stability of each reconstituted enzyme as well as steady-state kinetics studies will shed light on the structural characteristics mandatory for enzymatic activity and active site characterization...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{reflectivity}} {{measurements were}} used to investigate the thermal stability of layer by layer LBL films of poly o <b>methoxyaniline</b> POMA, which was probed by increasing the temperature up to 80 degrees C of a D 2 O solution {{in contact with the}} LBL films. The study was made possible by adsorbing POMA layers on a PEI PSS PAH 5 PSS LBL film template, leading to less rough POMA layers in comparison with the POMA poly vinylsulfonic acid sodium salt PVS LBL films adsorbed directly on glass and silicon substrates. While the latter yielded almost fringeless neutron reflectivity curves due to the large roughness, the fitting of the data for POMA films adsorbed onto the template film and UV vis measurements indicated that the topmost layer is affected for films heated in solution up to 80 degrees C. This is essentially the same thermal stability of LBL films from the template films made with conventional polyelectrolytes. A decrease in thickness of approximately 10 A was inferred when the solution temperature increased from 25 degrees C to 80 degrees C, which was maintained when the sample was cooled back to 25 degrees C. This decrease, observed for solutions of pH 3 and pH 8, is consistent with thermally stimulated desorption and was corroborated by UV VIS absorption experiments. The unexpected stability of the POMA layer at pH 8 is attributed to the layer by layer structure of the films that allows POMA to remain doped, in its salt emeraldine form, even at high p...|$|E
