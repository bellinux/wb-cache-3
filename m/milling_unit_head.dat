40|$|Background: Different CAD/CAM machinesâ {{generation}} may {{impact the}} restoration overall quality. The present study evaluated the marginal fit of CAD/CAM restorations manufactured with different generations of CEREC <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> systems. Material and Methods: Sixteen typodont teeth {{were divided into}} two groups (n= 8) according to the machineâ s generation assigned. These are control group (G 1) : Cerec AC with Bluecam/Cerec 3 <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> and (G 2) : Cerec AC with Bluecam/MC XL Premium Package <b>milling</b> <b>unit.</b> Scanning of the preparation were performed and crowns were milled using the Vita Mark II blocks. Blocks were cemented using epoxy glue on the pulpal floor only and finger pressure applied for 1 min. Upon completion of the cementation step, misfits between the restoration and abutment were measured by microphotography and the silicone replica technique using light body silicon material on Mesial (M) and Distal (D) surfaces. Results: Mean and SDs of marginal gaps in micrometers were: G 1 /M: 94. 90 (Â± 38. 52), G 1 /D: 88. 53 (Â± 44. 87), G 2 /M: 85. 65 (Â± 29. 89), G 2 /D: 95. 28 (Â± 28. 13). Two-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences among different groups (P> 0. 05); surface area (P> 0. 05) and the interaction (P> 0. 05). Overall, G 2 had greater margin gaps than G 1, however, without statistical difference (P> 0. 05). Conclusions: Difference in <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> generation did not significantly affect the marginal fit. Marginal gap means were in the range of the clinical acceptance levels for both generations of Cerec <b>milling</b> <b>units,</b> regardless the teeth site area...|$|R

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Milling is {{a central}} and {{important}} aspect of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. High milling accuracy reduces {{the time needed to}} adapt the workpiece and provides restorations with better longevity and esthetic appeal. The influence of different milling processes on the accuracy of milled restorations has not yet been reviewed. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of different milling processes on the accuracy of ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four groups of partial crowns were milled (each n= 17) : Three groups in a 4 -axial milling unit: (1) 1 -step mode and Step Bur 12 S (12 S), (2) 1 -step mode and Step Bur 12 (1 Step), (3) 2 -step mode and Step Bur 12 (2 Step), and (4) one group in a 5 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> (5 axis). The milled occlusal and inner surfaces were scanned and superimposed over the digital data sets of calculated restorations with specialized difference analysis software. The trueness of each restoration and each group was measured. One-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test was used to compare the data (α=. 05). RESULTS The highest trueness for the inner surface was achieved in group 5 axis (trueness, 41 ± 15 μm, P<. 05). The 4 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited trueness at settings ranging from 61 μm (2 Step) to 96 μm (12 S). For the occlusal surface, the highest trueness was achieved with group 5 axis (trueness, 42 ± 10 μm). The 4 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited trueness at settings ranging from 55 μm (1 Step) to 76 μm (12 S). CONCLUSIONS Restorations milled with a 5 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> have a higher trueness than those milled with a 4 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit.</b> A rotary cutting instrument with a smaller diameter results in a more accurate milling process. The 2 -step mode is not significantly better than the 1 -step mode...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the behaviour of prepared cane and bagasse, and the ability to model the mechanical behaviour of bagasse as it is squeezed in a <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> to extract juice, would help identify how to improve the current process. For example, there are opportunities to decrease bagasse moisture from a <b>milling</b> <b>unit.</b> Also, the behaviour of bagasse in chutes is poorly understood. Previous investigations have shown that juice flow through bagasse obeys Darcy’s permeability law, that the grip of the rough surface of the grooves on the bagasse can be represented by the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for soils, and that the internal mechanical behaviour of the bagasse is critical state behaviour similar to that for sand and clay. Progress has been made {{in the last ten years}} towards implementing a mechanical model for bagasse in finite element software. The objective has been to be able to simulate simple mechanical loading conditions measured in the laboratory, which, when combined together, have a high probability of reproducing the complicated stress conditions in a <b>milling</b> <b>unit.</b> This paper reports on the successful simulation of part of the fifth and final (and most challenging) loading condition, the shearing of heavily over-consolidated bagasse, and determining material property values through the use of powerful and free parameter estimation software...|$|R

A mass balance model is used to determine the fibre, brix and moisture mass flows between <b>milling</b> <b>units</b> so that a complete milling train, including the return stream from the juice screen, is modelled. Model solutions are presented to determine the effect of different levels of fibre in juice and efficiency of fibre separation in the juice screen on brix extraction.
