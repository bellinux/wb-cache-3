5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, García Márquez {{published}} the memoir Vivir para contarla, {{the first of}} a projected three-volume autobiography. Edith Grossman's English translation, Living to Tell the Tale, was published in November 2003. October 2004 brought the publication of a novel, Memories of My Melancholy Whores (Memoria de mis putas tristes), a love story that follows the romance of a 90-year-old <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pubescent concubine. Memories of My Melancholy Whores caused controversy in Iran, where it was banned after an initial 5,000 copies were printed and sold.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Bancroft was {{commissioned}} {{to design a}} large mural covering the exterior of a sports centre housing two basketball courts at Tempe Reserve in Marrickville, New South Wales.

It also includes the goanna, the ancestral totem of the Marrickville area's original inhabitants, the Wangal people.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Irish High Court held in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners that {{marriage}} {{as defined in}} the Irish Constitution was between a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman {{and that there was}} no breach of rights in the refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to recognise foreign same-sex marriages.|$|E
5|$|Key has a mixed {{voting record}} on social issues: for example, in 2004 {{he voted against}} the bill {{creating}} civil unions, stating that, while he personally supports such unions, he acted in accordance with his electorate's views. However, in 2005, Key {{was part of a}} large bloc of MPs voting to defeat a bill that defined marriage as being between a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman. Key stated in 2008 that he did not oppose gay adoption. In 2013 he expressed support for same-sex marriage and voted for the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013.|$|E

5|$|Maryland holds {{a unique}} {{place in the}} history of {{same-sex}} marriage in the United States. In 1973, it became the first state in the nation to define marriage as a union between a <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman, expressly banning same-sex marriage. The General Assembly passed the law a short time after voters in the state ratified Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, commonly referred to as the Equal Rights Amendment, in November 1972. The constitutional provision prohibited discrimination in equality of rights on the basis of sex.|$|E
5|$|Merrick's {{life was}} {{depicted}} in a 1979 play by Bernard Pomerance called The Elephant <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> David Lynch film, also called The Elephant Man in 1980.

5|$|Of {{greatest}} {{interest is}} the fourth composition of historical figures, a young <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. The figures are painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on his head. In his right hand, the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He extends his hand to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing a fitting crown.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer {{submitted}} {{his resignation}} as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone {{with both a}} solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who {{liked the fact that}} as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
5|$|Seven men {{lost their}} lives in the {{wreckage}} of several Cuban schooners at Punta Gorda. Nearby, one <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> baby drowned {{as a result of the}} storm surge, and another died while attempting to cross a flooded river. A French steamship, the Louisiane, went ashore with 600passengers; all people aboard the vessel were rescued by the Forward, a Revenue cutter.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E

5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> directional arrow.

Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in five to seven days.|$|E

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} years of Matilda's life {{have been the}} subject of {{historical}} fiction. Matilda, Stephen and their supporters feature in Ellis Peters's historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem Maud.|$|E
