500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year of the Gentleman, was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year of the Gentleman {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. And, in <b>my</b> <b>personal</b> <b>opinion,</b> the essence of the gentleman is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats {{what it is to be}} a gentleman in this business still." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{attracted}} widespread praise {{by music}} critics, {{many of whom}} ranked it among West's best songs. [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes, and stated that it contained {{some of the best}} lyrics ever written by West. Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track, writing that it was an excellent song overall, though wrote that [...] "in <b>my</b> <b>personal</b> <b>opinion,</b> I don’t really think Kid Cudi can sing; and I’m not sure why his generally off-key caterwauling is appealing to people, but here it’s hypnotically on point – matching perfectly with the track’s imposing tone." [...] MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically, musing that [...] "while his lyrics are razor sharp, the production here is softer, resulting in a melodic finger wag to his naysayers rather than searing jabs." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression. On the other hand, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon fit perfectly on the guitar-driven track.|$|E

40|$|LOGO {{has been}} {{evolving}} in incremental steps for 40 years. This {{has resulted in}} steady progress but some regions of the space of all programming languages for children cannot be reached without passing through unacceptable intermediate designs. What are the ultimate aims of LOGO? What criteria and aesthetics {{should be used in}} determining which areas of the design space are most promising? What would the ideal programming language look like? Would a family of special-purpose languages be more effective than a single language? In looking to the future what can we learn from the history of LOGO? What can we learn from other programming systems for children? Alan Kay is leading a new project entitled, "Steps toward the Reinvention of Programming". What are its strengths and weaknesses? We can conceptualise the design alternatives as defining an n-dimensional space. Some dimensions represent major alternatives for syntax, others for dealing with concurrency, others for the underlying computational models, and others for features of the programming environment.

40|$|The {{literature}} in focus {{in this essay}} is "Of Mice and Men" by John Steinbeck which was written during The Great Depression in America. The aspects of the novel concentrated on is firstly the historical aspect of it and secondly {{the message of the}} story and how it is significant to the modern student. My literary analysis suggests that since the issues raised in the story (gender, age and race discrimination, psychological instability and an overall generalization of human beings) are issues which still exist today, the characters and the issues raised alleviates the students’ ability to relate and connect to the story.

Based on my more than three decades of database systems work in the research and product arenas, I will outline what are many of the pitfalls to avoid since there is currently a mad rush to develop and adopt a plethora of NoSQL systems in a segment of the IT population, including the research community.

Hopefully, the lessons learnt over three decades with relational and other systems would not go to waste and we wouldn’t let history repeat itself with respect to simple minded approaches leading to enormous pain later on for developers as well as users of the NoSQL systems!
