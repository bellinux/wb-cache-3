6000|$|A foreign-looking waiter greeted us, and {{led us to}} one of {{a number}} of very small tables covered with linen which {{impressed}} even Frank's uncritical eyes with its <b>mussiness.</b> With a feeling of having inadvertently entered a den of thieves, I wished myself out of it but lacked the courage to rise and when the man returned and placed upon the table two glasses and a strange looking bottle with a metal stopper which had a kind of lever at the side, Frank said, [...] "Hi! Good thing!--I'm thirsty." [...] Quite against my judgment he fooled around with the lever till he succeeded in helping himself to some of the liquid with which the bottle was filled. It was soda water and he drank heartily, although I was sure it would be extra on the bill.|$|E
