40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} {{is aimed at}} improving the quality and reliability of measures of primary and secondary protection of metal structures at manufacturing companies, to prolong the service life of cyclically loaded structures of production facilities {{taking into account the}} corrosion level of danger. Methodology. Authors proposed to use the principles of process approach for statement and realization of management problems of operational service life in corrosion environments. The principles of ensuring reliability on the level of corrosion danger include justification of stages sequence for survivability assessment of a structural metalwork based on the strategy of DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) : definitions, measurements, analysis, improvement and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> of primary and secondary corrosion protection. Findings. Providing control measures from corrosion according to the criterion of corrosion danger allows providing requirements of reliability of structural metalwork based on calculated provisions of the limiting conditions method and solving the problems of management in technological safety during the expected service life of structural objects. Originality. The developed strategy of maintenance of the industrial facilities on an actual state includes the process approach to resource management by creation of system for the account and the functional controlling, risk analysis and regulation of technological safety in production facilities of the enterprises. Realization of the principles of process approach to management of technological safety at the object level is directed to perfecting of tools and methods of anticorrosive protection, extension of a resource taking into account indexes of survivability (,) and justification of program measures to ensure the reliability of enterprises(PER). Practical value. On the basis of process approach to quality and reliability management, generalizations of the natural and numerical researches directed to justification of design solutions of primary and secondary protection of a metalwork at the given level of corrosion danger of a metalwork the organizational measures of PER including assessment of integral characteristics of constructional suitability, technological rationality and risk analysis of signs corrosion danger of objects are developed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of large {{subtropical}} and tropical cities with defined climate plans has increased {{as a result of}} the initiatives of local governments, multi-bilateral development aid and development banks. Surveys carried out to date on climate planning consider the overall cities, at times by continent, without underscoring those that present planning deficiencies. For instance, we have no idea whether the cities that are most affected by hydro-meteorological and climatic disasters have plans, nor if their climate plans are ready to be implemented. Clarifying these aspects would strengthen the foundation of the current discussion on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2016 - 2030. Hence, the objective of this chapter is to ascertain the relevance and quality of climate planning in large subtropical and tropical cities populated by over 1 million inhabitants. Our survey found 344 large cities in the two climate zones concerned, and 82 of these have mitigation, adaptation, resilience or emergency plans, strategies or policies. We verified the relevance of these tools for the climate zones concerned, the type of economy and the frequency of hydro-meteorological and climate-related disasters. The quality of plans was assessed, ensuring that they had taken climate characterisation into account, that every measure was managed by a designated agency or office, and that funds were secured for implementing measures, as well as a monitoring and reporting sytem was defined. The analysis of collected information underscores considerable differences between large cities in terms of per capita greenhouse gas emissions (which were double in the subtropics relative to the tropics) and exposure to hazards (which were greater in the subtropical zone). Emergency and mitigation plans were the most common, while adaptation plans and resilience strategies were more unusual. The relevance of plans is still weak, given that barely 1 / 4 of the large cities had a plan. Plans were unquestionably more common in the subtropics, especially in OECD countries and in the BRICS, while they were absent in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), despite the presence of large cities that have been repeatedly affected by hydro-meteorological and climate-related disasters. Planning quality was good for 30 % of cities only. In the remaining 70 % of cities, climate characterisation was briefly defined; the planning process was fully funded by multi-bilateral development aid; measures were without a clear manager; cost, funds and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> were not specified. Thus the indication being that local plans were still scarcely action-oriented. Hence, the fact that two sustainable development goals (# 11 and 13) address human settlements and climate change, respectively, especially through assistance to LCDs, seems justified...|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} current state of {{taxation}} system in the period of its reform and to further designs in the field of fundamental bases of taxation. The purpose of writing this article is an in–depth study of the nature, the essence of risks in the sphere of taxation, consideration of the content of the system of the risk management and substantiation of conceptual bases of the efficiency of the taxation risk management by introducing a systematic approach under conditions of a large share of the shadow economy. The study was conducted with the use of the methods of deduction and induction, system approach, analysis and synthesis on the basis of the legislative framework of Ukraine, data by the state fiscal service of Ukraine, data by the state statistics service of Ukraine, papers by domestic and foreign economists, materials of the authors’ research. The nature and position of taxation risks in the system of their management were studied. It is proven that the taxation, as well as economic, risks are usually too overestimated, because as far as the cost is concerned, the measures to improve the performance results of human capital are very vague and formed under imperfect information conditions. The need for a systematic approach to managing taxation risks was identified. The main elements of the management system of taxation risks were considered. The influence of human capital and information on the efficiency of taxation risks management was proven. Special attention is paid to the feasibility study of taxation risks in the system of their management and to minimization of countermeasures. It is proven that such a system can be described as a set of certain methods, procedures and measures that makes it possible to forecast the deficit of tax payments and to take measures in regard to minimizing abuses in the taxation field. The main elements of the taxation risks management system were considered. This system is a set of interconnected and interrelated elements such as: 1) the essence and the original sources of risk; 2) analysis, evaluation and description of the risk; 3) methods of minimizing risks; 4) <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> of prevention and counteraction of risk. It is proven that the method of systematization of the taxpayers is applied according to the standards for determining the taxation risks in the system of their management. This approach will allow implementing into practice a new strategy of organization of the control and revision work with significant reduction in the cost of implementation of planned inspections. It is stressed that the taxation risks should be considered as a scientific basis for the design of the criterion of the efficiency of creating systems of national taxation security. Like any risk, taxation risks must not be identified only, but kept to a minimum. To do this, it is advisable to apply a taxation risks management system as a set of certain methods, procedures and activities. The use of human capital and information software will provide for reaching the necessary level of efficiency. The application of a systematic approach in the theory and practice of taxation will help to anticipate the negative consequences of the impact of the external environment; will contribute to the efficient monitoring of the risks and their practical management. The fiscal service may increase the amount of tax revenue to the budget by reducing tax abuses (tax evasion). This, in turn, will promote the exit of the economy out of the shadow. Scientific novelty of the research is in the deepening and determining the nature and the essence of taxation risks, as well as the substantiation of conceptual bases of the efficiency of their management through the implementation of a systematic approach. Adopting a systemic approach will allow fiscal services to efficiently manage taxation risks. A promising area of research is to review regulating documentation of the state fiscal service on the basis of a systematic approach and consideration of taxation risk as a measurement of results of human capital performance and imperfect information provision...|$|E

40|$|A new {{meteorological}} research station {{has been established}} and {{set up in the}} Solar Energy Laboratory which measures solar radiation (total and diffuse) on a horizontal surface, ambient air temperature, wind speed and wind direction. An inexpensive data logger based on an APPLE II microcomputer was designed and built.

A microdata (M 1600 L) microprocessor based automatic data logger was used later for the continuous <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> parameters. Four years <b>of</b> <b>monitored</b> data were used for analysis. Two mathematical models have been developed for the estimation of both total and diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal surface from different meteorological parameters.
