Not unacceptable but hard to mould are bi-concave lenses, steep meniscus lenses, and lenses with severe features (e.g. a bump on a convex surface).In general, plano-curved lenses are easier to mould than lenses with both sides curved since matching of flat faces is easier.Moulding concave forms with small centre thickness is difficult due to sticking of the <b>moulded</b> <b>part</b> to the mould occurring {{as a result of}} the different thermal expansion coefficients.Furthermore it is recommended to avoid undercuts and sharp edges.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel CAD feature recognition approach for thin-walled injection <b>moulded</b> and cast <b>parts</b> in which <b>moulding</b> features are recognised from a mid-surface abstraction {{of the part}} geometry. The motivation for the research has been to develop techniques to help designers of <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> to incorporate manufacturing considerations into their designs early in the design process. The main contribution of the research has been {{the development of an}} attributed mid- surface adjacency graph to represent the mid-surface topology and geometry, and a feature recognition methodology for moulding features. The conclusion of the research is that the mid-surface representation provides a better basis for feature recognition for <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> than a B-REP solid model. A demonstrator that is able to identify ribs, buttresses, bosses, holes and wall junctions has been developed using C++, with data exchange to the CAD system implemented using ISO 10303 STEP. The demonstrator uses a commercial algorithm (I-DEAS) to create the mid-surface representation, but the feature recognition approach is generic and could be applied to any mid-surface abstraction. The software has been tested on a range of simple <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> and found to give good results...|$|R

40|$|Telecommunication, {{information}} and medical industries {{have a high}} growth potential. A key technology for those industries is the replication of micro-structures. Precise micro-structured parts with functional surfaces can be produced economically by injection moulding. The whole process chain (thermal mould condition, moulding, demoulding, measurement and analysis) must be analysed carefully to ensure the highest precision and reliability. To enable the precise production of the above mentioned structures fundamental studies were conducted at the IKV. The studies considered {{on the one side}} several polymers (PMMA, PC, POM) {{and on the other side}} various test structures. In addition an external inductive heating unit was analyzed and implemented into the process to heat the cavity surface efficiently. Using this technique new mould concepts could be developed with a dynamic inductive heating system to increase the moulding accuracy and reduce the formation of orientations in the <b>moulded</b> <b>part</b> drastically. The final step of the process chain comprises the measurement and analysis of the micro-structured moulded parts.
