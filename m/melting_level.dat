40|$|The author {{describes}} a one-dimensional cloud model designed {{to investigate the}} relationships between stratiform downdrafts, congestus outflow, stability, and relative humidity in the tropical lower troposphere. In the tropics, the climatological lapse rate varies with height below the <b>melting</b> <b>level</b> {{in a way that}} is inconsistent with the assumptions of either moist pseudoadiabatic or reversible adiabatic ascent. This anomalous varia-tion is referred to as the melting-level stability anomaly (MLSA). It is argued that the MLSA is caused by a transition from static to dynamic downdrafts at the <b>melting</b> <b>level.</b> Above the <b>melting</b> <b>level,</b> evaporation of precipitation cools and moistens the tropical atmosphere but does not generate downdraft parcels with suf-ficient negative buoyancy to descend between model levels. Below the <b>melting</b> <b>level,</b> the evaporative cooling associated with stratiform precipitation is strong enough to overcome the stability of the atmosphere and generate a convective-scale circulation. The vertical descent within these downdrafts induces a compensatory ascent in the background atmosphere that changes the overall cooling-to-moistening downdraft ratio. The inclusion of this stratiform downdraft circulation brings the modeled lapse rate and relative humidity profiles into simultaneous agreement with observations. The transition from static to dynamic downdrafts is triggered, in the model, by imposed increases in the amount of rain falling outside clouds, in the out-of-cloud rain rate, and in the vertical coherence of the rain shafts. The destabilization of the lower tropical atmosphere triggered by the stratiform circulation affects the development of convective clouds. In particular, the melting-level stability anomaly increases detrainment near the <b>melting</b> <b>level</b> and gives rise to the congestus mode. 1...|$|E
40|$|Because {{knowledge}} of the <b>melting</b> <b>level</b> is critical to river forecasters and other users, an objective algorithm to detect the brightband height from profiles of radar reflectivity and Doppler vertical velocity collected with a Doppler wind profiling radar is presented. The algorithm uses vertical profiles to detect the bottom portion of the bright band, where vertical gradients of radar reflectivity and Doppler vertical velocity are negatively correlated. A search is then performed to find the peak radar reflectivity above this feature, and the brightband height is assigned to the altitude of the peak. Reflectivity profiles from the off-vertical beams produced when the radar is in the Doppler beam swinging mode provide additional brightband measurements. A consensus test is applied to subhourly values to produce a quality-controlled, hourly averaged brightband height. A comparison of radar-deduced brightband heights with melting levels derived from temperature profiles measured with rawinsondes launched from the same radar site shows that the brightband height is, on average, 192 m lower than the <b>melting</b> <b>level.</b> A method for implementing the algorithm and making the results {{available to the public}} in near–real time via the Internet is described.

40|$|An algorithm, the {{spectral}} latent heating (SLH) algorithm, {{has been developed}} to estimate latent heating profiles for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation radar with a cloud-resolving model (CRM). Heating-profile lookup tables for the three rain types—convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a <b>melting</b> <b>level)</b> —were produced with numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems in the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment. For convective and shallow stratiform regions, the lookup table refers to the precipitation-top height (PTH). For the anvil region, on the other hand, the lookup table refers to the precipitation rate at the <b>melting</b> <b>level</b> instead of PTH. A consistency check of the SLH algorithm was also done with the CRM-simulated outputs. The first advantage of this algorithm is that differences of heating profiles between the shallow convective stage and the deep convective stage can be retrieved. This {{is a result of}} the utilization of observed information, not only on precipitation type and intensity, but also on the precipitation depth.

Based on simulated and observed radar reflectivity, simulations roughly reproduce observed convective and stratiform precipitating areas. To identify the characteristics of convective and stratiform drafts {{that are difficult to}} observe but relevant to climate model parameterization, independent vertical wind speed thresholds are calculated to capture 90 % of total convective and stratiform updraft and downdraft mass fluxes. Convective updrafts are fairly consistent across simulations (likely owing to fixed large-scale forcings and surface conditions), except that hydrometeor loadings differ substantially. Convective downdraft and stratiform updraft and downdraft mass fluxes vary notably below the <b>melting</b> <b>level,</b> but share similar vertically uniform draft velocities despite differing hydrometeor loadings. All identified convective and stratiform downdrafts contain precipitation below ~ 10 km and nearly all updrafts are cloudy above the <b>melting</b> <b>level.</b> Cold pool properties diverge substantially {{in a manner that is}} consistent with convective downdraft mass flux differences below the <b>melting</b> <b>level.</b> Despite differences in hydrometeor loadings and cold pool properties, convective updraft and downdraft mass fluxes are linearly correlated with convective area, the ratio of ice in downdrafts to that in updrafts is ~ 0. 5 independent of species, and the ratio of downdraft to updraft mass flux is ~ 0. 5 - 0. 6, which may represent a minimum evaporation efficiency under moist conditions. Hydrometeor loading in stratiform regions is found to be a fraction of hydrometeor loading in convective regions that ranges from ~ 10 % (graupel) to ~ 90 % (cloud ice).

The results are interpreted to illustrate how this method for estimating hydrometeor types can be applied to monitor cloud evolution and evaluate the potentials and effects of glaciogenic cloud seeding.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{is to use the}} {{information}} about distributions of precipitation to determine the four dimensional (i. e., temporal and spatial) patterns of latent heating over the whole tropical region. The Spectral Latent Heating (SLH) algorithm has been developed to estimate latent heating profiles for the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) with a cloud- resolving model (CRM). The method uses CRM- generated heating profile look-up tables for the three rain types; convective, shallow stratiform, and anvil rain (deep stratiform with a <b>melting</b> <b>level).</b> For convective and shallow stratiform regions, the look-up table refers to the precipitation top height (PTH). For anvil region, on the other hand, the look- up table refers to the precipitation rate at the <b>melting</b> <b>level</b> instead of PTH. For global applications, it is necessary to examine the universality of the look-up table. In this paper, we compare the look-up tables produced from the numerical simulations of cloud ensembles forced with the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Response Experiment (COARE) data and the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) data. There are some notable differences between the TOGA-COARE table and the GATE table, especially for the convective heating. First, there is larger number of deepest convective profiles in the TOGA-COARE table than in the GATE table, mainly due to the differences in SST. Second, shallow convective heating is stronger in the TOGA COARE table than in the GATE table. This might be attributable to the difference in the strength of the low-level inversions. Third, altitudes of convective heating maxima are larger in the TOGA COARE table than in the GATE table. Levels of convective heating maxima are located just below the <b>melting</b> <b>level,</b> because warm-rain processes are prevalent in tropical oceanic convective systems. Differences in levels of convective heating maxima probably reflect differences in melting layer heights. We are now extending our study to simulations of other field experiments (e. g.

Varying the VGR indicated that a refined VGR, while adopting the widely used North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for initial and lateral boundary conditions, does not necessarily result in a consistent improvement in quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs). When averaged over a variety of microphysical schemes in an illustrative case, equitable threat score (ETS) and bias values actually worsened with a greater overpredicted rainfall for half of the rainfall thresholds when the VGR was refined.

In the HRG process, a thin silicon ribbon is crystallized and extracted continuously from the melt, using the fact that silicon oats on its melt just like ice oats on top of water. In our work, we assess two technical issues reported in previous experimental studies: meniscus stability and interface stability. The {{first law of thermodynamics}} along with the tools of variational calculus are used to find the existence and stability conditions of the meniscus formed between the silicon wafer and the surface of the crucible. Analytical expressions describing the shapes of the meniscii are found in terms of a single-valued function and in parametric form. These functions give the feasible configurations of the HRG system in terms of operating parameters and material properties, such as ribbon length and thickness, <b>melt</b> <b>level,</b> pulling angle, contact angle, and crucible edge geometry. From the existence conditions we show that the feasible configurations place a part or the entire meniscus above the <b>melt</b> <b>level.</b> The stability condition shows that every part of the meniscus must remain above the surface of the crucible.

The setting of the thermal conditions, which assure that for the obtained static meniscus the solidification conditions are satisfied at the “right” places, is not considered here...|$|R
