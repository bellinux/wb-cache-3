These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to <b>mental</b> <b>hygiene</b> of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E

40|$|Residential {{exposure}} to vapor from current or previous cultural use of mercury could harm {{children living in}} rental (apartment) homes. That concern prompted the following agencies to conduct a study to assess pediatric mercury exposure in New York City communities by measuring urine mercury levels: New York City Department of Health and <b>Mental</b> <b>Hygiene’s</b> (NYCDOHMH) Bureau of Environmental Surveillance and Policy, New York State Department of Health/Center for Environmental Health (NYSDOHCEH), Wadsworth Center’s Biomonitoring Program/Trace Elements Laboratory (WC-TEL), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A previous study indicated that people could obtain mercury for ritualistic use from botanicas located in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. Working closely with local community partners, we concentrated our recruiting efforts through health clinics located in potentially affected neighborhoods. We developed posters to advertise the study, conducted active outreach through local partners, and, as compensation {{for participation in the}} study, we offered a food gift certificate redeemable at a local grocer. We collected 460 urine specimens and analyzed them for total mercury. Overall, geometric mean urine total mercury was 0. 31  μg mercury/l urine. One sample was 24  μg mercury/l urine, which exceeded the (20  μg mercury/l urine) NYSDOH Heavy Metal Registry reporting threshold for urine mercury exposure. Geometric mean urine mercury levels were uniformly low and did not differ by neighborhood or with any clinical significance by children’s ethnicity. Few parents reported the presence of mercury at home, in a charm, or other item (e. g., skin-lightening creams and soaps), and we found no association between these potential sources of exposure and a child’s urinary mercury levels. All pediatric mercury levels measured in this study were well below a level considered to be of medical concern. This study found neither self-reported nor measured evidence of significant mercury use or exposure among participating children. Because some participants were aware of the possibility that they could acquire and use mercury for cultural or ritualistic purposes, community education about the health hazards of mercury should continue...|$|R

Preterm and teenage births were also more common in Brownsville than in other places citywide. In Brownsville, there were 13.8 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 9.0 per 1,000 citywide), and 38.5 teenage births per 1,000 live births (compared to 23.6 per 1,000 citywide), giving the area the second-highest teenage birth rate of any neighborhood in the city. In 2015, Brownsville had the lowest average life span (74.1 years) of any New York City neighborhood.

This is to be seen both in the actions of the characters and in the descriptions of imaginary places impregnated with contradictory connotations, not only in connection with <b>mental</b> and physical <b>hygiene,</b> but also with sexuality. In particular, texts in the Nouvelle Hèloïse concerning «natural » gardens represent physical and moral health in sentimental and sexual relations with others.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{behavioral}} risk factors in the 21 st century accurate and valid information is required on these factors and also about protective factors during these so called stormy years.. Attention to life-long behavioral risk factors and protective factors provides an alternative paradigm. Indeed, efforts to improve adolescent and pre-adolescent health typically features interventions designed to address specific health risk behaviors, such as physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol and drug use, violence, unintentional injuries and early sexual activities. As we know, the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) {{was developed by the}} World Health Organization and conducted among adolescents, aged 13 – 17 years, at a country level to obtain accurate information on behavioral risk factors and protective factors, with 335 items in 10 core questionnaire modules addressing the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children and adults worldwide, including alcohol and tobacco use, dietary behaviors, drug use, <b>hygiene,</b> <b>mental</b> health, physical activity, violence and unintentional injuries, sexual behaviors that contribute to HIV infection and other sexually-transmitted infections, unintended pregnancy and protective factors. We found that internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) in 2 modules of dietary behaviors (0. 25) and physical activity (0. 22) had the lowest reliability in comparison with other items. This finding suggests that although the tool that uses GSHS is accurate, it is necessary {{to pay more attention to}} issues in adolescent health-related contexts and it seems essential to pay more attention to and exercise caution in interpretation of data regarding items about dietary behavior and physical activity in using this questionnaire despite transcultural adaptation and validation of the GSHS questionnaire in Persian. This school-based self-report survey provided critical information for implementation across culturally diverse adolescents; therefore, culturally sensitive and locally valid questionnaires are essential to local health behavior risk factors and concerns in the global context.
