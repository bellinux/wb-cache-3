40|$|In this study, gaseous {{emissions}} and particles are measured during start-up and stop periods for an over-fed boiler and an under-fed boiler. Both gaseous and particulate matter <b>emissions</b> are continuously <b>measured</b> in the laboratory. The measurement of {{gaseous emissions}} includes oxygen (O 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide and (NO). The emissions rates are calculated from <b>measured</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>concentrations</b> and flue gas flow. The behaviours of the boilers during start-up and stop periods are analysed and the emissions are characterised {{in terms of}} CO, NO, TOC and particles (PM 2. 5 mass and number). The duration of the characterised periods vary between two boilers due to the difference in type of ignition and combustion control. The under-fed boiler B produces higher emissions during start-up periods than the over-fed boiler A. More hydrocarbon and particles are emitted by the under-fed boiler during stop periods. Accumulated mass of CO and TOC during start-up and stop periods contribute {{a major portion of}} the total mass emitted during whole operation. However, accumulated mass of NO and PM during start-up and stop periods are not significant as the duration of emission peak is relatively short...|$|R

Thus, {{the objective of this}} work was to develop accurate dust emission factors for modern cotton harvesting operations in terms of PM 10, PM 2. 5 and TSP. Particulate matter sampling of cotton harvesting operations was conducted on three farms in Texas during 2006 and 2007. Two protocols were used to develop emission factors in terms of TSP, PM 10, and PM 2. 5 from the operations. The first protocol used the regulatory dispersion models ISCST 3 and AERMOD to back calculate emission flux values for a two-row John Deere model 9910 cotton picker and six-row John Deere model 9996 cotton picker from measured downwind concentrations and meteorological data collected onsite. The second protocol employed a novel source sampling system onboard the six-row cotton picker to <b>measure</b> <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> emitted from the basket as the machine operated in the field. The results from the first protocol indicated that the two-row harvester emission factors were higher than the six row machine and the mean difference in the PM 10 emission factors developed in ISCST 3 and AERMOD were 1. 08 and 3. 61 kg/ha, respectively (0. 96 and 3. 22 lb/ac, respectively). These differences were found to be insignificant for ISCST 3 but significant for AERMOD. The emission factors developed under the source sampling protocol exhibited much higher precision and lower uncertainty than those developed under the first protocol.

40|$|Biodiesel {{has been}} a {{promising}} clean alternative fuel to fossil fuels, which reduces the emissions that are released by fossil fuels, and possibly reduces the energy crisis caused by the exhaustion of petroleum resources in the near future. Biodiesel is replacing diesel as an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. Previous research {{studies have shown that}} biodiesel can greatly reduce carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and particulate matter (PM) emissions compared to diesel fuels, but very few studies have shown a reduction in total nitrogen oxides (NOx). At present, B 20 (20 % biodiesel in the total fuel mix) is being used commonly in the US due to its material compatibility to changing weather conditions, emission benefits and costs. Currently, Canada is planning to use 5 % of biodiesel by 2015. The objective {{of this study is to}} test the feasibility of biodiesel in cold climates such as Canada. The biodiesel used is made of canola oil obtained from a local supermarket and winter diesel is used as a reference fuel. Three different series were used. The first series was biodiesel/diesel with six blends (B 0, B 5, B 10, B 20, B 50 and B 100). The second series was biodiesel/diesel plus 2 % of a chemical additive (B 0, B 5 A, B 10 A, B 20 A, B 50 A and B 100 A). The final was kerosene/biodiesel series (K 0, K 5, K 10, K 20, K 50 and K 100). Chemical additive (Wintron XC 30) is used to lower the cloud point of the blends and this is the first attempt to investigate its effect on engine emissions. On the other hand, there are limited studies on kerosene being treated as a blending fuel, where it is mainly used to lower the cloud point of the blends to investigate the feasibility of biodiesel in a cold climate such as the winter season in Canada and suggest an appropriate solution for the future of biofuel. Engine performance and <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> are investigated by determining the break specific fuel consumption (bsfc), fuel conversion efficiency and <b>measuring</b> <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> of CO, HC, NO, NO 2 and NOx using gas analysers. Engine tests are performed on a constant rated speed at three different load conditions. A comparison is made for the three series.

40|$|Recent {{air quality}} {{legislation}} has placed increased pressure on agricultural producers {{in several states}} across the US. In particular, California removed the exemption for agricultural sources from air quality permitting in 2003. Through the use of inaccurate particulate matter emission factors, agricultural operations have been targeted as significant sources of particulate matter emissions. The emission factors used by regulators in California were developed using techniques {{with high levels of}} uncertainty. The objective of this manuscript is to present a novel approach to <b>measuring</b> source <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> from cotton harvesting operations. The proposed sampler design would collect all of the harvested seed cotton, trash, and conveying air at the exit of the conveying ducts used to transport the harvested material to the basket. The air and entrained particulate matter would be separated from the seed cotton and large trash inside a dropper box where isokinetic concentration measurements would be taken at a point just before the air and entrained particulate matter is exhausted to the outside. Subsequent particle size distribution analyses of the particulate matter collected from the isokinetic samples would be used to determine the corresponding PM 10, PM 2. 5, and PM 10 - 2. 5 source <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Finally, particulate matter emission factors would be calculated (for each size fraction indicator i. e. PM 2. 5, PM 10, or PM 10 - 2. 5) on both a lbs/acre and lbs/bale harvested basis.

Thus, common uncertainties in input data would still provide good emission estimations. Measurements of dissolved N 2 O required low maintenance and N 2 O emission monitoring based on such measurements might therefore be considered as a significant practical improvement. This would be advantageous especially in non-enclosed wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) otherwise requiring complex off-gas measurements. As the sensor is connected directly to the WWTPs monitoring and control system, emissions calculations could be incorporated...|$|R

40|$|A {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} <b>measure</b> ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> from dairies using an isolation flux chamber. A hybrid dairy in Comanche county, Texas, was measured for one week each during August 2002 and January 2003. Sixty total ammonia samples {{were taken from the}} free stall barn, open lot, mixing tank, separated solids, compost, and two lagoons using the developed protocol. The ammonia concentration measurements were made using a chemiluminescence analyzer located inside a mobile laboratory. From the <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> recorded, it was estimated that 9. 68 metric tons of ammonia were produced from this dairy per year. An emission factor of 13. 34 ? 28. 80 kilograms per day per thousand head of cattle (kg/day/ 1000 head) was estimated for this dairy (? 95 % confidence intervals) during summer conditions. For winter conditions the emission factor was 12. 05 ? 12. 89 kg/day/ 1000 head. The 11 % difference of the emission factors from summer to winter conditions was predominantly from the change in ambient and control volume temperatures (a mean difference of approximately 25 degrees Celsius), differences in source temperatures, and seasonal variability in husbandry. The adsorption of ammonia onto different polymer tubing used in pollutant stream conveyance was researched for possible systematic losses. Teflon and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were tested for ammonia losses with treatments of: temperature, length, and inlet concentration. Inlet concentration and temperature were significant factors used to describe ammonia adsorption for Teflon, whereas LDPE was also affected by tubing length. These factors were used to create a model to correct the summer dairy measurements for ammonia losses, resulting in an emission factor increase of 8. 3 % over the original value obtained from the flux chamber. A nitrogen mass balance was performed to estimate the amount of nitrogen available for ammonia formation as excreted - 177. 5 kilograms per year per animal (wet basis). The amount of ammonia excreted per year was also estimated to be 26. 63 kilograms per year. The measured ammonia emitted from the dairy was five times less than the ammonia excreted and thirty-six times less than the total nitrogen excreted...|$|R

The engine soot emission index (mass soot per mass fuel burned) for this particular engine, derived from these measurements and a wavelength-specific mass absorption coefficient and the measured in-plume carbon dioxide concentrations, was 225 ± 35 mg kg− 1 at engine idle conditions.

This theory predicts bunching of <b>measured</b> <b>emissions</b> below the limits. We find this {{not to be}} consistent with the data. In fact, medians of <b>measured</b> <b>emissions</b> are often at around one half or less of the respective limit and are supported by wide distributions. Implications for optimum tax policies are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|To dispose/reuse {{antibiotic}} residues, Hydrothermal Pretreatment (HTPT) of Cephalosporin C Antibiotic Residue (CPCAR) {{coupled with}} air staging combustion of its produced solid biofuels was proposed and investigated based on pilot scale experiments. The {{results showed that}} the HTPT + combustion process could be energetically self-sufficient. HTPT reduced the N content but enhanced the S content in the produced solid biofuels, compared to the raw material. HTPT decreased the viscosity of the dried raw CPCAR and thus facilitated feeding material for combustion, and NOx <b>emission</b> <b>concentration</b> could be lower than 200 ppm. However, SOx <b>emission</b> <b>concentration</b> was unexpectedly high. Nevertheless, the technology of HTPT coupled with air staging combustion exhibited a good prospective for clean energy recovery from antibiotic residues. </p...|$|R

We show that if Galactic dark matter contributes a modest fraction of the <b>measured</b> <b>emission</b> in an energy range accessible to the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the energy dependence of the angular power spectrum of the total <b>measured</b> <b>emission</b> could be used to confidently identify gamma rays from Galactic dark matter substructure.

5000|$|One way of {{attributing}} greenhouse gas (GHG) <b>emissions</b> is to <b>measure</b> the embedded <b>emissions</b> of goods {{that are being}} consumed (also referred to as [...] "embodied emissions"). This {{is different from the}} question of to what extent the policies of one country to reduce emissions affect emissions in other countries (the [...] "spillover effect" [...] and [...] "carbon leakage" [...] of an emissions reduction policy). The UNFCCC <b>measures</b> <b>emissions</b> according to production, rather than consumption (UK Parliament, 2010). Consequently, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country. The question of whether to <b>measure</b> <b>emissions</b> on production instead of consumption is partly an issue of equity, i.e., who is responsible for emissions (Toth et al., 2001, p. 670).|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Tests were conducted on small laboratory scale ID- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones to demonstrate the reduction in <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> resulting when a pre-cyclone collector is used to collect large trash particles prior to cyclone fine dust collection. Cyclones were tested as fine dust collectors, simultaneous fine dust/trash collectors, and in series with a baffle-type pre-collector placed upstream of the cyclone. Cotton gin trash was utilized as the trash component while corn dust, sieved to less than 100 []m Aerodynamic Equivalent Diameter (AED), was utilized as the fine dust component. Results indicated that cyclones, if designed and operated properly as fine dust collectors, can be utilized as particulate abatement devices in situations where filtration technology is perceived as the only suitable solution. <b>Emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> below 23 mg/m 3 (0. 01 gr/dscf) were achieved using the ID- 3 D cyclones. It was shown that the ID- 3 D cyclone will have lower <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> as compared to the 2 D- 2 D cyclone at similar loading conditions. Tests showed that using ID- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones to simultaneously collect trash and fine dust will result in significantly higher <b>emission</b> <b>concentrations</b> as compared to emissions from cyclones collecting only fine dust. Significant reductions in emissions can be achieved if a baffle-type pre-collector is utilized to remove trash particles prior to cyclone fine dust removal. Utilizing the baffle-type pre-collector resulted in lower cyclone en-fission concentrations than when the cyclones were used to collect only fine dust. A pre-collector design guide was developed to aid in the design of precollector/cyclone systems. An equation was also developed to quickly and easily estimate the pressure drop across a pre-collector/cyclone system...|$|R
