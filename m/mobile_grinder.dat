40|$|To {{meet the}} 'Twenty in Ten Initiative' goals {{set in the}} 2007 State of the Union address, forest {{resources}} will be needed as feedstocks for lignocellulosic ethanol production. It {{has been estimated that}} 368 million dry tons can be produced annually in the U. S. from logging residues and fuel treatment thinnings. Currently, very little of this woody biomass is used for energy production due to the costs and difficulty in collecting and transporting this material. However, minimizing biomass costs (including harvest, handling, transport, storage, and processing costs) delivered to the refinery is necessary to develop a sustainable cellulosic ethanol industry. Achieving this goal requires a fresh look at conventional timber harvesting operations to identify ways of efficiently integrating energy wood collection and developing cost-effective technologies to harvest small-diameter trees. In conventional whole-tree logging operations, entire trees are felled and skidded from the stump to the landing. The residues (also called slash), consisting of tops and limbs, accumulate at the landing when trees are delimbed. This slash can be ground at the landing with a <b>mobile</b> <b>grinder</b> or transported to another central location with a stationary grinder. The ground material is transported via chip vans, or possibly large roll on/off containers, to the user facility. Cut-to-length harvesting systems are gaining popularity in some locations. In these operations, specialized harvesters that can fall, delimb, and cut logs to length are used. The small diameter tops and limbs accumulate along the machine's track. It can be left in the forest to dry or removed soon after harvest while logs are extracted. Removing slash during the same operation as the wood {{has been shown to be}} more efficient. However, leaving residue in the forest to dry reduces moisture content, which improves grinder performance, reduces dry matter loss during storage, and inhibits colonization of fungi that produce harmful spores. In recent years, new machines that are specially designed for collection of small diameter wood have been developed in the U. S. and Europe. Residue bundlers and balers improve transportation and handling efficiency by densifying the material and packaging it so that it can be handled with conventional equipment. An experimental integrated harvester/grinder can fall small diameter trees and feed them into a grinder. The ground material is collected in a bin that can be dumped into a chip van. The harvester head is also capable of delimbing and bucking (cut into sections) small timber to be used for pulp and posts. Limitations of these new technologies are their large capital costs and complexity, leading to high maintenance costs and the need for highly trained operators. To ensure that quality feedstock materials consistently enter the mouth of the refinery, the uniform format supply system concept proposes that feedstock diversity be managed at harvest, much like the current grain supply system. This allows for standardization of key infrastructure components and facilitation of a biomass commodity system. Challenges in achieving a uniform woody biomass supply include, but are not limited to, developing machines for efficient harvest of small-diameter trees in a range of topographies and conditions, developing machines and operating plans for grinding biomass as near to the stump as possible, developing cost-effective drying strategies to reduce losses and mold growth during wood chip storage, and quantifying environmental impacts of slash removal and fuel thinnings to aid landowner decisions and policy development...|$|E

50|$|In June 2014, it was {{announced}} that a Wild <b>Grinders</b> <b>mobile</b> game was being developed for iPhone, iPad and Android by Bubble Gum Interactive.

40|$|Issue: During {{community}} growth, adjacent forests become {{candidates for}} purchase and development; otherwise, they typically do not generate profit. To accommodate developments, developers remove trees, soil, {{and other materials}} from construction sites. In some regions, they use crawling bulldozers to knock down trees and pull up root balls for on-site burning. However, a sufficient quantity of wood upon a site makes it practicable to cut tree stems and ship logs to local markets. The roots and branches usually remain as landclearing waste. Traditionally, developers burned or buried this wood waste on-site. Wood waste could also be shipped off-site, either for disposal or, increasingly, for centralized wood processing. Furthermore, on-site processing is increasingly being used to recycle wood waste, often using a <b>mobile</b> tub <b>grinder.</b> Most professional development and landclearing contractors know the options available in their region for the wood waste they generate. Some may not, however, and {{it is wise to}} check with trade associations, recycling organizataions, and local solid waste utilities to get a list of wood recyclers that can provide wood waste services. Best Practice: Urbanization, which develops vegetated land for homes, commerce, or industry, generates landclearing debris. Developers could profit when they remove vegetation that includes trees...|$|R
40|$|Impurities in {{harvested}} stumps are {{a quality}} problem because {{high levels of}} mineral contaminants decrease the effective heating value of the stump wood, and can also affect ash melting behaviour during combustion, leading to sintering and drift problems. The aim of this case study was to clarify the productivity and screening efficiency of the Kompetech Crambo 6000 low-speed double-shaft grinder equipped with a Komptech star screen, in the integrated grinding and screening of Norway spruce and Scots pine stumps for fuel at a roadside landing, when using two different sieve sizes (250 x 320 mm and 180 x 180 mm screen baskets). Furthermore, we studied the fuel consumption of the Crambo 6000 grinder, ash content and particle size distribution of ground stump wood, and ash content and particle size distribution of the screening reject. In addition, the heating value of the produced hog fuel and screening reject were analysed. During {{the time of the}} studies, both the grinder and star screen were operating well and there were no delays due to machine breakdowns. The <b>mobile</b> Crambo 6000 <b>grinder</b> was also capable of operating well in constricted roadside landings. The quality of the produced hog fuel was high, due to low ash content (0. 4 – 2. 3 %), and this highlights the significance of screening to guarantee sufficient quality when processing stump fuel. The ash content of the screening reject was 32. 4 – 74. 7 %, and the effective heating value was 5. 2 – 13. 4 MJ/kg. The effective heating value of the produced hog fuel was 17. 9 – 19. 9 MJ/kg. The average grinding productivity, when using the 250 x 320 mm screen basket, was 162 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 44 litres per loose m 3. With a narrower screen, the average grinding productivity was 101 loose m 3 per effective hour, and the fuel consumption of the grinder was 0. 75 litres per loose m 3...|$|R
