25|$|The American upper <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> defined {{similarly}} using income, {{education and}} occupation as the predominant indicators. In the United States, the upper <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> defined as consisting mostly of white-collar professionals {{who not only}} have above-average personal incomes and advanced educational degrees but also {{a higher degree of}} autonomy in their work. The main occupational tasks of upper-middle-class individuals tend to center on conceptualizing, consulting, and instruction.|$|E

25|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{perhaps the}} most vaguely defined of the social classes.

25|$|A {{study by}} Brookings Institution in June 2006 {{revealed}} that Middle-income neighborhoods as {{a proportion of}} all metropolitan neighborhoods declined from 58 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in 2000.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the social {{mobility}} of the Japanese <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> <b>is</b> becoming closer to that of their Korean counterparts thanks to their increasing exposure to globaliza-tion. Globalization upsets the balance between transaction costs and opportunity costs of Japanese economic institutions such as Japanese management practices and the long-term relationship between the principal contractor and its subcontractors (the shitauke relationship). As a result, it makes social mobility of the new and old <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> which have <b>been</b> protected by such institutions, more fluid. Thus we make this argument {{based on the assumption}} that the Korean <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> have already <b>been</b> exposed to globalization and thus are more mobile than their Japanese counterparts. Then we test its empirical validity by analyzing absolute and relative mobility of the <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in the two societies with national representative data sets assembled in Japan in 1975, 1985 and 1995 and in Korea in 1990. The results of the analysis show: (1) that the Korean <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> <b>are</b> more fluid than their Japanese counterparts; and (2) that globalization has affected the social mobility of the old <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> much more than that of the new <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in Japan. The second finding implies that Japanese management customs that have protected a certain portion of the new <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>are</b> less affected by globalization than the institutions that have protected the old <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> In other words, the practices have a stronger inertia of institution.

25|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{percentages}} provided in the six-class model by Gilbert, {{as well as the}} model of Thompson and Hickey, one can apply U.S.Census Bureau statistics regarding income. According to these class models the lower <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> located roughly between the 52nd and 84th percentile of society. In terms of personal income distribution in 2005, that would mean gross annual personal incomes from about $32,500 to $60,000.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{environmental}} health, {{studies have}} found no or a positive effect. More important may be the Kuznets curve. Most environmental health indicators, such as water and air pollution show an inverted U-shape. Meaning {{in the beginning of}} economic development, little weight is given to environmental concerns, raising pollution along with industrialization. After a threshold, when basic physical needs are met and a <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> established, interest in a clean environment rises, reversing the trend.|$|E
25|$|In sociology, {{the upper}} <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> the social group {{constituted}} by higher status {{members of the}} middle class. This {{is in contrast to}} the term lower middle class, which is used for the group {{at the opposite end of}} the middle-class stratum, and to the broader term middle class. There is considerable debate as to how the upper middle class might be defined. According to sociologist Max Weber the upper middle class consists of well-educated professionals with postgraduate degrees and comfortable incomes.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{many social}} critics and intellectuals, {{most of whom}} are members of the {{professional}} middle class themselves, have commented on the extravagant consumption habits of the professional middle class. It is also often pointed out that the suburban lifestyle of the American professional <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> a major reason for its record consumption. The increasing materialism, even among such a highly educated class, is also often claimed to be connected to the notion of rugged individualism which gained popularity among the ranks of the professional middle class in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, {{it should come as no}} surprise that the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} social {{classes in the}} United States, there are no {{definite}} answers {{as to what is}} and what is not middle class. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> divided into two sections that combined constitute 47% to 49% of the population. The upper middle or professional class constitutes {{the upper end of the}} middle class which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end of the middle class – called either lower middle class or just middle class – consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} academic models split {{the middle class}} into two sections. Yet, it remains common for the term middle class to be applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio-economic strata. The <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> then often sub-divided into an upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle class. In colloquial descriptions of the class system the middle-middle class may be described as consisting {{of those in the}} middle of the social strata. Politicians and television personalities such as Lou Dobbs can be seen using the term middle class in this manner, especially when discussing the middle-class squeeze. The wide discrepancy between the academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated professionals together in the same class with secretaries may lead to the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{theories}} of political economy consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on society, {{because it has}} neither the possibly explosive revolutionary tendencies of the lower class, nor the absolutist tendencies of an entrenched upper class. Most sociological definitions of middle class follow Max Weber. Here the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> defined as consisting of professionals or business owners who share a culture of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, {{in the form of}} socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} {{of the middle class}} depends on which theory one utilizes.

If <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> used in a manner that includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the social strata, it might still be influential, as such definition may include the [...] "professional middle class", which is then commonly referred to as the [...] "upper middle class". Despite the fact that the professional (upper) <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> a privileged minority, it is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States.|$|E
