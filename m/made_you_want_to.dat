When the company started all dial tone lines were completely blocked meaning that only local telephone calls could be made and no collect, 900, or other toll calls could be <b>made.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> call long distance you {{would be required to}} buy a prepaid long distance card from a local store. Over time, Comm South Companies acquired a long distance plan which would allow you to make long distance calls from your home phone which was prepaid in advance. Each bill you received from Comm South was a bill for the next month of service and the due date was before that next month of service which is why the service was prepaid before you even used it to prevent people from running up high bills and not paying.|$|R

6000|$|I {{remember}} these women as immense. No doubt {{they were of}} negotiable size, but I was only a very little chap and they have assumed nightmare proportions in my mind. They loomed, they bulged, they impended. Mrs. Mackridge was large and dark; there was a marvel about her head, inasmuch as she was bald. She wore a dignified cap, {{and in front of}} that upon her brow, hair was PAINTED. I have never seen the like since. She had been maid to the widow of Sir Roderick Blenderhasset Impey, some sort of governor or such-like portent in the East Indies, and from her remains--in Mrs. Mackridge--I judge Lady Impey was a very stupendous and crushing creature indeed. Lady Impey had been of the Juno type, haughty, unapproachable, given to irony and a caustic wit. Mrs. Mackridge had no wit, but she had acquired the caustic voice and gestures along with the old satins and trimmings of the great lady. When she told you it was a fine morning, she seemed also to be telling you you were a fool and a low fool to boot; when she was spoken to, she had a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous, scornful [...] "Haw!" [...] that <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> burn her alive. She also had a way of saying [...] "Indade!" [...] with a droop of the eyelids.|$|E

Producing capacity has the potentiality of growing so much faster than its markets that there is the everpresent danger of overexpansion soon to result in the enormous wastes of excess capacity. In the past {{there was no real}} problem of coordinating supply and demand. The population was expanding rapidly and the markets growing even faster. Consumer tastes were not particularly discriminating, and by and large there was insufficient producing capacity {{to meet the needs of}} the market. <b>You</b> simply <b>made</b> what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make and consumers took i t. Over a period of years the supply never quite caught up to the demand; it was always slightly set back by periods of war and depression when equilibrium was in sight.

Robotics now has the critical mass of intellectual muscle it needs to progress rapidly, but it is lacking the philosophy and the tools to drive it forward as a unified field. Using Computer Science and its subfields as models for a successful academic disciplines, this paper provides suggestions for ways that we can improve our collective intellectual throughput. Rather than suggest directions for the entire field of Robotics, improvements in methodology and fields of study are suggested for individual researchers.
