5000|$|Zarana first {{appears in}} the G.I. Joe episode [...] "Arise Serpentor, Arise" [...] voiced by Lisa Raggio. She and Zandar join their brother Zartan when he is auditioning new members of the Dreadnoks. In the episode [...] "Computer Complications", Zarana goes {{undercover}} at a Joe base as [...] "Carol Weidler". During that time, she and Mainframe develop romantic feelings for each other. At {{the end of the}} episode, Zartan, sitting with the Dreadnoks at a campfire, jokes with her as she stands off from the group, gazing at the moon: [...] "Hey, Zarana, Iâ€™ve been thinking! <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> quit the Dreadnoks, go marry that wimp, get a house in the suburbs, have kids." [...] to which she responds by shooting {{in the direction of the}} Dreadnoks' campfire, causing them to scatter. The episode ends showing both Mainframe and Zarana, miles away from each other looking at the moon, perhaps pondering the same question. She was briefly reunited with Mainframe in [...] "Grey Hairs And Growing Pains", where she - without her brother's knowledge - supplied him with the antidote that would restore him (and the other Joes) to their proper ages.|$|E

40|$|What <b>ought</b> <b>you</b> believe? According <b>to</b> a {{traditional}} view, {{it depends on}} your evidence: <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> believe (only) what your evidence supports. Recently, however, some have claimed that what <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> believe depends not on your evidence but simply on what is true: <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> believe (only) the truth. In this paper, we present and defend two arguments against this latter view. We also explore some of the parallels between this debate in epistemology, and the debate in ethics about whether how <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> act depends on your epistemic position, or on all the facts...|$|R
40|$|This paper revisits {{a number}} of {{well-known}} paradoxes of deontic logic, namely Ross'paradox (if <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> mail a letter, <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> mail or burn it), the free choice paradox (if you are permitted to mail a letter, you are permitted to mail or burn it), the paradox of No Conflicting Obligations (ought implies permitted), the Good Samaritan Paradox (if <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> help Jones who is robbed, then Jones <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be robbed) and Chisholm's paradox (if <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do A, and if A <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> imply B, and not A implies that <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do not B, then this is inconsistent with doing not A). Framing these paradoxes in dynamic logic removes some of them and sheds light on others. This paper {{is based on an}} invited talk presented at DEON' 94...|$|R

40|$|Perspectivists {{hold that}} what <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do is {{determined}} by your perspective, that is, your epistemic position. Objectivists hold that what <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do {{is determined by}} the facts irrespective of your perspective. This paper explores an influential argument for perspectivism which appeals to the thought that the normative is action guiding. The crucial premise of the argument is that <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> phi only if you are able to phi for the reasons which determine that <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> phi. We show that this premise can be understood in different ways. On one reading, it provides no support for perspectivism. On another reading, the premise lacks support. So, the argument fails. An important upshot of the paper is that the objectivist can embrace the thought about guidance...|$|R

In the second half, we consider a number of objections to this argument and its conclusion. In doing so, we arrive at another argument for the view that justified beliefs about what <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do must be true, {{based in part on}} the idea that that the epistemic and practical domains are uniform, in a sense we spell out.
