40|$|Abstract: Any active thing always needs power. All {{productive}} tools, machines {{or working}} systems, which are so-called productive force, would need proper driving (<b>motive)</b> <b>power</b> (force) *. The <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> {{is the heart}} or core of productive force, which would always want to correspond with a definite relation of production. The different driving powers (or energy resource) with power devices are completely different in quality. Thus, the change of an important or main productive <b>motive</b> <b>power</b> in social economy would always lead to the qualitative change of relation of production, and would finally effect the change of human social-economical formation. The important task of mankind should ceaselessly find out new <b>motive</b> <b>powers</b> (energy) to satisfy the needs of new machines, new technology and new technical revolution. The important peculiarity of this article is: the development of human society was divided into five great stages, which were basically decided by the qualities and types of different <b>motive</b> <b>powers</b> of production.
