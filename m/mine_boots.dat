Some who had been acquainted with her earlier thought she {{deserved}} to suffer for having broken up the marriage between Horace and Augusta, and believed that she had been the cause of his ruin. At that time, Leadville had lost much of its boomtown population and was becoming a ghost-town. She often walked the empty streets at night, dressed in a mixture of women's and men's clothing, wearing trousers and <b>mining</b> <b>boots.</b> She protected the mine from strangers with a shot-gun, and [...] "she became a sad spectre of Baby Doe to old-timers; a spectacle to the young." ...|$|R

5000|$|At the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Leh had {{a display}} of men's and women's boots and shoes that his {{manufacturing}} plant produced. The judges at the Exposition noted that it was [...] "A good exhibit of Women's, Misses and Children's heavy and substantial shoes, prime stock and workmanship, and good, full fitting and strong work. The heavy <b>mining</b> <b>boot,</b> borgan and buckle shoe are very superior articles for purposes intended. Prices of goods were very reasonable".In the 1880s, the store had expanded far beyond selling shoes. Dry goods were added along with fabrics, ready to wear clothing and other goods, turning the company into a department store. In April 1880, the Reliable Lion Clothing Store was purchased on {{the southeast corner of}} 7th and Hamilton which became the H. M. Leh Lion Clothing Store selling ready-to-wear clothing. The Lion Hall Clothing was sold in the summer of 1895 and became Dresher & Stephens Lion Clothing Store, and subsequently in 1898 into Shankweiler and Lehr, which operated as men's store into the 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Dissatisfaction {{with work}} boot design {{is common in}} the mining industry. Many {{underground}} coal miners believe their work boots contribute to {{the high incidence of}} lower limb injuries they experience. Despite this, the most recent research to examine underground coal <b>mining</b> work <b>boot</b> satisfaction was conducted over a decade ago. This present study aimed to address this gap in the literature by assessing current <b>mining</b> work <b>boot</b> satisfaction in relation to the work-related requirements for underground coal mining. 358 underground coal miners (355 men; mean age = 39. 1 ± 10. 7 years) completed a 54 -question survey regarding their job details, work footwear habits, foot problems, lower limb and lower back pain history, and work footwear fit and comfort. Results revealed that underground coal miners were not satisfied with their current <b>mining</b> work <b>boots.</b> This was evident in the high incidence of reported foot problems (55. 3 %), lower back pain (44. 5 %), knee pain (21. 5 %), ankle pain (24. 9 %) and foot pain (42. 3 %). Over half of the underground coal miners surveyed believed their work boots contributed to their lower limb pain and reported their work boots were uncomfortable. Different working roles and environments resulted in differences in the incidence of foot problems, lower limb pain and comfort scores, confirming that one boot design cannot meet all the work-related requirements of underground coal mining. Further research examining the interaction of a variety of boot designs across the different underground surfaces and the different tasks miners perform is paramount to identify key boot design features that affect the way underground coal miners perform. Enhanced work boot design could improve worker comfort and productivity by reducing the high rates of reported foot problems and pain amongst underground coal miners...|$|R
2500|$|Alone in {{the cabin}} outside Leadville, Baby Doe turned to religion. She {{considered}} her life of great wealth a period of vanity and created penances for herself. During the frigidly bitter Colorado high-country winters, she wound burlap sacks around her legs. With no money, she ate very little, living on stale bread and suet, and refused to accept charity. Baby Doe lived like this for 35 years. [...] During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called [...] "Dreams and Visions", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in piles of paper in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: [...] "Nov. 26—1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent & am in need of food and only enough bread for tonight & breakfast.... my shoes and stockings only 1 pair are in rags." [...] An eyewitness described her in 1927 as dressed [...] "in corduroy trousers, <b>mining</b> <b>boots,</b> and a torn soiled blouse .... a blue bandana tied around her head", {{and went on to}} say that [...] "her eyes were very far apart and a gorgeous blue".|$|R
60|$|I {{went over}} into a dark corner where I had {{observed}} other men going and found the water. Then I returned and attacked the skilly. It was coarse of texture, unseasoned, gross, and bitter. This bitterness which lingered persistently in the mouth after the skilly had passed on, I found especially repulsive. I struggled manfully, but was mastered by my qualms, and half-a-dozen mouthfuls of skilly and bread was the measure of my success. The man beside me ate his own share, and <b>mine</b> to <b>boot,</b> scraped the pannikins, and looked hungrily for more.|$|R

40|$|Lower limb {{injuries}} are highly prevalent in underground coal mining. Wearing gumboots with inadequate ankle support {{was thought to}} contribute to these injuries. Despite the uptake of leather lace-up boots, which provide more ankle support, no recent research could be found investigating {{the effect of this}} alternative work boot in underground coal mining. Consequently, this study aimed to determine whether boot type (gumboot, leather lace-up boot) influenced work footwear habits, foot problems, lower limb pain, lower back pain, or perceptions of work boot fit and comfort in underground coal miners. Chi-squared tests were applied to 358 surveys completed by underground coal miners to determine whether responses differed significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) according to boot-type. There were no significant between-boot differences in regards to the presence of foot problems, lower limb pain or lower back pain. However, the types of foot problems and locations of foot pain differed according to boot type. Gumboot wearers {{were also more likely to}} state that their work boot comfort was either uncomfortable or indifferent, their work boot fit was poor and their current boot did not provide enough support. The introduction of more structured leather lace-up boots appears to have positively influenced the support and fit provided by <b>mining</b> work <b>boots,</b> although foot problems, lower limb pain and lower back pain continue to be reported. Further investigation is recommended to identify which specific boot design features caused these observed differences in work boot fit, comfort and locations of foot pain and how these design features can be manipulated to create an underground coal <b>mining</b> work <b>boot</b> that is comfortable and reduces the high incidence of foot problems and lower limb pain suffered by underground coal miners...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of wearing two standard underground coal <b>mining</b> work <b>boots</b> (a gumboot and a leather lace-up boot) on lower limb muscle activity when participants walked across simulated underground coal mining surfaces. Quadriceps (rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis) and hamstring (biceps femoris, semitendinosus) muscle activity were recorded as twenty male participants walked at a self-selected pace around a circuit while wearing each boot type. The circuit consisted of level, inclined and declined surfaces composed of rocky gravel and hard dirt. Walking in a leather lace-up boot, compared to a gumboot, resulted in increased vastus lateralis and increased biceps femoris muscle activity when walking on sloped surfaces. Increased muscle activity appears to be acting as a slip and/or trip prevention strategy in response to challenging surfaces and changing boot features...|$|R
50|$|But the {{description}} of the muki changes with time. Around the 1930s, he was said to wander the mines while holding a gas lantern and wearing a vicuña poncho. He was described as having two small shiny horns and to speak with a soft voice. Nowadays he has a more updated look: <b>mining</b> outfit, rain <b>boots</b> and a battery flashlight. Sometimes he shape shifts into an animal or a blonde white man to appear to the miners and deceive them.|$|R
50|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, it must have become clear that {{consolidation}} was the best means of achieving profitability, and a partnership under two businessmen named Zeckendorf and Steinfeld managed to acquire a large group of claims in the district. This partnership held one of the most productive <b>mines,</b> the Old <b>Boot.</b> Another group of claims was developed by the Oxide Copper Company; this company retained another major mine, the Young America. In 1901, there was enough mining activity in the district, and enough of a family presence, that Pima County established a public school. It had seventy-five students that year. Two communities were included in the 1900 census: Peltonville, with eighty inhabitants, and Atlas Camp, with fifty-nine.|$|R

40|$|Blast mines {{have played}} a major role in almost every {{conflict}} from the two world wars to the most recent skirmishes. They provide a psychological threat in addition to denying access to areas and exerting a huge toll on the logistic and medical capabilities in conflict zones. Due to the lack of inexpensive and reliable mechanical technique that would work consistently and without the danger of mines being missed, human deminers are often preferred. This means that deminers are under constant threat of serious traumatic injuries to lower extremities, potentially leading to amputation and death. A limited number of studies have been published in the open literature regarding the performance of boots both commercially available and those that are specifically designed to deal with anti – personnel mines. The issue with these studies is that while they have followed a common test method, they have been unable to agree on the variables involved. This has resulted in studies that produce vastly different results making them difficult to compare. However, while all of them have concluded that none of the commercial boots tested provided adequate protection against even a small mine, there have been varied results observed with respect to certain <b>mine</b> resistant <b>boots</b> with some reporting adequate protection while others reporting outright failure. Blast testing involves a large number of variables making it difficult to produce repeatable, consistent and conclusive results, and therefore difficult to prove the claims of different boots. The aim of the research project was i) to investigate the reliability and reproducibility of current blast test methods while testing the performance of commercially available boots and ii) to develop a new test method that is able to replicate the performance of blast test methods that is capable of producing more consistent and reproducible results while being cheaper, quicker and flexible. To address these challenges, blast testing was conducted using a variety of commercially available boots – i) to test their performance and if the results observed line up with the literature and ii) to obtain baseline data for further analysis. Blast testing demonstrated that none of the commercially available boots offer adequate protection even against a small mine. They additionally highlighted issues with this type of testing regarding their accuracy and repeatability. This was compared to an analysis of the effect that foams have on reducing loads, which showed that by increasing the number of layers it was possible to reduce the loads measured. However, the total impulse measured remained the same irrespective of the foam thickness. The baseline data from the blast test was used to develop a new gun based test in order to address the limitation observed during blast testing. The final version of this test was able to match the performance of the blast test while being able to produce penetration. A subsection of the research tested the effectiveness of socks as a means of preventing contamination. Two different types of socks were used in three different arrangements and testing revealed that socks have a positive effect on preventing contamination...|$|R
