Most donations were from foreign contributors, including NGOs and foreign governments (among them Japan, Germany, Monaco, Luxembourg and the United States). The European Union was also a significant contributor during that period, providing €20.7million. , the Croatian <b>Mine</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Centre</b> has been allocated approximately 400million kuna ( [...] 53million euros) a year for demining. An estimated further €500million (or more) will be needed to remove all remaining land mines from Croatia by 2019, the deadline for land-mine clearance set by the Ottawa Treaty.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} recent initiatives {{which are}} contributing {{to the establishment of}} a harmonised GIS for <b>mine</b> <b>action</b> in South East Europe. While these initiatives have been oriented particularly towards the needs of the <b>mine</b> <b>action</b> community, they are also clearly relevant for the needs of other communities with humanitarian, environmental and security concerns in the region. The problem of mine contamination in S. E. Europe continues to be very serious, causing casualties and creating obstacles to socio-economic development. It will continue to be present in some of the countries for a time-scale of the order of ten years- if present rates of mine clearance can be sustained, and this is not certain. Planning and monitoring of <b>mine</b> <b>actions</b> requires the use of GIS, and these will be more effective at handling regional and cross-border aspects if systems and data are harmonised at the regional level. There is therefore a need to establish a regional geographical information infrastructure among the organisations in the <b>mine</b> <b>action</b> community. The first EU supported initiative with this aim was the setting up of the Working Group “Towards Harmonised Information Systems for <b>Mine</b> <b>Action</b> in S. E. Europe”. The group was composed mainly of participants from the <b>Mine</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Centres</b> (MACs) of Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo and was coordinated by the Joint Research Centre. It worked initially on establishing the contents and formats of very basic georeferenced datasets describing the extent of mine contamination and related accidents in these countries...|$|R

50|$|MAG’s {{delivery}} of Humanitarian <b>Mine</b> <b>Action</b> (HMA) is <b>centred</b> {{on the use}} of multi-skilled, highly mobile and flexible teams called MATs. These were developed by MAG in the mid-nineties in response to the varied needs of mine affected communities. Drawing on multi-skilled staff, MATs are able to quickly adapt to the many challenges presented not only by mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), but also to changing environments, including weather, geographical and topographical conditions and the wider security and political climate. Drawing on many years of operational experience, MATs have proven highly successful in countries such as Iraq and Cambodia in delivering a comprehensive and flexible HMA response, with multi-skilling a central aspect of their success. Team members are trained in Community Liaison (CL), information/data gathering, survey and assessment, mapping, logistics, minefield marking, landmine clearance and ordnance disposal (EOD).|$|R
