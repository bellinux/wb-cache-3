40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} enhance the NC {{programming}} efficiency and quality of aircraft structural parts (ASPs), an intelligent NC programming pattern driven by process schemes is presented. In this pattern, the NC <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> is the minimal organizational structure in the technological process, consisting of an operation machining volume cell, and the type and parameters of the machining operation. After the <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> construction, the final NC program can be easily obtained in a CAD/CAM system by instantiating the machining operation for each <b>machining</b> <b>cell.</b> Accordingly, how to automatically establish the machining cells is a key issue in intelligent NC programming. On {{the basis of the}} NC machining craft of ASP, the paper aims to make an in-depth research on this issue. Firstly, some new terms about the residual volume and the machinable volume are defined, and then, the technological process is modeled with a process scheme. Secondly, the approach to building the machining cells is introduced, in which real-time complement machining is mainly considered to avoid interference and overcutting. Thirdly, the implementing algorithm is designed and applied to the Intelligent NC Programming System of ASP. Finally, the developed algorithm is validated through two case studies...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the designs}} of {{cellular}} manufacturing systems (CMS) requires that a machine population be partitioned into <b>machine</b> <b>cells.</b> Numerous methods are available for clustering <b>machines</b> into <b>machine</b> <b>cells.</b> One method involves using a similarity coefficient. Similarity coefficients between machines are not absolute, and they still need more attention from researchers. Although {{there are a number}} of similarity coefficients in the literature, they do not always incorporate the important properties of a similarity coefficient satisfactorily. These important properties include alternative routings, processing time, machine capacity (reliability), machine capability (flexibility), production volume, product demand, and the number of operations done on a machine. The objectives of this paper are to present a review of the literature on similarity coefficients between machines in CMS, to propose a new similarity coefficient between machines incorporating all these important properties of similarity, and to propose a <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> heuristic approach to group <b>machines</b> into <b>machine</b> <b>cells.</b> An example problem is included and demonstrated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{production}} planning and scheduling {{of a job}} shop environment of a <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> in a manufacturing facility. This thesis addresses the scheduling limitations in the <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> that can result in unbalanced loading and idling of machines as well as longer manufacturing lead times. A method was developed to use Microsoft Project 2007 {{as a tool to}} enable dynamic production planning and control in the shop floor. In order for a proper model to be set up, relevant observations were made and required data collected. In Microsoft Project, work orders were scheduled using an active-nondelay hybrid scheduling technique. This technique resulted in short makespan with high machine utilization, low average waiting time, and low WIP. Simulated manufacturing lead times were also reduced to an average of 1. 5 weeks compared to current manufacturing lead times of about 3 - 4 weeks, showing significant improvement. Further observations revealed that machine utilizations could not be balanced further than what was achieved without changing the machine routings of the components. Alternatively, if process times on the bottleneck machine could be reduced, more balanced loads could be achieved as well. If recommendations to the company were implemented, we expect that there will be an increase in the overall <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> output capacity and a reduction in overall manufacturing lead times and WIP levels due to shorter processing times, higher machine utilizations, and better production planning. by Wei Yung Tan.

40|$|Aiming at the {{production}} stability of complex parts, a method based on weighted network was proposed {{to analyze the}} stability of the process routes of complex parts in order to improve {{the production}} stability. The weighted network of the process routes of complex parts was constructed by using the concept of <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> which can transform the production cost and manufacturing time to the weights of network to do the decision-making of the process routes. Based on the production stability, the brittleness risk entropy of subsystem of weighted network was constructed by analyzing the probability of the brittle events that may lead to the collapse of the weighted network in machining cells. As the indicator of analyzing the vulnerability of weighted network node, the brittleness risk entropy can predict the easily failed subsystem in the entire network. Meanwhile, the brittle event, which may lead to the <b>machining</b> <b>cell</b> failure, was retrospect for the greater stability of the process routes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem {{regarding}} the rapid NC machining programming for top planar surface of ribs in aircraft structural parts, an approach based on skeleton extraction technique is presented here to generate tool path for top planar surface. Firstly, the constrained Delaunay triangulation is built to split the rib top planar surface into several sub areas and approximate skeleton branch of each sub area is extracted. Then based on these skeleton branches and process scheme, the set of <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> of the rib top planar surface is constructed. Secondly, the problem on determining the sequence of <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> is resolved by optimizing the machining path. Finally, the sequence of <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> can be converted into the <b>machining</b> <b>cells</b> chain from which tool path can be calculated by CAM systems.

40|$|Purpose: Improving the {{productivity}} of a large manufacturing firm through {{development and implementation of}} a group technology model in a real manufacturing environment. This incorporates classification of parts, coding of parts and par families, formation of <b>machine</b> <b>cells,</b> and minimization of machine idle times through <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> capacity adjustment. Design/methodology/approach: An algorithm has been developed for classification of all the parts into part families on the basis of manufacturing similarities. This formed 144 par families for more than 7500 different parts in production. The algorithm assigned group technology code to each part and a part family code to each part family. The former represents manufacturing characteristics of the part and the latter simplifies determination of part families. A number of <b>machine</b> <b>cells</b> were developed to produce all of the part families. After classification the system automatically directs each part to the appropriate <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> for manufacturing. A computer software has been developed that automated the functions of classification of parts and assigning a group technology code to each part, determination of part families and assigning part family codes, and directing part families to appropriate <b>machine</b> <b>cells</b> for production. Findings: Introducing part family codes in addition to group technology codes considerably simplified the task of part family determination. Application of the system immediately resulted in an increased productivity of about 50 %. This was due to the reduced setup times, less flow of parts in the workshop, production of similar parts due to parts classification, etc. Yet a productivity improvement of 100 % or more is anticipated in near future. Research limitations/implications: As the manufacturing firm was producing a wide range of products at the time of implementation of this work, it was difficult to implement the project without affecting the production flow significantly. There has also been some resistance from technical people opposing a change in traditional production methods. Originality/value: Integration of <b>machine</b> <b>cell</b> formation with capacity adjustment is of great value that resulted in significant productivity improvements. Also some issues regarding actual implementation of group technology and associated problems and issues, coding of parts and part families, formation of <b>machine</b> <b>cells,</b> and capacity adjustment of <b>machine</b> <b>cells</b> have been dealt with and discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{flexible}} manufacturing facilities {{can be highly}} complex, consisting of {{the latest developments in}} machine tool technology, automated material handling systems and sophisticated cell controllers. The design and management of such systems requires a large number of decisions and choices with regard to production mix, assignment of fixtures and cutting tools. A large number of commercial computer modelling packages are now available in the market place. Although these allow valuable assistance in the analysis of a manufacturing facility, they usually take significant amounts of time to build models and require a large amount of training, and can be constraining in their application.

The cell is designed to manufacture a wide variety of parts simulta-neously. Parts enter the cell at a loading station, and are routed through a sequence of operations at the machining centers. The completled part is finally unloaded at an unloading station. The rnachining operations and part movements are controlled by a host computer through a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). A key advantage of a FMC over conventional manufacturing systems; is the flexibility feature, which allows a variety of parts to be manufactured simul-taneously.
