5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

5|$|Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa {{first met}} at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed {{together}} at Hughes's studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future. Bonamassa also worked with Jason Bonham that year, when the drummer performed on the guitarist's fifth studio album You & <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recommendation of producer and mutual friend Kevin Shirley. Hughes and Bonamassa reunited three years later in November 2009, performing together at the House of Blues in Los Angeles for Guitar Center. It {{was at this point}} that the two decided to form a band. The idea of enlisting Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian to complete the band's lineup was suggested by Shirley, after a second guitarist was briefly considered instead of a keyboardist.|$|E

25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Locklear {{joined the}} cast of The CW's updated version of Melrose Place. Beginning on November 17, 2009, she reprised her role as Amanda Woodward and {{appeared}} in eight episodes. Ten {{years after the end}} of the original Melrose Place, Amanda Woodward is now a partner in a public relations firm, and is both mentor and tormentor to a young underling, Ella, played by Katie Cassidy. However, despite Locklear's appearances (along with various other original series regulars), the new show was not a ratings success and was cancelled after one season. In 2011, Locklear starred in the television movie He Loves <b>Me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lifetime Channel.|$|E
25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the Korean War {{armistice}} (a cessation of hostilities), Miller wound up in a drunk tank in North Georgia Mountains. Miller stated later that this incident was the lowest point of his life. Upon his release, Miller enlisted in the Marines. During his three years in the United States Marine Corps, Miller attained the rank of sergeant. He often refers to the value of his experience in the Marine Corps in his writing and stump speeches; in his book on the subject, entitled Corps Values: Everything You Need to Know I Learned in the Marines, he wrote: In the twelve weeks of hell and transformation that were Marine Corps boot camp, I learned the values of achieving a successful life that have guided and sustained <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> course which, although sometimes checkered and detoured, I have followed ever since.|$|E
25|$|The Corleonesi {{were also}} indicted in the Trial of the 114 {{related to the}} First Mafia War that {{resulted}} in the Ciaculli Massacre, that was also prepared by Terranova. During an interrogation preparing the trial, Leggio refused to answer questions. When in response to one of them, Leggio replied that he could not even recall his own name or his parents, Terranova instructed the clerk: “Write that Leggio does not know whose son he is.” Leggio was infuriated with the implication that he was a bastard. The incident {{was the beginning of a}} deep hatred by Leggio for Terranova. “Leggio actually had foam on his lips; he would have killed <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot if he could,” Terranova told his wife. The prosecution appealed successfully against the Catanzaro verdict that had acquitted Leggio and had him tried in absentia in 1970. This time Leggio was found guilty, although he had left jail after the Catanzaro trial, given the time they had already spent in detention while awaiting trial, and it was not until 1974 that Leggio was finally captured again and taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> promenade, {{in order to}} demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since {{received a letter from}} the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E
