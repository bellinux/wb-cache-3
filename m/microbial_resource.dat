For example, molecular techniques such as community fingerprinting {{can be used to}} track changes in microbial communities over time or assess their biodiversity. Managing the carbon cycle to sequester carbon dioxide and prevent excess methanogenesis is important in mitigating global warming, and the prospects of bioenergy are being expanded by the development of microbial fuel cells. <b>Microbial</b> <b>resource</b> management advocates a more progressive attitude towards disease, whereby biological control agents are favoured over attempts at eradication. Fluxes in microbial communities has to be better characterized for this field's potential to be realised. In addition, there are also clinical implications, as marine microbial symbioses are a valuable source of existing and novel antimicrobial agents, and thus offer another line of inquiry in the evolutionary arms race of antibiotic resistance, a pressing concern for researchers.|$|E

40|$|The {{search for}} novel {{technologies}} to generate renewable chemicals and fuels has attracted large attention in recent years, {{mainly because of}} the necessity to develop sustainable alternatives for fossil fuel based processes. The conversion of biomass and organic wastes by fermentation processes is of growing importance. Whereas in the past microbial conversions were limited to ‘simple molecules’ like bio-ethanol, methane (via anaerobic digestion) or hydrogen production, the application of <b>microbial</b> <b>resource</b> management paves the way towards the fermentative production of more complex and value added organic molecules, which {{can be used as a}} feedstock in chemical processes or as liquid fuel. In both cases, they can replace fossil fuels. <b>Microbial</b> <b>resource</b> management aims to control and steer the capabilities of complex communities by operating the bioreactors in such a way to promote the development of a microbial community that accommodates the desired functional process. The application of molecular biology and the advent of culture-independent molecular techniques like high throughput DNA sequencing methods has caused a revolution in the capabilities to practice <b>microbial</b> <b>resource</b> management, opening the door to engineer communities with superior functions. Currently, bioreactors exploiting natural microbial communities for bioenergy production are commonly operated based on bulk parameters and empirical expert knowledge. The composition of the fermentation mixture in the bioreactor often remains a black box. The ability of current molecular and cell based methods to derive structurefunction-relationships, that is, correlations between the microbial community structure and dynamics, and the reactor performance, are considered as key-criteria for the future development of biofuel production. This paper will review the current state-of-the art in fermentation technology and will analyse the current trends in <b>microbial</b> <b>resource</b> management. Examples of applications will be presented with a focus on integration with process measurements to improve system performance. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Among the {{innovative}} {{trends in the}} wine sector, the continuous exploration of enological properties associated with wine <b>microbial</b> <b>resources</b> represents a cornerstone driver of quality improvement. Since the advent of starter cultures technology, the attention {{has been focused on}} intraspecific biodiversity within the primary species responsible for alcoholic fermentation (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and, subsequently, for the so-called ‘malolactic fermentation’ (Oenococcus oeni). However, in the last decade, a relevant number of studies proposed the enological exploitation of an increasing number of species (e. g., non-Saccharomyces yeasts) associated with spontaneous fermentation in wine. These new species/strains may provide technological solutions to specific problems and/or improve sensory characteristics, such as complexity, mouth-feel and flavors. This review offers an overview of the available information on the enological/protechnological significance of <b>microbial</b> <b>resources</b> associated with winemaking, summarizing the opportunities and the benefits associated with the enological exploitation of this microbial potential. We discuss proposed solutions to improve quality and safety of wines (e. g., alternative starter cultures, multistrains starter cultures) and future perspectives...|$|R

The basic equipment needed is the same as that used for searching databases: a terminal, or a personal computer equipped with a communication software, a modem and a telephone line. The aims of the network are to provide a forum for the exchange of information, experience and scientific results on BNF; to foster better communication and cooperation among and between MlRCENs and other organizations; and to encourage and help laboratories and individuals to use e-mail for communications in BNF research.

40|$|Background Microorganisms govern {{important}} ecosystems processes, {{in particular}} the degradation of organic matter (OM). However, microorganisms are rarely considered in efforts to monitor ecosystem health and functioning. Evidence suggests that environmental perturbations can adversely affect microbial communities {{and their ability to}} use available substrates. However, whether impacted microbial efficiencies in extracting and utilizing the available resources (resource niche breadth) translate to changes in OM degradation in natural systems remains poorly understood. Methods Here we evaluated effects of differences in OM related to agricultural land use (OM derived from ditches adjacent to grasslands, bulb fields and a pristine dune area) on microbial functioning. We specifically assessed (1) resource niche breadths of microbial communities during initial community assembly in laboratory microcosms and already established natural communities, and (2) how changes in community resource niche breadth translates to the degradation of natural OM. Results A disparity existed between <b>microbial</b> <b>resource</b> niche breadth in laboratory incubations and natural microbial communities. Resource utilization and niche breadth of natural microbial communities was observed to be constrained in drainage ditches adjacent to agricultural fields. This outcome coincides with retarded degradation of natural OM collected from ditches adjacent to hyacinth bulb fields. Microbial communities in bulb field ditches further showed functional redundancy when offered grassland OM of seemingly higher substrate quality. Discussion Results presented in this study suggest that agricultural practices can impose constraints on microbial functional diversity by reducing OM resource quality, which can subsequently translate to confined <b>microbial</b> <b>resource</b> niche differentiation and reduced organic matter degradation rates. This hints that assessments of actual <b>microbial</b> <b>resource</b> utilization and niche differentiation could potentially be used to assess the ecological health and functioning of natural communities...|$|E
