Auto-ignition {{temperature}} (AIT) {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} lowest temperature at which a substance will produce hot-flame ignition in air at atmospheric pressure {{without the aid of}} an external energy source such as spark or flame. Its principal applications include: defining the maximum acceptable surface temperature in a particular area, usually for electrical classification purpose, to prevent fire and explosion hazards; determining the possible hazardous consequence associated with leakage of flammable chemicals in risk assessment methods. Although AIT is indispensable for safely handling and operating flammable substance, the AITs data are, however, very much diverse in different data compilations. In present work the AITs of three ketones are measured in compliance with the ASTM E 659 test method. The measured AITs are (461. 7 ± 9. 2) ℃, (397. 8 ± 8. 0) ℃ and (399. 0 ± 8. 0) ℃ for Methyl Ethyl Ketone, <b>Methyl</b> <b>Isoamyl</b> <b>Ketone</b> and 2 -Heptanone, respectively. It is found that the AIT compiled in DIPPR 2009 is beyond the experimental reproducibility in Methyl Ethyl Ketone and <b>Methyl</b> <b>Isoamyl</b> <b>Ketone,</b> and the difference is found to be of 54 ℃ and 207 ℃ and 6 ℃ for Methyl Ethyl Ketone Methyl and Isoamyl Ketone, respectively. The AIT reported in The Chemical Database also deviates from that obtained in present work with certain degree, and the difference is found to be of 54 ℃, 57 ℃ and 133 ℃ for Methyl Ethyl Ketone, <b>Methyl</b> <b>Isoamyl</b> <b>Ketone</b> and 2 - Heptanone, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Depleting oil {{reserves}} and growing environmental concerns have necessitated {{the development of}} sustainable processes to fuels and chemicals. Here we have developed a general metabolic platform in E. coli to biosynthesize carboxylic acids. By engineering selectivity of 2 -ketoacid decarboxylases and screening for promiscuous aldehyde dehydrogenases, synthetic pathways were constructed to produce both C 5 and C 6 acids. In particular, the production of isovaleric acid reached 32 g/L (0. 22 g/g glucose yield), which is 58 % of the theoretical yield. Furthermore, we have developed solid base catalysts to efficiently ketonize the bio-derived carboxylic acids such as isovaleric acid and isocaproic acid into high volume industrial ketones: methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK, yield 84 %), diisobutyl ketone (DIBK, yield 66 %) and <b>methyl</b> <b>isoamyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MIAK, yield 81 %). This hybrid “Bio-Catalytic conversion” approach provides a general strategy to manufacture aliphatic ketones, and represents an alternate route to expanding the repertoire of renewable chemicals...|$|E

The methods used for identification are generally nonspecific if analyzed concurrently with ethanol or require an additional analytical procedure that employs mass spectrometry. A previously published technique utilizing a capillary flow technology splitter to simultaneously quantitate and confirm ethyl alcohol by flame ionization and mass spectrometric de-tection after headspace sampling and gas chromatographic separ-ation was evaluated {{for the detection}} of inhalants.

Malt was contaminated with deoxynivalenol and T- 2 in different ratios (up to 500 ppb), according to a 3 ² factorial design, and the alcohols obtained after the fermentation were determined through gas chromatography.

40|$|Three new nonquaternary oximes {{have been}} {{evaluated}} {{with respect to their}} antidotal activities against organophosphate poisoning. The oximes 1, 2, 3 -thiadiazole- 5 -carboxaldoxime (1, pKa = 7. 6), 2 -methyl- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole- 5 -carboxaldoxime (2, pKa = 8. 4), and 3 -methyl- 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazole- 5 -carboxaldoxime (3, pKa = 7. 0) were prepared in yields of 56, 24, and 58 %, respectively, by nitrosation of the corresponding <b>methyl</b> derivatives with <b>isoamyl</b> nitrite in the presence of potassium ethoxide. The new compounds are substantially more lipophilic and much less toxic than the well-known antidote P 2 S. They reactivate phosphylated AChE slowly. In the five animal species investigated, they disappear from the blood stream after iv administration at approximately the same rates as Obidoxime. It was shown that the disappearance of 1 from rabbit blood is not due to rapid renal excretion of the unchanged oxime, as is the case for Obidoxime and P 2 S. Since an unidentified derivative of 1 has been found in the urine, rapid metabolic conversion of 1 is most likely responsible. Therapeutic administration (ip) of 2 - 3 at 250 mg/kg, in combination with atropine, saves mice from four to five times the LD 50 of sarin. Much lower doses (33 - 75 mg/kg) of 1 save rats and mice from five times the LD 50 of sarin, whereas P 2 S cannot save mice from the same challenge dose. In contrast herewith, 1 does not save rats from five times the LD 50 of paraoxon, whereas P 2 S is effective in this case. For oral prophylaxis against sarin, 1 is inferior to P 2 S. This inferiority may be partly ascribed to the combined effects of rapid absorption of 1 from the gastrointestinal tract and rapid elimination.
