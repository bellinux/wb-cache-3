Under this sparse deployment, sensors cannot {{communicate with each other}} via ranging hardware or one-hop connectivity, rendering the existing localization solutions ineffective. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Traffic Lights Schedule-based localization algorithm (TLS), which is built on the fact that vehicles move through the intersection with a known traffic light schedule. We can first obtain the law by binary vehicle detection time stamps and describe the law as a <b>matrix,</b> called a <b>detection</b> <b>matrix.</b> At the same time, we can also use the known traffic light information to construct the matrices, which can be formed as a collection called a known <b>matrix</b> collection.

Investigation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that support the tissue homeostasis under microgravity conditions allows a deeper insight into the processes underlying bone loss.

The investigation of major osteogenic gene expression has showed decreased trans­criptional activity in RUNX 2, ALPL- 1, Col- 1, but increased expression of PPARγ. One of the reasons for the decreased osteogenic potential of MSCs may be an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after 30 days of clinorotation.

Characteristics of these cells at first, second, third and fourth weeks were comprised with calvaria osteoblasts that were isolated from human calvaria by explanation culture method.

40|$|Noroviruses (NoVs) are a {{major cause}} of {{gastroenteritis}} worldwide in humans and animals and are known as very infectious viral agents. They are spread through feces and vomit via several transmission routes involving person-to-person contact, food, and water. Investigation of these transmission routes requires sensitive methods for detection of NoVs. As NoVs cannot be cultivated to date, detection of these viruses relies on the use of molecular methods such as (real-time) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Regardless of the <b>matrix,</b> <b>detection</b> of NoVs generally requires three subsequent steps: a virus extraction step, RNA purification, and molecular detection of the purified RNA, occasionally followed by molecular genotyping. The current review mainly focused on the molecular detection and genotyping of NoVs. The most conserved region in the genome of human infective NoVs is the ORF 1 /ORF 2 junction and {{has been used as a}} preferred target region for molecular detection of NoVs by methods such as (real-time) RT-PCR, NASBA, and LAMP. In case of animal NoVs, broad range molecular assays have most frequently been applied for molecular detection. Regarding genotyping of NoVs, five regions situated in the polymerase and capsid genes have been used for conventional RT-PCR amplification and sequencing. As the expected levels of NoVs on food and in water are very low and inhibition of molecular methods can occur in these matrices, quality control including adequate positive and negative controls is an essential part of NoV detection. Although the development of molecular methods for NoV detection has certainly aided in the understanding of NoV transmission, it has also led to new problems such as the question whether low levels of human NoV detected on fresh produce and shellfish could pose a threat to public health. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

This is a factor for the presence of masked criminals is often successful in their robbery mission. Therefore, a detection system that exposed human skin needed for the classification of each customer. There are three objectives of the construction of this facial skin detection. The first is the presence of customers. Second, detect the head in normal standing customers. Third, tracking customers exposed skin and classified into 5 groups. Customer presence is detected by Background Subtraction (BS) method. The method requires two images of the reference image and the current image to separate the foreground (FG) pixels of background (BG) pixels. Morphological methods were used {{to improve the quality of}} binary image objects. Detection of the customer's head is done by using the Circle Hough Transform (CHT). This method mapping template circle at each pixel boundary objects and produce CHT matrix that containing the coordinates and radius of the 10 best circles. Next, the selection of a circle for the head has done according Y min in the CHT <b>matrix.</b> <b>Detection</b> of the skin is done using a new and efficient method is known as the Skin Gray (GS). It can detect the diversity of human skin tones like bright skin (Kulit Cerah, KC), tanned skin (Kulit Sawo, KS), and dark skin (Kulit Gelap, KG) to display the image contrast between skin and non-skin in grayscale. Image contrast is produced by multiplication coefficient of GS in each image component (RcxR +Gc+GxBcxB). Three coefficients were used GS; coefficient of the Red Component (Red Coefficient, Rc), the coefficient of the green component (Green Coefficient, Gc), the coefficient of the blue component (Blue Coefficient, Bc). The analysis conducted has found the GS coefficients for each group of skin and choose a single GS coefficient suitable for all skin tones. The coefficient of selected single GS is Rc = 1. 00, which Ge = 0. 50, Bc = 0. 50. Separation of skin and non- skin area on the image contrast is done by setting range of the threshold value (low threshold (THR) and high threshold (THT)). The analysis conducted has found a range of values for each group threshold skin and choose a range that is suitable for all skin tones. Single threshold value range is; THR = 18, and THT = 113.

The cod-end of the trawl was replaced with a cylindrical PIT-tag detection antenna with an 86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening and two detection coils connected in series. The pair trawl was 105 m long with a 91. 5 -m opening between the wings and a sample depth of 4. 9 m. Also during 2008, we finalized {{the development of a}} prototype 'matrix' antenna, which was larger than previous antennas by a considerable magnitude. The matrix antenna consisted of 6 coils: a 3 -coil front component and a 3 -coil rear component, which were separated by 1. 5 -m of net mesh. The fish-passage opening was 2. 5 m wide by 3. 0 m tall and was attached to a standard-size pair trawl net. Intermittent sampling with a single crew began on 7 March and targeted yearling Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss. Daily sampling using two crews began on 30 April and continued through 14 June; during this period we detected 2. 7 % of all juvenile salmonids previously detected at Bonneville Dam [...] a measure of sample efficiency. Sampling with a single crew continued through 20 August and targeted subyearling Chinook salmon. We detected 7, 397 yearling Chinook salmon, 2, 735 subyearling Chinook salmon, 291 coho salmon O. kisutch, 5, 950 steelhead, and 122 sockeye salmon O. nerka in the upper estuary. We deployed the matrix antenna system and the older, cylindrical antenna system (86 -cm-diameter fish-passage opening) simultaneously in mid-May 2008 to test <b>matrix</b> <b>detection</b> efficiency. The cylindrical antenna system had been used successfully in 2007 and early 2008. Because distribution of migrating salmonids in the estuary changes rapidly, we felt that a tandem sampling effort between the two systems {{was the only way to}} truly evaluate comparative detection efficiency. We deployed both systems within 1 km of each other during a period of high fish densities on 13, 14, and 15 May. Detections of the matrix system surpassed those of the cylindrical system by 53 % in 14 h of simultaneous sampling (total detections 716 and 339, respectively). We believe that the higher detection rate observed with the matrix system was due to fewer smolts escaping the trawl entrance and to more smolts readily passing through the larger fish-passage opening. After tandem sampling, we continued exclusive use of the matrix system for the remainder of the 2008 juvenile migration season.
