ATP-shortening of muscle fiber is remarkably inhibited by those drugs. By considering these reacting mechanisms, we discussed that the effects of adrenaline and <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> are very similary to those of pyrophosphate and NaHCO 3 (A. G.

40|$|The {{effects of}} drugs on glycerinated rabbit psoas and on ATP-shortening {{of the same}} were studied. The {{experiments}} were carried out with rabbit psoas stored in 50 per cent glycerol as described by A.

ATP causes a pronounced shortening of glycerinated muscle fibre and renders muscle fibre originally opalescent and white, transparent. Adrenaline and <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> also cause muscle fibre to become transparent and induces a slight shortening (6 %) of the muscle fibre.

40|$|A {{study on}} the effects of adrenaline, <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{pyrophosphate}} for the shortening of glycerol extracted muscle fibers, induced by ATP solution, containing various concentrations of Nat was conducted. The results are as follows : 1). Glycerol extracted muscle fibers show maximal shortening at each ionic strength (0. 07 ? 0. 4 M Na+). 2). The ATP-shortening of the muscle fibers, which are treated by agents, namely 5 × 10 - 4 M adrenaline, 10 - 3 M <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> or 0. 1 M Na-pyrophosphate, are inhibited at low and high ionic strength {{with the exception of the}} above mentioned range. 3). When the muscle fibers are treated in these agents at high concentration, the ATP-shortening is remarkably inhibited at any ionic strength, but yet. 20 % shortening was retained. From these results as mentioned above, it is concluded that these agents destroy or -loosen the link between actin and myosin of glycerol extracted muscle fibers and are responsible for the removal of hysteresis...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} {{showing that the}} dissimilation of carbohydrate reserves in two strains of bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a purely respiratory process. Endogenous respiration is KCN-labile. Our own experiments together with various accounts and data given in the literature show that the same "oxygen-transporting mechanism" functions in both endogenous and exogenous metabolism. However, the lack of sensitivity of the endogenous system of reactions to low concentrations of <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> the absence of anaerobic CO 2 production, {{and the absence of}} alcohol production, demonstrate that fermentation is not involved in the dissimilation of the carbohydrate reserves. Throughout the experiments the endogenous respiration behaved functionally as a unitary system of reactions. The O 2 consumption and CO 2 production were parallel at all times; i. e., the R. Q. was consistently 1. <b>Monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and KCN in concentrations from 10 – 5 to 10 – 1 molar affected both O 2 uptake and CO 2 production to the same extent. The only agents known to alter the value of the R. Q. were those which disrupted the normal protoplasmic structure, viz. grinding the cells with sand, plasmolyzing them with toluol and hypertonic salt solutions, or pressing them in a hydraulic press. These agents brought about a vigorous anaerobic CO 2 production accompanied by an accumulation of alcohol in the medium. The unitary character of endogenous respiration is exhibited only when the normal structure of the cell is kept intact; apparently it depends upon the maintenance of a chambered (or compartmental) architecture of the cell...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemical}} agents on the viscosity change of actomyosin solution prepared from skeletal muscle was studied.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} metabolic inhibitors and {{light on the}} gliding movement of the hormogonia of the cyanobacterium Nostoc cycadae were examined. Respiratory poisons (sodium cyanide, sodium azide) stopped the movement in the dark, but not in light. DCMU {{had little effect on}} the movement in light. The inhibitory effect of <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (MIA) on the gliding movement in light was restored by adding DCMU, suggesting that the gliding movement in light is linked to a cyclic electron flow involving photosystem I, not to a noncyclic electron flow involving photosystem II. This was then proved by experiments on the effects of selected wavelengths of light on the movement; light absorbed by chlorophyll was found to accelerate the movement, but that absorbed by phycobilins did not. The proton-conducting uncouplers carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) immediately abolished the movement. Arsenate or N, Af-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), known inhibitors of ATP synthesis, had little effect on the movement. Light irradiation caused acidification of the cell suspension...|$|E

The effect on discharge of various ionic solutions and ion channel blockers was tested. In {{the absence of}} Ca 2 + in the medium no discharge was elicited, whatever {{the composition of the}} medium. In the presence of lOmmolI" 1 Ca 2 + total discharge was induced by NaSCN, Nal, choline iodide and KI, whereas KC 1 induced both discharge and extrusion of undischarged nematocysts. The latter effect was prevented by La 3 + but not by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA+). Aldan Blue induced total discharge. NaCl and choline chloride were ineffective. The discharge induced by lyotropic anions depended on Ca 2 + concentration and was prevented by the Ca 2 + channel blockers La 3 +, Co 2 + and Cd 2 +, but not by verapamil. It is proposed that the discharge of in situ nematocysts is caused by Ca 2 + conductance through the cell membrane of either the nematocyte or the supporting cell.

40|$|Author abstract]In the {{presence}} of urea, HAP is active at the moderate temperatures (30 ～ 40 ℃) that are optimal for most enzymes. Shark muscle contains much urea, and so it may have an HAP with thermal properties somewhat different from the usual ones. We therefore looked for HAP in a crude extract of shark muscle. The optimum pH of caseinolytic activity in the extract was 8. 0, and the optimum temperature for one-hour reaction was 55 ℃. At 45 ℃, the activity was very weak, and at below 40 ℃ it had almost disappeared. The activity was relatively high even at 30 ℃ when the concentration of urea was 3 M. The heat-stability of the activity was inferior to that of HAP purified from usual fish, but it was stable when heated for one hour at 50 ℃. The activity was inhibited not only by cysteine proteinase inhibitors such as 4 -chloromercuribenzoate, <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and iodoacetamide, but also by ATP and related compounds. The above properties of the activity coincided with those of HAP. The results suggested that there is HAP in shark muscle, the thermal stability of which differs in some ways from HAP from other fish.

The binding of concanavalin A (Con A) {{to the cell}} surface was very specific and the available binding sites were saturated within a few minutes. The amount of 131 I-Con A bound to EATC was 4 - 14 x io 7 molecules/cell at 37 °C and 212 x io 7 molecules/cell at o °C. Under these conditions, cell agglutination was observed only at 37 °C and not at o °C. However, the binding sites measured at o °C were also effective for agglutination at 37 °C. Beef erythrocytes were agglu-tinated by Con A only after treatment of cells with papain. The number of binding sites for Con A on the cell surface was decreased by this treatment to about half the number present on untreated cells. Various reagents such as colchicine, <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> dinitrophenol, rotenone, sodium azide and carboxyl cyanide-m-fluorophenylhydrazone (FCCP) {{had no effect on}} Con A-mediated cell agglutination. In contrast, periodate treatment produced a remarkable decrease in the agglutinability of cells. From these data, it is concluded that the cell agglutina-tion induced by Con A was due to the topographical distribution of the surface receptors for the lectin, and not the result of energy-dependent or microtubule-dependent reaction pro-cesses. The number and the state of Con A receptors on the cell surface were in a dynamic condition, their conformation, orientation, and/or topographical distribution changing under different conditions...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveIn a rat <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (MIA) -induced {{arthritis}} model, {{the amount}} of MIA commonly used was too high, resulting in rapid bone destruction. We examined the effect of MIA concentrations on articular cartilage and infrapatellar fat pad (IFP). We also established an original system for “macroscopic cartilage and bone score” and “IFP inflammation score” specific to the rat MIA-induced arthritis model. DesignMale Wistar rats received a single intra-articular injection of MIA in the knee. The amount of MIA was 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5, and 1  mg respectively. Articular cartilage was evaluated at 2 – 12 weeks. IFP was also observed at 3 – 14 days. ResultsMacroscopically, low MIA doses induced punctate depressions on the cartilage surface, and cartilage erosion proceeded slowly over 12 weeks, while higher MIA doses already induced cartilage erosion at 2 weeks, followed by bone destruction. MIA macroscopic cartilage and bone score, OARSI histological score, and Mankin score increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IFP inflammation score peaked at 5 days in low dose groups, then decreased, while in high dose groups, the IFP score continued to increase over 14 days due to IFP fibrosis. ConclusionsPunctate depressions, cartilage erosion, and bone destruction were observed in the MIA-induced arthritis model. The macroscopic cartilage and bone scoring enabled the quantification of cartilage degeneration and demonstrated that MIA-induced arthritis progressed in a dose- and time-dependent manner. IFP inflammation scores revealed that 0. 2  mg MIA induced reversible synovitis, while 1  mg MIA induced fibrosis of the IFP body...|$|E

40|$|The {{condensation}} of retinene 1 with opsin to form rhodopsin is optimal at pH about 6, a pH which {{favors the}} condensation of retinene 1 with sulfhydryl {{rather than with}} amino groups. The synthesis of rhodopsin, though unaffected by the less powerful sulfhydryl reagents, <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and its amide, is inhibited completely by p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). This inhibition is reversed {{in part by the}} addition of glutathione. PCMB does not attack rhodopsin itself, nor does it react with retinene 1. Its action in this system is confined to the —SH groups of opsin. Under some conditions the synthesis of rhodopsin is aided by the presence of such a sulfhydryl compound as glutathione, which helps to keep the —SH groups of opsin free and reduced. By means of the amperometric silver titration of Kolthoff and Harris, it is shown that sulfhydryl groups are liberated in the bleaching of rhodopsin, two such groups for each retinene 1 molecule that appears. This is true equally of rhodopsin from the retinas of cattle, frogs) and squid. The exposure of new sulfhydryl groups adds an important element to the growing evidence that relates the bleaching of rhodopsin to protein denaturation. The place of sulfhydryl groups in the structure of rhodopsin is still uncertain. They may be concerned directly in binding the chromophore to opsin; or alternatively they may furnish hydrogen atoms for some reductive change by which the chromophore is formed from retinene 1. In the amperometric silver titration, the bleaching of rhodopsin yields directly an electrical variation. This phenomenon may have some fundamental connection with the role of rhodopsin in visual excitation, and may provide a model of the excitation process in general...|$|E

Veratrine-like contractions were evoked by glycerine and formaldehyde. 3. Veratrine contraction was obviated by lowering the temperature and facilitated by raising it. An intimate relations between the effective minimal dosis of veratrine and temperature were noted. 4. Veratrine contraction was depressed or abolished by calcium or potassium chlorides. Relations between threshold concentration of veratrine and calcium or potassium chlorides were determined. 5. Acidity inhibited the occurrence of veratrine contraction, alkalinity facilitated it. 6. Height of contraction of veratrinised muscle was higher than normal muscle, in twitch as welt as in tetanus. Refractory period of veratrine muscle was greatly prolonged and found in the descending phase of veratrine contraction. 7. Quinine obviated veratrine contraction.

The activity of Lubrol-PX-solu-bilized acetylcholinesterase was broadly distributed in the fractions having VtjVa = 1. 0 - 2. 0 in gel filtration on a Sepharose 6 B column. The intermediary fractions (VJV 0 = 1. 3 - 1. 7) were collected as "the middle active Sepharose 6 B eluate " and characterized {{on the basis of}} enzymology and protein chemistry. When this eluate was treated with Pi-specific phospholipase C, the major activity peak was obtained in the later fractions with VJV 0 = 1. 75 - 2. 0 on the same column chromatography. Lubrol-solubilized and phospholipase C-treated acetylcholinesterase preparations were different in the thermostability, the elution profiles of chromatography on Mono Q, butyl-Toyopearl and phenyl-Sepharose columns, and the affinity to phos-pholipid micelles. On treatment with Pi-specific phospholipase C, Lubrol-solubilized acetylcholinesterase became more thermostable. The phospholipase C-treated enzyme was eluted at lower NaCl concentration from the Mono Q column than the Lubrol-solubilized enzyme. The most important difference was observed in the hydrophobicity of these two enzyme preparations. The Lubrol-solubilized enzyme shows high affinity to phospholipid micelles and hydrophobic adsorbents such as butyl-Toyopearl and phenyl-Sepharose. However, this hydrophobicity was lost when acetylcholinesterase was solubilized from bovine erythrocyte membrane by Pi-specific phospholipase C. The presence of myo-inositol was confirmed in the purified preparation of acetylcholinesterase by gas chromatography (GC) -mass spectrometry (MS). Furthermore, the monomeric form of acetylcholinesterase was directly released from erythrocyte ghosts by phospholipase C, after reduction with 2 -mercaptoethanol and alkylation with <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> These results indicate that the diacylglycerol moiety of the PI molecule in Lubrol-solubilized and mem-brane-bound acetylcholinesterase plays a role as a hydrophobic anchor binding thi...|$|E
40|$|Recently, naringinase {{preparations}} of molds such as Asp. niger and Asp. usamii mut. shirousamii {{were brought}} to market in Japan. Since the enzyme hydrolyses naringin, a bitter substance in fruits of Natsudaidai or grapefruit, the preparation is employed for removing bitterness in processing of the fruits. According to Okada et al. and Takiguchi, naringin (naringenin- 7 -rhamnoglucoside) is hydrolysed by releasing rhamnose and glucose as shown in Scheme 1. Therefore, it might be understood that naringinase action is retarded by rhamnose or grucose, as established by several authors. Natsudaidai contains sucrose and fructose as well as glucose. In addition, sugar was often supplemented in processing of the fruits to sweetening the products. Therefore, {{in order to obtain}} helpful data to employment of the enzyme preparation, the influence of several kinds of sugar on naringinase was investigated. Enzymatic activity was assayed by determining hydrolysis of naringin which was colorimetrically estimated by Davis 2 ̆ 7 method using diethyleneglycol and sodium hydroxide. Naringinase was strongly inhibited by rhamnose or glucose of low concentration. Inhibiting rate of rhamnose was more or less higher than that of glucose. With galactose or mannose, hydrolysis of naringin was also retarded, even with less extent than with rhamnose or glucose. In this case, galactose has a little higher ability to inhibit the enzyme than mannose has. By xylose too, naringinase was inhibited in about the same extent with mannose. Similar degree of inhibition of naringinase was observed with fructose and sucrose which are natively contained in the fruits. Sorbitol has lesser ability to reduce naringinase activity, while least inhibition was estimated with ascorbic acid. Inhibition of naringinase by a mixture of sucrose and sorbitol was also estimated in order to examine whether or not sorbitol is useful to substitution for sucrose accompanying lesser inhibiting rate. These influence could be compared by consulting the inhibiting rates in Tables and the slope of straight lines of V/Vi plotted to concentration of sugars. When glucose had been transformed into glucosoxime, enhancement of inhibiting rate of glucose on naringinase was estimated. On the contrary, inhibition was reduced with glucosamine to the level by galactose. No alteration in inhibiting rates, however, was established, if galactos- or mannosoxime was substituted for galactose or mannose. Carbonyl reagents such as hydroxylamine and hydrazine had no effect on naringinase, whose activity was reduced by SH reagents, <b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and PCMB, of low concentration. Incidentally, some inhibition with α-ketoglutaric acid was observed, but not with acetaldehyde.

40|$|Transglutaminases (EC 2. 3. 2. 13) are a {{group of}} thiol enzymes that {{catalyse}} acyl-transfer reaction in which the gamma-carboxyamide groups of peptide-bound glutaminyl residues are the acyl donors. They cause post-translational modification of proteins mainly by protein to protein cross-linking, but also through acyl transfer reaction and deamidation of glutamine residues. Crude liver and flesh extracts of bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) were investigated to ascertain the effects of storage time and temperature on the stability and activity of transglutaminase (TGase). TGase activity was measured and the enzyme was subsequently characterized using CBZ-L-glutaminylglycine and hydroxylamine as substrates. Frozen bluefish liver and flesh extracts had higher specific activities (0. 321 Units and 0. 230 Units respectively) in comparison to refrigerated liver and flesh extracts (0. 124 Units and 0. 071 Units respectively) {{at the end of}} a 30 day storage period with the frozen liver extract retaining the highest stability. The optimum temperature for the crude bluefish liver TGase reaction with CBZ-L-glutaminylglycine and hydroxylamine was between 40 °C and 45 °C. The enzyme was stable at temperatures below 55 °C, beyond which it lost activity progressively. The crude enzyme extract was active within the pH range of 6. 0 - 7. 5, with an optimum pH of 7. 0, and was stable from pH 6. 5 - 8. 0. TGase was partially purified from the frozen liver extract of bluefish by gel filtration on 8 ephacryl S- 200 HR. The partially purified extract was further characterized with respect to its response to temperature and pH. The effects of sodium as well as calcium chloride and other divalent cations, and the inhibitory effects of various chemicals on the activity of the partially purified TGase were also investigated. The partially purified bluefish TGase had an optimum temperature of 40 °C via the reaction with CBZ-L-glutaminylglycine and hydroxylamine. The enzyme was observed to be stable at temperatures below 50 °C and approximately 90 % of the initial TGase activity was retained {{at the end of a}} 30 min incubation period. The partially purified bluefish TGase had a pH optimum of pH 7. 5 and was stable within a narrow pH range of 7. 0 - 8. 0. The partially purified enzyme showed requirement for calcium (Ca 2 +) ions for activity and no activity was observed in the absence of Ca 2 +. The replacement of Ca 2 + by other divalent cations such as Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ba 2 +, Zn 2 + and Fe 2 + produced various levels of activity with the enzyme, albeit less than that achieved with Ca 2 +. Increasing NaCl concentrations, 0 - 15 mM, did not seem to have an enhancing effect on the activity of partially purified bluefish TGase. TGase was inhibited by sulfhydryl alkylating agents (<b>monoiodoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (IAA) and N'-ethylmaleimide (NEM)) ...|$|E
