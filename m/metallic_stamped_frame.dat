An existing engraving of Washington made for use on the Washington-Franklin issue was used. That engraving, done by Marcus Baldwin, was modeled from a bust made by Clark Mills in 1853, which, in turn, was a reproduction of a bust sculpted by Jean Antoine Houdon at Washington's Mount Vernon home in 1785.

5000|$|A [...] "Shooting Star" [...] Birkin has a {{metallic}} image resembling a shooting star, stamped {{adjacent to the}} [...] "Hermès, Paris Made in France" [...] stamp, that is in gold or silver to match the hardware and embossing. Rarely, the stamp is blind or colourless, if the bag is made {{of one or two}} leathers onto which no <b>metallic</b> <b>stamping</b> is used. Sometimes, Birkins or other Hermès bags may be made by independent artisans for [...] "personal use", but only once a year. Every bag bears the stamp of the artisan who made the bag. These identifications vary widely, but are not different for every bag made. Finding stamps of more than one artisan on a bag occurs because the stamp is not a serial reference. Fonts and the order of stamping may vary, depending on the artisans.|$|R

50|$|Unusually, all the WLAs {{produced}} after Pearl Harbor, {{regardless of}} the actual year, would be given serial numbers indicating 1942 production. Thus, war-time machines would {{come to be known}} as 42WLAs. This may have been in recognition of the use of the continued use of the same specification. Most WLCs were produced in 1943, and are marked 43WLC. The precise serial number, as well as casting marks, can be used to date a specific motor accurately, and some other parts bear year and month <b>stamps.</b> <b>Frames</b> and many other parts were not tagged with the serial number, and cannot generally be dated.

40|$|While {{automatic}} hot embossing {{systems are}} available for large- and small-scale productions of polymeric devices, one of the process challenges remains to be the manufacturing of precise, durable, and yet inexpensive hot embossing stamps. The use of <b>metallic</b> <b>stamps</b> manufactured by electroplating a photoresist pattern or by precision milling and their replication into silicone molds with UV-lithography, electroplating, and molding techniques is state of the art. Yet, there have been few, if any, thriving attempts to directly emboss polymers by means of bare photoresists, and in particular polyimide-based photoresists, without transferring the photoresist patterns into a different stamp material. We conduct a proof-of-concept by developing hot embossing stamps based on photosensitive polyimide. We focus primarily on {{the reliability of the}} aforementioned stamps throughout the hot embossing cycle and the fidelity of pattern transfer onto polymeric films for different microstructural patterns. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R

40|$|Controlled growth, {{patterning}} {{and placement}} of carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films for electronic applications are demonstrated. The density of CNT films {{is controlled by}} optimizing the feed gas composition {{as well as the}} concentration of growth catalyst in a chemical vapor deposition process. Densities of CNTs ranging from 0. 02 CNTs/μm^ 2 to 1. 29 CNTs/μm^ 2 are obtained. The resulting pristine CNT thin films are then successfully patterned using either pre-growth or post-growth techniques. By developing a layered photoresist process that is compatible with ferric nitrate catalyst, significant improvements over popular pre-growth patterning methods are obtained. Limitations of traditional post-growth patterning methods are circumvented by selective transfer printing of CNTs with either thermoplastic or <b>metallic</b> <b>stamps.</b> Resulting as-grown patterns of CNT thin films have edge roughness (< 1 μm) and resolution (< 5 μm) comparable to standard photolithography. Bottom gate CNT thin film devices are fabricated with field-effect mobilities up to 20 cm^ 2 /Vs and on/off ratios of the order of 10 ^ 3. The patterning and transfer printing methods discussed here have a potential to be generalized to include other nanomaterials in new device configurations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Metallic glasses often undergo glass {{transitions}} {{at temperature}} Tg well below their crystallisation temperature T x and thus possess so-called super-cooled liquid temperature range ∆T = T x –Tg {{to which they}} can be heated in principle without crystallization. Metallic glass heated to its ∆T regime can be pressed onto a warm substrate to engrave selected patterns. The metallic glass surface then takes on a surface pattern that is the negative of that on the substrate. Subse-quently the initial pattern on the substrate can be reproduced on a third target surface at room temperature by cold pressing (punching) the negative pattern on the metallic glass surface onto the target surface. We report the transfer of arbitrary motifs initially on WC or Ni hard surfaces onto Al thin foils via creation of the negative of the pattern on a <b>metallic</b> glass <b>stamp</b> used for punching. 1...|$|R

50|$|The grid in {{the first}} triode valve {{consisted}} of a zig-zag piece of wire placed between the filament and the anode. This quickly evolved into a helix or cylindrical screen of fine wire placed between a single strand filament (or later, a cylindrical cathode) and a cylindrical anode. The grid is usually made of a very thin wire that can resist high temperatures and is not prone to emitting electrons itself. Molybdenum alloy with a gold plating is frequently used. It is wound on soft copper sideposts, which are swaged over the grid windings to hold them in place. A 1950s variation is the frame grid, which winds very fine wire onto a rigid <b>stamped</b> metal <b>frame.</b> This allows the holding of very close tolerances, so the grid can be placed closer to the filament (or cathode).|$|R
5000|$|By 1943, a {{prototype}} was rapidly developed with off-the-shelf LMCO components.

Both were mounted on a <b>stamped</b> steel <b>frame.</b> An LMCO 801 field coil compression driver with a 1.75" [...] diaphragm was used as is for HF reproduction and mounted coaxially {{to the back of}} the 287 motor. A horn throat from the 801 penetrated the center of the LF field coil and exited into a small multicellular horn mounted in front of the LF cone. The horn was designed with a cut-off frequency of 900 Hz and the system was set with a crossover frequency of 1200 Hz.|$|R
5000|$|The {{postage stamps}} issued in the 1870s and 1880s are collectively {{known as the}} [...] "Bank Notes" [...] because they were {{produced}} by the National Bank Note Company, the Continental Bank Note Company, then the American Bank Note Company. After the 1869 fiasco with pictorial stamp issues, the new Postmaster-General decided to base a series of stamps on the [...] "heads, in profile, of distinguished deceased Americans" [...] using [...] "marble busts of acknowledged excellence" [...] as models. George Washington was returned to the normal-letter-rate stamp: he had played that role in the issues of 1851 and 1861 and would {{continue to do so}} in every subsequent definitive set until the Presidential Series of 1938. But the large banknotes did not represent a total retreat to past practices, for the range of celebrated Americans was widened beyond Franklin and various presidents to include notables such as Henry Clay and Oliver Hazard Perry. Moreover, while images of statesmen had provided the only pictorial content of pre-1869 issues, the large banknotes did not entirely exclude other representative images. Two denominations of the series accompanied their portraits with iconographic images appropriate to the statesmen they honored: rifles, a cannon and cannonballs appeared in the bottom corners of the 24-cent issue devoted to General Winfield Scott, while the 90-cent <b>stamp</b> <b>framed</b> Admiral Oliver Perry within a nautically hitched oval of rope and included anchors in the bottom corners of its design. National first printed these, then in 1873 Continental received the contract—and the plates that National used. Continental added secret marks to the plates of the lower values, distinguishing them from the previous issues. The American Bank Note Company acquired Continental in 1879 and took over the contract, printing similar designs on softer papers and with some color changes. Major redesigning, however, came only in 1890, when the American Bank Note Company issued a new series in which stamp-size was reduced by about 10% (the so-called [...] "Small Bank Notes").|$|R
