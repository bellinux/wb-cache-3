5000|$|Since that time, the mizpah {{has come}} to connote an {{emotional}} bond between people who are separated (either physically or by death). Mizpah jewelry is often made {{in the form of}} a coin-shaped pendant cut in two with a zig-zag line bearing the words [...] "The LORD watch between <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>thee,</b> when we are absent one from another" [...] (Genesis 31:49). This is worn to signify the bond. Additionally, the word [...] "mizpah" [...] can often be found on headstones in cemeteries and on other memorials. From Genesis 31:49 of the Bible:And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>thee,</b> when we are absent one from another.|$|R

[...] "I went ahead with my education, got my start in life, then Father died, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> took up his burdens. Circumstances made <b>me</b> <b>and</b> crushed <b>you.</b> That's all there is about that. Luck made <b>me</b> <b>and</b> cheated <b>you.</b> It ain't right." ...|$|R
25|$|Crosby also {{released}} {{a span of}} solo albums entitled Generica with him and an acoustic guitar throughout 2007 and 2008, culminating in a collection in 2009. The music would later find its way onto VAST albums being reworked into a full-band setting on future release <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
25|$|VAST's {{sound is}} {{identifiable}} as ambient electro-rock with considerable industrial and acoustic influences, usually made with Crosby's traditional acoustic guitar, electronic instruments and processing, drum-driven tracks, and heavy bass. Vocally similarities range from classic rock to post-grunge. In recent years, however, VAST's sound {{has been more}} identifiable with acoustic rock in releases such as April and <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>You.</b>|$|E
25|$|In both test {{settings}} and conversations Genie still sometimes reversed I and you, my and your, and <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you,</b> {{but during the}} summer of 1974 she began to show definite improvement in both her comprehension and production of first and second person pronouns. In August she started to demonstrate the ability to modify first subject and then object pronouns. By mid-1975, her confusion of me versus you and my versus your was much less frequent. Curtiss also noted Genie starting to use the benefactive case during this time, although she did not always include the word for.|$|E

For two thousand years, Kallikrates, have I waited for <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> now at length thou hast come back to me; and as for this woman," [...] pointing to the corpse, [...] "she stood between <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>and</b> therefore have I laid her in the dust, Kallikrates." ...|$|R
25|$|Attestations of Old Dutch {{sentences}} {{are extremely}} rare. The language is mostly recorded on fragmentary relics, and words have been reconstructed from Middle Dutch and loan words from Old Dutch in other languages. The oldest recorded {{is found in}} the Salic law. In this Frankish document written around 510 the oldest Dutch sentence has been identified: Maltho thi afrio lito ("I say to you, I free you, serf") used to free a serf. Another old fragment of Dutch is Visc flot aftar themo uuatare ("A fish was swimming in the water"). The oldest conserved larger Dutch text is the Utrecht baptismal vow (776–800) starting with Forsachistu diobolae... ec forsacho diabolae ("Do you forsake the devil?... I forsake the devil"). If only for its poetic content, the most famous Old Dutch sentence is probably Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan, hinase hic enda tu, wat unbidan we nu ("All birds have started making nests, except <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you,</b> what are we waiting for"), is dated to around the year 1100, written by a Flemish monk in a convent in Rochester, England. Since the sentence speaks to the imagination, it is often erroneously stated as the oldest Dutch sentence.|$|E
500|$|The {{equality}} {{of their marriage}} was dramatically underscored {{towards the end of}} 2004, when Den, as a sign of faith and in an effort to win back her sympathies, revealed to Chrissie his plans to reclaim The Queen Victoria public house by scamming the rival Mitchell family: [...] "If you ever needed proof that we're in this together or how badly I need you in my life, this is it. I wasn't going to show this to another soul, but I'm showing you because you're my wife; because it's <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> together." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you hold <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> love me..." [...] That {{was the last thing}} you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E

500|$|... "1+1" [...] {{begins with}} a low {{fidelity}} indie rock arrangement which is brought about by distorted guitar arpeggios and a discreet pipe organ. Beyoncé sings a meandering melody as she alternately references the pleasures of love and sex. Using simple arithmetic to describe her undying love for her partner, she begins the first verse as she affirms to her romantic interest {{that the only thing}} she is sure about is her feelings for him, [...] "I don't know much about algebra, but I know that one plus one equals two ... If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn / 'Cause I got it with you". In the pre-chorus lines, Beyoncé expresses her reliance on her man without whom she believes to be incomplete as she sings, [...] "And it's <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you,</b> that's all we'll have when the world is through / Because baby we ain't got nothing without love / Darling, you got enough love for the both of us".|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we do (what we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E
500|$|Track five is an {{interlude}} {{which is}} another medley titled [...] "The First Noel" [...] / [...] "Born Is the King". [...] "The First Noel" [...] section [...] is a soulful down-tempo song which consists of Carey delivering a piano-and-voice epilogue backed by an 808 drum machine, while [...] "Born Is the King" [...] {{is a piece of}} [...] "pure baby-making magic", according to Juzwiak. [...] "When Christmas Comes" [...] is a soul song with elements of R the instrumental consists of horns, including the trumpet performed by Rick Baptist and Greg Adams, and the trombone by Nick Lane. Other brass instruments include Dan Higgins on the sax and flute. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "giving the gift of love", as Carey sings [...] "And <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> gon' have ourselves a holiday/ And we don't need nobody else to celebrate/ And we're gon' kiss our worries and our cares away/ I can't wait/ Because this Christmas time, get together / It's gonna be so nice, better than ever/ And baby you’re the one, special treasure." ...|$|E

500|$|It as an R-influenced soul {{song with}} a [...] "simple groove" [...] that lasts for a {{duration}} of four minutes and forty-six seconds. The single release version with Legend lasts for additional second. The instrumental consists of horns, including the trumpet performed by Rick Baptist and Greg Adams, and the trombone by Nick Lane. Other brass instruments include Dan Higgins on the sax and flute. In {{addition to being}} a producer, Poyser performs the keyboard. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "giving the gift of love", as Carey and Legend harmonize the lyrics [...] "And <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> gon' have ourselves a holiday/ And we don't need nobody else to celebrate/ And we're gon' kiss our worries and our cares away/ I can't wait/ Because this Christmas time, get together / It's gonna be so nice, better than ever/ And baby you’re the one, special treasure." [...] Prior to the final chorus, the pair freelance the a portion of the lyrics from [...] "Jingle Bells". As noted by Scott Shelter of PopCrush, [...] "listeners are treated to notes from the upper reaches of Mariah’s five-octave range, which she rarely shows off anymore." [...] In an interview for Vevo, Carey stated that she felt that Legend was the [...] "perfect choice" [...] to re-create the song as a duet with, and that his [...] "soulful" [...] creative decisions [...] "took it up several notches".|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget About Us" [...] is a mid-tempo song lasting {{three minutes}} and fifty-three seconds, while drawing {{influence}} from pop and R with downtempo beats music genres. Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, and {{produced by the}} former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together". According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of G minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F6. Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a [...] "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to [...] "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings, [...] "You just let it die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding, [...] "There's only one <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny", indicating that while {{they are no longer}} together, she will continue to cherish the memory of them and how strong their love was. According to Carey, she refrained from giving away too much of the song's lyrical meaning, in order to allow fans to possibly interpret the song in their own way: ...|$|E
