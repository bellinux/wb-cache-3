5|$|The {{series is}} {{distinguished}} by its art style, which emulates manga and anime. According to Baba, the character designs are created once the main character's story, personality, and environment {{are determined by}} the rest of the production team. Beyond that, the artist is allowed to use their imagination, though they can be asked to alter things like costume details, and facial expressions. One of the main designers for the series is manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima. He was first brought in to design the characters for Phantasia, and has since designed for <b>multiple</b> <b>entries</b> including Abyss and Xillia. Another designer, Mutsumi Inomata, first designed for the series with Destiny, and has contributed designs for <b>multiple</b> <b>entries</b> including Eternia, Rebirth and Xillia. A third regular artist is Daigo Okumura, who designed characters for Vesperia and Xillia 2, as well as Dawn of the New World. Other designers to work on the series include Kazuto Nakazawa (Legendia), Kouichi Kimura (Xillia 2), and Minoru Iwamoto (Zestiria). The art design for each game's world and characters has ranged between a cel-shaded anime style (Vesperia) to a more realistic style (Xillia 2). Skit character images are also directly inspired by anime art. The art style for each title is determined by the theme and story decided upon by the developers.|$|E

500|$|While {{keeping a}} lower profile in English-speaking regions, in Japan, it is {{regarded}} as one of the biggest role-playing video game series. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, speaking in 2001, referred to it as the third biggest RPG series in Japan behind Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Gamasutra's Brandon Sheffield echoed these sentiments, stating that [...] "While the series doesn't have quite the cultural cache of Final Fantasy in the West or Dragon Quest in Japan, it's still a very popular brand worldwide". IGN's Anoop Gantayat additionally referred to it as the third biggest Japanese role-playing series in regards to sales. <b>Multiple</b> <b>entries</b> in the series, notably Destiny and Legendia have been favorably compared with fighting games and brawlers, especially the Street Fighter series. GameTrailers ranked the Linear Motion Battle System, with particular reference to Graces, as one of the top five JRPG battle systems. Their stories and characters have generally received a more mixed response from western critics: opinions on entries such as Legendia, Abyss, Xillia were mixed to positive, while others such as Symphonia, Graces and Xillia 2 were criticized. The main criticism for these games and Legendia was that the story was either predictable or cliché. The in-game graphics have also drawn mixed responses for several games in the series, including Destiny, Eternia, Graces and Xillia.|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} {{are present in}} <b>multiple</b> <b>entries</b> of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both Mother and EarthBound. The alien creature's emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in Mother and has no appearance but as an [...] "indescribable" [...] force in EarthBound final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through {{a tour de force}} of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, EarthBound final fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" [...] with noted emotional impact. This battle's dialogue was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for 1UP.com that Itoi intended to show the alien's yearning for love in [...] "a manner ... beyond human understanding". Despite EarthBound and Mother 3 dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man's head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of 1UP.com considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the Mother series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness's child neighbor who [...] "cowers" [...] and [...] "refuses to fight" [...] in EarthBound, but grows into a [...] "vicious control freak with no regard for human life", Porky, {{by the end of the}} series' Mother 3.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, the Grete Herballs {{numerous}} woodcuts {{are taken}} from Le Grant Herbier, but like the text these images are not original to the French Herbier. They are in fact copies {{of a series of}} woodcuts which first appeared in the German Herbarius zu Teutsch (also known as Der Gart). In the Grete Herball the same woodcut image is often reused for <b>multiple</b> <b>entries.</b> By most accounts, these images became much degraded between their original use in Herbarius and their subsequent recycling in the Grete Herball. Woodcuts were expensive to acquire, and like other printers of his time Peter Treveris would reuse them in later books.

2500|$|Theories {{derived from}} early unilingual {{research}} relied mainly upon generalizations without precise specification {{of how these}} specific systems of lexical access works. Due {{to the advancement of}} medical science within the last decade, the field of Psycholinguistics has evolved immensely, resulting in more detailed research and therefore, {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms behind language production. [...] "Many early studies of second language acquisition focused on the morphosyntactic development of learners, and the general findings was that bound morphemes appear in the same order in the first and second language"(Bardovi-Harlig 1999. In addition, [...] "second language learners are also able to produce and process simple sentences before complex sentences" [...] (Pienemann et al.2005), just like first language learners. For example, the theory of serial search models and parallel access models. Serial Search Models propose that when monolinguals encounter a word, they will look through all the lexical entries to distinguish whether the input item is a word not, and then they will only retrieve the necessary information about that word (i.e., its semantics or orthography). They also propose that the lexical access would process sequentially by activating only one lexical entry at a time. In contrast, the Parallel Access Models believe that <b>multiple</b> <b>entries</b> can be activated at once, which means that the perceptual input from a word would activate all lexical items directly, even though some of them might not be necessary. In this way, numbers of potential candidates would be activated simultaneously and then the lexical candidates which are most consistent with the input stimulus would be chosen. [...] Later, the researchers addressed that both the serial and parallel process are accounted for the lexical organization and lexical access.|$|E
