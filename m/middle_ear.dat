5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> by the eardrum. The <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and {{is connected to the}} throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the inner ear, the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{and the outer}} ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E
5|$|Sound waves {{travel through}} the outer ear, are {{modulated}} by the <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear. This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain, where it is registered as sound.|$|E
5000|$|Land {{vertebrates}} evolved <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> independently in each major lineage, and {{are this}} {{the result of}} parallel evolution. The configurations of the <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy. Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw. Furthermore, {{it is apparent that}} the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.|$|R
5000|$|She {{has also}} used her powers {{to create a}} [...] "cutting" [...] effect by {{refining}} {{the force of the}} wind. When at close range, she can also compress air into a person's ear to disrupt their <b>middle</b> <b>ear's</b> equilibrium thereby disturbing their balance.|$|R
40|$|We {{transformed}} a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolate with a plasmid containing the luxCDABE operon {{driven by the}} H. influenzae outer membrane protein P 2 promoter. Herein, we demonstrate the ability to detect bioluminescence and to monitor infection within the nasopharynges, eustachian tubes, and <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of chinchillas after intranasal and transbullar challenges...|$|R
5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{lies between}} the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. <b>Middle</b> <b>ear</b> anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis. In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
40|$|A 7 -week-old male Saker falcon {{died with}} a history of severe {{refractory}} dyspnoea and respiratory signs. Microscopical lesions included moderate to severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> conjunctivae, third eyelids, choanae, salivary glands of the tongue, turbinates, larynx, trachea, syrinx and bronchi. The lesions were associated with variable numbers of Cryptosporidium spp., further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and in-situ hybridization. Cryptosporidium baileyi was identified by DNA sequence analysis. C. baileyi may therefore be a cause of otitis media in raptors as it is in man. It is most likely that the <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> of the Saker falcon acquired the infection through the eustachian tubes that originate near the pharynx in the oral cavity. This is the first description of otitis media associated with C. baileyi in a bird or a mammal except man...|$|R
25|$|Ears and sinuses: There {{is a risk}} of {{stretched}} or burst eardrums, usually crushed inwards during descent {{but sometimes}} stretched outwards on ascent. The diver can {{use a variety of}} methods to let air into or out of the <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> via the Eustachian tubes. Sometimes swallowing will open the Eustachian tubes and equalise the ears.|$|R
50|$|The SoundBite Hearing System is a non-surgical and {{removable}} {{bone conduction}} hearing prosthetic device that re-routes sound through the teeth and skull bone {{directly to the}} functioning inner ear or cochlea. By-passing problems in the outer and <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> entirely. For patients suffering from single-sided deafness, SoundBite re-routes sound from the deaf side, to the functioning cochlea, by-passing the non-hearing side.|$|R
5|$|<b>Middle</b> <b>ear</b> - In crown-group mammals, {{sound is}} carried from the eardrum by {{a chain of}} three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the {{articular}} and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids.|$|E
5|$|The dentary {{gradually}} became the main bone {{of the lower}} jaw which, by the Triassic, progressed towards the fully mammalian jaw (the lower consisting only of the dentary) and <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct the jaws of reptiles).|$|E
5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> is {{supplied}} by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery, {{a branch of the}} maxillary artery. Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, internal carotid artery, and the artery of the pterygoid canal.|$|E
50|$|Barotrauma is {{the injury}} to the tissues of air filled spaces in the body {{as a result of}} {{differences}} in pressure between the body spaces and the ambient atmospheric pressure. Air filled spaces include the <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> paranasal sinuses, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. One would be predisposed by a pre-existing upper respiratory infection, nasal allergies, recurrent changing pressures, dehydration, or a poor equalizing technique.|$|R

To {{evaluate the}} surgical prevalence based {{on the type of}} ST. To calculate the sensibility and positive predictive value (PPV) of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans for ST involvement by cholesteatoma. To evaluate the morphology of the sinus tympani (ST) based on computed tomography (CT) scans (axial view), describing the findings in a cohort of 148 patients (296 ears), and classifying the prevalence according to our ST classification. To evaluate the surgical prevalence based on the type of ST. To calculate the sensibility and positive predictive value (PPV) of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans for ST involvement by cholesteatoma. Methods: Retrospective review of the radiologic database and surgical reports. Results: In total, 98 / 296 (33. 1 %) <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> presented a radiologic morphology Type A; 185 / 296 (62. 5 %) <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> presented a radiologic morphology Type B; 13 / 296 (4. 4 %) <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> presented a radiologic morphology Type C; HRCT showed a sensibility of 91 %, specificity of 65 %, PPV of 68 % and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90 %. Conclusions: ST shape and depth can influence surgical preference in cholesteatoma surgery. In the case of a shallower ST, an exclusive endoscopic exploration is chosen; whereas {{in the case of a}} deeper ST, a retrofacial approach is usually preferred. HRCT scans demonstrated high sensibility and NPV for ST involvement by cholesteatoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural history}} of {{infection}} with Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica in domestic rabbits was studied prospectively at a commercial rabbitry. At weaning, about 25 % of rabbits had nasal infections with P. multocida and 75 % had infections with B. bronchiseptica. Infection of weanling rabbits paralleled nasal infections of their dams. The proportion of rabbits with both infections increased with age. At 2 to 4 months old, about 50 % of rabbits with P. multocida or P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica infections had upper respiratory disease (URD), whereas rabbits with B. bronchiseptica infection had no disease. In rabbits about 10 months old, 75 % with P. multocida or P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica infections had URD, whereas virtually none with B. bronchiseptica infection had disease. Disease of the nares, paranasal sinuses, <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> and lungs was associated with P. multocida and not B. bronchiseptica infection. In adult rabbits with nasal P. multocida infection, with or without signs of URD, about 80 % had concurrent infection of the paranasal sinuses and <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> and 20 % had infection of the bronchi and lungs. In rabbits without nasal P. multocida infection, 20 to 35 % had P. multocida infection of the paranasal sinuses and <b>middle</b> <b>ears.</b> Weanling rabbits with and without P. multocida infection had similar immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. In rabbits observed prospectively, the only antibody differences between those transiently and persistently infected with P. multocida were a diminished IgA response in nasal lavages and an earlier IgM response in sera of transiently infected rabbits. IgG levels increased with the duration of infection. There was no relationship between immunoglobulin levels and freedom from P. multocida infection...|$|R
5|$|The {{porpoise}} ear has specific {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{works as an}} impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E
5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
40|$|Guinea pigs {{were treated}} with anti-CD 18 {{antibody}} (M 8), and subsequently <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> (ME) were infected with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. Forty-eight hours after infection, the ME washes of these animals had significantly lower polymorphonuclear leukocyte numbers but higher bacterial counts compared with washes of animals treated with control antibody (M 11) or saline. The edema and epithelial damage of ME tissues correlated directly with polymorphonuclear leukocyte numbers and not bacterial counts...|$|R
50|$|Due {{to changes}} in facial structures, infants, toddlers, and {{children}} with distal 18q- often have poor drainage from the <b>middle</b> <b>ears,</b> leading to a build-up of fluid. This can in turn lead to recurrent ear and sinus infections. Antibiotics are typically required to treat these infections. In addition, the diagnosis of ear infections in children with 18q- is frequently complicated by stenosis or atresia of the ear canals, a common finding in people with distal 18q-.|$|R

5|$|Clindamycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum implies the existence of a sensitive <b>middle</b> <b>ear.</b> It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the <b>middle</b> <b>ears.</b> Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo is a problem {{in a part of the}} vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.|$|R
50|$|Early archaeocetes such as Pakicetus had {{the nasal}} {{openings}} {{at the end}} of the snout, but in later species such as Rodhocetus, the openings had begun to drift toward the top of the skull. This is known as nasal drift. The nostrils of modern cetaceans have become modified into blowholes that allow them to break to the surface, inhale, and submerge with convenience. The ears began to move inward as well, and, in the case of Basilosaurus, the <b>middle</b> <b>ears</b> began to receive vibrations from the lower jaw. Today's modern toothed whales use their melon organ, a pad of fat, for echolocation.|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that infectious catarrh {{of the rat}} is caused by Gram-negative coccobacilliform bodies which resemble the agents of fowl coryza and mouse catarrh. These bodies were demonstrable microscopically in at least 90 per cent of the exudates from the nasal passages and <b>middle</b> <b>ears.</b> The characteristic syndrome was reproduced in selected rats by the nasal instillation of pure tissue culture growths and was maintained for 10 successive passages by the injection of exudate. The experimentally produced disease was also communicable by direct contact. The biological characteristics of the specific bodies are discussed {{in relation to the}} organisms of the pleuropneumonia group...|$|R
5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, the <b>middle</b> <b>ear</b> {{works as an}} impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the <b>middle</b> <b>ear,</b> river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{structures}} in Haemophilus influenzae {{are subject to}} rapid ON/OFF switching of expression, a process termed phase variation.
