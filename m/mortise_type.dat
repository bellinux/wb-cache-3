5000|$|Electric strikes can be {{differentiated}} in {{a number}} of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. [...] The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim Panic Exit Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the dead bolt is thrown and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the spring latching capability of the other lock sets). <b>Mortise</b> <b>type</b> locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.|$|E
5000|$|The lockset's {{latching}} (resp., locking) mechanism {{may be of}} the <b>mortise</b> or cylindrical <b>type.</b> The <b>mortise</b> mechanism {{resides in}} a (usually metal) box, requiring for installation a rectangular cavity mortised into the door. The cylindrical mechanism is typically installed into the door via a cavity that can be simply bored into the door, say with a hole saw.|$|R
5000|$|For cutting small mortises, {{a normal}} drill bit can be used. However, for larger <b>mortises,</b> a common <b>type</b> of bit in modern mortisers is a Harry Watt square drill bit, {{in which a}} bit with a Reuleaux {{triangle}} cross section is allowed to [...] "wobble" [...] while it rotates within a square with rounded corners. This type of bit removes all but {{the corners of the}} material to be removed, leaving very little to be cut by the chisel.|$|R

A famous example of Chinese construction is the Great Wall of China built between the 7th and 2nd centuries BC. The Great Wall was built with rammed earth, stones, and wood and later bricks and tiles with lime mortar. Wooden gates blocked passageways. The oldest archaeological examples of <b>mortise</b> and tenon <b>type</b> woodworking joints were found in China dating to about 5000 BC.|$|R
