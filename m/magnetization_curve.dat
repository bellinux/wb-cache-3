50|$|Typically the {{coercivity}} of {{a magnetic}} material {{is determined by}} measurement of the magnetic hysteresis loop, also called the <b>magnetization</b> <b>curve,</b> as illustrated in the figure. The apparatus used to acquire the data is typically a vibrating-sample or alternating-gradient magnetometer. The applied field where the data line crosses zero is the coercivity.

40|$|In this paper, we combine thermal effects with Landau-Zener (LZ) quantum {{tunneling}} {{effects in}} a dynamical Monte Carlo (DMC) framework to produce satisfactory <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> of single-molecule magnet (SMM) systems. We use the giant spin approximation for SMM spins and consider regular lattices of SMMs with magnetic dipolar interactions (MDI). We calculate spin reversal probabilities from thermal-activated barrier hurdling, direct LZ tunneling, and thermal-assisted LZ tunnelings {{in the presence}} of sweeping magnetic fields. We do systematical DMC simulations for Mn$_{ 12 }$ systems with various temperatures and sweeping rates. Our simulations produce clear step structures in low-temperature <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves,</b> and our results show that the thermally activated barrier hurdling becomes dominating at high temperature near 3 K and the thermal-assisted tunnelings play important roles at intermediate temperature. These are consistent with corresponding experimental results on good Mn$_{ 12 }$ samples (with less disorders) {{in the presence of}} little misalignments between the easy axis and applied magnetic fields, and therefore our <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> are satisfactory. Furthermore, our DMC results show that the MDI, with the thermal effects, have important effects on the LZ tunneling processes, but both the MDI and the LZ tunneling give place to the thermal-activated barrier hurdling effect in determining the <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> when the temperature is near 3 K. This DMC approach can be applicable to other SMM systems, and could be used to study other properties of SMM systems. Comment: Phys Rev B, accepted; 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{coercivity}} of {{a material}} {{depends on the}} time scale over which a <b>magnetization</b> <b>curve</b> is measured. The magnetization of a material measured at an applied reversed field which is nominally smaller than the coercivity may, over a long time scale, slowly relax to zero. Relaxation occurs when reversal of magnetization by domain wall motion is thermally activated and is dominated by magnetic viscosity. The increasing value of coercivity at high frequencies is a serious obstacle to the increase of data rates in high-bandwidth magnetic recording, {{compounded by the fact}} that increased storage density typically requires a higher coercivity in the media.|$|E
50|$|Another kind of {{laboratory}} remanence is anhysteretic remanence or anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). This is induced by exposing a magnet {{to a large}} alternating field plus a small dc bias field. The amplitude of the alternating field is gradually reduced to zero to get an anhysteretic magnetization, and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The anhysteretic <b>magnetization</b> <b>curve</b> is often close {{to an average of}} the two branches of the hysteresis loop, and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field. ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology and to the acquisition of natural remanent magnetization in rocks.|$|E

It then followed from Landau theory why these two apparently disparate systems {{should have the same}} critical exponents, despite having different microscopic parameters. It is now known that the phenomenon of universality arises for other reasons (see Renormalization group). In fact, Landau theory predicts the incorrect critical exponents for the Ising and liquid-gas systems.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} the {{magnetic}} characterization of thin films composed of gas-phase cobalt nanoclusters deposited on surfaces. Measurements of <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> at ambient temperature indicate a strong exchange interaction between the clusters, while at cryogenic temperatures an exchange bias field appears. The latter confirms the existence of a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic core-shell system. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements under zero-field-cooled conditions showed a rather broad maximum situated around 200 K. Magnetic force microscopy indicates the formation of a correlated super-spin-glass (CSSG) resulting from the frustration between the interparticle exchange interaction and the randomly oriented intraparticle anisotropy. The approach to saturation of the <b>magnetization</b> <b>curves</b> at 295 K is consistent with a CSSG. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{essential}} physics {{underlying the}} phenomenon is the exchange interaction between the antiferromagnet and ferromagnet at their interface. Since antiferromagnets have a small or no net magnetization, their spin orientation is only weakly influenced by an externally applied magnetic field. A soft ferromagnetic film which is strongly exchange-coupled to the antiferromagnet will have its interfacial spins pinned. Reversal of the ferromagnet's moment will have an added energetic cost corresponding to the energy necessary to create a Néel domain wall within the antiferromagnetic film. The added energy term implies {{a shift in the}} switching field of the ferromagnet.
