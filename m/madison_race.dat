5000|$|<b>Madison</b> <b>races</b> team up {{pairs of}} riders in a tag-team format. Riders [...] "sling" [...] their {{teammate}} forward to facilitate alternating sprints {{that keep the}} pace very high during typically long races (30 km, or more, compared to 3 - 10 km for most other races). The name is taken from Madison Square Garden where the format was popular in the early 1900s. Since partners can trade {{as often as they}} like, this is a very busy race format, with half of the racers racing and half circulating around the track at any time.|$|R

In <b>Madison</b> <b>races</b> (named after six-day <b>races</b> at <b>Madison</b> Square Garden in New York City, New York and also known as [...] "the American"), the team's relief rider rests above the stayer’s line by riding slowly until his or her teammate comes around the track and throws him or her back into the race.|$|R

50|$|The bicycle boom of {{the late}} 19th century had a strong impact in the area, and the City of Brooklyn was {{especially}} responsive, providing accommodation in Eastern Parkway, Ocean Parkway, and elsewhere. New York didn't produce as many bicycles as other cities, so imported many from elsewhere, including Freehold Township, New Jersey. As a spectator sport, six-day racing was popular and spurred the building of velodromes in suburbs including Washington Heights, Manhattan, and Jersey City, New Jersey. Weekly races were held in suburban roads, including Pelham Parkway, Bronx. The biggest races were in inner city locations, notably at the original Madison Square Garden which had been designed for cycle racing {{and at the time}} was located adjacent to Madison Square. The Olympic sport, <b>Madison</b> <b>Racing,</b> is named after cycle races that became popular at Madison Square Gardens.|$|R
