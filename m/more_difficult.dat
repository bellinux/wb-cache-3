5|$|East of Camerton {{the coal}} is buried beneath newer rock strata, {{which meant that}} mining in the area was <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has always}} been {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> Nepenthes species to cultivate. However, in recent years, it has become apparent that the plant may not be deserving of its reputation.|$|E

50|$|Although the concerto {{sounds more}} relaxed and lyrical than its C major {{predecessor}} it is <b>more</b> technically <b>difficult</b> for the soloist.|$|R
5000|$|North Spur (a.k.a. North Ridge). Shorter {{than the}} above two routes, but much <b>more</b> {{technically}} <b>difficult.</b> Has been repeated, including a semi-alpine style (capsule style) ascent.|$|R

5|$|Treatment of {{advanced}} forms of MS is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than relapsing-remitting MS. A {{wide range of}} medications {{have been used to}} try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.|$|E
5|$|Unbiunium has not {{yet been}} synthesised. Nevertheless, because it is only three {{elements}} away from the heaviest known element, oganesson (element 118), its synthesis may come in the near future; it is expected {{to be one of the}} last few reachable elements with current technology, and the limit may be anywhere between element 120 and 124. It will also likely be far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to synthesise than the elements known so far up to 118, and still <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than elements 119 and 120. The team at RIKEN in Japan has plans to attempt the synthesis of element 121 in the future after its attempts on elements 119 and 120.|$|E

50|$|Martin Wolf {{has argued}} that the {{purchase}} of toxic assets may distract the U.S. Congress from the urgent need to recapitalize banks and may make it <b>more</b> politically <b>difficult</b> to take necessary action.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap their fingers instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) because it is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to control (it {{can take over}} an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull's structural integrity.|$|E
5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5000|$|Warner is {{credited}} with coining the phrase [...] "", to mean the actual forces engaged in a conflict. [...] The first use of the phrase is identified as a quote in the Christian Science Monitor (April 11, 1980) {{in reference to the}} Iran hostage crisis: [...] "US options grow <b>more</b> <b>difficults</b> as the chance of a Soviet response increases. However, many American strategists now argue that even light, token US land forces -- 'getting US combat boots on the ground' as General Warner puts it -- would signal to an enemy that the US is physically guarding the area and can only be dislodged at the risk of war." ...|$|R

5000|$|... 2) Fusimotor set: Gamma motoneurons are {{activated}} {{according to}} the novelty or difficulty of a task. Whereas static gamma motoneurons are continuously active during routine movements such as locomotion, dynamic gamma motoneoruns tend to be activated <b>more</b> during <b>difficult</b> tasks, increasing Ia stretch-sensitivity.|$|R
5|$|Alexander sent much of {{his army}} to Carmania (modern {{southern}} Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran. Alexander reached Susa in 324BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the 2014 United States–Africa Leaders Summit, Bush, Michelle Obama, the State Department, and the George W. Bush Institute {{hosted a}} daylong forum on {{education}} and health with the spouses of the African leaders attending the summit. Bush urged African leaders to avoid discriminatory laws that make the treatment of HIV/AIDS <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{online game}} {{based on the}} series was {{developed}} for GSN's website midway through the show's first season. The game allows online users to answer questions seen on the actual show. Answering {{a certain amount of}} questions correctly allows players to level up and face <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> questions; a total of 34 levels are available.|$|E
5000|$|The Mason twist is a <b>more</b> {{advanced}} (<b>difficult)</b> {{version of}} the Russian twist. It is performed in the same manner, except the legs are straight and the feet are held off the ground (in the V-sit position) {{for the duration of}} the exercise.|$|R
5000|$|Aortic valve repair is a {{surgical}} procedure used to correct some aortic valve disorders {{as an alternative}} to aortic valve replacement. Aortic valve repair is performed less often and is <b>more</b> technically <b>difficult</b> than mitral valve repair.There are two surgical techniques of aortic-valve repair: ...|$|R
5000|$|The two-step {{estimator}} {{discussed above}} {{is a limited}} information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator. In asymptotic theory and in finite samples as demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations, the full information (FIML) estimator exhibits better statistical properties. However, the FIML estimator is <b>more</b> computationally <b>difficult</b> to implement.|$|R
5|$|Batygin and Brown also {{predict a}} yet-to-be-discovered {{population}} of distant objects. These objects would have semi-major axes greater than , {{but they would}} have lower eccentricities and orbits that would be aligned with that of Planet Nine. The larger perihelia of these objects would make them fainter and <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect than the anti-aligned objects.|$|E
5|$|By refraining {{from the}} advance a2-a3 White tries {{to gain a}} tempo on {{the lines of the}} {{previous}} section, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts.

5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} was far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates.

50|$|The Transcendental Études (Études d'exécution transcendante), S.139, are {{a series}} of twelve {{compositions}} for solo piano by Franz Liszt. They were published in 1852 as a revision of a <b>more</b> technically <b>difficult</b> 1837 series, which in turn were the elaboration of a set of studies written in 1826.|$|R
5|$|Complicated UTIs are <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to treat}} and usually {{requires}} more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication. Increasing antibiotic resistance is causing {{concern about the}} future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to obtain.|$|E
