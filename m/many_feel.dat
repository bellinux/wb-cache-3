5|$|Although <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> the show's quality {{declined}} {{over the}} years, Last of the Summer Wine continued to receive large audiences for the BBC and was praised for its positive portrayal {{of older people}} and family-friendly humour. Many members of the Royal Family enjoyed the show. The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There were twenty-one Christmas specials, three television films and a documentary film about the series. Last of the Summer Wine inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel, several novelisations, and stage adaptations.|$|E
5|$|To further complicate this controversy, <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> {{that there}} are varying levels of offensiveness with team names and mascots. The nature and degree of {{stereotyping}} varies depending upon {{the name of the}} team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo; the name of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as Redskins or Squaws; or the behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E

25|$|The Zócalo {{area has}} been, since 2014, where large rallies {{have been held}} in the {{aftermath}} of the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping, an event that has become symbolic for the climate of widespread criminality, impunity and governmental corruption that <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> the country faces.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of an arch bridge was viewed as wasteful in respect to the extra costs associated with building this type of bridge. Other designs which were less expensive in nature were rejected in favour of the more expensive tied arch design.

25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. <b>Many</b> <b>feel</b> {{that it is not}} fair to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The Heat and Spurs also {{developed}} a recent rivalry, coming off from two consecutive NBA finals match-ups which <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> has ignited a feud between the Heat and Texas basketball teams overall. The first time the two teams met was during the 2013 NBA Finals, where the Spurs entered their fifth NBA Finals appearance and the Heat entered their third consecutive appearance. It was LeBron James's second time facing the Spurs in the Finals, having faced them in 2007 in a crushing four-game sweep. It was the Heat's third time playing a Texas team. The Heat had home-court advantage since their record (66-16) was better than San Antonio's (58-24) with Miami as the highly favored team. The Heat fell during Game 1, 88-92 after a late upsurge led by Tony Parker. They evened the series during Game 2 with a 103-99 victory. The Heat went through a roller-coaster alternation of wins and losses which extended the series to a deciding Game 7 in Miami. The series experienced many feats, in which Ray Allen had his record for most-threes in a Finals broken by Danny Green. During Game 5, despite strong performances from LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Ray Allen, the Heat still lost 104-114. During Game 6 in Miami, Ray Allen made a game-saving clutch three-pointer {{to tie the game}} and save Miami's season. The Heat would win games 6 and 7, completing the championship repeat, a loose reminiscent of and similar fashion as the 2010 NBA Finals between the Lakers and the Celtics. James was named the Finals MVP. The Heat also handed the Spurs their first NBA Finals loss, becoming the first team to beat them.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in the 2000s, the stay-at-home dad {{began to}} emerge as a role in China, though some remain uncomfortable {{with the way the}} role changes {{traditional}} family dynamics. Customs in China suggest that men must be the heads of their households. Stereotyping is an issue for stay-at-home dads, who sometimes prefer not to tell others about their family arrangement. Traditional ideas promote criticism of [...] "woman-like" [...] men, and <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> that they would face humiliation and criticism for being stay-at-home dads. Others suppose they would be looked at as having a wife that is [...] "too strong".|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere in the Qur'an, Isaac is {{mentioned}} in lists: Joseph follows {{the religion of}} his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of God's favor to them (12: 6); Jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, [...] "Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the Qur'an commands Muslims {{to believe in the}} revelations that were given to [...] "Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs" [...] (2: 136; 3: 84). In the Qur'an's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son (37: 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though <b>many</b> <b>feel</b> that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith.|$|E
500|$|Traveling Shoes is [...] "more tightly controlled" [...] than Angelou's {{previous}} books, {{most likely}} due to {{the dominance of the}} travel motif. [...] Setting, always an important element for Angelou, becomes even more important in this book. [...] Unlike her previous books, most of this book's action occurs in one setting, Accra, which contributes to and is tightly connected with her personal development. Angelou's feelings towards living in Ghana are ambivalent, which provides Traveling Shoes with richness and depth. [...] <b>Many</b> <b>feel</b> that Angelou's inclusion of her tour with The Blacks to Berlin and Venice as a digression that detracts from the African setting, but Lupton sees it as a contribution to her character development and provides the book with a [...] "universal quality" [...] as Angelou reaches beyond the confines of her personal life and encounters racism in Germany. [...] During this trip, she comes to see her fellow African-Americans differently, as more spirited than the Africans she has met in Ghana.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} of reborning a play doll typically involves {{a number of}} steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed. Then a blue color wash may be applied to {{give the appearance of}} realistic baby skin undertones. For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced. The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint. If heat set paints are used, the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied. Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers. The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look. Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process. [...] There are air dry paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names. [...] <b>Many</b> <b>feel</b> that repeated baking of vinyl can cause it to break down over time. [...] In addition, there are fumes and chemicals released during the heating process.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proliferation}} of [...] "commemorative issues" [...] and subscription incentives seemed to some like {{an exchange of}} journalistic integrity for commercial opportunism.
