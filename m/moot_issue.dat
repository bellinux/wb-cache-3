40|$|Despite its {{widespread}} presence among grazing ruminants, dicrocoeliosis, {{also known}} as "small liver fluke" disease, is poorly known and often underestimated by researchers and practitioners in many countries. This is primarily due to the multiple parasitic infections which affect ruminant livestock and mask the pathology of dicrocoeliosis, to the difficulties in diagnosing it with coprological techniques and, finally, to the few effective drugs found. Furthermore, the biological cycle of Dicrocoelium, which requires a snail and an ant as intermediate hosts, and {{the high number of}} ecological and epidemiological variables affecting the disease make it difficult to set up experimental designs to study dicrocoeliosis. In the past 50 years, many aspects of this disease have been broadly investigated (aetiology, life cycle, diffusion, epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunology) but its diagnosis and treatment still remain <b>moot</b> <b>issues.</b> Dicrocoeliosis often remains clinically undetected and its diagnosis is mostly based on adult dicrocoelia recovered in the liver post mortem or on egg detected at coprological examination. The prophylaxis of the small liver fluke has been difficult and unsatisfactory to date due to the complexity of its biological life cycle and epidemiology. Many anti-helminthic drugs are practically ineffective against dicrocoeliosis if used at the dosage recommended against other gastrointestinal helminths and lungworms.

5000|$|On April 17, 2012, the FCC {{cancelled}} {{the license}} of WLLS-LP, after determining {{that the lack}} of submitted paperwork equated to the station having gone dark for at least 21 months, placing the approximate closure date in July 2010. Prior to the cancellation, Mrs. Schrencongost e-mailed the FCC, stating that the agency failed to act on her requests to transfer the station from his estate to her name, and the status of the license hampered efforts to sell the station. She also complained that Verizon Wireless had taken away the channel 65 signal for [...] "emergency services", which she dismissed as [...] "nonsense". She also complained that the reception of WLLS-LP from a former Adelphia headend in Indiana with a coat hanger was disallowed by the FCC as tangible proof for must carry protections, and that plans in 2006 to relocate the digital signal of WNPA (now WPCW) to channel 49 had also put the future of the station in doubt, an overture that Mrs. Schrencongost declared was [...] "an illegal take-over".

40|$|This article briefly {{discussed}} ways {{to overcome}} the limitations of existing GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection) models and primarily focused on the human processing of cognition and perception which was widely discussed yet a <b>moot</b> <b>issue.</b> Regarding mouse activities, especially drag-drop, the experiment demonstrates {{a significant difference between}} the predicted and empirical results in terms of time. The reason was found to be the following: in empirical testing, participants were swift in executing dragging behavior, whereas in NGOMSL modeling, not penetrated parameters of internal/external operators become sequential components that cause the metrics (e. g., movement time) to be computed serially. Based on other studies on mouse activity, the operator of the original NGOMSL is revised to include accurate cognitive process. In the validation, by implementing the revised GOMS operator, differences between the model execution time and the empirical duration, as measured when certain software is used, are evaluated. As a result, the revised GOMS model with new operators is proven to be effective and provides an estimate that deviates from the empirical value by at most 7 %...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} prima facie paradox of the {{endorsement}} of the death penalty in Art. 2 (1) of the European Convention of Human Rights, with the “abolition” of the punishment provided by Protocol No. 6 and Protocol No. 13. It will analyse the evolution of the Council of Europe’s abolitionist discourse which led to this juxtaposition, and identify whether there are unified or heterogeneous approaches to the punishment by the Committee of Ministers, the Parliamentary Assembly, and the judicial organs of the Commission and Court. What emerges is a conflict between the radical expansion of the boundaries of human rights by the Assembly, with the Committee’s demonstration that the shadow of state sovereignty constantly attempts to thwart the progress. Consequently, the Court has bowed to the need for Member State acceptance of provisions for amendment of Art. 2 (1) and has not applied any purposive application of the “living instrument” doctrine. However, the gradual solidification of the Council’s abolitionist position has produced the possibility of legislative abolition through the Protocols, but the text of Art. 2 (1) remains. So is the death penalty abolished or not? As contemporary practice within Member States affirms that it is, is textual amendment now a <b>moot</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out to {{determine}} the feasibility of using commercial database management systems (DBMSs) to support large-scale computational science. Conventional wisdom in the past has been that DBMSs are too slow for such data. Several events {{over the past few years}} have muddied the clarity of this mindset: 1. 2. 3. 4. Several commercial DBMS systems have demonstrated storage and ad-hoc quer access to Terabyte data sets. Several large-scale science teams, such as EOSDIS [NAS 91], high energy physics [MM 97] and human genome [Kin 93] have adopted (or make frequent use of) commercial DBMS systems as the central part of their data management scheme. Several major DBMS vendors have introduced their first object-relational products (ORDBMSs), which have the potential to support large, array-oriented data. In some cases, performance is a <b>moot</b> <b>issue.</b> This is true in particular if the performance of legacy applications is not reduced while new, albeit slow, capabilities are added to the system. The basic assessment is still that DBMSs do not scale to large computational data. However, many of the reasons have changed, and there is an expiration date attached to that prognosis. This document expands on this conclusion, identifies the advantages and disadvantages of various commercial approaches, and describes the studies carried out in exploring this area. The document is meant to be brief, technical and informative, rather than a motivational pitch. The conclusions within are very likely to become outdated within the next 5 - 7 years, as market forces will have a significant impact on the state of the art in scientific data management over the next decade...|$|E

40|$|The {{orthorhombic}} perovskite NaOsO 3 {{undergoes a}} continuous metal-insulator transition (MIT), accompanied by antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at T_N= 410 K, suggested {{to be an}} example of the rare Slater (itinerant) MIT. We study this system using ab initio and related methods, focusing on the origin and nature of magnetic ordering and the MIT. The rotation and tilting of OsO 6 octahedra in the GdFeO 3 structure result in moderate narrowing the band width of the t_ 2 g manifold, but sufficient to induce flattening of bands and AFM order within the local spin density approximation (LSDA), where it remains metallic but with a deep pseudogap. Including on-site Coulomb repulsion U, at U_c 2 eV a MIT occurs only in the AFM state. Effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the band structure seem minor as expected for a half-filled t_ 2 g^ 3 shell, but SOC doubles the critical value U_c necessary to open a gap and also leads to large magnetocrystalline energy differences in spite of normal orbital moments no greater than 0. 1 μ_B. Our results are consistent with a Slater MIT driven by magnetic order, induced by a combination of structurally-induced band narrowing and moderate Coulomb repulsion, with SOC necessary for a full picture. Strong p-d hybridization reduces the moment, and when bootstrapped by the reduced Hund's rule coupling (proportional to the moment) gives a calculated moment of 1 μ_B, consistent with the observed moment and only a third of the formal d^ 3 value. We raise and discuss one important question: since this AFM ordering is at q= 0 (in the 20 atom cell) where nesting is a <b>moot</b> <b>issue,</b> what is the microscopic driving force for ordering and the accompanying MIT?Comment: 9 page...|$|E
