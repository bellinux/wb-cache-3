25|$|The boat’s navigational and {{communications}} {{systems have been}} damaged by saltwater intrusion. The man tries to repair the <b>marine</b> <b>radio</b> and connects {{it to one of}} the boat's batteries but is unsuccessful. When he climbs the mast to repair an antenna lead, he sees an oncoming tropical storm. When the storm arrives, he runs before the wind. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position, but when crawling to the bow to hoist the storm jib, he is thrown overboard and regains the deck after a long struggle. The boat capsizes, turtles after a further 180-degree roll and is dis-masted, and most of the equipment is destroyed. With the boat badly holed and sinking, the man abandons ship in an inflatable life raft, salvaging whatever he can to survive.|$|E

Brown {{began in}} December 1946, {{many of the}} early {{students}} being men who {{had dropped out of}} classes at the Metropolitan Vocational High School during World War II to serve as merchant mariners or in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard. Students studied standard academic subjects and took boat building, <b>marine</b> <b>radio,</b> marine electrician, and maritime business classes in the high schools main building ashore; aboard John W. Brown they learned their seafaring trade, either as [...] deck hands, engine room personnel, or stewards, and they also performed all maintenance and repairs the ship required. Students at first spent a week at a time in the building and a week at a time on the ship; later, the schedule changed so that they spent half of each school day in the building and the other half aboard the ship. The Maritime Educational Advisory Commission also met regularly aboard the ship and worked closely with the schools staff.|$|E

At 2.31am the co-pilot told approach control that they couldn't establish marine VHF communication with the vessel and asked for navigational assistance from the Murchison platform. Witnesses on the platform and its stand-by vessel later saw the helicopter pass by in a northeasterly direction in driving rain and poor visibility. At 2.36am approach control informed the helicopter that the survey vessel had a searchlight and could turn it on and point it vertically to assist in location and the co-pilot replied a minute later that they could see the Baffin Seal and were in radio communication. At 2.41am approach control attempted calling the helicopter and received no reply.
