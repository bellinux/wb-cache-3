[...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, {{to do so would}} have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> kiss the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> kiss this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> kiss that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or [...] "'scuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E

500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still {{felt as if they}} all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist in front of the wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
500|$|The show {{also won}} four Annie Awards, {{including}} its 12th consecutive in the Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Television Production category.

However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse <b>me</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've got things to do, like the first thing is not to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{with the}} onset of the Great Depression, the {{painting}} came {{to be seen as a}} depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit. Wood assisted this transition by renouncing his Bohemian youth in Paris and grouping himself with populist Midwestern painters, such as John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton, who revolted against the dominance of East Coast art circles.
