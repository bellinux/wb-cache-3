50|$|McLaren {{endured a}} <b>mixed</b> <b>end</b> to the season. Häkkinen missed the Pacific GP {{with a case}} of {{appendicitis}} {{and was replaced by}} the rookie Magnussen, but then returned to finish a fine second at Suzuka. This was tempered by the fact that Blundell wrote off a chassis in practice, but this setback paled in comparison to Häkkinen's accident during qualifying for the final race of the season at Adelaide. A sudden puncture saw his car fly out of control and hit a concrete wall at high speed. Häkkinen was pulled out of his car unconscious with blood pouring from his mouth and nose. However, he made a full recovery for the first grand prix of the next year, which was also in Australia.|$|E
50|$|He lasted {{barely a}} month at Newcastle before joining Bristol Rovers. His {{impressive}} career seemingly on the decline, he failed to score in nine games for Bristol Rovers before a sudden departure again, this time to Norwich City where, {{at the age of}} 34, he found some of his old touch. He played 88 games over three seasons, scoring 16 goals, and suffered a <b>mixed</b> <b>end</b> to his Norwich career in 1985 when the club won the League Cup — Channon's second and final domestic honour — with a 1-0 win over Sunderland at Wembley, but were then relegated (with Sunderland) {{at the end of the}} same season. Channon joined Portsmouth and Finn Harps (where he played in one League of Ireland Cup game), before retiring from the game in 1986.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{a method}} was {{proposed}} for solving the pure end condition {{problem of a}} semi-infinite elastic cylinder [1]. This {{has been a long}} standing problem in the dynamic theory of linear elasticity. The method employed decomposed the pure end condition problem into two <b>mixed</b> <b>end</b> condition problems then superposed their solutions. On each of the <b>mixed</b> <b>end</b> condition problems a double transform technique is used then inverted asymptotically [2]...|$|E

40|$|A compact {{empirical}} mode decomposition (CEMD) {{is presented}} to reduce mode <b>mixing,</b> <b>end</b> effect, and detrend uncertainty in analysis of time series (with N data points). This new approach consists of two parts: (a) highest-frequency sampling (HFS) to generate pseudo extrema for effective identification of upper and lower envelopes, and (b) a set of 2 N algebraic equations for determining the maximum (minimum) envelope at each decomposition step. Among the 2 N algebraic equations, 2 (N − 2) equations are derived {{on the base of}} the compact difference concepts using the Hermitan polynomials with the values and first derivatives at the (N − 2) non-end points. At each end point, zero third derivative and determination of the first derivative from several (odd number) nearest original and pseudo extrema provide two extra algebraic equations for the value and first derivative at that end point. With this well-posed mathematical system, one can reduce the mode <b>mixing,</b> <b>end</b> effect, and detrend uncertainty drastically, and separate scales naturally without any a priori subjective criterion selection...|$|R
30|$|During protein purification, {{the protein}} {{concentrations}} in the samples were determined based on Bradford assay using Quick Start™ Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. The activities of purified CBH I and CBH II were determined on Avicel in 50  mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. 1  mL of Avicel solution (10  g/L) with final enzyme concentration of 0.1  mg/mL was incubated (<b>mixed</b> <b>end</b> to end) at 45  °C in 2  mL Eppendorf centrifuge tubes for 2  h (Jäger et al. 2010). After 2  h of incubation, the samples were heated at 95  °C for 5  min to stop the hydrolysis. The samples were centrifuged at 15, 000  rpm for 5  min to separate the supernatant. The reducing sugar concentration in the supernatant was determined using dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay and using glucose as standard.|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{eigenfunction}} expansion {{is one of}} the most elegant methods for solving elastodynamic problems. The solution obtained from it is more concise than that obtained from the integral transform technique. Traditional eigenfunction expansion method is used for the elastodynamic problems with displacement and traction boundary conditions. In this paper, the method is generalized to study the elastodynamic response of an elastic solid with mixed boundary surfaces, and the exact analytical solution is derived. The dynamic response of a finite-length solid aluminum cylinder with two <b>mixed</b> <b>end</b> boundaries is numerically evaluated. The result computed from the analytical solution agrees very well with that obtained from finite element method (FEM).

After {{the release of}} Quicksilver Clouds the band started to experiment with new elements and sounds for their music.

The band eventually decided to record the album themselves, with the help of familiar sound technicians. The official recording of the album did not start until around November 2007. After various locations and sessions, the recordings and <b>mixing</b> <b>ended</b> in November 2009.|$|R

40|$|Hilbert-Huang {{transform}} (HHT) {{has drawn}} great attention in power system analysis {{due to its}} capability to deal with dynamic signal and provide instantaneous characteristics such as frequency, damping, and amplitudes. However, its shortcomings, including mode <b>mixing</b> and <b>end</b> effects, are as significant as its advantages. A preliminary result of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) method to enhance HHT and hopefully to overcome these disadvantages is presented in this paper. The proposal first removes dynamic DC components in signals using empirical mode decomposition. Then an EKF model is applied to extract instant coefficients. Numerical results using simulated and real-world low-frequency oscillation data suggest the proposal can help to overcome the mode <b>mixing</b> and <b>end</b> effects with a properly chosen number of modes.
