25|$|An evocative {{description}} {{exists in}} words from 1867: ″Look at the dapper little fellow, how neatly {{he sits on}} the back of the old American horse, Reporter. Notice the jerry-hat, the open but determined, never-say-die, countenance, the polished boots, the burnished spurs, the tight-fitting breeches, the long waistcoat, creaseless coat, and general ′get-up′ of that wiry-looking, ten-stone, five-feet-five specimen of humanity, and tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is a ′character′ when once seen that will never be forgotten.″ Charlie Canavan differs on one point - he states his weight 'when at man's age' did not exceed 9stone (126lb or 57kg).|$|E

The episode, [...] "Escape Route," [...] was directed by the show's star, Roger Moore, who later recalled that Sutherland [...] "asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could show it to some producers as he was up for an important role... they came to view a rough cut and he got The Dirty Dozen." [...] The film, which starred Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson, was the 5th highest-grossing film of 1967 and MGM's highest-grossing movie of the year.|$|E
2500|$|When Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was elected, the {{government}} sent her Fredrik August Adelswärd as their representative to inform her. He said that realized her disappointment, as Bernadotte was a non-royal, but {{asked her to}} pretend to be happy for the health of the monarch, who was afraid that she would displeased. She answered that she would be happy with any one who could bring stability: [...] "Then it will be the right one, and he will find a loyal friend in <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> is also gifted with talent and a good heart, then his lineage would mean nothing to me." [...] She asked for permission to go to Örebro, and declared: [...] "I do not meddle in politics, although everyone may say otherwise." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I do; but we'll see." [...] There was a comely {{determination}} on her lip, {{very pleasant}} to a beholder who was neither bishop, priest, nor deacon. [...] "I think I can manage any vicar's views about <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> under forty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I don't like 'im best, {{even without the}} money," [...] said Miss Kybird, calmly. [...] "Nobody could 'ave been more {{attentive}} than 'im. I believe that 'e'd marry <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>'e</b> 'ad a hundred thousand, but it looks better your way." ...|$|R
2500|$|Socrates tells Cebes to [...] "bid him (his friend) {{farewell}} from me; {{say that}} I would have him come after <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> be a wise man" [...] Simmias expresses confusion {{as to why}} they ought hasten to follow Socrates to death. Socrates then states [...] "...he, who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to die; but he will not take his own life." [...] Cebes raises his doubts as to why suicide is prohibited. He asks, [...] "Why do you say...that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow one who is dying?" [...] Socrates replies that while death is the ideal home of the soul, man, specifically the philosopher, should not commit suicide except when it becomes necessary.|$|E
2500|$|On July 8, 1955, Rushmore {{appeared}} on The Tom Duggan Show in Chicago. He claimed on air {{that he was}} on a secret mission to uncover the communist assassins of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Rushmore told the viewers that the leader of the [...] "Chicago Communist Party," [...] whose name was given as [...] "Lazarovich," [...] was in hiding and that Rushmore needed their help in locating him. Rushmore later disappeared from his hotel room, leading to a nationwide manhunt by the FBI. As the nation speculated that Rushmore was either kidnapped or murdered by communists, he was discovered hiding under the name [...] "H. Roberts" [...] at the Hotel Finlen in Butte, Montana. Meanwhile, news reporters found [...] "Lazarovich" [...] living in Manhattan under his real name of William Lazar. Lazar said [...] "It's a simple fact that I live quite normally in Manhattan and that any green cub reporter would not have the slightest difficulty in locating <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> honestly wanted to." [...] Associate Director of the FBI, Clyde Tolson, wrote in the margin of a report on the disappearance: [...] "Rushmore must be a 'nut.' We should {{have nothing to do with}} him." [...] J. Edgar Hoover added: [...] "I certainly agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [...]" [...] Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John told <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're on {{the high}} bank o' the Quharity. Take care, man; you was {{stepping}} ower into the roaring water. Lie down and tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> there yet. Maybe I just think that I see him, for the sicht is painted on my een." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, go ahead," [...] I says. [...] "I'm sorry, and I {{take it all}} back. I didn't mean nothing. Fix it any way {{you want}} it. HE ain't any {{consequence}} to <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he's</b> killed, I'm as glad of it as you are; and if he--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect you}} dreamt it all," [...] I ses. [...] "Where would pore Sam get a gold watch and chain from? And why should ’e {{go to you}} about it? Why didn’t <b>’e</b> come to <b>me?</b> <b>If</b> <b>’e</b> thinks I ’ave got it let ’im come to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Brian {{identified}} {{the main difference}} between his music approach to the Beatles' is that they simplify songs to their [...] "skeletal form," [...] whereas he would be [...] "impelled to make [...] more complex," [...] and that if he had arranged [...] "Norwegian Wood", he would have [...] "orchestrated it, put in background voices, [...] done a thousand things." [...] On the subject of the Beatles' Revolver (1966), Love responded: [...] "No, I don't think he was influenced by Revolver. Brian was in his own world, believe <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> were influenced by the Beatles, there'd be more fuzz tone and a few sitars on our records, but there never have been, really." [...] Wilson praised McCartney's bass playing, calling it [...] "technically fantastic, but his harmonies and the psychological thing he brings to the music comes through. Psychologically he is really strong ... The other thing that I could never get was how versatile he was. .... we would spend ages trying to work out where he got all those different types of songs from." [...] In 2014, Brian stated that he thought [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] was [...] "a weird record ... I liked it", although he denied rumors which said that the song had crippled him emotionally. In 2015, he highlighted [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends" [...] as a favorite. He views [...] "Let It Be" [...] as an intensely comforting song, likening it to valium.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dry up!" [...] shouted Mr. Hamlin, turning {{with sudden}} savageness upon his pillow. [...] "Dry up!--don't you see you're driving me half-crazy with your infernal buzzing?"
