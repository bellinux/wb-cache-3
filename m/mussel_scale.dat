To improve {{the efficacy of}} restoration actions targeting these organisms, we used Random Forest modeling to investigate the biotic and abiotic factors influencing mussel density and distribution throughout a 55 - kilometer segment of river. We collected data at both the reach and channel unit scale to investigate how mussel-habitat relationships vary with spatial scale. Margaritifera density exhibited a unimodal distribution while Anodonta and Gonidea density increased in a downstream direction. Model performance was greatest with Margaritifera at the reach scale, and reach scale models generally outperformed channel unit scale models. Physical habitat characteristics such as woody debris, emergent aquatic vegetation, substrate size, and channel shape generally had higher variable importance than hydraulic, biotic, and chemical variables. These results suggest that at the reach and channel unit <b>scale,</b> <b>mussel</b> abundance and distribution is influenced by high flow refugia and habitat heterogeneity. We anticipate that knowledge gained from this study will assist mussel restoration efforts by providing specific guidance about where suitable habitat may occur...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater mussels in California's rivers are {{potentially}} very useful {{as indicators of}} watershed health and recorders of watershed changes. We report the occurrence and habitat of mussel populations within a continuous 8 -km section of the South Fork Eel River in the Northern Coast Range of California. The primary goals of our study were 1) to compile information on species composition and population density, and 2) to examine whether spatial distribution and variability were related to geomorphology and hydrology. We found numerous individuals of 2 species (Margaritifera falcata and Anodonta californiensis), with the spatial distribution of both species characterized by high variability. Mussels in this system live almost exclusively in pools (with a few in runs), near the channel banks, and especially among sedge root-mat substrate. High discharges almost certainly provide more of a constraint on the distribution and persistence of mussels in the South Fork Eel than do low summer flows, so we used the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) hydraulic model to estimate physical conditions during high flows when in-channel investigations were not feasible. In all flow regimes (summer, winter, 5 -y flood, and the largest floods on record), mussels were found in areas of lower boundary shear stresses and lower velocities. Our study suggests that, at various spatial <b>scales,</b> <b>mussels</b> appear to be distributed {{in a manner that}} protects them from the highest flow-induced stresses...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{how large}} <b>scale</b> <b>mussel</b> farms affect {{stratified}} ocean flows {{with the aim}} of gaining a greater understanding of their interaction with the environment and therefore improve mussel farming practices. This situation is recreated in the laboratory as a two-dimensional model of the steady flow of a 2 layer stratified fluid past a mussel farm. The mussel farm is modelled by extending aluminium cylindrical rods (simulating mussel droppers) into the stratified flow creating a farm model with a specified porosity and height ratio. The aim is to explore how the ratio hf / h 1 (depth of the dropper/depth of the interface), porosity and the Richardson number, a measure of the stability of the interface between the two fluids, will affect the mixing and the diversion of the interface induced by the farm. The flume is filled with a two layer stratified fluid where the more saline bottom layer is dyed allowing disturbances in the interfacial layer to be recorded. The Light Attenuation (LA) technique is used to capture images of the movement of the flow. This records the movement and mixing of the salt water and the fresh water present in the flume. The experimental procedure focuses on using a range of farm speeds and dropper depths, to simulate a range of different values of Richardson number and Froude number, which is th...|$|R

The kaolin treatments reduced the apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) fruit infestation on cultivar J. Grieve, and the fruit damage caused by oyster scale (Quadraspidiotus ostreaeformis), <b>mussel</b> <b>scale</b> (Lepidosaphes ulmi), early caterpillars, leaf rolling moths (Tortricidae), fruitlet-mining tortrix moth (Pammene rhediella) and codling moth (Cydia pomonella). There was {{no effect on the}} number of colonies of rosy leaf curling aphid (Dysaphis devecta), nor on the fruit damage caused by common earwig (Forficula auricularia) and apple sawfly on cv. G. Delicious. The level of infestation of rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea), leaf miner moths (Phyllonorycter blancardella, Lyonetia clerkella), and agromyzid flies (Phytomyza heringiana) increased in the kaolin-treated plots. Kaolin treatments promoted woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) infestation, which became severe, while it reduced the abundance of polyphagous predators like F. auricularia, predaceous Heteroptera and Coleoptera, the red velvet mite (Allothrombium fuliginosum), spiders (Araneae) and the abundance of common black ant (Lasius niger). The treatments also reduced parasitism of the apple sawfly by the ichneumonid Lathrolestes ensator. Many weeks after ending the kaolin treatments, the number of predaceous Coleoptera and especially the number of spiders remained low in the kaolin-treated plots...|$|E
40|$|Self-organized spatial {{patterns}} {{occur in}} many terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. Theoretical models and observational studies suggest self-organization, {{the formation of}} patterns due to ecological interactions, is critical for enhanced ecosystem resilience. However, experimental tests of this cross-ecosystem theory are lacking. In this study, we experimentally test the hypothesis that self-organized pattern formation improves the persistence of mussel beds (Mytilus edulis) on intertidal flats. In natural beds, mussels generate self-organized patterns at two different spatial scales: regularly spaced clusters of <b>mussels</b> at centimeter <b>scale</b> driven by behavioral aggregation and large-scale, regularly spaced bands at meter scale driven by ecological feedback mechanisms. To test for {{the relative importance of}} these two spatial scales of self-organization on mussel bed persistence, we conducted field manipulations in which we factorially constructed small-scale and/or large-scale patterns. Our results revealed that both forms of self-organization enhanced the persistence of the constructed mussel beds in comparison to nonorganized beds. Small-scale, behaviorally driven cluster patterns were found to be crucial for persistence, and thus resistance to wave disturbance, whereas large-scale, self-organized patterns facilitated reformation of small-scale patterns if mussels were dislodged. This study provides experimental evidence that self-organization can be paramount to enhancing ecosystem persistence. We conclude that ecosystems with self-organized spatial patterns are likely to benefit greatly from conservation and restoration actions that use the emergent effects of self-organization to increase ecosystem resistance to disturbance...|$|R

Analyzing {{the quality and quantity}} of material exiting the farms and its uptake by surrounding invertebrates highlights the effectiveness of muti-trophic, co-culturing systems where waste from one species is recycled as food for adjacent species. This thesis describes organic throughput of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) land-based tanks and uptake of organic constituents by invertebrates surrounding Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms. [...] The land-based tank output showed significant lipid and fatty acid increases in outflow compared to inflow (p< 0. 020) for the breakdown indicator free fatty acid (FFA), the markers of zooplankton and subsequent indicators of the feed, 20 : 1 ω 9 and 22 : 1 ω 11, and the essential fatty acid DHA(docosahexaenoic acid, 22 : 6 ω 3). Scaling to an 1880 tonne Atlantic cod farm showed 3170 ± 870 kg/day particulate dry weight and 4. 7 ± 1. 7 kg/day DHA exiting the farms. Based on the amount of DHA required per <b>mussel,</b> the <b>scaled</b> amount of DHA could theoretically support 1400 tonnes of mussels assuming optimal consumption of the available DHA. This relates to mussels' role in multi-tropic co-culturing systems as they could assimilate valuable compounds that would otherwise be lost. [...] Regression analysis of particle uptake by invertebrates surrounding multiple aquaculture sites in coastal British Columbia showed a decrease in wet weight for mussels with increasing distance from the farm. There was also an increase in DHA in molluscs combined as well as mussels alone. Principal components analysis showed a similar trend with DHA being higher in molluscs further away from the farm. In addition, bacterial fatty acid markers were higher in molluscs further from the farm except for the individual bacterial fatty acid, 18 : 1 ω 7, which remained higher closer to the farm for molluscs combined, mussels and whelks, and mussels alone; however, not for limpets alone. Additionally, a breakpoint was found for DHA in mussels at 339 m with lower DHA proportions closer to the farm. However, of the DHA present, mussels had significantly higher amounts compared to other molluscs again relating to their use in multi-trophic aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the spatial heterogeneity in three sessile rocky shore organisms, the mussel Perna perna, the barnacle Octomeris angulosa (Sowerby) {{and the red}} alga Gelidium pristoides (Turn.) at a range of continuous local scales along horizontal transects within mid- and upper mussel beds of South African shores. We also {{examined the}} relationships between variability of organisms and topographic features (rock depressions, slope, aspect), and between mussel, barnacle and algal variability over the same scales. To estimate spatial heterogeneity, we analyzed scaling properties of semivariograms using a fractal approach. Relationships between different variables at the different scales were examined by cross-semivariograms. Spatial dependence of P. perna variability increased with spatial dependence of topographic variability, so that <b>scaling</b> regions of <b>mussel</b> and topographic distributions corresponded well. This relationship often improved with larger local <b>scales</b> (<b>mussel</b> cover increased with depressions, steeper slope and aspect towards waves), while at smaller spatial <b>scales,</b> variability in <b>mussel</b> cover was less well explained by variability in topography. The variability of the barnacle O. angulosa exhibited spatial dependence, even on topographically unstructured shores. In contrast, {{the distribution of the}} alga G. pristoides revealed high fractal dimensions, showing spatial independence on topographically unstructured shores. Algae also showed a very strong negative relationship with mussels at most local scales, and a negative relationship with barnacles in upper zones, especially at larger local scales. Barnacles may show clear spatial dependence because of hydrodynamics (at larger local scales) and the need to find a future mate in close proximity (at smaller local scales), while algae may show a strong negative relationship with mussels because of competition for space...|$|R
40|$|The habitat {{requirements}} of western freshwater mussels, Anodonta, Gonidea, and Margaritifera, remain unclear despite their imperiled status. Freshwater mussels provide {{a series of}} ecosystem services including habitat enhancement, substratum stabilization, nutrient cycling, and water clarification, which makes their loss from aquatic ecosystems particularly detrimental. To improve the efficacy of restoration actions targeting these organisms, I used random forest modeling to investigate the biotic and abiotic factors influencing mussel density and distribution throughout a 55 -kilometer (km) segment of the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJDR), in northeastern Oregon. Data was collected to characterize the occurrence of mussels {{with respect to the}} hierarchical, hydrogeomorphic structure of habitat within reaches of varying valley confinement and channel units nested within these reaches. Data regarding functional habitat features were also included to ensure that models included the wide range of characteristics that mussels need from their environment. By collecting data at both the reach and channel unit scale, I was able to investigate how mussel densities and distributions vary with spatial scale and other biophysical parameters. Throughout the study area, Margaritifera density exhibited a unimodal distribution with respect to river km, while Anodonta and Gonidea density showed a negative relationship with river km and exhibited higher densities downstream. The large scale, longitudinal trends of Margaritifera were related to hydrogeomorphic characteristics at the reach scale, while {{less than half of the}} longitudinal variation in Anodonta and Gonidea were explained by hydrogeomorphic and water quality parameters. At the channel unit <b>scale,</b> all <b>mussel</b> genera responded to the patchy variation in physical habitat characteristics, particularly habitat factors that indicated more stable parts of the channel. Overall, physical habitat characteristics such as woody debris, emergent aquatic vegetation, coarse substratum, and channel morphology were more important than hydraulic, biotic, and chemical variables. These results suggest that at both the reach and channel unit <b>scales,</b> <b>mussel</b> density and distribution are influenced by high flow refugia and the hierarchical structuring of hydrogeomorphic habitat characteristics. These results will assist mussel restoration efforts by providing specific guidance about the types of physical habitat conditions that are suitable for mussels...|$|R

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Robert A Desharnais, Carlos Robles, Paul Narguizian, Nancy McQueenDisturbance, Ecological Modeling, Mussel Bed, Population DynamicsRealistic {{approaches}} to modeling disturbances in complex ecological systems could {{aid in the}} conservation and management of natural resources. Cellular automata (CA) models {{have been used to}} study the dynamics of disturbances in marine mussel beds, Mytilus californianus. These models usually consider transitions among a small number of states, for example, “empty”, “occupied”, and “disturbed”, and assume a homogenous spatial environment with periodic boundaries. On the other hand, more complex CA models have also been used to study mussel bed boundary formation. These models consider mussel settlement and growth and predator-prey dynamics within gradients of tidal height and wave exposure. I formulate and analyze a model that combines these {{approaches to}} allow a consideration of the effects of mussel growth, size-dependent predation, and environmental gradients on disturbance dynamics. Small "patches" of the mussel bed are modeled using a deterministic mean field ordinary differential equation (ODE) approximation to the complex CA model. Each patch represents an area of constant tidal height and wave exposure. Adjacent patches are linked through local interactions to form a "quilt" that spans gradients of tidal height and wave exposure. Patches are vulnerable to random disturbances that can propagate to neighboring patches, forming gaps in mussel cover. The probabilities of disturbance and propagation increase as functions of mussel biomass. I investigated how the distribution of gap sizes varied with frequency of disturbance and predation intensity in both homogeneous environments and in gradients of tidal height and wave exposure. I also examined how recovering gaps from previous disturbances influence the dynamics of gap formation. As with simpler models, the gap size frequency distribution varied according to a power law in homogenous <b>mussel</b> beds, indicating <b>scale</b> invariance and self-criticality, which implies self-organization. In simulations with environmental gradients, the highest frequencies and largest sizes of disturbances occurred in interior areas of highest biomass. As disturbances became more likely, the historical effects from previous gap formations had a greater influence on the dynamics of disturbance. High frequency of disturbances can lead to mussel bed collapse. The hybrid deterministic-stochastic quilt model provides a novel paradigm for studying ecological disturbances. These types of predictive models could advance our knowledge of disturbance dynamics and be adapted for the management of other complex biological systems, such as forests. Biological Science...|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, was {{introduced}} accidentally to South Africa {{and has since}} become invasive. One {{possible explanation for the}} success of this species is that it has been released from the effects of parasites which affect the indigenous species of mussels. The aim of this work was to examine the parasitic load of different mussel populations along the southern African coast and to assess the effects of parasites on their hosts. A survey was done to quantify the levels of parasitism in indigenous populations of Perna perna from Southern Africa and of Mytilus galloprovincialis from South Africa (where it is exotic) and Spain (where it is indigenous). This survey was carried out at three different geographic scales: small scale (metres), studying the incidence of parasites within a <b>mussel</b> bed; medium <b>scale</b> (kilometres to tens of kilometres), comparing prevalences of infection among different localities; and large scale (hundreds to thousands of kilometres), examining infection rates along the Southern African coast, as well as the coast of the Basque Country (North Spain). During this survey metazoan parasites other than trematodes were rare. Four species of trematodes were commonly found infecting the indigenous mussel Perna perna. These were metacercariae of the genus Proctoeces, bucephalid sporocysts, encysted metacercariae on the labial palps and gelatinous cysts with metacercariae inside. A detailed description of Proctoeces is given; the other parasites are described elsewhere. No parasites were found in M. galloprovincialis either in South Africa or in Spain. This thesis concentrates on the study of prevalences of Proctoeces and bucephalid sporocysts and their effects on Perna perna. Infection rates with Proctoeces are highly dependent on the sex of the host, with more females than males being infected, and are also size dependent, though only for females. Identification of the sex of mussels infected with bucephalid sporocysts is often not possible since the sporocysts spread over the gonad and replace it. Prevalence of infection with this parasite also increases with the size of the host. To study the influence of Proctoeces and bucephalid sporocysts on the ecological fitness of Perna perna, their effects on survival and competitive ability were tested. The results showed significant negative effects. Both parasites significantly depressed condition but only after spawning, when the mussels were already stressed. In order to check for effects on host survival, the effects of both parasites on mortality rates, gaping behaviour and water loss of mussels exposed to air were also examined. Neither parasite affected mortality rate or gaping behaviour of Perna perna. Proctoeces did not affect the amount of water lost by mussels, but the bucephalid sporocysts did. Mussels infected with sporocysts lost significantly more water than non-infected individuals. This increase in water loss was not related to the gaping behaviour, but a test of the strength of the adductor muscles showed that less force was needed to open mussels with bucephalid sporocysts than non-infected mussels. This was not the case for mussels infected by Proctoeces. Weaker mussels will fail to seal the valves properly, resulting in an increase of water loss on exposure to air by evaporation. Another factor that will have an obvious effect on a population is the reproductive output of the animals. Histological sections of the gonad of infected and non-infected females were cut to study the effects of both parasites on reproduction. Statistical tests comparing the numbers and sizes of oocytes in females infected with Proctoeces and non-infected females showed no significant differences. However, bucephalid sporocysts have a dramatic effect on reproduction by castrating the host, leaving no trace of sex products. One of the major factors shaping the composition of a mussel bed is competition for space and food, with smaller mussels being at a competitive disadvantage. Thus, in order to examine effects of both parasites on the competitive ability of Perna perna, summer and winter growth rates were compared for infected and non-infected mussels. Proctoeces reduced growth both in summer and in winter whilst bucephalid sporocysts had no significant effect. Both growth and reproduction are important components of the energy budget of an animal, and each is affected by either Proctoeces or the bucephalid sporocysts. In an attempt to test if Perna perna compensates energetically for these negative effects, filtration rates and oxygen consumption of mussels with and without parasites were measured. Neither parasite had a significant effect on filtration rates or oxygen consumption of the host. All these results indicate that both Proctoeces and the bucephalid sporocysts have a detrimental effect on their host, and that the mussels do not compensate for these negative effects. There is neither an increase in filtration, nor a decrease in respiration to balance the energy lost to the parasite. The two parasites studied affect the host in different but complementary ways. The effects of both parasites are concentrated on those size classes of mussel which channel most energy into the portion of the energy budget affected by the parasite. Proctoeces affects growth only in the smaller individuals, which under normal conditions would put most energy into growth; and the bucephalid sporocysts castrate the bigger mussels, which would expend most energy on reproduction. By reducing growth rates of small mussels or castrating large mussels, these parasites effectively remove them from the breeding population and reduce their competitive abilities. These negative effects, together with the high prevalence of both parasites in Perna perna along the South African coast and their absence in Mytilus galloprovincialis, suggest that parasites may be an important reason for the success of Mytilus. ...|$|R
