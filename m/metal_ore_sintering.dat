Based {{on the results}} of tests, basic sources of dioxins have been determined in the iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> process in one of the Polish integrated steel plants. The work is presents Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in the iron and steel industry. Most POPs emission is generated in sinter plants. Adaptation to the European Union emission standards is the main challenge for steel producers. In the nearest future investigations of POPs emission in Polish steelworks will be necessity.

40|$|AbstractIron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> is {{a complex}} and {{hysteresis}} process, so the prediction of the iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> character is very necessary. By using stepwise regression analysis, this paper confirms the main factors that influence moisture content, fuel ratio, sintering speed and the sintering drum strength. By using BP artificial neural network, we construct the prediction model against the four characters mentioned afore, and prediction accuracy are 96. 67 %, 93. 33 %, 86. 67 % and 93. 33 % respectively. The model result used in sintering pot test, the experimental {{results show that the}} mix moisture and fuel ratio are optimized, and the sinter drum strength is improved...|$|R
40|$|The raw {{materials}} for an integrated steelworks can be classified into four categories, which are iron ores, fluxes, fuels, and reverts. The characteristics of these {{raw materials}} strongly affect the metallurgical properties of iron <b>ore</b> <b>sinter</b> and sinter plant performance. An optimal ore blend design is therefore essential to produce low cost and high quality hot metal. Without doubt, some hazardous components are brought into the production process, and therefore, there are some associated pollutants. A good preparation of raw materials {{is the first step}} for in-process anti-pollution action. This chapter will introduce the common materials used in iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> and the handling procedures in an integrated steelworks...|$|R

40|$|Iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> {{processes}} constitute significant {{sources of}} dioxins, and studies have confirmed a close correlation between polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) and dioxin formation. Thus, iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> processes {{are thought to}} be a potential source of PCNs, although intensive investigations on PCN emissions from sintering processes have not been carried out. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to qualify and quantify PCN emissions from nine sintering plants operating on different industrial scales. PCN concentrations ranged from 3 to 983 ng m(- 3) (0. 4 - 23. 3 pg TEQ(PCN) m(- 3)) and emission factors ranged from 14 to 1749 mu g t(- 1) (0. 5 - 41. 5 ng TEQ(PCN) t(- 1)), with a geometric mean of 84 mu g t(- 1) (2. 1 ng TEQ(PCN) t(- 1)). The estimated annual emission of PCNs from sintering processes in China was 1390 mg TEQ(PCN). These figures will assist in the development of a PCN emissions inventory. Regarding emission characteristics, PCNs mainly comprised low-chlorinated homologs. The ratios of several characteristic PCN congeners were also measured and compared with those from other sources. Taken together, these results may provide useful information for identifying the sources of PCNs produced by iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|During {{the iron}} <b>ore</b> <b>sintering</b> process, iron <b>ore</b> fines (< 6. 3 mm) {{are mixed with}} {{limestone}} flux and coke breeze and heated to ~ 1300 &# 0186;C. This results in partial melting of the mixture, converting the loose raw materials into a porous but physically strong composite material in which the iron-bearing minerals are bonded together by a range of complex ferrite-like phases known collectively as 'SFCA' (Silico-Ferrite of Calcium and Aluminium). These 'SFCA' phases can be divided {{on the basis of}} composition and morphology into two main types: a low-Fe form that is simply referred to as SFCA, and a second high-Fe, low-Si form called SFCA-I. SFCA and SFCA-I are believed to be the most desirable bonding phases in iron <b>ore</b> <b>sinter</b> because of their high reducibility, high mechanical strength and low reduction degradation, all of which are significant factors in determining the efficiency of the blast furnace. Despite their importance in controlling the quality of iron <b>ore</b> <b>sinter,</b> the stability range and mechanisms of 'SFCA' formation from precursor phases are not well understood. CSIRO has attempted to improve understanding of phase relations within iron <b>ore</b> <b>sinter</b> by; a) conducting experimental phase equilibria studies within the Fe 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 (FCS) and Fe 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 (FACS) model sinter systems to establish the key thermal and compositional parameters that influence the bonding phase chemistry and stability, and, b) conducting in situ X-ray diffraction experiments to determine the formation mechanisms of SFCA and SFCA-I under simulated sintering conditions. The combination of techniques will provide insights into sinter formation mechanisms which are important in designing strategies to counter some of the key problems facing the Australian iron ore industry...|$|R

Finally, by collecting 6 s laboratory XRD datasets and using a heating rate of 175 °C min− 1, phase formation and decomposition have been monitored under heating rates more closely approximating those encountered in industrial iron <b>ore</b> <b>sintering.</b> © 2014 JCPDS-ICDD...|$|R
