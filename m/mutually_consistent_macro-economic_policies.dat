Pre- 1994 racial inequality was formalised through apartheid laws. Apartheid therefore created National Innovation Systems (NSIs) which were selective and exclusionary, benefiting the White minority. After the end of apartheid the Government of National Unity (GNU) was faced {{with the task of}} redressing past imbalances through redistribution and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policies.</b> This assessment looks at policies at two levels, these being the redistribution and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policies.</b> It is noted that the implementation of redistribution (socio-economic) and <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policies</b> has yielded mixed results; for instance, although the budget allocation towards housing has increased, supply has been low...|$|R
3000|$|First, at the {{beginning}} of the financial crisis, China adopted a <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> that was the opposite of those in Western countries. Breaking out in the USA in 2007, the crisis spread across the world in 2008. Most countries opted for expansionary <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> as a response. In contrast, by {{the beginning}} of 2008, China was employing an overall tight <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> that aimed to avoid an overheated economy and inflation. Tight monetary policy was set to cool down overheated demand for investment triggered by the fast economic growth between 2003 and 2007 (the growth rate over this period was over 10 %). Only 6 months after the policy was set, the financial crisis started to take its toll on China's economy. After June 2008, the target of <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> was to ‘maintain growth, control prices, and optimise the structure’, with economic growth set as the top priority and price control as the second. Therefore, expansionary <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> replaced tight policy. As the financial crisis worsened, by the end of 2008, the general target was to ‘maintain, expand domestic demand, and optimise structure’. Inflation prevention was no longer one of the macro-economic goals and an expansionary policy was in full swing. The question is, in the first half of 2008, should China have opted for tight policy instead of the expansionary policies chosen by Western countries? [...]...|$|R

We argue that Japan’s main bank and financial keiretsu systems left corporate governance largely {{in the hands of}} creditors rather than shareholders. Thus, Japanese governance practices did not assign effective control rights to residual claimants.

The main portion of the paper considers {{a variety of methods}} for public financing of health and development projects.

The potential for redistribution from the defense to the health service industry is briefly considered. ...|$|R

40|$|Large {{segments}} of the population in poor countries con-tinue to suffer from a high level of unmet health needs, requiring macro-level, broad-based interventions. Healthy public policy, a key health promotion strategy, aims to put health on the agenda of policy makers across sectors and levels of government. <b>Macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> in develop-ing countries has thus far not adequately captured the attention of health promotion researchers. This paper argues that healthy public policy should not only be an objective in rich countries, but also in poor countries. This paper takes up this issue by reviewing the main macro-economic aid programs offered by international financial institutions as a response to economic crises and unmanageable debt burdens. Although health promotion researchers were largely absent during a key debate on structural adjustment programs and health during the 1980 s and 1990 s, the international <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> tool currently in play offers a new opportunity to partici-pate in assessing these policies, ensuring new forms of <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> interventions do not simply repro-duce patterns of (neoliberal) economics-dominated devel-opment policy.

The study attempts to draw parallels between the GEAR <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> framework and structural adjustment programmes in the South.

40|$|Who decides {{policy in}} a {{coalition}} government? The question {{is important to}} political scientists and presumably to voters. It plays {{a central role in}} a literature on government accountability and economic voting. Empirical analysis of policy-making, however, faces considerable challenges. This paper circumvents those challenges and infers <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy</b> using the actual record of the macro-economy in a specification based on Alesina’s rational partisan theory (Alesina, 1987). The testing strategy relies upon the variation we see in party control of different cabinet ministries under coalition government. According to rational partisan theory, partisan policy preferences will only have real effects on the economy after a surprise change in the macro-economic policy-maker, as after an election. By tabulating changes in party control of different ministerial positions with changes in the real economy, therefore, we can infer which cabinet positions actually confer policy rights and are decisive in <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy.</b> In particular, we can test whether the Minister of Finance has full power over <b>macro-economic</b> <b>policy,</b> as posited by Laver and Shepsle’s theory of ministerial discretion (1996). The analysis is implemented by extending Alesina’s model of rational partisan theory using a set of interaction terms that isolate the effect of party change in different positions and is estimated using data on government composition and ministerial appointments from Woldendorp, Keman and Budge (2000) and macro-economic data from the IMF and OECD...|$|R
