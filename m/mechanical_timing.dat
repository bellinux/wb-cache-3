50|$|Simple leaf {{shutters}} have {{a single}} leaf, or two leaves, which pivot so as to allow light through to the lens when triggered. If two leaves are used they have curved edges to create a roughly circular aperture. They typically have only one shutter speed and are commonly found in basic cameras, including disposable cameras.

50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI system type is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the ignition system compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor ignition system. The module type is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses <b>mechanical</b> <b>timing</b> controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain <b>mechanical</b> <b>timing</b> controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanically}} operated bellows injects a jet of {{air into}} the first chamber where ignition will take place. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>timing</b> lets fall a measured amount of powder fuel into the jet {{so that it is}} blown along and mixed with it. Under the control of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>timing</b> mechanism a smoldering fuse is introduced to this fuel air jet at the precise moment it passes the fuse location. The fuse then withdraws behind a metal plate. The now burning ball of powder and air travels though a wide nozzle into the main combustion chamber where a fast, almost explosive, burn takes place. The whole system now being almost airtight, a build-up of pressure follows. The pressure acts against the column of water in the exhaust pipe and expels it from the system. As the flow of exhaust gas moves into the tail pipe, it moves a loose piston in the combustion chamber which extracts and stores sufficient power to work the machines timing mechanisms. Energy from this piston is stored by lifting weights attached to a balance wheel. The return of this wheel to its lower position under the pull of the weights governs the timing for the next cycle by operating the bellows, fuel dispenser, the fuse and valves at the correct points in the cycle. The tail pipe, being under the boat, fills with water ready for the next discharge. The fall of the timing piston also expels the exhaust gases via a pipe above the ignition chamber, which is closed off by a valve during the burn part of the cycle.|$|E
50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to <b>mechanical</b> <b>timing</b> advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E

5000|$|Vickers {{pioneered the}} use of common rail {{injection}} in submarine engines. Vickers engines with the common rail fuel system were first used in 1916 in the G-class submarines. It used four plunger pumps to deliver a pressure of up to [...] every 90 degrees of rotation to keep the fuel pressure adequately constant in the rail. Fuel delivery to individual cylinders could be shut off via valves in the injector lines. Doxford Engines used a common rail system in their opposed-piston marine engines from 1921 to 1980, where a multi-cylinder reciprocating fuel pump generated a pressure of approximately , with the fuel being stored in accumulator bottles. [...] Pressure control was achieved {{by means of an}} adjustable pump discharge stroke and a [...] "spill valve". Camshaft-operated <b>mechanical</b> <b>timing</b> valves were used to supply the spring-loaded Brice/CAV/Lucas injectors, which injected through the side of the cylinder into the chamber formed between the pistons. Early engines had a pair of timing cams, one for ahead running and one for astern.

This system was used for the injection of both diesel oil and heavy fuel oil (600cSt heated to a temperature of approximately 130 °C).|$|E

40|$|A project {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the B. S. degree. Department of Mechanical Engineering ME 494 Since the first internal combustion engine was built the design has required a rotating camshaft to mechanically actuate the valve timing. The problem with actuating the valves on an engine with a camshaft is there are many added losses. Turning the camshaft consumes energy from the crankshaft which takes away from the overall power output; also the springs used to close the valves create {{a large amount of}} parasitic losses which take away from the engine performance. Some types of camshafts use a rocker arm assembly that requires many extra parts and adds a considerable amount of weight to the engine. Clearly, <b>mechanical</b> valve <b>timing</b> that uses a rotating camshaft has serious flaws; a new design that gets rid of the camshaft and its accessories could revolutionize the internal combustion engine. There are many companies competing to invent camless valve timing for engines, and all of which are at the basic R&D and prototyping stage. There are no camless four stroke engines being produced and sold on the market today. The objective of this project is to enter the camless actuation race and create a camless valve actuator that is driven by the forces from a piezoelectric crystal. Piezoelectric crystals expand when high voltage is applied to them. The expansion displacement is minimal, but the forces produced are impressive, making it undoubtedly possible to actuate the valves of an engine. Designing a new valve actuator that does not use a camshaft is greatly beneficial for many reasons. By eliminating the camshaft and the associated components, the engine design will be less complex, the overall timing components on the engine will weigh less, and the removed spring will reduce parasitic loss. Utilizing piezoelectric crystals and an electronic controller to actuate the valves and control the timing has the potential to increase the engine efficiency up to 20...|$|R

This study shows that the opening and closing of the mitral valve {{are related to the}} length of the previous heart cycle as demonstrated by the variations occuring in aluricular fibrillation. These variations in valve action are controlled by the pressure gradient between left auricle and ventricle. T HE vibrations of the heart sounds are an immediate manifestation of various mechanical activities of the heart,. and, when suitably recorded, provide an excellent way of timing events which comprise the car-diac cycle. It is important, therefore, to recog-nize the effect of disease on the time of occur-rence of these vibrations, their probable mode of production, and their relationship to other events in the cardiac cycle. It is agreed by most observers that the begin-ning of electrical activity in the heart muscle precedes mechanical activity as manifested by the vibrations of the first heart sound la, b, c; however, this discrepancy between mechanical and electrical events is more apparent than real. The spread of electrical activity in the myo-cardium occurs with extreme rapidity and, while mechanical contraction probably begins almost simultaneously, 2 a short interval of time is required to produce a significant shortening of the muscle fibers. During this initial phase of ventricular systole, a few low intensity, low frequency vibrations occur (first component of the first heart sound 3).

40|$|Background: Early {{defoliation}} is a viticultural practice {{aimed at}} crop control. So far, {{the impact of}} early leaf removal on the monomeric phenolic composition of wines has not been explored. This study examines the effects of early defoliation on the phenolic profile and content in Tempranillo wines. The influence of the defoliation method (manual vs <b>mechanical)</b> and the <b>timing</b> of leaf removal (pre-bloom vs fruit set) was investigated. Results: Over two consecutive seasons, 2007 and 2008, the monomeric phenolic composition in Tempranillo wines was studied by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection, and 22 compounds were identified and quantified. Overall, early defoliation led to wines more intensely coloured, of higher alcohol content and with larger concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and anthocyanins (in 2008 only for mechanical treatments). In the absence of fungal infection, resveratrol was found to increase in wines corresponding to early defoliation treatments. The method of leaf removal {{seemed to be more}} critical than the timing of intervention, and larger effects on wine phenolic composition were observed for mechanical treatments. Conclusion: Early defoliation proved to be an effective technique for improving the phenolic composition of Tempranillo wines, by favouring the accumulation of hydroxycinnamics, flavonols and anthocyanins. This is an important achievement, as wine quality is often described by its colour and phenolic attributes. Â© 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Effects of {{different}} hand rim diameters in wheelchair racing were studied {{with respect to}} physiological and technique parameters at five speed levels (N = 8 wheelchair sportsmen). In each of five subsequent 15 -min exercise tests on a treadmill, a different sized hand rim was mounted to the rear wheels (0. 3, 0. 35, 0. 38, 0. 47, 0. 56 m). In each test, speed increased with 0. 83 m. s- 1 every 3 min, starting at 0. 83 m. s- 1 and ranging up to 4. 17 m. s- 1 (slope: 0. 5 degrees). Cardiorespiratory responses (ventilation, oxygen cost, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, <b>mechanical</b> efficiency) and <b>timing</b> data (cycle time, push time, recovery time, push angle, and work per cycle) were obtained every 3 rd min, together with the movement pattern of trunk and arm segments. Clear effects of rim diameter and speed were seen for the physiological parameters (P less than 0. 05). In physiological terms, D 5 appeared the least beneficial, followed by D 4. Moreover, increasing rim diameter {{had a significant effect}} on movement pattern of the upper arm in the sagittal as well the frontal plane of motion. However, no timing effects were seen with changing rim diameter. On the other hand, timing parameters varied markedly with speed, whereas the segmental excursions of the upper limb did not show a "speed-effect". In general, small hand rims show lower cardiorespiratory responses. This {{may be related to the}} decreased segmental excursions of the upper limb and the lower linear hand velocity. Together with a low rolling and air drag, heart rate, and oxygen cost, these are important prerequisites in racing events. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Complementary {{metal oxide}} {{semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology has a minimum energy per operation, and that limitation {{is one of the}} myriad hurdles CMOS faces as it reaches small scales. This minimum energy is set by the balance between leakage energy and dynamic energy in subthreshold CMOS circuits, and sets floors on the achievable energy of digital units. A new, post-CMOS device with a sharper subthreshold slope than CMOS would be able to sidestep this minimum energy constraint. A candidate device called a nano-electromechancial (NEM) relay has recently emerged. NEM relays are small, integrated, capacitively-actuated, mechanical switches. The devices have demonstrated extremely high subthreshold slopes: ten orders of magnitude over a millivolt of swing. However, in the same lithographic process they are twenty times larger than a minimum sized CMOS device, their gate capacitance is ten times that of a minimum sized CMOS device, and their mechanical motion is an order of magnitude slower than a CMOS inverter. Can NEM relays improve digital systems even with these drawbacks?With proper circuit design, simulations say "yes". This dissertation examines three of the critical components of digital systems [...] logic, timing, and memory [...] and proposes NEM circuits which mitigate the weaknesses of the technology while achieving design goals. Simulations show that optimized relay logic, which arranges for all of the slow movement of relays to happen at the same time, can achieve an improvement of 10 x in energy-per-operation below the CMOS minimum energy point at a penalty of 10 x in delay and 3 x inarea. This logic style is experimentally demonstrated. In addition, relay latch based timing with staticization in the feedback path is simulated, which results in a working relay pipeline with zero <b>mechanical</b> delays of <b>timing</b> overhead. Finally, a new device called NEMory is proposed to build dense, non-volatile, mechanical memory. A hybrid NEMory/CMOS array is simulated, and its performance is compared to other memory solutions. The NEMory density is higher than any non-volatile memory except for multi-level cell, o-chip Flash, and its read and write energy are lower than any other non-volatile technology. Finally, the scaling and process limits of realizing mechanical devices are discussed in the context of future work...|$|R
