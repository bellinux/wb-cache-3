Rubber shock absorbers are light in weight and less costly also mounting of rubber shock absorbers is easy, they can mount using any mechanical mechanism. In critical situations, there are chances of death due to bleeding or damage to internal body parts because of vibrations produced. Use of rubber shock absorbers becomes helpful in such situations, since they can reduce the shocks to a minimum level. Hence while considering the importance of safety, this paper focuses on the effective use of this shock absorbers in hand lifting stretcher...|$|E
