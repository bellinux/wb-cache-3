5|$|The {{village has}} {{experienced}} significant population growth, {{with it and}} neighboring communities undergoing <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> growth than Westchester County overall. The period from 1950 to 1970 saw the greatest increase in population, with growth leveling off since then.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electric}} telegraph network expanded, {{allowing for the}} <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E

5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was written}} at a <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to the Chili Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, {{in order to}} arrange song structures and guitar riffs. They would then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide what they would use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E
5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinums {{physical}} dissimilarity to {{many other}} species in Boletales corresponds to {{a higher rate of}} genetic drift than average for the order. This trait is shared {{with other members of the}} Sclerodermatineae, which as a group have undergone <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> evolutionary change than the order as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of slow population growth in the 19th century and <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> growth in the 20th century. In particular over the past 40 years, in which the population of Northallerton has more than doubled. The fall in population between 1851 and 1871 {{has been attributed to}} the collapse in coaching as the railways became popular.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} tributaries are the Luana, the Lokwa and the Dule. The Luana, which runs almost {{parallel to the}} Kamtsha, is 20 m near its mouth. The two rivers flow {{on either side of}} a well-populated plateau. After the Luana has joined it, the river has no <b>more</b> <b>rapids</b> and is navigable down to the Kasai.|$|R

5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|These GTPases {{regulate}} cell motility, {{proliferation and}} {{also contribute to}} tumor progression and invasion. In many cell types, NEDD9 overexpression increases spreading and crescent morphology (an indicator of high motility). However, in fibroblasts, some work has found that absence of NEDD9 leads to <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> focal adhesion turnover, which led to increase of migration in NEDD9-/- compared to wild type.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{from natural}} {{processes}} or {{the activities of}} man, landscapes and their associated habitats change over time. There are the slow geomorphological changes associated with the geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence, and the <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> changes associated with earthquakes, landslides, storms, flooding, wildfires, coastal erosion, deforestation and changes in land use. Then there are the changes in habitats brought on by alterations in farming practices, tourism, pollution, fragmentation and climate change.|$|E
50|$|As <b>more</b> capable <b>rapid</b> {{reaction}} forces were established, earlier 'fire brigades', including the ACE Mobile Force (Land) ('AMF (L)'), were disbanded; AMF(L) was disbanded on 30 October 2002.|$|R

5000|$|Routes {{that begin}} with a [...] "2" [...] are Rapid routes. They make fewer stops than local and express routes, but run <b>more</b> frequently. <b>Rapid</b> routes run every 15 minutes.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the core has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E

50|$|By 1928 {{the line}} was electrified, with pre-pay {{stations}} - <b>more</b> a <b>rapid</b> transit line than a conventional railroad. However, due to the Great Depression, the BRB&L shut down on January 27, 1940.|$|R
5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times <b>more</b> <b>rapid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system. In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing the autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E

50|$|Going upstream: Vitim {{town where}} the Vitim joins the Lena. Mama and Mama Airport, about 130 km south of Vitim. A {{muscovite}} mica mine from 1705 until the late 1930s. Now a small settlement. Mamakan, on a west-flowing stretch 200 km south-southeast of Vitim. In 1961 a 86MW dam on a left tributary was completed, {{one of the first}} dams built on permafrost. Bodaybo, just upstream, a gold mining center founded in 1864. Upstream, the port of Luzhki was the start of a road to the Lena gold fields. From here upstream the river goes crookedly east and then south. About 240 km upstream from Bodaybo are the Uronsky Rapids and after 140 km <b>more,</b> the Parama <b>Rapids.</b> About 40 km or so upstream, the Vitim is crossed by the Baikal Amur Mainline between Taksimo and Kuanda. Upriver there are <b>more</b> <b>rapids</b> and goldfields. South through the Stanovoy Mountains toward Chita, then west into the Vitim Plateau east of Lake Baikal.|$|R

5|$|Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became <b>more</b> <b>rapid.</b> Between {{the height of}} the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting {{in an increase in}} the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> biological evolution as new niches emerge.|$|E
5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms lead to a <b>more</b> <b>rapid</b> achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E
50|$|Between the 1920s and 1940s, the coal-powered {{steam engines}} that pumped water in all plants except Fairmount were {{replaced}} by electric pumps. Between the late 1940s and the early 1960s, slow sand filters {{were replaced by}} <b>more</b> efficient <b>rapid</b> sand filters.|$|R
