A two-factor central composite design was adopted for studying the effects of <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> and electric potential on chlorine generation efficiency of electrolyzed deep ocean water. Deep ocean water was electrolyzed in a glass electrolyzing cell equipped with platinum-plated titanium anode and cathode. Results showed high electric efficiency at a low cell potential, and a high current density and high chlorine concentration at a high cell potential and low <b>electrode</b> <b>gap.</b> Current efficiency of the system was not significantly affected by <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> and electric potential. A small <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> reduced the required cell potential and resulted in high energy efficiency. The optimal choice of <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> and cell potential depends on the chlorine level of the electrolyzed deep ocean water to be produced, and a small <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> is preferred...|$|R

These are: <b>electrode</b> <b>gap,</b> melt rate, cooling rate, furnace annulus, furnace atmosphere and electrode quality (i. e. cleanliness and integrity). Of these variables, active, closed loop control is usually applied only to <b>electrode</b> <b>gap.</b> Other variables are controlled by controlling furnace operational parameters to preset schedules (e. g. melting current is ramped or held constant to control melt rate in an open loop fashion), through proper maintenance and calibration of equipment (e. g. to ensure proper cooling water and gas flow rates, or to accomplish an acceptable vacuum leak rate), through proper practice of procedures, and by maintaining electrode quality control. <b>Electrode</b> <b>gap</b> control is accomplished by controlling an <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> indicator such as drip-short frequency (or period) to a specified set-point.

40|$|Pseudospark-sourced {{electron}} beam is a self-focused intense {{electron beam}} which can propagate without any external focusing magnetic field. This electron beam can drive a beam-wave interaction directly or after being post-accelerated. It is especially suitable for terahertz (THz) radiation generation {{due to the}} ability of a pseudospark discharge to produce small size in the micron range and very high current density and bright electron beams. In this paper, a single-gap pseudospark discharge chamber has been built and tested with several <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separations to explore the dependence of the pseudospark-sourced electron beam current on the discharge voltage and the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separation. Experimental results show that the beam pulses have similar pulse width and delay time from the distinct drop of the applied voltage for smaller <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separations but longer delay time for the largest gap separation used in the experiment. It has been found that the electron beam only starts to occur when the charging voltage is above a certain value, which is defined as the starting voltage of the electron beam. The starting voltage is different for different <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separations and decreases with increasing <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separation in our pseudospark discharge configuration. The electron beam current increases with the increasing discharge voltage following two tendencies. Under the same discharge voltage, the configuration with the larger <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separation will generate higher electron beam current. When the discharge voltage is higher than 10 kV, the beam current generated at the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separation of 17. 0 mm, is much higher than that generated at smaller gap separations. The ionization of the neutral gas in the main gap is inferred to contribute more to the current increase with increasing <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> separation...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{control of}} the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> in a vacuum arc {{remelting}} (VAR) furnace has been a goal of melters for many years. The size of the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> has a direct influence on ingot solidification structure. At the high melting currents (30 to 40 kA) typically used for VAR of segregation insensitive Ti and Zr alloys, process voltage is used {{as an indicator of}} <b>electrode</b> <b>gap,</b> whereas drip-short frequency (or period) is usually used at the lower currents (5 to 8 kA) employed during VAR of superalloys. Modem controllers adjust electrode position or drive velocity to maintain a voltage or drip-short frequency (or period) set-point. Because these responses are non-linear functions of <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> and melting current, these controllers have a limited range for which the feedback gains are valid. Models are available that relate process voltage and drip-short frequency to <b>electrode</b> <b>gap.</b> These relationships may be used to linearize the controller feedback signal. An estimate of <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> may then be obtained by forming a weighted sum of the independent gap estimates obtained from the voltage and drip-short signals. By using multiple independent measures to estimate the gap, a controller that is less susceptible to process disturbances can be developed. Such a controller was designed, built and tested.

40|$|<b>Electrode</b> <b>gap</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} parameter for the safe and successful control of vacuum arc remelting (VAR), a process used extensively throughout the specialty metals industry for the production of nickel base alloys and aerospace titanium alloys. Optimal estimation theory has been applied to the problem of estimating <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> and a filter has been developed based on a model of the gap dynamics. Taking into account the uncertainty in the process inputs and noise in the measured process variables, the filter provides corrected estimates of <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> that have error variances two-to-three orders of magnitude less than estimates based solely on measurements for the sample times of interest. This is demonstrated through simulations and confined by tests on the VAR furnace at Sandia National Laboratories.

40|$|A great {{potential}} {{of the use of}} aluminum nitride (AlN) to enhance the actuation of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) microelectromechanical system disk resonators is revealed. A disk resonator with a unimorph (AlN/NCD) structure is fabricated by depositing a c-axis oriented AlN on a capacitive NCD disk resonator. The unimorph resonator is piezoelectrically actuated with flexural whispering gallery modes with a relatively large <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> spacing, i. e., the spacing which is greater than 1 mu m, although this is not possible for the capacitive NCD disk resonator. This result is explained by a finite element method simulation where the piezoelectric actuation turns out to be more effective than the capacitive actuation when the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> spacing is > 0. 8 mu m. The simulation also shows that the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> spacing required for the capacitive actuation to be more effective than the piezoelectric actuation exponentially decreases when the resonator dimension is scaled down for higher frequency operations.

40|$|Mean {{arc voltage}} {{is a process}} {{parameter}} commonly used in vacuum arc remelting (VAR) control schemes. The response of this parameter to changes in melting current (I) and <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> (g{sub e}) at constant pressure may be accurately described by an equation of the form V = V{sub 0 } + c{sub 1 }g{sub e}I + c{sub 2 }g{sub e}{sup 2 } + c{sub 3 }I{sup 2 }, where c{sub 1 }, c{sub 2 } and c{sub 3 } are constants, and where the non-linear terms generally constitute a relatively small correction. If the non-linear terms are ignored, the equation has the form of Ohm`s law with a constant offset (V{sub 0 }), c{sub 1 }g{sub e} {{playing the role of}} resistance. This implies that the arc column may be treated approximately as a simple resistor during constant current VAR, the resistance changing linearly with g{sub e}. The VAR furnace arc is known to originate from multiple cathode spot clusters situated randomly on the electrode tip surface. Each cluster marks a point of exist for conduction electrons leaving the cathode surface and entering the <b>electrode</b> <b>gap.</b> Because the spot clusters re highly localized on the cathode surface, each gives rise to an arc column that may be considered to operate independently of other local arc columns. This approximation is used to develop a model that accounts for the observed arc voltage dependence on <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> at constant current. Local arc column resistivity is estimated from elementary plasma physics and used to test the model for consistency by using it to predict local column heavy particle density. Furthermore, it is shown that the local arc column resistance increases as particle density increases. This is used to account for the common observation that the arc stiffens with increasing current, i. e. the arc voltage becomes more sensitive to changes in <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> as the melting current is increased. This explains why arc voltage is an accurate <b>electrode</b> <b>gap</b> indicator for high current VAR processes but not low current VAR processes...|$|R
