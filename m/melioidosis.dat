25|$|Person-to-person {{transmission}} is exceedingly unusual; and patients with <b>melioidosis</b> {{should not be}} considered contagious. Lab workers should handle B. pseudomallei under BSL-3 isolation conditions, as laboratory-acquired <b>melioidosis</b> has been described.|$|E
25|$|Patients with <b>melioidosis</b> {{usually have}} {{risk factors for}} disease, such as diabetes, thalassemia, {{hazardous}} alcohol use, or renal disease, and frequently give a history of occupational or recreational exposure to mud or pooled surface water. However, otherwise healthy patients, including children, may also get <b>melioidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Melioidosis</b> is a {{recognised}} {{disease in}} animals, including cats, goats, sheep, and horses. Cattle, water buffalo, and crocodiles {{are considered to}} be relatively resistant to <b>melioidosis</b> despite their constant exposure to mud. An outbreak at the Paris Zoo in the 1970s ("L’affaire du jardin des plantes") was thought to have originated from an imported panda.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis is extensive; <b>melioidosis</b> may mimic many other infections, including tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|A {{definite}} {{history of}} contact with soil may not be elicited, as <b>melioidosis</b> can be dormant for many years before manifesting. Attention should be paid to a history of travel to endemic areas in returned travellers. Some authors recommend considering possibility of <b>melioidosis</b> in every febrile patient {{with a history of}} traveling to and/or staying at endemic areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>melioidosis</b> {{is divided into}} two stages, an intravenous high-intensity phase and an eradication phase to prevent recurrence.|$|E
25|$|A {{serological}} test for <b>melioidosis</b> (indirect haemagglutination) is available, but not commercially in most countries. A high background titre {{may reduce the}} positive predictive value of {{serological test}}s in endemic countries. A specific direct immunofluorescent test and latex agglutination, based on monoclonal antibodies, are used widely in Thailand, but are not available elsewhere. Cross-reactivity with B.thailandensis is almost complete. A commercial ELISA kit for <b>melioidosis</b> appears to perform well. but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{considered}} for or {{known to be}} used as a weapon include anthrax, ebola, Marburg virus, plague, cholera, typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, brucellosis, Q fever, machupo, Coccidioides mycosis, Glanders, <b>Melioidosis,</b> Shigella, Psittacosis, Japanese B encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and smallpox.|$|E
25|$|A {{vaccine is}} in the process of being developed, but is not yet licensed. There is a fear that when a vaccine is licensed, {{financial}} constraints will make the vaccination an unrealistic factor for many countries that are suffering from high rates of <b>melioidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Burkholderia pseudomallei (also {{known as}} Pseudomonas pseudomallei) is a Gram-negative, bipolar, aerobic, motile {{rod-shaped}} bacterium. It is a soil-dwelling bacterium endemic in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, particularly in Thailand and northern Australia. It infects {{humans and animals}} and causes the disease <b>melioidosis.</b> It is also capable of infecting plants.|$|E
25|$|No {{vaccine is}} {{currently}} available, {{but a number}} of vaccine candidates have been suggested. Aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (asd) gene deletion mutants are auxotrophic for diaminopimelate (DAP) in rich media and auxotrophic for DAP, lysine, methionine, and threonine in minimal media. The Δasd bacterium (bacterium with the asd gene removed) protects against inhalational <b>melioidosis</b> in mice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Melioidosis</b> is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by a}} Gram-negative bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, found in soil and water. It is of public health importance in endemic areas, particularly in northeast Thailand, Vietnam, and northern Australia. It exists in acute and chronic forms. Signs and symptoms may include pain in chest, bones, or joints; cough; skin infections, lung nodules, and pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Ashdown's medium, a {{selective}} medium containing gentamicin, {{may be required}} for cultures taken from nonsterile sites. Burkholderia cepacia medium may be a useful alternative selective medium in nonendemic areas, where Ashdown's is not available. A new medium derived from Ashdown, known as Francis medium, may help differentiate B. pseudomallei from B. cepacia and may help in the early diagnosis of <b>melioidosis,</b> but {{has not yet been}} extensively clinically validated.|$|E
25|$|In up to 25% of patients, no {{focus of}} {{infection}} is found and {{the diagnosis is}} usually made on blood cultures or throat swab. <b>Melioidosis</b> {{is said to be}} able to affect any organ in the body except the heart valves (endocarditis). Although meningitis has been described secondary to ruptured brain abscesses, primary meningitis has not been described. Less common manifestations include intravascular infection, lymph node abscesses (1.22.2%), pyopericardium and myocarditis, mediastinal infection, and thyroid and scrotal abscesses and ocular infection.|$|E
25|$|Without {{access to}} {{appropriate}} antibiotics (principally ceftazidime or meropenem), the septicemic form of <b>melioidosis</b> exceeds 90% in mortality rate. With appropriate antibiotics, {{the mortality rate}} is about 10% for uncomplicated cases but up to 80% for cases with bacteraemia or severe sepsis. It seems certain that access to intensive care facilities is also important, and probably at least partially explains why total mortality is 20% in Northern Australia but 40% in Northeast Thailand. Response to appropriate antibiotic treatment is slow, with the average duration of fever following treatment being 5 to 9 days.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic <b>melioidosis</b> {{is usually}} {{defined by a}} {{duration}} of symptoms greater than two months and occurs in about 10% of patients. The clinical presentation of chronic <b>melioidosis</b> is protean and includes such presentations as chronic skin infections, chronic lung nodule, and pneumonia. In particular, chronic <b>melioidosis</b> closely mimics tuberculosis, and has sometimes been called [...] "Vietnamese tuberculosis".|$|E
2500|$|Nightcliff gardener's disease (Nightcliff is {{a suburb}} of Darwin, Australia where <b>melioidosis</b> is endemic) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} risk factor for developing <b>melioidosis</b> is diabetes mellitus, followed by hazardous alcohol use, chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung disease. Other risk factors include thalassaemia, occupation (rice paddy farmers), and cystic fibrosis. [...] The mode of infection {{is believed to be}} through either a break in the skin, or the inhalation of aerosolized B. pseudomallei cells. Person-to-person spread has been described, but is extremely unusual. HIV infection does not predispose to <b>melioidosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the {{subgroup}} of patients where an inoculating event was noted, the mean incubation period of acute <b>melioidosis</b> was 9 days (range 121 days). Patients with latent <b>melioidosis</b> may be symptom-free for decades; the longest period between presumed exposure and clinical presentation is 62 years. The potential for prolonged incubation was recognized in US servicemen {{involved in the}} Vietnam War, and {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Vietnam time-bomb". A wide spectrum of severity exists; in chronic presentations, symptoms may last months, but fulminant infection, particularly associated with near-drowning, may present with severe symptoms over hours.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Melioidosis</b> is endemic {{in parts}} [...] of {{southeast}} Asia (including Thailand, Laos, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Burma and Vietnam), China, Taiwan and northern Australia. Flooding can increase its extent, including flooding in central Australia. Multiple cases {{have also been}} described in Hong Kong and Brunei India, and sporadic cases in Central and South America, the Middle East, the Pacific and several African countries. Although only one case of <b>melioidosis</b> has ever been reported in Bangladesh, at least five cases have been imported to the UK from that country. Recent news reports indicate B.pseudomallei has been isolated from soil in Bangladesh, but this remains to be verified scientifically. This suggests that <b>melioidosis</b> is endemic to Bangladesh and that a problem of underdiagnosis or under-reporting exists there. most likely {{due to a lack}} of adequate laboratory facilities in affected rural areas. A high isolation frequency (percentage of positive soil samples) was found in east Saravan in rural Lao PDR distant from the Mekong River, thought by the investigators to be the highest geometric mean concentration in the world (about 464 (25-10,850 CFU/g soil).|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{drainage}} {{is usually}} indicated for prostatic abscesses and septic arthritis, may be indicated for parotid abscesses, {{and is not}} usually indicated for hepatosplenic abscesses. In bacteraemic <b>melioidosis</b> unresponsive to intravenous antibiotic therapy, splenectomy has been attempted, but only anecdotal evidence [...] supports this practice.|$|E
2500|$|Intravenous {{ceftazidime}} is {{the current}} drug of choice for treatment of acute <b>melioidosis</b> and should be administered 10 to 14 days after getting the infection. Meropenem, imipenem and the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination (Sulperazone) are also active. [...] Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav) may be used if {{none of the above}} four drugs is available, but it produces inferior outcomes. Intravenous antibiotics are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, and are not usually stopped until the patient's temperature has returned to normal for more than 48 hours. Even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, fevers often persist for weeks or months, and patients may continue to develop new lesions even while on appropriate treatment. The median fever clearance time in <b>melioidosis</b> is 10 days: and failure of the fever to clear is not a reason to alter treatment. It is not uncommon for patients to require [...] treatment continuously for a month or more.|$|E
2500|$|A {{complete}} screen (blood culture, sputum culture, urine culture, throat swab, {{and culture}} of any aspirated pus) should be performed on all patients with suspected <b>melioidosis</b> (culture on blood agar as well as Ashdown's medium). A definitive diagnosis is made by growing B. pseudomallei from any site. [...] A throat swab is not sensitive, but is 100% specific if positive, and compares favourably with sputum culture. [...] The sensitivity of urine culture is increased if a centrifuged specimen is cultured, and any bacterial growth should be reported (not just growth above 104 organisms/ml which is the usual cutoff). [...] Very occasionally, bone marrow culture may be positive in patients who have negative blood cultures for B.pseudomallei, {{but these are not}} usually recommended. [...] A common error made by clinicians unfamiliar with <b>melioidosis</b> is to send a specimen from only the affected site (which is the usual procedure for most other infections) instead of sending a full screen.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1989, the {{standard}} treatment for acute <b>melioidosis</b> was a three-drug combination of chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline; this regimen {{is associated with}} a mortality rate of 80% and is no longer be used unless no other alternatives are available. [...] All three drugs are bacteriostatic (they stop the bacterium from growing, but do not kill it) and the action of co-trimoxazole antagonizes both chloramphenicol and doxycycline.|$|E
2500|$|In vitro, optimal {{proliferation}} {{temperature is}} reported around 40°C in neutral or slightly acidic environments (pH [...] 6.8–7.0). The majority of strains {{are capable of}} fermentation of sugars without gas formation (most importantly, glucose and galactose; older cultures are reported to also metabolize maltose and starch). Bacteria produce both exo- and [...] endotoxins. [...] The role of the toxins identified {{in the process of}} <b>melioidosis</b> symptom development has not been fully elucidated.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in <b>melioidosis</b> {{has been}} {{expressed}} {{because it has}} the potential to be developed as a biological weapon. [...] It is classed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as a category B agent. B. pseudomallei, like B. mallei which causes glanders, was studied by the US as a potential biological warfare agent, but never weaponized. [...] The Soviet Union was reported to have also experimented with B. pseudomallei as a biological warfare agent.|$|E
2500|$|B. pseudomallei was {{previously}} classed {{as part of}} the Pseudomonas genus; until 1992, it was known as Pseudomonas pseudomallei. It is phylogenetically related closely to Burkholderia mallei which causes glanders, an infection primarily of horses, donkeys, and mules. The name <b>melioidosis</b> is derived from the Greek melis (μηλις) meaning [...] "a distemper of asses" [...] with the suffixes -oid meaning [...] "similar to" [...] and -osis meaning [...] "a condition", that is, a condition similar to glanders.|$|E
2500|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} is ceftazidime. While various antibiotics are active in vitro (e.g., chloramphenicol, doxycycline, co-trimoxazole), they have been proven to be inferior in vivo {{for the treatment of}} acute <b>melioidosis.</b> Disc diffusion tests are unreliable when looking for co-trimoxazole resistance in B.pseudomallei (they greatly overestimate resistance) and Etests or agar dilution tests should be used in preference. The actions of co-trimoxazole and doxycycline are antagonistic, which suggests [...] these two drugs ought not to be used together.|$|E
2500|$|A {{statistical}} model {{indicated that the}} incidence will be 165,000 cases per year in 2016 (95% confidence interval, 68,000 to 412,000), with 138,000 of those occurring in East and South Asia and the Pacific. In {{about half of those}} cases, people will die. Northeast Thailand has the highest incidence of <b>melioidosis</b> recorded in the world (an average incidence of 12.7 cases per 100,000 people per year). [...] In Northeast Thailand, 80% of children are positive for antibodies against B. pseudomallei by the age of 4; the figures are lower {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with <b>melioidosis</b> usually {{present with}} fever. Pain or other {{symptoms}} may be suggestive of a clinical focus, which {{is found in}} around 75% of patients. Such symptoms include cough or pleuritic chest pain suggestive of pneumonia, bone or joint pain suggestive of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, or cellulitis. Intra-abdominal infection (including liver and/or splenic abscesses, or prostatic abscesses) do not usually present with focal pain, and imaging of these organs using ultrasound or computed tomography should be performed routinely. In one series of 214 patients, 27.6% had abscesses in the liver or spleen (95% confidence interval, 22.0% to 33.9%). B. pseudomallei abscesses may have a characteristic [...] "honeycomb" [...] or [...] "swiss cheese" [...] architecture (hypoechoic, multiseptate, multiloculate) on CT.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic <b>melioidosis</b> {{is usually}} {{defined by a}} {{duration}} of symptoms greater than two months and occurs in about 10% of patients.
