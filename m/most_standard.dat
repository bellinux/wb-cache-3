5|$|A related {{issue to}} the classic horizon problem arises because in <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> cosmological {{inflation}} models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should {{not be able to}} prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E
5|$|All {{standard}} production Type 26s have checked pattern grip panels {{as well as}} original finished characteristics. <b>Most</b> <b>standard</b> production revolvers have a serial number that is between 1,000 and 58,900. Many of the {{standard production}} models suffered from extreme wear because of the long military service the revolvers served.|$|E
5|$|English has {{undergone}} many historical sound changes, {{some of them}} affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. <b>Most</b> <b>standard</b> varieties {{are affected by the}} Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.|$|E

5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. <b>Most</b> <b>standard</b> meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|<b>Most</b> <b>standard</b> {{programs}} {{written for}} DOS {{did not necessarily}} need 640kb or more of memory. Instead, driver software and utilities referred to as Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs {{could be used in}} addition to the standard DOS software. These drivers and utilities typically permanently used some conventional memory, reducing the total available for standard DOS programs.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> infantry weaponry, {{so they must}} be targeted with specific heavy weapons (e.g. anti-tank rockets) to be destroyed. Vehicles can also be upgraded with multiple weapon systems, usually forcing a choice between either anti-infantry or anti-vehicle armaments. Walkers are a type of vehicle often armed with powerful heavy melee weapons, causing devastating damage in close combat.|$|E

25|$|APR is {{dependent}} on the time period for which the loan is calculated. That is, the APR for one loan with a 30-year loan duration cannot be compared to the APR for another loan with a 20-year loan duration. APR can be used to show the relative impact of different payment schedules (such as balloon payments or bi-weekly payments instead of straight monthly payments), but <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> APR calculators have difficulty with those calculations.|$|E
25|$|The {{physically}} handicapped {{are often}} welcome {{to compete in}} chess tournaments. Although the Blind Chess Olympiad {{is the most significant}} chess event for the blind and visually impaired, players in either group can participate at <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> tournaments including international ones.

25|$|German-born British {{engineer}} Augustus Siebe {{developed the}} standard diving dress in the 1830s. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design - a helmet fitted {{to a full}} length watertight canvas diving suit.

50|$|In practice, <b>most</b> <b>standards</b> specify {{presetting}} {{the register}} to all-ones and inverting the CRC before transmission. This {{has no effect}} on the ability of a CRC to detect changed bits, but gives it the ability to notice bits that are added to the message.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> <b>standards</b> are voluntary—there are no laws {{requiring}} their application.

25|$|Clark Development Company (CDC) {{pioneered the}} FILE ID.DIZ format {{as well as}} a {{powerful}} scripting language (PPL), which supported modifications and to a large degree replacement of <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> commands and processes. A compiled interpreter script written in PPL was called PPE (PCBoard Programming Executable). PPEs were generated by the PCBoard Programming Language Compiler (PPLC), which was an optional tool provided by Clark Development Company and was also available for purchase as stand alone tool. It was less than $100 by itself and less than $50 in combination with any BBS license. This allowed programmers to develop PPEs for PCBoard without having to purchase a PCBoard BBS license.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipeline}} {{is operated}} {{at a higher}} pressure than other gas pipelines in the UK: 94 bar (1364 psi) instead of 85 bar (1231 psi). This pressure is higher than <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> pipelines worldwide and will increase the chance of pipe leak and corrosion, though other such high-pressure pipelines have been successfully run in Germany, for example. It is buried 1.2 metres underground {{for most of the}} route. National Grid replaced, levelled and cultivated the large amount of vegetation, subsoil and topsoil which had been removed to a width in places of a dual carriageway in an attempt to restore the land to its original condition. They consulted and used a wide range of environmental experts to help restore the environment.|$|E
25|$|Modern maps of Oz {{are almost}} universally drawn with the Winkies {{in the west}} and the Munchkins in the east, {{although}} west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing <b>most</b> <b>standard</b> compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass in which everything was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book The Number of the Beast he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's The Magic Mirror of Oz attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.|$|E
