25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{accident}} Whymper asked Taugwalder to see the rope and to his surprise he {{saw that it was}} the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought and it was only intended as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a <b>Manila</b> <b>rope,</b> or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, Hilberry joined {{what would}} become the Manhattan Project, the effort to create an atomic bomb during World War II. He moved to the University of Chicago to help Arthur H. Compton in any way possible. Hilberry became {{associate}} director of Compton's Metallurgical Project. On December 2, 1942, he was present for the start up of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor to achieve criticality. Because of fears that the reaction could [...] "run away", Hilberry stood ready with an axe to cut the scram line, a <b>manila</b> <b>rope</b> connected to control rods that could quickly shut the reactor down. He was also present for the start-up of the X-10 Graphite Reactor in November 1943, and the reactors at the Hanford Engineer Works the following year. He returned to the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in 1945.|$|E
50|$|Special {{gangs of}} men worked {{together}} on the viaduct maintenance. To reach timbers below the deck they worked from 2.5 in <b>manila</b> <b>ropes.</b> It was possible {{to work on the}} viaduct without closing the viaduct to trains, but a temporary 10 mph speed restriction was enforced until the replacement was properly in place. The actual movement of the larger timbers was carried out on a Sunday when there were few trains operating.|$|R
5000|$|The ladders {{are made}} by {{threading}} and fixing a series of hardwood, machined steps, each not more than 400mm x 115mm x 25mm, onto two pairs of minimum 18mm diameter <b>manila</b> <b>ropes,</b> and binding each step to the ropes at 310mm (+- 5mm) intervals. At a maximum interval of 8 steps, the standard step {{is replaced by a}} spreader, which is an elongated version of the standard machined step, with a minimum length of 1.8 m. The spreader's function is to prevent the ladder from twisting in the prevailing weather conditions when in use.|$|R
2500|$|The Nose {{was first}} climbed in 1958 by Warren Harding, Wayne Merry and George Whitmore in 47 days using [...] "siege" [...] tactics: {{climbing}} in an expedition style using fixed ropes {{along the length}} of the route, linking established camps along the way. The fixed <b>manila</b> <b>ropes</b> allowed the climbers to ascend and descend from the ground up throughout the 18-month project, although they presented unique levels of danger as well, sometimes breaking due to the long exposure to cold temperatures. The climbing team relied heavily on aid climbing, using rope, pitons and expansion bolts to make it to the summit. The second ascent of The Nose was in 1960 by Royal Robbins, Joe Fitschen, Chuck Pratt and Tom Frost, who took seven days in the first continuous climb of the route without siege tactics. The first solo climb of The Nose was done by Tom Bauman in 1969. The first ascent of The Nose in one day was accomplished in 1975 by John Long, Jim Bridwell and Billy Westbay. Today, The Nose typically takes fit climbers 4â€“5 days of full climbing, and has a success rate of around 60%.|$|R
2500|$|Mooring {{lines are}} usually made from <b>manila</b> <b>rope</b> or a {{synthetic}} material such as nylon. Nylon {{is easy to}} work with and lasts for years, but it is highly elastic. This elasticity has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that during an event, such as a high wind or the close passing of another ship, stress can be spread across several lines. However, should a highly stressed nylon line break, it may part catastrophically, causing snapback, which can fatally injure bystanders. The effect of snapback is analogous to stretching a rubber band to its breaking point between your hands and then suffering a stinging blow from its suddenly flexing broken ends. Such a blow from a heavy mooring line carries much more force and can inflict severe injuries or even sever limbs. [...] Mooring lines made from materials such as Dyneema and Kevlar have much less elasticity and are therefore much safer to use. However, such lines do not float on water and they do tend to sink. In addition, they are relatively more expensive than other sorts of line.|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} ensued as {{to whether}} the rope had actually been cut, but a formal investigation could not find any proof, and Peter Taugwalder was acquitted. The rope had snapped between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. Whymper asked Taugwalder to see the rope and to his surprise he saw that it was the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought and it was only intended as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a <b>Manila</b> <b>rope,</b> or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done. It can be deduced that Taugwalder had no other choice but to use a weaker rope as the stronger rope was not long enough to connect Traugwalder to Douglas. The account of Whymper's attempts on the Matterhorn occupies the greater part of his book, Scrambles amongst the Alps (1871), in which the illustrations are engraved by Whymper himself. [...] The accident haunted Whymper: ...|$|E

5000|$|Delaware used an {{execution}} protocol written by Fred Leuchter. This specifies {{the use of}} 30 ft of 0.75 in diameter <b>Manila</b> hemp <b>rope,</b> boiled to take out stretch and any tendency to coil. The area of the rope sliding inside the knot was lubricated with melted paraffin wax {{to allow it to}} slide freely. A black hood is specified by the protocol, as is a sandbag to test the trap door and a [...] "collapse board" [...] to which a prisoner can be strapped if necessary.|$|R
50|$|A hemp fly system, {{so named}} for the <b>manila</b> hemp <b>rope</b> that was once common in {{theatrical}} rigging, it was previously {{believed to be the}} oldest type of fly system. It is the simplest type of fly system. Recent research shows that the hemp system, although known for centuries, was not much used. The hemp system gained popularity first in the United States in the mid nineteenth century. It soon gained popularity in England, as it was inexpensive and provided a great deal of flexibility for moving scenery. Hemp systems are also known as rope line systems, or simply as rope systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{brothers}} {{found that}} paper {{made from a}} scrap pile of <b>manila</b> bolt <b>ropes</b> cut from old sails was very strong and suitable for industrial applications; they were granted a patent by the U.S. Patent Office for the manufacture of paper from manila fiber. In 1852 Lyman Hollingsworth purchased an existing paper mill {{on the site of}} the present West Groton Mill of Hollingsworth & Vose Company. Until 1881 it was used to manufacture paper from jute and manila for tag paper, pattern paper, abrasive backing, and wrapping paper. These products were sold both domestically and abroad.|$|R
6000|$|In the tool-box by {{the drum}} {{he found an}} old monkey-wrench and a short bar of iron, also a coil of fairly new <b>Manila</b> <b>rope.</b> He looked in vain {{for a piece of}} board with which to rig a [...] "boatswain's chair." [...] There was nothing at hand but large planks, which he had no means of sawing, so he was {{compelled}} to do without the more comfortable form of saddle.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} that Jocelyn should not feel a tender impulsion towards this attractive and once independent woman, who from every worldly {{point of view}} was an excellent match for him--a superior match, indeed, except in money. He took her hand again and held it awhile, and a faint wave of gladness seemed to flow through her. But no--he could go no further. That island girl, in her coquettish Sunday frock and little hat with its bunch of cock's feathers held him as by strands of <b>Manila</b> <b>rope.</b> He dropped Nichola's hand.|$|E
60|$|Later on, in {{the fall}} of the year, he saved John Thornton's life in quite another fashion. The three {{partners}} were lining a long and narrow poling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans and Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin <b>Manila</b> <b>rope</b> from tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the bank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off his master.|$|E
50|$|Lift and {{operating}} lines were commonly made of <b>manila</b> hemp. The <b>rope</b> was {{often referred to}} simply as manila. Use of manila {{had a number of}} issues. Splinters of fiber could get into hands and eyes. Humidity and temperature changes could significantly affect the length of the rope. Over time the rope slowly rots.|$|R
5000|$|Manila {{paper was}} {{originally}} {{made out of}} old <b>Manila</b> hemp <b>ropes</b> which were extensively used on ships, having replaced true hemp. It was made from Manila hemp (also called abacÃ¡) or Musa textilis which is grown in The Philippines and hence the association with Manila, the capital of that country. Abaca is an exceptionally strong fibre, nowadays used for special papers like teabag tissue. It is also very expensive, priced several times higher than woodpulp, hence the change to that fibre for what is still called Manillaâ€”usually with two [...] "ll"s. More recently new woodpulp has often been replaced with {{a high proportion of}} recycled fibre. True manila hemp folders would have been much tougher and long lasting than modern folders.|$|R
40|$|Food safety risks due to Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 may be {{affected}} by variability in prevalence in or on live cattle at slaughter. Our objectives were to assess the prevalence and risk factors associated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 in feedlot pens immediately prior to slaughter, and assess relationships among methods of monitoring the E. coli O 157 :H 7 status of pre-harvest pens. We studied 84 pens containing a total of nearly 27 000 head of cattle in commercial feedlots in Alberta during 2003 and 2004. Sampling devices (ROPES) prepared from <b>manila</b> <b>ropes</b> were used to detect high prevalence pens. Forty of 84 pens (48 %) were classified ROPES-positive. Within pens, fecal prevalence ranged between 0 % to 80 % (median = 20 %) and the hide prevalence ranged between 0 % and 30 % (median = 0 %). Pens that were ROPES-positive had a higher median prevalence for feces (40 %) and for hides (3. 8 %) than those that were ROPES-negative (13. 3 % and 0 %, respectively). The prevalence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in pens immediately prior to slaughter {{was found to be}} quite high or very low even within feedlots and seasons. Factors such as sampling month, temperature, precipitation, pen floor conditions, and water tank cleanliness were associated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 outcome measures, although associated factors were not completely consistent among years and outcome measures. Fecal and hide prevalence are considered primary pre-harvest indicators of potential carcass contamination, but other methods such as ROPES that are associated with these outcomes may provide logistic advantages to efficiently classify pens of cattle as high or low risk to food safety...|$|R

From her {{scuppers}} she ran clear water, and the men were in haste and worked hard at the pumps. On the bow stood a mighty man, watching the depth of the water and giving commands with a voice of thunder. His eyes were of the pale blue of the deep waters, and his head was maned like that of a sea lion. And his hair was yellow, like the straw of a southern harvest or the <b>manila</b> <b>rope</b> yarns which sailormen plait.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was rough}} on Gilson. Such was the terse, cold, but not {{altogether}} unsympathetic {{judgment of the}} better public opinion at Mammon Hill--the dictum of respectability. The verdict of the opposite, or rather the opposing, element--the element that lurked red-eyed and restless about Moll Gurney's [...] "deadfall," [...] while respectability took it with sugar at Mr. Jo. Bentley's gorgeous [...] "saloon"--was to {{pretty much the same}} general effect, though somewhat more ornately expressed by the use of picturesque expletives, which it is needless to quote. Virtually, Mammon Hill was a unit on the Gilson question. And it must be confessed that in a merely temporal sense all was not well with Mr. Gilson. He had that morning been led into town by Mr. Brentshaw and publicly charged with horse stealing; the sheriff meantime busying himself about The Tree with a new <b>manila</b> <b>rope</b> and Carpenter Pete being actively employed between drinks upon a pine box about the length and breadth of Mr. Gilson. Society having rendered its verdict, there remained between Gilson and eternity only the decent formality of a trial.|$|E

2500|$|Penn 's {{commanding}} officer, Commander J.H. Swain RN, offered Captain Mason a tow {{with a heavy}} 10-inch <b>manila</b> hemp <b>rope.</b> With the {{tow line}} in place, Penn moved ahead, straining its engines to the limit; Ohio continued to list to port. The two ships were not making any progress, even drifting backwards due to the easterly wind. Now both ships were sitting ducks, and as another serious attack developed, the destroyer went to full speed to part the tow. A German bomber dived on the tanker and was shot down by Ohio 's gunners, but just before its demise, the aircraft's crew released its cargo. A bomb hit the tanker just where the initial torpedo had hit her, effectively breaking her back, just as night was setting in. The ship was abandoned for the night. The day after, Penn was joined by the minesweeper [...] The two ships towed the tanker and succeeded in making up to five knots, overcoming the tendency to swing to port. Another attack blasted the group of ships, snapping the tow lines and immobilising Ohios rudder. Another bomb hit the fore end of the front deck, forcing the engineers out of the engine room. Once more, Mason gave the order to abandon ship, as two more air attacks narrowly missed the tanker. A superficial examination showed that the rent that had developed in the amidships section had widened and that the ship had indeed almost certainly broken her back.|$|R
50|$|<b>Manila</b> <b>rope</b> is very durable, flexible, and {{resistant}} to salt water damage, allowing {{its use in}} rope, hawsers, ships' lines, and fishing nets. It {{can be used to}} make handcrafts like bags, carpets, clothing, furniture, and hangings.|$|E

50|$|Manila ropes shrink {{when they}} become wet. This effect can be {{advantageous}} under certain circumstances, {{but if it is}} not a wanted feature, it should be well taken into account. Since shrinkage is more pronounced the first time the rope becomes wet, new rope is usually immersed into water and put to dry before use so that the shrinkage is less than it would be if the rope had never been wet. A major disadvantage in this shrinkage is that many knots made with <b>manila</b> <b>rope</b> became harder and more difficult to untie when wet, thus becoming subject of increased stress. <b>Manila</b> <b>rope</b> will rot after a period of time when exposed to saltwater.|$|E
