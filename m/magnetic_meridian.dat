It functions as a pointer to [...] "magnetic north", the local <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> because the magnetized needle at its heart aligns itself with the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field.

[...] The needle is mounted on a low-friction pivot point, in better compasses a jewel bearing, so it can turn easily.

When {{the plate}} {{was in the}} <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>meridian,</b> {{or in any other}} plane coinciding with the magnetic dip, then its rotation produced no effect upon the galvanometer. When inclined to the dip but a few degrees, electricity began to appear upon rotation. Thus when standing upright in a plane perpendicular to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> and when consequently its own plane was inclined only about 20° to the dip, revolution of the plate evolved electricity. As the inclination was increased, the electricity became more powerful until the angle formed by the plane of the plate with the dip was 90°, when the electricity for a given velocity of the plate was a maximum.|$|E

40|$|Equatorial ionospheric {{responses}} {{during two}} magnetic storms of moderate intensity are investigated, {{for the first}} time, by conjugate point observations in Brazil. The study focuses on storm-induced changes in the evening prereversal vertical drift, thermospheric trans-equatorial winds, spread F/plasma bubble irregularity development, electron density/plasma frequency heights, the EIA strength, and zonal plasma drifts. It is based on data obtained from five Digisondes operated in Brazil, three of them {{being part of a}} conjugate point equatorial experiment (COPEX) involving a dip equatorial and two magnetic conjugate sites at +/- 12 degrees. The other two were operated at the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) trough and crest locations at nearby <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridians.</b> The results bring out, and clarify, many outstanding aspects of the strong influence of storm time electric fields on the equatorial ionosphere at different phases of the two long lasting storm sequences. During both storms prompt penetration electric fields dominated the ionospheric response features as compared to the disturbance wind dynamo effects that were not very conspicuous. An under-shielding (over-shielding) electric field occurring in the evening hours causes enhancement (suppression) of the prereversal vertical drift and post sunset spread F/plasma bubble generation. The same electric fields cause post sunset EIA enhancement and suppression, respectively. Post sunset (post midnight) spread F can develop from under-shielding (over-shielding) electric fields, while it can be disrupted by over-shielding (under-shielding) electric field. Trans-equatorial winds are found to be ineffective to stabilize the post sunset F region against the destabilizing effect of strong prereversal vertical drift. Storm time westward plasma drifts are found to be driven by prompt penetration eastward electric fields (through their effect of inducing vertical Hall electric fields), rather than by a disturbance westward thermospheric wind during these storms.

Upon {{adjusting}} the needles {{to the plane}} of the magnetic meridian; arranging the ball {{on the outside of the}} glass jar to the west of the needles, and at such a height that its centre should correspond horizontally with the upper needle, whilst its axis was in {{the plane of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> but perpendicular to the dip; and then rotating the ball, the needle was immediately affected. Upon inverting the direction of rotation, the needle was again affected, but in the opposite direction. When the ball revolved from east over to west, the marked pole went eastward; when the ball revolved in the opposite direction, the marked pole went westward or towards the ball. Upon placing the ball to the east of the needles, still the needle was deflected in the same way; i.e. when the ball revolved from east over to west, the marked pole wont eastward (or towards the ball); when the rotation was in the opposite direction, the marked pole went westward.|$|E

The {{relation}} of the current of electricity produced in the wire, to its motion, may be understood by supposing the convolutions at the galvanometer away, and the wire arranged as a rectangle, with its lower edge horizontal and in {{the plane of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> and a magnetic needle suspended above and over the middle part of this edge, and directed by the earth (fig. 30.). On passing {{the upper part of the}} rectangle from west to east into the position represented by the dotted line, the marked pole of the magnetic needle went west; the electric current was therefore from north to south in the part of the wire passing under the needle, and from south to north in the moving or upper part of the parallelogram. On passing the upper part of the rectangle from east to west over the galvanometer, the marked pole of the needle went east, and the current of electricity was therefore the reverse of the former.|$|E

I did {{not think}} it {{impossible}} that some natural difference might occur between bodies, relative to the intensity of the current produced or tending to be produced in them by magneto-electric induction, which might be shown by opposing them to each other; especially as Messrs. Arago, Babbage, Herschel, and Harris, have all found great differences, not only between the metals and other substances, but between the metals themselves, in their power of receiving motion from or giving it to a magnet in trials by revolution (130.). I therefore took two wires, each one hundred and twenty feet long, one of iron and the other of copper. These were connected with each other at their ends, and then extended {{in the direction of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> so as to form two nearly parallel lines, nowhere in contact except at the extremities. The copper wire was then divided in the middle, and examined by a delicate galvanometer, but no evidence of an electrical current was obtained.|$|E
40|$|The OGO- 6 {{electric}} field measurements {{make it clear}} that the general pattern of high latitude {{electric field}}s in magnetic time-invariant latitude coordinates is not highly variable and that when unusual variations, or field distributions, occur they are relatively isolated in time and spatial extent. Thus, electric field changes on a global scale cannot, in general, be evoked as a direct cause of substorms. Polar traverses along the 18 (h) to 6 (h) <b>magnetic</b> time <b>meridian</b> show that the sum of potential drops across the evening auroral belt and morning auroral belt approximately equals the potential drop across the polar cap. The integrated polar cap potential drop ranges from 20 to 100 keV and values in the center of this range are most common under conditions of moderate magnetic disturbance. Roughly near 18 (h) magnetic local time, a latitudinally narrow strip at the transition between auroral belt and polar cap fields exhibits unusually large field fluctuations immediately following the sudden onset of a negative bay at later magnetic local times. It appears likely that this spatially isolated correlation is related to an effect rather than a cause of substorm enhancement...|$|R

Upon {{considering}} {{the effects of}} terrestrial magneto-electric induction which have now been described, {{it is almost impossible}} to resist the impression that similar effects, but infinitely greater in force, may be produced by the action of the globe, as a magnet, upon its own mass, in consequence of its diurnal rotation. It would seem that if a bar of metal be laid in these latitudes on the surface of the earth parallel to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> a current of electricity tends to pass through it from south to north, in consequence of the travelling of the bar from west to east (172.), by the rotation of the earth; that if another bar in the same direction be connected with the first by wires, it cannot discharge the current of the first, because it has an equal tendency to have a current in the same direction induced within itself: but that if the latter be carried from east to west, which is equivalent to a diminution of the motion communicated to it from the earth (172.), then the electric current from south to north is rendered evident in the first bar, in consequence of its discharge, at the same time, by means of the second.|$|E

30|$|The sketch in Figure  10 {{can also}} be used to {{visualize}} how EW asymmetry manifests itself in swoopers and off-great-circle paths in TEP experiments. In the case of a short baseline (e.g., Davies and Chang 1968), we can treat the monostatic rays as those transmitted from one location, that encounter side reflections, but still reach the receiver at the other end of the bistatic path. This conversion is relatively simple because plasma structures are all expected to be elongated along B lines.

40|$|The evening prereversal {{enhancement}} (PRE) of {{the vertical}} plasma drift has important {{consequences for the}} Appleton density anomaly and {{the stability of the}} nighttime ionosphere. Simplified simulations were used to review the three competing theories of the PRE origin, to explore their relative importance, and to indentify their interdependence. The mechanisms involved in the generation and climatology of the PRE are, first, a curl-free electric field response to rapid changes in the vertical electric field associated with the nighttime F region dynamo; second, a divergence of Hall currents in the E region away from the magnetic equator; and, third, the moderating effect of the large Cowling conductivities in the equatorial E region. The simulations indicate that the equatorial Cowling conductivity creates an important current path that limits the other two mechanisms prior to equatorial sunset and releases them after equatorial sunset. The curl-free mechanism is the dominant mechanism when the terminator and <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian</b> are aligned in part due to the accelerating F region zonal wind. When the solar terminator is not aligned with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>meridian,</b> there is an interaction involving all three mechanisms contributing to the magnitude and timing of the PRE. Finally, the altitude profile of the PRE decays more quickly with altitude when the curl-free mechanism dominates as compared to when the Hall current mechanism dominates. © 2015.
