500|$|Fellini {{has called}} La Strada [...] "a {{complete}} catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of <b>my</b> <b>identity</b> that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever." [...] As a result, the film demanded {{more time and}} effort {{than any of his}} other works, before or since. The development process was long and tortuous; there were various problems during production, including insecure financial backing, problematic casting, and numerous delays. Finally, just before shooting was completed, Fellini suffered a nervous breakdown that necessitated medical treatment in order to complete principal photography. Initial critical reaction was harsh, and the film's screening at the Venice Film Festival was the occasion of a bitter controversy that escalated into a public brawl between Fellini's supporters and detractors.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling <b>my</b> <b>identity...</b> My hair was my glory. It was the only thing that I could change about myself." ...|$|E

40|$|In this autoethnographical study, I {{examine how}} <b>my</b> <b>identities</b> were {{influenced}} by Confucianism. Two main Confucian concepts were examined: “selfperfection,” and “filial piety and submissiveness. ” As a migrant who left Macau for Australia at fifteen, I have been immersed in diverse cultural climates, experienced gender bias, identity crisis and racial discrimination. I consider all experiences as essential steps of my evolution with ethnographic, interpretative, phenomenological and narrative understandings. This paper introduces the term “seasonal fluctuations” {{as a way to}} describe the changing meanings of my lived experiences that were interrogated by my three distinctive personalities: The Writer, The Interpreter and The Observer. This triple hermeneutics is borrowed from Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. For me, my gender, birth place and birth order had pre-determined my fate before learning took place. The Confucian values that my family and I adopted further shaped <b>my</b> <b>identities.</b> Issues of gender equity and social justice had been discussed in the interrogation of <b>my</b> story, <b>my</b> <b>identities</b> remain fluid. Finally, the challenges and benefits of conducting an autoethnography were discussed. I acknowledge that qualitative research can have a transformative influence on the individuals conducting the inquiry, as we reflect on our participation in the world around ourselves...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by Parker Palmer’s {{call for}} {{teachers}} to understand the self who teaches, I recently completed a transformative research journey that revealed and reconceptualised deeply sedimented dimensions of <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity.</b> I am a university based science teacher educator from Indonesia, and recently participated in a 3 -year longitudinal co-teaching project in lower secondary schools in Western Australia. Conducting co-teaching and narrative research stimulated me to think deeply about and reflect critically on <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity.</b> I came to understand the powerful role of culture, religion, and personal experiences in transformative learning and sustainability education in shaping <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity.</b> As the research involved critical reflection on my professional praxis, I adopted a multi-paradigmatic research approach with three focus paradigms - interpretivism, criticalism, and postmodernism - and adopted critical auto/ethnography as my research methodology. I applied multiple genres within arts-based research, including poetic reflections (poems), stories, dialogues within narrative, and metaphors. My five research quality standards were critical reflexivity, praxis, representation, trustworthiness and authenticity, and crystallisation. I discovered that <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity</b> is not fixed and that the journey in revealing <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity</b> is endless. I revealed and reconceptualised <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity</b> from four main perspectives. I {{came to understand that}} I am a product of cultural hybridity resulting from interactions of very different cultures, including Javanese, Bimanese, Indonesian and Australian. As I was growing up Islam became my way of life and shaped my values, beliefs and actions in all aspects of my life; I discovered religion as a hegemonic power in <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity.</b> <b>My</b> postgraduate journey embedded three aspects of transformative learning in my teaching identity: (1) constructivism, (2) empowering teacher-student relationships, and (3) dialectical thinking. I came to realise the power of sustainability education in shaping <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity,</b> through <b>my</b> core life values of religion and childhood education. These values have found expression in my teaching practice via ‘Green Chemistry’. This doctoral research was an empowering journey that enriched my personal and professional life by enabling me to examine and develop core values, beliefs, and practices that form <b>my</b> teaching <b>identity.</b> I hope that my newly transformed teaching identity enables me to further develop my professional practice as a science teacher educator who has a passion to empower the agency of her student teachers and to empower her readers to reflect on their own identities, both personally and professionally...|$|R

2500|$|On March 17, 2007, Plame {{testified before}} the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She was asked how she learned of Novak's {{reference}} to her in his column. Plame told the committee [...] "I found out {{very early in the}} morning when my husband came in and dropped the newspaper on the bed and said, 'He did it'.... We had indications in the week prior that Mr. Novak knew <b>my</b> <b>identity</b> and my true employer. And I of course alerted my superiors at the agency, and I was told, don't worry; we'll take care of it. And it was much to our surprise that we read about this July 14.... I believe, and this is what I've read, that the then-spokesman, Mr. Harlow, spoke directly with Mr. Novak and said something along the lines of, don't go with this; don't do this. I don't know exactly what he said, but he clearly communicated the message that Mr. Novak should not publish my name." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2000, Geller sued {{video game}} company Nintendo for £60 {{million over the}} Pokémon species [...] "", {{localized}} in English as [...] "Kadabra", which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity. The Pokémon in question has psychic abilities and carries a bent spoon. Geller also claimed that the star on Kadabra's forehead and the lightning patterns on its abdomen are symbolisms popular with the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany. [...] The katakana for the character's name, ユンゲラー, is visually similar to the transliteration of Geller's own name into Japanese (ユリゲラー). [...] He is quoted as saying: [...] "Nintendo turned me into an evil, occult Pokémon character. Nintendo stole <b>my</b> <b>identity</b> by using my name and my signature image." [...] As of 2008 the situation was still ongoing. Pokémon anime director and storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka confirmed {{in an interview that}} Kadabra would not be used on a Pokémon Trading Card until an agreement was reached on the case. As of 2017, the agreement has not been reached and the last Kadabra card released was in the Skyridge e-Reader set.|$|E

2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find <b>my</b> <b>identity.</b> I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and I learned how to do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E
