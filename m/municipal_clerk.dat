40|$|Using {{data from}} a survey of <b>municipal</b> <b>clerks</b> across the United States, this {{research}} tests a model of job satisfaction for municipal employees based on research by Ellickson and Logsdon (2001). The primary hypothesis is that the model will not hold true for this subgroup of municipal employees because <b>municipal</b> <b>clerks</b> are different from other public sector employees. Clerks are different in part because their job duties and responsibilities are set out by statute, {{there is a great}} deal of autonomy, and the position is one most often held by females. To test the research hypotheses, multivariate regression analysis was employed. Results suggest that this model does not explain the variation in job satisfaction of <b>municipal</b> <b>clerks</b> across the United States as fully as the Ellickson and Logsdon’s model did in their study of municipal employees in one city...|$|R

50|$|United States {{passports}} {{are issued}} by the U.S. Department of State. Applications for passports are most often filed at United States Postal Service offices or local county or <b>municipal</b> <b>clerk's</b> offices. For many years, passports were not required for U.S. citizens to re-enter from countries near the United States (including Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and most Caribbean and Central American nations.) In light of this, and given the country's immense size and the great distances which the average citizen lives from an international border, passport possession in the United States had remained relatively low. Indeed, most Americans normally did not obtain passports or carry them regularly unless traveling abroad, and as of 2006, only 60 million (20% of Americans) had passports. As of 2011, approximately 37% of Americans have passports or passport cards.|$|R

30|$|As the {{disaster}} management paradigm {{has evolved from}} a traditional approach that focuses on managing an emergency to a more proactive approach that emphasizes the reduction of disaster risk and building resilience, we {{argue that it is}} these abilities that help local government leaders get the tasks of disaster risk reduction and resilience building done effectively. Based on related literature and concepts elaborated above, we refer to these abilities as “disaster resilience leadership” (DRL). We also hypothesize that DRL is a significant predictor of a city’s disaster resilience. We examined DRL among local government leaders in Thailand, which, in our research, not only referred to municipality mayors, but also included other highly positioned administrators who are directly responsible for or assigned to carrying out disaster management functions, such as deputy mayors, <b>municipal</b> <b>clerks,</b> and emergency managers. We then tested the effect of DRL on each city’s disaster resilience.|$|R

This article argues that just as religious exemptions of this sort are not granted for {{discrimination on the basis}} of race, religion, national origin, or gender, they should not be granted for {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation or transgender status. Discrimination on the basis of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s identity, biology, or other immutable characteristics has been labeled odious by our laws, whether motivated by religious beliefs or not.
