25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> {{life have}} I listened {{to such a}} magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, {{with a piece of}} atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced.|$|E

But scary." [...] Over 25 gallons of fake blood was used in the film, which was two and half times more than Saw II.|$|E

[...] When the crew arrived in London, the Beatles sent a limousine to pick them up. [...] Booking agent Bill Graham proposed that Redding play at the Fillmore Auditorium in late 1966. [...] The gig was commercially and critically successful, paying Redding around $800 to $1000 a night.

500|$|Fellini {{has called}} La Strada [...] "a {{complete}} catalogue of <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever."

The development process was long and tortuous; there were various problems during production, including insecure financial backing, problematic casting, and numerous delays. Finally, just before shooting was completed, Fellini suffered a nervous breakdown that necessitated medical treatment in order to complete principal photography. Initial critical reaction was harsh, and the film's screening at the Venice Film Festival was the occasion of a bitter controversy that escalated into a public brawl between Fellini's supporters and detractors.|$|E
