The present experiments were conducted on glass eels of the Australian shortfin eel, when the effectiveness of four types of readily available fish roe (European <b>carp,</b> <b>mirror</b> dory, orange roughy and warehou) were evaluated over a 42 -day period, in the laboratory. After 28 days the eels did not show an interest in orange roughy and mirror dory roe, and these two treatments were discontinued to avoid mortality. In all treatments there was a decrease in mean weight during this period, but the survival was over 99 %. In the 28 th to 42 nd day period the mean weight and specific growth rate of glass eels reared on European carp and warehou roe increased, but the differences between these two treatments were not significant. The physical features of the roe and the oocytes thereof, the proximate composition, amino acid and fatty acid composition indicated major differences amongst the roe types, particularly with regard to the amount of n− 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the ratio of n− 3 to n− 6.

We determined the main periods in the development of pond fish culture and its one of main object — carp. Galician carp was first presented at the Agricultural Exhibition in Berlin in 1880 by the farm Kanov, which was located on the territory of Galicia. These carp was characterized by nice flesh properties and relatively early maturation that caused interest in fish farmers. Galician carp was reared in ponds during early stages of aquaculture development, therefore we examined historical information on the use of this group in fish culture. Few-scaled (<b>mirror)</b> Galicia <b>carp</b> were used not only as a commercial fish as a pure line but also for crossing with other groups of carps for obtaining higher productivity values due to heterozygosis.

Therefore, currently, Galician carp remained in few fish farms of Ukraine and they need further studies in order to be preserved as a native species, which became rare and vanishing. Originality. This work is a generalization of historical information on the development and establishment of fish culture on the territories, which belonged to Galicia.

To {{perform an}} {{analysis}} the fish breeding, biological, productive, exterior indicators of Antoninsko-Zozulenetskiy carps of Ukrainian scaly and Ukrainian framed breeds, their genetic characteristics {{as well as to}} provide the methods of the creation of these carps as a selective achievement. Methodology. The works were carried out in accordance with conventional techniques in fish farming and breeding. Carp breeding was conducted by the method of mass continuously improving selection of fish the aim of which is that a complex of fish breeding and management activities create conditions contributing to the development of productive qualities in the selected carp, while selection and breeding activities form and reproduce the leading pedigree group of the stock. Findings. In the conditions of the development of fisheries industry, especially important are the problems of selection and breeding works aimed at improving the biological and economic features of fish farming objects by improving the existing and developing new breeds, inbreeding, zonal types, lines, etc., creating a progressive heterotic structure of breeds and forming highly productive pedigree stocks of fish breeding objects. The main object of commercial fish farming in Ukraine, as in many countries, is carp, so his selection is given much attention. The starting material for producing the Antoninsko-Zozulenetskiy Ukrainian scaly and Ukrainian framed breeds was carp population of Antoninskiy State fish hatchery (Khmelnytsky region), which was a cross between native <b>carp</b> with <b>mirror</b> Galician <b>carp.</b> The principal method of carp breeding was a massive, continuously improving selection with high intensity among younger age groups. An importance during the selection was given to the growth rate of the fish, their exterior and constitutional "strength. " For the brood, individuals with the highest body weight, scaly cover of which corresponded to accepted standards, beautiful high back constitution and without any signs of defects and diseases were selected. An important role during the selection was also given the distinct manifestation of secondary sexual features in males and females. The high productive qualities of domestic carp contributed to their spread in the near abroad and far abroad countries as well. They were exported to Russia, Moldova, Romania, China, with the aim of pure breeding and improvement of native carp forms. Based on the analysis of long-term studies on the rearing of Antoninsko-Zozulenetskiy arrays of Ukrainian framed and scaly breeds, it was found that their fish breeding and biological indicators comply with the requirements of the Regulation on testing of selection achievements in animal breeding and can be submitted to the relevant authorities for consideration and approval as a type of inbreeding Ukrainian framed and scaly carp breeds.

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} fish diseases is; increasingly, being reported as a limiting factor in the future development of aquaculture. The control of fish disease is largely performed in retrospect through curative chemotherapy. However, the development of resistant strains of fish places the emphasis on preventative, rather than the curative, control of disease. The freshwater parasite Icthyophthirius multifiliis causes the disease known as ichthyophthiriasis or white spot. Losses of fish due to this parasite are believed to total over one million dollars per annum worldwide. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the genetics of resistance to I. multifiliis, Comparisons were made between four stocks of the tropical livebearing fish Xiphophorus maculatus. One of these stocks, the blue platyfish, was found to be less susceptible to white spot than the yellow comet tail, red or red wag tail platyfish, Comparisons with four other tropical spades of fish found significant differences between X. maculatus, X. variatus, Ameca splendens and Ilyodon xanthusi in levels of susceptibility. A. splendens was the most susceptible species, with the blue platy (X. maculatus) and sunset platy (X. variatus) forming the most resistant group. All the remaining stocks and species formed an intermediate group. Examination of resistance to white spot infection in four scale types of related common carp (Cyprinus auratus) also found variation in resistance, with the fully scaled carp being the most resistant phenotype (scattered mirror, linear <b>mirror</b> and leather <b>carp</b> being similar in infection level). More detailed analysis of the genetics of disease resistance was performed with heritability determinations in stocks of A. splendens, X. maculatus (yellow comet tail) and X. maculatus (Vera Cruz). The highest heritability value, based on sire components only, was that for Vera Cruz platyfish of 0. 75, with a value of 0. 23 for X. maculatus (yellow comet tail) and 0. 00 for A. splendens. A breeding programme was also performed between X. maculatus (red platy) and X. variatus (sunset platy) to evaluate the presence of any heterosis. Such was observed, with a heterosis value, based on actual parasite counts, of 16. 2 %. Several factors of the infection process are also discussed, especially the fluctuating yearly trends in infection levels and parasite strain differences. Finally, the future potential of genetic manipulation of fish stocks for increased disease resistance is discussed in the light of this study. It is considered that a useful foundation has been laid for the further development of this approach to disease prevention in aquaculture.

Para os testes de resistência à tração, ao alongamento e à determinação da força de rasgamento progressivo, utilizou-se o dinamômetro EMIC. Foram retiradas amostras da região dorsal do couro para análise de microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). As amostras foram secas em ponto crítico com CO 2 e metalizadas com íons de ouro-paládio. Em seguida as amostras foram elétron-micrografados com o JEOL-JSM 5410.

Os couros curtidos com a técnica bioleather apresentaram maiores valores no teste de tração (20, 45 N/mm 2) em comparação ao cromo (12, 32 N/mm 2).
