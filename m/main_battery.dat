5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, Seydlitz was hit 21 times by heavy-caliber shells, twice by {{secondary}} battery shells, and once by a torpedo. The ship suffered a total of 98 of her crew killed and 55 wounded. Seydlitz herself fired 376 <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> shells and scored approximately 10 hits.|$|E
5|$|For armament, the Rivadavia {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> of twelve 12-inch/50 caliber guns, a secondary battery of twelve 6 inch (152 mm)/50 and twelve 4-inch (102mm)/50 QF, and two 21-inch (533mm) torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Prinz Eugen {{supported}} a {{failed attempt to}} seize the fortress island of Hogland. The ship then returned to Gotenhafen, before escorting a convoy of ships evacuating German soldiers from Finland. The convoy, consisting of six freighters, sailed on 15 September from the Gulf of Bothnia, with the entire Second Task Force escorting it. Swedish aircraft and destroyers shadowed the convoy, but did not intervene. The following month, Prinz Eugen returned to gunfire support duties. On 11 and 12 October, she fired in support of German troops in Memel. Over the first two days, the ship fired some 700 rounds of ammunition from her <b>main</b> <b>battery.</b> She returned on the 14th and 15th, after having restocked her <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> ammunition, to fire another 370 rounds.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{batteries}} Secondary {{batteries are}} just as important as <b>main</b> <b>batteries.</b> Typically, these guns are half the size of the <b>main</b> <b>batteries</b> but equal in range. These guns are generally multipurpose guns, being used for ship-to-ship, anti aircraft, and general bombardment. In the series Blood & Chrome Galactica is shown fitted with 68 (34 port, 34 starboard) secondary batteries for a total of 136 rifles (assuming they are 2-rifled batteries) on her dorsal side to compliment her <b>main</b> <b>batteries.</b> Because of their smaller caliber they can fire at a faster rate than their larger counterparts. For example, an Iowa class battleship's <b>main</b> 16-inch <b>batteries</b> fire at 2-6 rounds per minute per rifle or 18-54 rounds/minute. Whereas the smaller 5-inch secondary batteries fire at 15-20 per minute/rifle (5 2-rifled batteries per side), or 150-200 5-inch rounds per minute, a difference of 2.5-5 times. The same can be assumed for the Galactica. If her <b>main</b> <b>batteries</b> fire 15-20 rounds/minute/rifle, then it can be assumed her secondary batteries fire 40-80 rounds/min/rifle. Again simple math suggests that a full one minute barrage of the secondary batteries can fire between 5,540-10,880 rounds per minute from the dorsal side alone.|$|R

5|$|Masséna was {{the fourth}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was Charles Martel, which formed the basis for Masséna and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship Brennus, but instead of mounting the <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel Magenta, which moved two of the <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|Moltke and Goeben, {{improvements}} {{over the}} preceding Von der Tann, were ordered in 1908 and 1909, respectively. While their design {{was not as}} contentious as with the Von der Tann, there were still disagreements between Tirpitz and the General Navy Department over whether the <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> guns should be increased in number or caliber. Tirpitz favored the increase to ten guns, while the Navy Department preferred eight 30.5cm (12in) guns. It was eventually decided that ten 28cm guns would be mounted. In addition to the increased <b>main</b> <b>battery,</b> the two Moltke-class ships were slightly larger and better armored than Von der Tann.|$|E
5|$|Ordered in 1938 {{under the}} Second Vinson Act, Iowa {{was the lead}} ship of her class of battleship. She was {{launched}} on 27 August 1942 and commissioned on 22 February 1943. Iowa’s <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> consisted of nine 16inch (406.4mm)/50caliber guns.|$|E
50|$|On 64-gun two-deckers, the 12-gun {{was used}} as {{secondary}} artillery, to supplement the 24-pounder <b>main</b> <b>batteries.</b> 28 guns were carried on the top gun-deck.|$|R
5000|$|The 8"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun (spoken [...] "eight-inch-forty-five--caliber") {{were used}} for the {{secondary}} batteries of the United States Navy's last pre-dreadnought battleships and refitted in older armored cruisers <b>main</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
50|$|A lattice fire-control mast was {{installed}} on Fort Drum, a fort {{built by the}} United States to guard the entrance of Manila Bay. The mast directed the fire of the fort's 14-inch <b>main</b> <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The British took Ninfa {{into service}} as HMS Hamadryad, a 36-gun frigate with a <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> of 12-pounders, but {{were unable to}} {{retrieve}} the cargo of silver, which later arrived safely in Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> of four 12-inch/40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of eight 8-inch/45 caliber guns and twelve /50 caliber Mark 6 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> turrets, {{with the other two}} turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve /50 caliber guns, mounted in casemates {{along the side of the}} hull, and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Nebraska carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.|$|E
5|$|A {{battleship}} {{is a large}} armored warship with a <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> {{consisting of}} large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was considered vital for any nation that desired to maintain command of the sea.|$|E
500|$|There is an auxiliary, 12volt {{conventional}} {{lead acid}} battery under the bonnet/hood for the accessories. It is also needed to control and charge the <b>main</b> traction <b>battery</b> and to start the vehicle. It is charged from the <b>main</b> traction <b>battery</b> via a DC-DC voltage reduction device. If it is discharged, the vehicle cannot be started, neither can the <b>main</b> traction <b>battery</b> be charged. Use of 12 volt [...] "jump cables" [...] from another vehicles is possible.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} as Constructor of the Navy, the Bureau tested and adopted {{numerous}} new ideas in warship design. Among his notable innovations was the decision to mount battleships' <b>main</b> <b>batteries</b> on the centerline, thereby increasing their broadside weight of metal to the maximum.|$|R
5000|$|The 8"/30 caliber gun (spoken [...] "eight-inch-thirty-caliber") {{formed the}} <b>main</b> <b>batteries</b> of the United States Navy's [...] "New Navy".

5|$|Also on 18 April, Iowas fire-control officer, Lieutenant Leo Walsh, {{conducted}} a briefing {{to discuss the}} next day's <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> exercise. Moosally, Morse, Kissinger, and Costigan {{did not attend the}} briefing. During the briefing, Skelley announced that Turret Two would participate in an experiment of his design in which D-846 powder would be used to fire 2700lb (1224.7kg) shells.|$|E
5|$|An American design, , {{authorized}} in 1905 {{and laid}} down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, , were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the <b>main</b> <b>battery,</b> dispensing with Dreadnoughts wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.|$|E
5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The {{elevation of}} the <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> guns was again increased, the bow section of the belt armor was removed, and half of her boilers were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
50|$|Its {{function}} was to automatically aim the guns {{so that a}} fired projectile would collide with the target. This is the same function as the <b>main</b> <b>battery’s</b> Mk 8 Rangekeeper used in the Mark 38 GFCS except {{that some of the}} targets the Mark 1A had to deal with also moved in elevation — and much faster. For a surface target, the Secondary Battery’s Fire Control problem {{is the same as the}} <b>Main</b> <b>Battery’s</b> with the same type inputs and outputs. The major difference between the two computers is their ballistics calculations. The amount of gun elevation needed to project a 5-in shell nine nautical miles (17 km) is very different from the elevation needed to project a 16-in shell the same distance.|$|R
50|$|The move proved unnecessary, however, as the Brazilian vessel ran hard aground. Mariath {{was thus}} dissuaded {{from taking the}} eastern route, {{although}} his pilot thought it still possible. He commenced an artillery duel with the <b>main</b> <b>batteries,</b> until the storm obliged him to suspend the indecisive action.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{supported}} when Major Adama CO of the Pegasus orders that the <b>main</b> <b>batteries</b> target the central {{axis of the}} Cylon baseships. This {{would not be possible}} given the range and speed the ships are engaging each other at without self autonomous precession guided munitions.|$|R
5|$|As built Kalinin lacked any radars, but by 1944 she was {{equipped}} with British and American Lend-Lease radars as well as Soviet-designed systems. A British Type 291 and an American SG radar were used for air search. Two Soviet Yupiter-1 radars were used for <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> fire control while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two British Type 282 radars.|$|E
5|$|Both Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were {{equipped}} with {{two sets of}} Seetakt radar. One was mounted on the forward gun director, which was located {{on top of the}} bridge. The second radar set was emplaced on the rear <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> gun director. The Seetakt sets operated at 368megacycles, initially at 14kW, though the sets were upgraded to operate at 100kW, on the 80cm wavelength.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 gunnery {{training}} exercises, Patrie suffered mechanical {{problems with}} her sighting equipment that disabled {{one of her}} <b>main</b> <b>battery</b> turrets. In 1910 the battleship again was in an accident; while on maneuvers in the Gulf of Jouan, Patrie launched a torpedo that inadvertently struck her sister République. Her hull was damaged, and {{she was forced to}} put into Toulon for repairs.|$|E
