25|$|The {{story of}} the {{discovery}} of the first LSm proteins begins with a young woman, Stephanie Smith, who was diagnosed in 1959 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), eventually succumbing to complications of the disease in 1969 at the age of 22. During this period, she was treated at New York's Rockefeller University Hospital, under the care of Dr. Henry Kunkel and Dr. Eng Tan. As those with an autoimmune disease, SLE patients produce antibodies to antigens in their cells' nuclei, most frequently to their own DNA. However, Dr. Kunkel and Dr. Tan found in 1966 that <b>Ms.</b> <b>Smith</b> produced antibodies to a set of nuclear proteins, which they named the 'smith antigen' (Sm Ag). About 30% of SLE patients produce antibodies to these proteins, as opposed to double stranded DNA. This discovery improved diagnostic testing for SLE, but the nature and function of this antigen was unknown.|$|E

6000|$|This is to Jean; but {{the same}} afflicted lady wrote indifferently to Jean, to Janet, and to <b>Ms.</b> <b>Smith,</b> whom she calls ‘my Edinburgh mother.’ It is plain the three were as one person, moving to acts of kindness, like the Graces, inarmed. Too much stress must not be laid on the style of this correspondence; Clarinda survived, not far away, and may have met the ladies on the Calton Hill; {{and many of the}} writers appear, {{underneath}} the conventions of the period, to be genuinely moved. But what unpleasantly strikes a reader is, that these devout unfortunates found a revenue in their devotion. It is everywhere the same tale; {{on the side of the}} soft-hearted ladies, substantial acts of help; on the side of the correspondents, affection, italics, texts, ecstasies, and imperfect spelling. When a midwife is recommended, not at all for proficiency in her important art, but because she has ‘a sister whom I [the correspondent] esteem and respect, and [who] is a spiritual daughter of my Hond Father in the Gosple,’ the mask seems to be torn off, and the wages of godliness appear too openly. Capacity is a secondary matter in a midwife, temper in a servant, affection in a daughter, and the repetition of a shibboleth fulfils the law. Common decency is at times forgot in the same page with the most sanctified advice and aspiration. Thus I am introduced to a correspondent who appears to have been at the time the housekeeper at Invermay, and who writes to condole with my grandmother in a season of distress. For nearly half a sheet she keeps to the point with an excellent discretion in language then suddenly breaks out: ...|$|E

They soon find a body {{in the trunk of}} the stolen car. J.T. and Tanya dump the body of the person in the lake. The body belonged to the town's doctor. It is revealed that <b>Ms.</b> <b>Smith</b> killed the doctor and is a professional assassin. They logically conclude that the car will not be reported stolen so J.T. decides to keep it. Later, two local bullies who harassed James and J.T. start destroying the car. Tanya gets the bully's baseball bat and they start kicking and beating them out of anger. The next day, the cops find the body and visit J.T.. <b>Ms.</b> <b>Smith</b> vouches and helps them evade suspicion from the detectives. She then threatens the lives of their families if her car isn't returned that night. Later, she kills a man who attempted to rape Tanya, and gets a photo of her at the crime scene, which could incriminate her. J.T. kisses Tanya in the car right before <b>Ms.</b> <b>Smith</b> arrives with James. She then tells Tanya to tie them both up and kill them. She whispers them both instructions to fake their deaths and it was successful. <b>Ms.</b> <b>Smith</b> takes Tanya and the car with her as she leaves. She later tells Tanya that she knew that they weren't dead and that it was a test for Tanya that she passed. They destroy the car in an explosion and Tanya becomes her apprentice.|$|E
