5|$|Penshurst Airfield was an {{airfield}} {{in operation}} between 1916–36 and 1940–46. Initially a <b>military</b> <b>airfield,</b> after the First World War {{it was used}} as an alternate destination to Croydon Airport, with some civil flying taking place. The airfield closed following the crash of a Flying Flea at an air display in 1936, and was converted to a polo ground.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has {{a modest}} public bus {{transport}} system, with the Arbroath Bus Station {{serving as the}} town's main terminus. Stagecoach Strathtay and Travel Wishart (part of National Express) operate most of the local services, with most rural services operated by Stagecoach Strathtay. Arbroath has one railway station, {{a short walk from}} the bus station, with regional train services to the east coast of Scotland, Edinburgh, Perth and Glasgow whilst intercity services operate to destinations in England such as Newcastle, Birmingham, York and London. Passenger services at Arbroath are provided by Abellio ScotRail, CrossCountry, Caledonian Sleeper and Virgin Trains East Coast. Dundee has a regional airport which offers commercial flights to London City Airport five times a week. The airport has a 1,530-yards runway capable of serving small aircraft and is located 1.8miles west of the city centre, adjacent to the River Tay. The nearest major international airports are in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Arbroath has a sizeable airfield at the Royal Marines military base on the western outskirts of the town, but this remains a dedicated <b>military</b> <b>airfield.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{airport is}} served by Norwegian Air Shuttle and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) with Boeing 737 {{aircraft}} on flights to Tromsø and Oslo. Widerøe operates services to several regional airports in Finnmark, feeding to the larger airlines'routes. There are {{a limited number of}} international charter flights. The first airport in the area was a <b>military</b> <b>airfield</b> built by the Luftwaffe in 1943, but was damaged beyond repair during World War II. The civilian airport opened on 4 May 1963. At first services were provided by SAS to other primary airports in the north and to Oslo, but in the 1970s, several regional airports opened in Finnmark, with Widerøe flying connecting flights to them. Alta Airport's regional importance increased in 1990, when it became a hub for the newly created SAS Commuter. Norwegian started flying to Alta in 2003 and a new terminal building was opened in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Such a large glider {{had never}} been {{constructed}} before by the British military, and to test the design, a half-scale prototype model was first designed; designated GAL. 50 it still required an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber {{to act as a}} tug to get it airborne, and was first flown in September 1941. However, it only flew once; the test pilot approached the landing area too low, attempted to raise the flaps for extra glide, and instead crashed the prototype and wrecked it. However, the trial was considered to be a success and the first full-scale prototype model was finished at GAL's works in Hanworth, Middlesex in March 1942. The Hamilcar was transported to RAF Snaith in Yorkshire, as GAL's airfield at Hanworth was too short for the glider to take off from; moving the glider to a secure <b>military</b> <b>airfield</b> would also ensure that it remained secret. Its first flight was conducted on 27 March 1942, towed by a Handley Page Halifax bomber. A second prototype was completed in June 1942, and further testing and development took place at a number of different airfields, including the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at RAF Beaulieu; all flight trials appear to have been successful, and there were few differences between the prototypes and the production models.|$|E
