50|$|Without a <b>matrix</b> <b>circuit,</b> a 61-key {{keyboard}} for a synthesizer, electronic organ, or digital piano {{would require}} 62 wires to connect (one for each note, and a ground)—an awkwardly thick bundle of wiring. With a <b>matrix</b> <b>circuit,</b> any of 61 notes {{can be determined}} with only 16 wires. This is drawn schematically as a matrix of 8 columns and 8 rows of wires, with a switch at every intersection. The keyboard controller scans the columns. If a key has been pressed, the controller scans the rows — and in a manner analogous to the board game Battleship!, the controller determines the row-column combination at which a key has been pressed, and generates a note corresponding to that key. This process occurs so quickly that the performer is unaware of any delay.|$|E
