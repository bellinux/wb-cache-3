Two birds captured near Yorkton died or their transmitters were lost before migration. Two adults from the Overflowing River moved to staging areas in southern Saskatchewan in September.

By 21 December, it arrived a few km inland from the Gulf Coast near McFaddin, Texas, 3, 378 km from its capture location. It remained there until at least 9 March 1995.

It remained there until at least 25 December, whereafter no further transmissions were received.

40|$|Beginning in 2001, a {{reintroduction}} {{project was}} initiated using captive-reared whooping cranes (Grus americana) {{to establish a}} <b>migratory</b> <b>flock</b> in eastern North America. From May 2003 to August 2008, 23 of these birds were retrieved and translocated in 15 separate events. These individuals consisted of 14 cranes that had been led to Florida by ultralight aircraft on their first autumn migration (UL) and 9 cranes that had been directly released in autumn in Wisconsin (DAR). Of 104 (86 UL and 18 DAR) reintroduced individuals that eventually departed from their release location, 22 % were later retrieved 1 - 3 times. Lake Michigan posed an effective barrier to northward migrating yearlings, and 8 retrieval events were of birds in Lower Michigan or in other locations that were {{a direct result of}} the bird having been in Michigan during their yearling spring and summer. Three events involved DAR birds (n = 8) that were in inappropriate locations during their first autumn migration, and in another event 4 UL birds were translocated within Wisconsin because of inadequate human avoidance behavior. Nine yearlings (6 UL and 3 DAR) in Lower Michigan were not retrieved (retrievals were attempted for only 3 of the birds). The summer location of released birds influenced the location of return in future years. Concentration of this population in the core reintroduction area, where probability of pair formation and association with conspecifics was greatest, became a high project priority. Retrieval and translocation of yearlings to Wisconsin became a critical management tool in the reintroduction.

40|$|We, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), {{propose to}} {{reintroduce}} whooping cranes (Grus Americana) into historic habitat {{in the eastern}} United States {{with the intent to}} establish a <b>migratory</b> <b>flock</b> that would summer and breed in Wisconsin, and winter in west-central Florida. We propose that this reintroduced population be designated a nonessential experimental population (NEP) according to section 10 (j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. We also announce the availability of the draft environmental assessment for this action. The area proposed for NEP designation includes the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. We are considering including the States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont within the eastern United States NEP area. The objectives of the reintroduction are: to advance recovery of the endangered whooping crane; to further assess the suitability of Wisconsin and west-central Florida as whooping crane habitat; and to evaluate the merit of releasing captive-reared whooping cranes, conditioned for wild release, as a technique for establishing a self-sustaining, migratory population. The only natural wild population of whooping cranes remains vulnerable to extirpation through a natural catastrophe or contaminant spill, due primarily to its limited wintering distribution along the Texas gulf coast. If successful, this action will result in the establishment of an additional self-sustaining population, and contribute towards the recovery of the species. No conflicts are envisioned between the whooping crane’s reintroduction and any existing or anticipated Federal, State, Tribal, local government, or private actions such as agricultural practices, pesticide application, water management, construction, recreation, trapping, or hunting...|$|E

50|$|Market hunting {{severely}} depleted {{populations of}} large birds through the 19th century. Several species were exterminated, and the threatened loss of others caused popular legislation effectively prohibiting market hunting. At {{the time of}} European discovery, <b>migratory</b> <b>flocks</b> a mile wide and hundreds of miles long contained billions of passenger pigeons flying so closely together that they darkened the sky for hours as they passed overhead; the weight of roosting pigeons would break trees up to 2 ft in diameter. Michigan market hunters killed 25,000 pigeons daily for a month in 1874 before the flocks disappeared {{at the end of}} the century. Market hunters then turned their attention to <b>migratory</b> <b>flocks</b> of millions of Eskimo curlews and harvested up to 7,000 birds per day. Market hunters used small cannon called punt guns in Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, and Chesapeake Bay to harvest Atlantic Flyway waterfowl. New York, New Jersey, and Maryland market hunters sold Labrador ducks from 1840 to 1860, and the species was extinct by 1875. The last known breeding colony of great auks on Funk Island was destroyed for feathers sold to stuff pillows and mattresses. Herons and egrets were hunted for their long, filamentous nuptial plumage used in the millinery trade from 1840 until prices rose to $32 per ounce in 1903. Heath hens were exterminated from the mainland by 1835, and were extinct within a century. Hunting seasons were eventually established to conserve surviving wildlife and allow a certain amount of recovery and re-population to occur. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act signed in 1918 regulated hunting and prohibited all hunting of wood ducks until 1941 and swans until 1962.|$|R

50|$|In North America, nonmigratory Canada goose {{populations have}} been on the rise. The species is {{frequently}} found on golf courses, parking lots, and urban parks, which would have previously hosted only migratory geese on rare occasions. Owing to its adaptability to human-altered areas, it has become the most common waterfowl species in North America. In many areas, nonmigratory Canada geese are now regarded as pests by humans. They are suspected of being a cause of an increase in high fecal coliforms at beaches. An extended hunting season, deploying noise makers, and hazing by dogs have been used in an attempt to disrupt suspect flocks. A goal of conservationists has been to focus hunting on the nonmigratory populations (which tend to be larger and more of a nuisance) as opposed to <b>migratory</b> <b>flocks</b> showing natural behavior, which may be rarer.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how extrinsic and intrinsic factors affect dispersal, foraging, aggression and energy reserves in a winter population of a small, <b>migratory</b> <b>flocking</b> bird, the Snow Buniting Plectrophenax nivalis. Previous observations of this species, and consideration of its northern ground-feeding open country niche, suggested that Snow Buntings {{were less likely}} to show as strong a degree of site fidelity as many other winter-studied species. This may therefore have led to opportunities for the Snow Bunting's winter behavioural ecology to diverge from that of more sedentary species. The distribution of age and sex categories of wintering Snow Buntings was examined at eleven sites in North-East Scotland which varied markedly in altitude (and consequently habitat and climate). The proportions of adult males and adult females trapped at these sites increased with altitude, whilst the proportion of juvenile females decreased. Because males are the larger sex, and adult birds have the advantage of previous experience, the distribution of age and sex categories suggested that the more elevated sites were of higher quality. Consequently, I suggest several environmental factors (reduced competition, fewer predators, and similarity to breeding conditions) which may be responsible for altitudinal segregation and argue that these may also help explain intraspecific latitudinal segregation patterns in this and other species. More detailed observations of Snow Bunting numbers and behaviour were made at one high altitude site, Cairn Gorm during 1987 / 88 to 1992 / 93. There was evidence that, even within this site, birds selected higher altitude feeding areas when possible. However, snowfalls caused some birds, particularly young or naive individuals or females, to leave the site, although population composition recovered during subsequent thaws...|$|R
