40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse, in terms of presence, {{determinants}} and purposes, the <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> expected revenues during budget formulation and the <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> actual revenues during budget execution. To this end, we use six- year panel data from Italian municipalities with populations above 15, 000. Our results suggest that overestimations of current revenues are more frequent than underestimations, during both budget formulation and budget execution. In terms of determinants, our results highlight the impact on revenue <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> both political orientation and fiscal stress. Finally, in terms of purposes, we show that revenue underestimation during budget formulation and revenue overestimation during budget execution may contribute to the formation of surpluses. The former, in particular, may allow mayors to create a ‘war chest’ in non-election years, which can then be used to increase net borrowing on the eve of elections...|$|R

40|$|In our {{rejoinder}} to Don Weatherburn's paper, “Law and Order Blues”, we do {{not take}} issue with his advocacy {{of the need to}} take crime seriously and to foster a more rational approach to the problems it poses. Where differences do emerge is (1) with his claim that he is willing to do so whilst we (in our different ways) are not; and (2) on the question of what this involves. Of particular concern {{is the way in which}} his argument proceeds by a combination <b>of</b> simple <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the positions it seeks to disparage, and silence concerning issues of real substance where intellectual debate and exchange would be welcome and useful. Our paper challenges, in turn, the <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> Indermaur's analysis of trends in violent crime, the <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> Hogg and Brown's Rethinking Law and Order, the <b>misrepresentation</b> <b>of</b> the findings of some of the research into the effectiveness of punitive policies and the silence on sexual assault in “Law and Order Blues”. We suggest that his silence on sexual assault reflects a more widespread unwillingness to acknowledge the methodological problems that arise in the measurement of crime because such problems severely limit the extent to which confident assertions can be made about prevalence and trends...|$|R
