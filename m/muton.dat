The 20 -parameter KD and MZ hydropathicity scales have different thermodynamic character, corresponding to first and second order transitions. The KD and MZ comparisons show that the mutation rates reflect quantitative iteration of qualitative amino acid phobic and philic binary 2 x 10 properties that define quaternary 4 x 5 subgroups (but not quinary 5 x 4 subgroups), with the modern MZ bioinformatic scale giving much better results.

40|$|AbstractThe gene spa P (formerly {{designated}} as spa P 1) encoding the Mr 185, 000 surface antigen (I/II) of Streptococcus <b>mutons,</b> serotype c (NG 5), has been sequenced. The gene (4683 bp) encodes a protein of 1561 amino acid residues including putative signal peptide (residues 1 – 38) and transmembrane (residues 1537 – 1556) sequences. The N-terminal region (60 – 550) has alanine-rich repeats and {{is predicted to}} be α-helical. However, the C-ternunal region (800 – 1540) is proline-rich and favours an extended structure. Except for a short central variable region the sequences appear to be highly conserved for S. mutans serotype c. N-Tenninal sequencing of separated antigen I and antigen II polypeptides suggests that the former represents the N-terminal and the latter the C-terminal portions of the intact antigen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{classical}} view of {{the gene}} prevailing during the 1910 ’s and 1930 ’s comprehended the gene as the indivisible unit of genetic transmission, genetic recombination, gene mutation and gene function. The discovery of intragenic recombination in the early 1940 ’s led to the neoclassical concept of the gene, which prevailed until the 1970 ’s. In this view the gene or cistron, as it was now called, was divided into its constituent parts, the <b>mutons</b> and recons materially identified as nucleotides. Each cistron {{was believed to be}} responsible for the synthesis of one single mRNA and concurrently for one single polypeptide. The discoveries of DNA technology, beginning in the early 1970 ’s, have led to the second revolution in the concept of the gene in which none of the classical or neoclassical criteria for the definition of the gene hold strictly true. These are the discoveries concerning gene repetition and overlapping, movable genes, complex promoters, multiple polyadenylation sites, polyprotein genes, editing of the primary transcript and gene nesting. Thus, despite the fact that our comprehension of the structure and organization of the genetic material has greatly increased, we are left with a rather abstract, open and general concept of the gene.

40|$|ABSTRACT Nystose {{represents}} a fructooligosaccharide with two fructose molecules linked via |i (I- 2) bonds to the fructosyl moiety of sucrose. This tetrasaccharide {{was subjected to}} an array of in vitro tests designed {{for the assessment of}} potential sugar substitutes before animal or human studies. ÃŸ-Fructosidase from yeast cleaved nystose at about 5 % of the initial rate observed with sucrose. The terminal fructose was released first. Glycosyltransferase from Streptococcus <b>mutons</b> # 620 did not utilize nystose for the formation of a glucan-type polysaccharide. Anaerobic fermentation of nystose by a suspension of mixed dental plaque microorganisms and by S. muÃ-aos NCTC 10449 was about half as fast as with sucrose. Thin-layer chromatography at various reaction times with S. mutans NCTC 10449 indicated the terminal fructose as the site of first attack. Analyses for free monosaccharides confirmed these data because free fructose exceeded free glucose at early reaction times far more than would follow from the 3 : 1 ratio of fructose to glucose in the nystose molecule. High pressure liquid chromatography assays demonstrated lactic and acetic acids as the main fermentation products. Carbohydrases from human jejunal mucosa did not attack nystose. However, cecal anaerobic microorganisms of the rat fermented nystose rapidly into acids. J. Nutr. 117 : 846 â€” 851, 1987.

40|$|Abstract—The Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are {{vulnerable}} to insider attacks, in which the legitimate nodes are compromised and the adversary modifies the delivery metrics of the node to launch harmful attacks in the networks. The traditional detection approaches of secure routing protocols can not address such kind of insider attacks in DTNs. In this paper, we propose a mutual correlation detection scheme (<b>MUTON)</b> for addressing these insider attacks. <b>MUTON</b> takes into consideration of the transitive property when calculating the packet delivery probability of each node and correlates the information collected from other nodes. We evaluated our approach through extensive simulations using both Random Way Point and Zebranet mobility models. Our results show that <b>MUTON</b> can detect insider attacks efficiently with high detection rate and low false positive rate. I...|$|E

Players play {{as the top}} secret extraterrestrial combat unit, shooting down UFOs after sightings using Interceptors and transporting your men using the Skyranger, rather than Skydiver, to investigate crash sites. The main poster race of the series, the <b>Mutons,</b> are bio-engineered humanoids controlled telepathically from the alien homeworld by an unseen race.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of antibiotic resistance amongst bacteria has increased steadily {{due to the}} over prescription of antibiotics for minor ailments {{in addition to their}} overuse in the agricultural industry. As such it is imperative that we identify new therapies to combat the growing threat from antibiotic resistant pathogens. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the antimicrobial potential of a number of novel alpha helical peptides from diverse sources. These peptides shared common biophysical features of host defense peptides (HDPs) such as size, cationicity and amphipathicity. The nature of these peptides suggests they could function as topical antimicrobial agents and the oral cavity represents an ideal location for their use. This study has shown that truncation of LL- 37 to produce shorter mimetics generates peptides with enhanced antimicrobial efficacy against a range of oral pathogens in addition to pathogens from the skin, lung and gut. In one case truncation of LL- 37 produced a peptide (KE- 18) with increased potential to bind to lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid. A further mimetic, KR- 12 has potent an ti-candidal peptide with decreased haemolytic activity. In addition this study has shown that the truncated mimetics of LL- 37 investigated had a similar mechanism of action to that of the parent molecule as all were shown to disrupt the bacterial membrane. Peptides from the African volcano frog (Xenopus amieti) displayed potent antimicrobial efficacy against a range 'of oral pathogens. Then exhibited minimal haemolytic activity suggesting these peptides may be useful templates for the development of possible therapeutics designed for the oral cavity. PGLa-AMl and CPF-AMl both displayed excellent ability to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus <b>mutons</b> suggesting these peptides could have a potential role in the prevention of dental carries. ~. The study identified a number of "cryptic" peptides (the 10 family of peptides) which, displayed antimicrobial activity and some ability to bind to lipopolysaccharide. One peptide (31 Q 3) merited further investigation as the others showed modest antimicrobial activity against examples of Gram positive, Gram negative and fungal pathogens. Overall, this study has identified a number of alpha helical peptides which have the potential to be investigated further as possible therapeutics for the treatment of a number of oral conditions.
