They are used as food additives for the surface treatment of confectionery and some fruit varieties, in chewing gum base, protective coatings, defoaming agents, and surface finishing agents. Commission Regulation No 231 / 2012 established physical and chemical specifications for <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> to use in food, and posed a limit of 50 μg/kg for benzo(a) pyrene. Due to the low solubility of <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> in organic solvents and matrix interferences, analytical determination of benzo(a) pyrene represents a difficult task. The official method for indirect determination of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons uses unspecific spectrophotometric detection and a quite laborious, time- and solvent-consuming extraction method. A liquid-liquid partition method followed by solid-phase microextraction was developed to isolate benzo(a) pyrene from the bulk of saturated hydrocarbons in <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes,</b> with the aim to have a simple and effective method to verify compliance with the legal limit.

5000|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> when {{produced}} by wax refiners are typically produced {{to meet a}} number of ASTM specifications. These include congeal point (ASTM D938), needle penetration (D1321), color (ASTM D6045), and viscosity (ASTM D445). <b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> can generally be put into two categories: [...] "laminating" [...] grades and [...] "hardening" [...] grades. The laminating grades typically have a melt point of 140-175 F (60 - 80 oC) and needle penetration of 25 or above. The hardening grades will range from about 175-200 F (80 - 93 oC), and have a needle penetration of 25 or below.

50|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{a type of}} wax {{produced}} by de-oiling petrolatum, {{as part of the}} petroleum refining process. In contrast to the more familiar paraffin wax which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> {{is often}} used in {{industries}} such as the tire and rubber, candles, adhesives, corrugated board, cosmetics, castings, {{and a host of}} others.

30|$|Waxes and {{asphaltenes}} are {{the most}} important constituents of crude oils because they have a great influence on crude oil properties. Waxes are a complex mixture of solid (at ambient temperature) hydrocarbons which consist mainly of paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a small amount of}} naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as polar compounds. There are two general classes of petroleum waxes. Waxes that are composed primarily of normal alkanes (n-alkanes) with a chain length of C 18 –C 30 and crystallize in large flat plates (macrocrystalline structures) with a melting point of 40 – 60  °C are referred to as paraffin waxes (Jowett 1984). Waxes, which consist primarily of the higher molecular weight n-alkanes within C 30 –C 60, with a high share of iso-paraffins and naphthenes, and have much higher melting point ranges (above 60 – 90  °C), are referred to as <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes.</b> According to Musser and Kilpatrick (1998), paraffinic and <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> have molecular weight ranges of 350 – 600 and 300 – 2500, respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> {{are derived}} from the {{refining}} of the heavy distillates from lubricant oil production. This by-product must then be de-oiled at a wax refinery. Depending on the end use and desired specification, the product may then have its odor removed and color removed (which typically starts as a brown or dark yellow). This is usually done {{by means of a}} filtration method or by hydro-treating the wax material.|$|R
50|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{excellent}} materials {{to use when}} modifying the crystalline properties of paraffin wax. The <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> has significantly more branching of the carbon chains that are the backbone of paraffin wax. This is useful when some desired functional changes in the paraffin are needed, such as flexibility, higher melt point, and increased opacity.They are also used as slip agents in printing ink.|$|E
5000|$|For {{retarding}} further red rot {{in leather}} bookbindings, {{it is common}} to first consolidate the leather by application of Klucel G or a similar material and then apply a protective coating of a <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax.</b> When Renaissance Wax is used for this protective coating, it can create a white residue if applied too heavily. This white residue cannot be removed. Use of a different wax, such as SC6000, is recommended for leather.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> is used {{in sports}} too, {{specifically}} in ice hockey and snowboarding. It {{is applied to the}} friction tape of an ice hockey stick to prevent degradation of the tape due to water destroying the glue on the tape and also to increase control of the hockey puck due to the waxes' adhesive quality. It is also applied to the underside of snowboards to reduce friction and increase the gliding ability of the board, making it easier to control and diminishing the fatigue of the rider.|$|E
30|$|Heritage metals {{are often}} coated {{as part of}} a {{conservation}} treatment to protect the metal surface from atmospheric deteriogens. At the same time, the coating is expected to both preserve the aesthetic appeal of the artefact and be retreatable. Common protective coatings used in conservation practice are paraffin and <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> [1]. These coatings are applied physically to a surface. Inhibitive coatings on the other hand form a protective layer on a surface after a chemical reaction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> have {{considerable}} application in the custom making of jewelry and small sculptures.

The melted wax can be cast to make multiple copies that are further carved with details. Jewelry suppliers sell wax molded into the basic forms of rings as well as details that can be heat welded together and tubes and sheets for cutting and building the wax models. Rings may be attached to a wax [...] "tree" [...] so many can be cast in one pouring.|$|R
30|$|The solid deposit {{formed in}} {{producing}} wells, in borehole equipment, and pipelines {{is known to}} represent a complex mixture of waxes, asphaltenes, and resins along with trapped oil, water, and inorganic material. The amount and composition of the solid deposits are a function of changing temperature, pressure, and oil composition during oil production (Leontaritis 1996; Chouparova et al. 2004). It is known that solid deposits produced from different depths of the same well vary in amount and composition: the closer to the surface the bigger the amount of solid deposits and the bigger the share of low molecular weight n-paraffin hydrocarbon (macrocrystalline waxes) in them. At greater depths, little solid deposit is formed, but it contains {{a high proportion of}} the most high molecular weight paraffin hydrocarbons (<b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes)</b> (Chouparova et al. 2004). Thus, it is believed that most unstable macro- and <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> may precipitate from oil and form the solid deposits at different depths in the well, in borehole equipment, and pipelines, and therefore high molecular weight hydrocarbons are practically absent in produced oils. This fact has been demonstrated repeatedly by comparative analyses of MMD of paraffin hydrocarbons in oils and in the corresponding solid deposits (Philp et al. 1995; Garcia 2001; Paso and Fogler 2004; Yang and Kilpatrick 2005). Since we have shown that the most high molecular weight paraffin hydrocarbons are concentrated in asphaltenes; then in order to study the peculiarities of redistribution of the most high molecular weight paraffin hydrocarbons between oil and solid deposit, we studied the composition of n-alkanes in asphaltenes of solid deposits and compared it with that of the corresponding oils.|$|R

Although not appropriate for all materials, it is known to and used by almost every collection. It is also used as a primary finish for cabinetry and furniture. Renaissance wax is also used by reenactors of historic swordsmanship to protect armour and weapons. It is widely recognised that this substance is more protective and longer lasting than oil, especially for swords and helmets that are frequently touched by human hands.|$|E
50|$|Although many natural waxes contain esters, {{paraffin}} waxes are hydrocarbons, mixtures of alkanes {{usually in a}} homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum. They are refined by vacuum distillation. Paraffin waxes are mixtures of saturated n- and iso- alkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. A typical alkane paraffin wax chemical composition comprises hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2, such as Hentriacontane, C31H64. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. <b>Microcrystalline</b> <b>wax</b> is a lesser produced petroleum based wax that contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons.|$|E

40|$|High-temperature gas {{chromatography}} (HTGC) has enhanced {{our ability to}} characterize hydrocarbons extending to C 120 in crude oils. As a result, hydrocarbons in waxes (> C 20) have been observed to vary significantly between crude oils, even those presumed to originate from the same source. Prior to this development, <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> con-taining hydrocarbons above C 40 were not characterized on a molecular level due to the analytical limitations of con-ventional {{gas chromatography}}. Routine screenings of high pour-point crude oils by high-temperature gas chromatography has revealed that high molecular weight hydrocarbons (> C 40) are very common in most oils and may represent 2 % of the crude oil. Precise structures, origins, and significance of these high molecular weight com-pounds remain elusive. As a preliminary step to expand our knowledge of these compounds their general molecular structures and formulas have been investigated in this study. Initial {{results suggest that the}} major high molecular weight compounds include a homologous series of n-alkanes, methylbranched alkanes, alkylcyclopentanes, alkylcy...|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|R
30|$|The {{ratio of}} {{paraffinic}} to <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> in oils depends on origin of oils (Tissot and Welte 1978; Musser and Kilpatrick 1998; Philp 2004; Fazeelat and Saleem 2007). However, in most cases, the higher molecular weight paraffin hydrocarbons (microcrystalline type) {{are present in}} very low concentrations or are absent in produced oils. This is due to their low mobility and limited solubility in crude oil. As a result, these components remain in the reservoir rocks or precipitate out in borehole equipment when the temperature and pressure change. It was demonstrated repeatedly that high molecular weight n-alkanes were concentrated in solid deposits formed in well equipment and pipelines (Philp et al. 1995; Chouparova et al. 2004). Moreover, the concentrations of high molecular weight paraffin hydrocarbons in oils, which are determined by high temperature gas chromatography (HTGC, {{one of the main}} methods for investigating hydrocarbon composition of oils) (Lipsky and Duffy 1986; Hawthorne and Miller 1987), are underestimated because of the poor solubility of the high molecular weight hydrocarbons in the solvent and the difficulty in eluting of such high boiling components even at 440  °C, resulting in the bias of response toward the shorter-chain homologs (Philp et al. 1995).|$|R
5000|$|In {{industrial}} applications, it {{is often}} useful to modify the crystal properties of the paraffin wax, typically by adding branching to the existing carbon backbone chain. The modification is usually done with additives, such as EVA copolymers, <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>wax,</b> or forms of polyethylene. The branched properties result in a modified paraffin with a higher viscosity, smaller crystalline structure, and modified functional properties. Pure paraffin wax is rarely used for carving original models for casting metal and other materials in the lost wax process, as it is relatively brittle at room temperature and presents the risks of chipping and breakage when worked. Soft and pliable waxes, like beeswax, may be preferred for such sculpture, but [...] "investment casting waxes," [...] often paraffin-based, are expressly formulated for the purpose.|$|E

Specifically, porous zirconia particles having varying porosity were prepared by a two-step protocol wherein a porogen was first embedded during the particle synthesis, followed by its removal in a subsequent step. In this research study, the ability of four different types of porogens, viz. fumed silica, micronized high molecular weight polyethylene emulsion ME 09730, and <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> ME 48040 M 2 and ME 98040 M 1, to impact the pore size, porosity, and pore area were investigated.

40|$|International audienceIn outdoor {{environment}} bronze statues undergo degradations mainly {{caused by}} water but also related to air pollution [1]. These degradations lead to physical and aesthetic modifications of the work’s patina. To limit these degradations environment/patina interactions should be reduced. Several treatments can be applied on the statue: <b>microcrystalline</b> <b>waxes</b> or corrosion inhibitors. For the latter we’ve decided to work with carboxylates solutions (NaC 10 and HC 10) which are non-toxic and non-carcinogenic [2]. Nowadays the efficiency of these treatments has not been consistently evaluated and we have little data about mechanisms that occur to microscopic scales within “old” patinas. This study aims to evaluate and compare the efficiency for both treatments by viewing their penetration in the patina layer and explaining the interactions to microscale between the treatment and the patina. First several naturally formed patinas have been characterized following a graduated analytical methodology. In a second time treated samples with both treatment was studied.
