50|$|The arc is {{maintained}} {{independently of the}} workpiece or parts being welded. The hydrogen gas is normally diatomic (H2), but where the temperatures are over 600 C near the arc, the hydrogen breaks down into its atomic form, absorbing {{a large amount of}} heat from the arc. When the hydrogen strikes a relatively cold surface (i.e. the weld zone), it recombines into its diatomic form, releasing the energy associated with the formation of that bond. The energy in AHW can be varied easily by changing the distance between the arc stream and the workpiece surface. This process is being replaced by gas <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding,</b> mainly because of the availability of inexpensive inert gases.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Occupational asthma (OA) can {{be induced}} by fumes of manual <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> on {{stainless}} steel. In recent years, {{the use of}} special stainless steels (SSS) with high chromium content has increased. This study presents two cases of OA caused by manual <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> on SSS. In both cases, the diagnosis of OA was based on respiratory symptoms, occupational exposure and positive findings in the specific challenge tests. In the first case, a 46 -yr-old welder had experienced severe dyspnoea while welding SSS (SMO steel), but not in other situations. Challenge tests with both mild steel and stainless steel using a common electrode were negative. Welding SSS with a special electrode caused a delayed 37 % drop in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). In the second case, a 34 -yr-old male had started to experience dyspnoea {{during the past few}} years, while welding especially SSS (Duplex steel). The workplace peak expiratory flow monitoring was suggestive of OA. Challenge tests with both mild steel and stainless steel using a common electrode did not cause bronchial obstruction. Welding SSS with a special electrode caused a delayed 31 % drop in FEV 1. In conclusion, exposure to manual <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> fumes of special stainless steel should be considered as a new cause of occupational asthma...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} aging at intermediate temperature on the mechanical properties of type 308 stainless steel weld metals have been studied. Three multipass shielded <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welds</b> with ferrite levels of 4, 8, or 12 % were aged up to 50, 000 h at 343 {degrees}C. Tensile and Charpy V-notch specimens {{were used to}} determine the effects of aging on the mechanical properties of the weld metal. Aging had little effect on the yield strength of the weld metal, but did result in a slight increase (approximately 5 %) in the ultimate tensile strength. The ferrite content had little effect on the yield strength of the materials, but the ultimate tensile strength increased slightly with higher ferrite content. In contrast to the small effect on the tensile properties, the impact properties were significantly degraded by aging. The extent of the degradation increased with increasing ferrite content and continued to increase with increasing aging time, Spinodal decomposition and the precipitation of G-phase particles in the ferrite phase are believed to be responsible for the degradation of the mechanical properties...|$|R

In the present investigation, single fillet T-joints were made of mild steel plates using manual <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> process. A number of parameters including state of the base plate (such as, pre-welding stress relieving, preheating), size of flux-coated electrodes, size of the fillet weld, etc. were considered.

40|$|The {{modeling}} {{of the gas}} <b>metal-arc</b> (GMA) <b>welding</b> process in three dimensions for moving heat sources has been attempted using the finite element method. The occurrence of finger penetration in the weldment resulting from a streaming type of metal transfer at high contents is explained by assuming that the heat content of transferring droplets is distributed in a certain volume of the workpiece below the arc. Volumetric distribution of the heat content of transferring droplets has been considered as an internal heat-generation term, and the differences between penetration characteristics in two cases of globular and streaming conditions of metal transfer have been analyzed. It is shown that weld penetration depends on the depth at which the droplets distribute their energy inside the workpieces. Temperature dependence of thermo-physical properties, i. e [...] thermal conductivity and specific heat, has been included. Latent heat is incorporated by a direct iteration method. Heat losses from the plate caused by convection and radiation are also considered. The model is validated by predicting the weld-bead dimensions and comparing them with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMicrochemical {{analyses of the}} inclusions present in several shielded <b>metal-arc</b> steel <b>weld</b> metals were made by analytical transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Low alloy C-Mn steel weld metal samples were studied in which only the titanium and aluminum contents varied significantly. Carbon extraction replicas were made {{from each of the}} weldments and the inclusions were analyzed in the TEM by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) and parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy (PEELS). The results indicated that, for weld metals containing small amounts of M (13 ppm), the inclusions were comprised of MnO-SiO 2, TiO (maybe as a compound) and Cu(Mn) S. As the M content was increased to 160 ppm, Mn and Si no longer took part in the deoxidization process and the inclusion compositions were dominated by TiO and A 12 O 3 along with some sulfides. For weld metal containing a much higher amount of Al (580 ppm) the inclusions became essentially mixtures of TiO, Al 2 O 3 and TiN sometimes complexed with sulfides. These inclusion chemistries were predicted by the use of equilibrium thermodynamics and their effect on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the steel weld metals investigated.

The wear resistant coatings are deposited on pure aluminium metal matrix by shielded gas <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> applying tungsten inert gas (TIG) with extruded aluminium wire reinforced by particles as additive material. Wire filler is produced by extrusion of a pack containing metalized and plated by flux micro/nano SiC particles.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} project was the optimization of matching welding consumables for the GTAW (as tungsten arc welding), SMAW (shield <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding)</b> and SAW (submerged-arc welding) process. Principally, the long-term properties should be ascertained in comparison with both of the parent metals. The staring point of the investigations were the ranges of chemical composition and minimum requirements for mechanical properties of both the parent metals E 911 and P 92. To ensure sufficient toughness, the analyses of the consumables were slightly modified {{in comparison with the}} parent metals. Having ensured sufficient toughness of the all weld metal after welding (at least 41 J at room temperature with as short as possible post weld heat treatment), the long-term properties in not only that all weld metal but also the weld joint were ascertained. At the time of reporting, trial results for long-term investigations up to 18, 000 hours for the all weld metal and 30, 000 hours for the weld joints were available. (orig.)

Shielded <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> (SMAW) {{have been used}} on casting samples of 300 x 90 x 10 mm, with a groove angle of 60 º. It is also analysed the influence on the weldability of the chemical composition of the different electrodes used, Ni (56 % and 97, 6 % each one) as well as the influence of the pre-heating temperature (350 ºC and 600 ºC) and the coldest velocity (at the air and at the furnace). The weldability is evaluated by tests of to bends and traction. Finally, microstructure analysis are performed on the joints: on the heat-affected-zone (the piece near the weld); the piece-weld interface; and the fusion-zone (the weld). Mechanical characteristics of the joint and its microstructure and with fractography analysis are correlated. In order to investigate the influence of the principal factors and interactions that take place in the process, a factorial design at two levels (high + and low -) was used, what meant to carry out 8 experiences.

40|$|Residual {{stress is}} a complex subject which {{requires}} {{clear understanding of the}} phenomenon before any serious attempt in measuring it can be made. A variety of different phenomena is often lumped together under one collective name as residual stress and to complicate it further, these various types of residual stress can exist simultaneously together in an elastic body. Hence when interest is focussed on a specific type of residual stress, not only a distinction in identifying the type of residual stress is required, but it is imperative to be able to separate the various types of residual stress during its measurement. The magnitude and distribution of residual welding stresses produced in plates due to fusion welding are determined from X-ray diffraction measurements. In the investigation, the gas <b>metal-arc</b> <b>welding</b> process, using CO₂ as shielding gas and 1. 2 mm consumable solid wire as electrode, is employed. Residual stresses arising out of two different methods of metal transfer by this process, namely the spray and short-circuiting arc methods, are measured and compared. Effects of edge preparation and weld length upon the residual welding stress patterns are investigated. Results obtained so far from X-ray measurements have indicated large scatter of experimental points on the residual stress patterns. The author believes it can be attributed to local variation in initial stresses present in the plates before welding. Large variation in initial stress distribution can plausibly obscure the residual welding stress patterns sought in the present investigation. An interesting question immediately arises from this, namely how the initial stresses add on to the residual welding stresses during welding. This problem has been discussed in length in section 1. 2. The main school of throught supports simple additiveness of the two types of residual stress. However, conclusive evidence is lacking in this conjecture. This is mainly attributable to the lack of 'the' method of residual stress measurement upon which reliability can be confidently placed. Various methods of residual stress measurement have been discussed in section 1. 5 and the difference in characteristics is discussed in section 2. 4. It would appear that each method has its own drawbacks which are serious when accurate measurements of residual stress are required. The main drawback with the X-ray methods is the shallow effective penetration of the diffracted x-rays, and thus the method could only reveal surface stresses present in the surface layer of the elastic body. Problems peculiar to the X-ray methods are discussed in Chapter Six where the effects of surface preparation and preferred orientation on X-ray stress measurements are presented...|$|E
