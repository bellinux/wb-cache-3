5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the <b>metallic</b> radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where <b>metallic</b> radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the <b>metallic</b> bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between <b>metallic</b> and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Four {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished by}} polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). Consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic nonmetals show more <b>metallic</b> character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least <b>metallic</b> of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some <b>metallic</b> character, either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals. Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and <b>metallic</b> conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E

5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} <b>metallic</b> nature {{of some of the}} {{properties}} of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor in the direction of its planes, and since the halogens become more <b>metallic</b> with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be <b>metallic</b> in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are <b>metallic</b> when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E

5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some <b>metallic</b> character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least <b>metallic</b> of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most <b>metallic.</b> Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most <b>metallic</b> and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak <b>metallic</b> interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a <b>metallic</b> conductor.|$|E

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as <b>metallic</b> character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from <b>metallic</b> bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. <b>Metallic</b> bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours. Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours. Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours. As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours, as <b>metallic</b> character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E

5|$|<b>Metallic</b> silver, like copper, is an {{antibacterial}} agent, {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; <b>metallic</b> silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide.

5|$|Sirius A is classed as an Am star {{because the}} {{spectrum}} shows deep <b>metallic</b> absorption lines, indicating an enhancement in elements heavier than helium, such as iron.
