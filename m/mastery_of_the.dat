5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E

40|$|Current {{literature}} is inconsistent about <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> in <b>the</b> relation between perceived ethnic discrimination and depression. While {{on the one}} hand, higher levels <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> are theorized to buffer against <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> perceived ethnic discrimination, on the other hand, ethnic discrimination is thought to lower one’s level <b>of</b> <b>mastery,</b> explaining negative health outcomes. Using structural equation modeling, this study examined both roles <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> in <b>the</b> relation between perceived ethnic discrimination and depression in a large multi-ethnic sample of immigrant adults in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it was explored whether <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>mastery</b> was dependent upon <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discrimination perceived. As was expected, perceptions of ethnic discrimination were positively related to depression symptomatology. This relation was both mediated and moderated by <b>mastery,</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> discrimination one perceived.

Attempting to combine Michelangelo's <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied by candlelight. The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are quite {{different}} from his later ones. The works compiled in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, resulting in a different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as words such as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E

5|$|After swiftly {{recovering}} from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole of Italy {{was by no means}} assured. The Samnites were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The First Samnite War of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the Battle of Mount Gaurus in 342 BC and the Battle of Suessula in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War.|$|E
5|$|After their retreat, {{the native}} Theban kings found {{themselves}} trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling {{the north and}} the Hyksos' Nubian allies, the Kushites, to the south of Egypt. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555BC. The pharaohs Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Near East.|$|E

For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles.

5|$|Trident, {{named after}} the weapon that symbolized <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seas, was laid down in April 1870 in Toulon and {{launched}} on 9 November 1876. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known, {{it is believed that}} reduction of the French Navy's budget after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes. The ship was completed on 1 November 1878 and became the flagship of the second-in-command of the Mediterranean Squadron the following month. Trident, together with her sister ship , bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax on 15–16 July 1881 as the French occupied Tunisia. She was disarmed and placed in reserve in 1886–89, but was recommissioned on 17 February 1889 and resumed her role as flagship until she was again placed in reserve in 1894. The ship served as a gunnery training ship until she was condemned on 5 March 1900. Trident was renamed Var in 1904 and was sold for scrap five years later.|$|E

Practitioners of Eagle Claw, Chuojiao and Xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with Yue Fei, the supposed progenitor of these styles. He is also linked to Northern Praying Mantis boxing via Lin Chong and Yan Qing. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing. However, the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to Yue Fei. Nothing is ever said about him knowing or teaching a specific style of Chinese martial arts.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine navy, {{like the}} Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire itself, was a {{continuation}} of the Roman Empire and its institutions. After the Battle of Actium in 31BC, {{in the absence of any}} external threat in the Mediterranean, the Roman navy performed mostly policing and escort duties. Massive sea battles, like those fought in the Punic Wars, no longer occurred, and the Roman fleets were composed of relatively small vessels, best suited to their new tasks. By the early 4th century, the permanent Roman fleets had dwindled, so that when the fleets of the rival emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius clashed in 324AD, they were composed to a great extent of newly built or commandeered ships from the port cities of the Eastern Mediterranean. The civil wars of the 4th and early 5th centuries, however, did spur a revival of naval activity, with fleets mostly employed to transport armies. Considerable naval forces continued to be employed in the Western Mediterranean throughout the first quarter of the fifth century, especially from North Africa, but Rome's <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean was challenged when Africa was overrun by the Vandals over a period of fifteen years.|$|E
