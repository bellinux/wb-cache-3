5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced fluorescent pastel lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In the TV series, both Marco and Jake <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> skinks, {{a type of}} lizard (though they {{actually}} <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> eastern fence lizards); in the book, only Jake <b>morphs</b> <b>into</b> a lizard, a green anole.|$|R

50|$|The {{video is}} done to {{resemble}} one long shot, and uses Gondry's signature usage of special effects. In the black-and-white video, Beck walks into an empty house, tuning a radio to different stations, then sitting down in a chair, where he sings the song. Suddenly, {{the view of the}} city skyline outside <b>morphs</b> <b>into</b> a 2-dimensional humanoid figure, and the door <b>morphs</b> <b>into</b> a figure as well. As the video progresses, Beck and those two figures <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> each other, transforming into doors and skylines, while the apartment's radio and dresser <b>morph</b> <b>into</b> different forms, as well.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> a squall line. This line of severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early in the morning, the squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Rivalry came {{predominantly}} {{from the}} Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior {{to the second}} generation Commodore of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from mid-size offerings from Toyota Australia as well as Chrysler Australia, which <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw {{the launch of the}} Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of the second generation Commodore. With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives. In the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian army {{continued}} to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty. It is uncertain {{how many men}} were appointed as somatophylakes, which numbered eight men {{at the end of}} Alexander the Great's reign, while the hypaspistai seem to have <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> assistants of the somatophylakes. At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great's royal squadron of companion cavalry contained 800 men, the same number of cavalrymen in the sacred squadron (Latin: sacra ala; Greek: hiera ile) commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219BC. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the sacred squadron and royal cavalry. Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181BC, respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under PhilipV.|$|E

5|$|The first Labor {{party in}} South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891, {{born out of}} a trade union {{association}} that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union, later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> the Australian Labor Party in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian army {{continued}} to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty. It is uncertain {{how many men}} were appointed as somatophylakes, which numbered eight men {{at the end of}} Alexander the Great's reign, while the hypaspistai seem to have <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> assistants of the somatophylakes rather than a separate unit in their own right. At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen. Alexander the Great's 'royal squadron' of companion cavalry were similarly numbered to the 800 cavalrymen of the 'sacred squadron' (Latin: sacra ala; Greek: hiera ile) commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219 BC. Due to the Roman historian Livy's accounts of the battles of Callinicus in 171 BC and Pydna in 168 BC, it is known that the Macedonian cavalry were also divided into groups with similarly named officers as had existed in Alexander's day. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the 'sacred squadron' and 'royal cavalry'. Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181 respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under Philip V, such as its command by tetrarchai officers assisted by grammateis (i.e. secretaries or clerks).|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Lao military aviation establishment was the 'Laotian Aviation' (French: Aviation laotiènne), {{established by}} the French on 28 January 1955 as a small aerial observation and transport arm of the then National Lao Army (ANL). As the French withdrew from Indochina, the Lao Aviation was supported by American aid. With the addition of offensive capabilities, it <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF).|$|E

25|$|By 130 AD, Ptolemy, {{influenced}} by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, {{was using a}} symbol for0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this Hellenistic zero was the first documented use of a true zero in the Old World. In later Byzantine manuscripts of his Syntaxis Mathematica (Almagest), the Hellenistic zero had <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> the Greek letter omicron (otherwise meaning70).|$|E
25|$|The “Type 102” <b>morphed</b> <b>into</b> {{the early}} {{production}} Yugo 45 with a 903 cc engine, later into the 55 with a 1,116 cc engine {{and then the}} more powerful 65 fitted with a 1,301 cc engine also became available in the British market. The new Yugo competed with indigenous cars such as the Austin Mini-Metro and Ford Fiesta MK1/MK2, captive imports such as the Vauxhall Nova (Opel Corsa A), and French models like the Citroen Visa and Talbot Samba.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{addition}} to the city's museum scene is the Museum of Remembrance and Tolerance (Museo de la Memoria y Tolerancia), inaugurated in early 2011.

Permanent exhibits include those on the Holocaust and other large-scale atrocities. It also houses temporary exhibits; one on Tibet was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011.|$|E
