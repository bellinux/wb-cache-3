5000|$|... iRobot {{has been}} criticized for {{attempting}} unregulated use of 6240-6740 MHz band, and asking for an FCC exemption to do so. This band is for use for the lawn <b>mowing</b> <b>robot</b> without needing to use an electronic fence as a boundary marker, instead by using radio beacons. The band falls into a band reserved for radio astronomy use, thus interfering with radio telescope observations of methanol's 6.66852 GHz emissions.|$|E

In this paper, we {{introduce a}} new research about <b>mowing</b> <b>robot</b> on obstacle avoidance and path tracking controlling theoretically and practically, and propose the mowing control method which based on computer vision. Lawn images collected by camera, through the extraction of programming dealing with lawn, obstacles and boundary characteristics to achieve edge separation. Through special processing algorithm to determine boundary arises and obstacles location, size and speed of the robot, with real-time capturing and processing. This paper gives the complete image recognition processing, and analyzes several methods of image filtering and edge detection, and proposes simple control algorithm for obstacle avoidance, and applies MATLAB for obstacle avoidance simulation. The results show that: the method can correctly identify the obstacles and boundaries, through the output about location, size of the obstacles and boundary, border slope and speed of the robot to control robot mower. Most importantly, that computer vision applying in the <b>mowing</b> <b>robot</b> itself is an innovation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{address the}} problem of {{planning}} complete coverage paths for mowing robots that have the greatest coverage rates and the lowest repetitive rates, we proposed an improved back propagation neural network algorithm based on priority traversal thoughts for local path planning. The algorithm based on plowing global path planning. We adopted grid method to model the environment and used Matlab 2010 a to simulate for the algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can make the <b>mowing</b> <b>robot</b> walk out of dead zone, the dead zone was composed of obstacle grid or the grid that had been cut around this area, and achieve the complete coverage path planning...|$|E
40|$|Part 2 : Design, Manufacturing and Production ManagementInternational audienceConsidering {{the rapidly}} {{expanding}} market for <b>mowing</b> <b>robots</b> to homeowners the noticeable {{question that arises is}} {{what are the}} safety-guided design requirements that could be applied to production management via safety standards? Standardization attempts to protect human during the interaction with this device. It makes an effort to confine residents by implementing more legible guidelines. There is no correct or incorrect list of hazards, only a list that customers and designers agree that is necessary to be handled. However, the requirements may differ in the design stage. All the design requirements shall be included in the physical system design of the robotic mower. In this paper, the authors believe that it is essential to put forward a comprehensive and systematic list of corrective or preventive measures in order to provide a safety checklist throughout the design stages of robot use. These safety criteria intend to minimize the chance of an accident and offer the adequate protection to users...|$|R
50|$|A robotic {{lawn mower}} is an {{autonomous}} robot used to cut lawn grass. A typical robotic lawn mower (in particular earlier generation models) requires {{the user to}} set up a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be <b>mowed.</b> The <b>robot</b> uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to 20000 m2 of grass.|$|R
5000|$|When the <b>robot</b> <b>mows</b> {{the welcome}} mat it reveals the word Nerts, a {{possible}} reference {{to either the}} card game or to a popular expression of the time -- [...] "nertz". Some have speculated that Techno-Cracked may have been photographed in two-strip Technicolor.|$|R
50|$|A {{robotic mower}} is {{contained}} by a border wire around the lawn {{that defines the}} area to be <b>mowed.</b> The <b>robot</b> uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed {{and in some cases}} to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to 5 acre of grass. Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are usually self-docking and contain rain sensors, nearly eliminating human interaction for mowing grass. Multiple robotic mowers can be used to mow an even larger area.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} two robotic algorithms for {{the simulation}} of N <b>robots</b> <b>mowing</b> a field, such that no patch {{in the field}} will be left un-mowed by the robots. The first algorithm is a wall following algorithm, by which the robots follow the exterior walls, and circle in towards {{the center of the}} field. The second algorithm is one whereby the robots go up and down, sweeping from East to West, across the field. In order to evaluate the efficiency of each algorithm in directing <b>robots</b> to <b>mow</b> a field, we simulate the two algorithms in three different scenarios: 1) a simple open square field, 2) a square field with two obstacles on the borders, and 3) a square field with two obstacles on the borders, and an open obstacle in the center. The number of robots is varied in the simulations from one to ten, while the field to be mowed is taken to be a square field, consisting of 100 elements by 100 elements. We also define a cost function for measuring the efficiency of each <b>robot</b> in <b>mowing</b> a field. As we will demonstrate, each algorithm is found to be successful in directing the <b>robots</b> in <b>mowing</b> the field, in directing the robots to avoid the obstacles, and without leaving any elements un-mowed. Also, from our definition of the cost function, we will demonstrate that there are no serious differences in the efficiency of each algorithm...|$|R
