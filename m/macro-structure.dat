40|$|Until now texture {{has been}} largely viewed as a {{statistical}} or holistic paradigm: textures are described {{as a whole and}} by summary statistics. In this thesis it is assumed that there is a structure underlying the texture leading to models, reconstruction and to scale based analysis. Local Binary Patterns are used throughout as the basis functions for texture and methods have been developed to reconstruct texture images from arrays of their LBP codes. The reconstructed images contain identical texture properties to the original; providing the same array of LBP codes. An evidence gathering approach has been developed to provide a model for each texture class based on the spatial structure of these elements throughout the image. This method, called Evidence Gathering Texture Segmentation, provides good results for segmentation with smooth boundaries and minimal oversegmentation, when compared with existing methods. Analysing microand <b>macro-structures</b> confers ability to include scale in texture analysis. A novel combination of lowpass and highpass filters produces images devoid of structures at certain scales; allowing both the micro- and <b>macro-structures</b> to be analysed without occlusion by other scales of texture within the image. A two stage training process is used to learn the optimum filter sizes and to produce model histograms for each known texture class. The process, called Accumulative Filtering, gives superior results compared to the best multiresolution LBP configuration and analysis only using lowpass filters. By reconstruction, by evidence gathering and by analysis of micro- and <b>macro-structures,</b> new capabilities are described to exploit structure within the analysis of texture...|$|R

Filtering allows for {{selection}} of texture structures at different scales, revealing the micro- and <b>macro-structures</b> which {{would otherwise be}} concealed. The new approach to texture segmentation uses low- and high-pass filters to achieve this scale-based analysis.

These are generated for the original image and each of the filtered images. A two stage training process is used to learn the optimum filter sizes and to produce model histograms for each known texture class. These are used in the supervised segmentation of texture mosaics generated from the VisTex database. The results demonstrate the superiority of the new combined approach compared to the best multi-resolution LBP configuration and analysis only using lowpass filters. Noise analysis has also confirmed the advantageous properties of low- and high-pass filtering, and confirms that it is optimal to combine the two forms in texture segmentation...|$|R

50|$|Metallurgy did {{not arise}} {{as a science}} until the early 20th century. Before this, {{metallography}} was the primary method used for studying metals. Metallography {{is the study of}} the patterns in metals, the nature of fractures, and the microscopic crystal-formations. However, neither metallography as a science nor the crystal theory of metals emerged until the invention of the microscope. The ancient swordsmiths had no knowledge of metallurgy, nor did they understand the relationship between carbon and iron. Everything was typically learned by a process of trial-and-error, apprenticeship, and, as sword-making technology was often a closely guarded secret, some espionage. Prior to the 14th century, very little attention was paid to the patterns in the blade as an aesthetic quality. However, the Japanese smiths often prided themselves on their understanding of the internal <b>macro-structure</b> of metals.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the issue of}} {{conjunction}} use in learner writing from a text-structuring angle, focusing on hortatory expositions by NNS learners and NS professionals. The learners are advanced Dutch-speaking students of English, while the professionals are journalists writing for British quality newspapers. We investigate how external conjunctive items (CIs), which express real-world relations between states of affairs, interact with internal CIs, which relate to the writer’s speech acts or modal positions, to construct specific rhetorical <b>macro-structures,</b> or conjunctive profiles. On the basis of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we identify four profiles: (1) predominance of internal CIs, (2) predominant use of external CIs, (3) spreading of external and internal CIs over the whole essay, (4) concentration of internal CIs in introduction and conclusion. The first profile is exclusive to NNS learner writing, but the other three profiles are found in both NNS and NS expositions. Gross overuse of CIs is found in the first and second learner profiles only.

5000|$|In Japan, steel-making {{technology}} was imported from China, most likely through Korea. The steel {{used in the}} Chinese swords, called chi-kang (combined steel), was similar to pattern welding, and edges of it were often forge welded to a back of soft iron, or jou thieh. In trying to copy the Chinese method, the ancient smiths {{paid much attention to}} the various properties of steel, and worked to combine them to produce an internal <b>macro-structure</b> that would provide a similar combination of hardness and toughness. Like all trial-and-error, each swordsmith often attempted to produce an internal structure that was superior to swords of their predecessors, or even ones that were better than their own previous designs. The harder metals provided strength, like [...] "bones" [...] within the steel, whereas the softer metal provided ductility, allowing the swords to bend before breaking. In ancient times, the Japanese smiths would often display these inhomogeneities in the steel, especially on fittings like the guard or pommel, creating rough, natural surfaces by letting the steel rust or by pickling it in acid, making the internal structure part of the entire aesthetic of the weapon.|$|E
50|$|International and World-Historical Contexts: Skocpol also {{discuss the}} role of the {{international}} community in social revolutions. It is assumed that each nation learns from the example of others, for example, modernization takes off from Western Europe, since that is where commercial-industrial and national revolutions originated. After being modernized, nations often fall into revolutions due to the change in values, the unity and mobilization of people, and temper, and once the revolution is successful the state can undergo more socioeconomic development. Another chain of events Skocpol describes is that hasty and disorderly economic expansion encourages and disturbs mass expectations, leading to unanimous dissatisfaction and political violence, that in turn destroys the current government. This, in turn, leads to new ideological movements that diminish the authority of existing structures and recreate societal values. Overall, a state’s relationship with other countries and the international community in general helps to determine the outcome of its revolution. Not only do nations look to each other as examples of how to properly execute a revolution, but they also lean on others for support during one. The Potential Autonomy of the State: It is common knowledge that social revolutions begin with visibly political crises. It is also clear that they continue because of the struggles of political parties and factions and they eventually lead to a culmination in the fortification of new state organizations that ensure socioeconomic transformations. In other words, Skocpol explains, the uprising of certain social classes and socioeconomic transformations are tied tightly to the fall of the old regime and with the strengthening and functioning of the new regime. Of utmost importance when attempting to understand social-revolutionary transformations is understanding the state as a <b>macro-structure.</b> The state is “a set of administrative, policing, and military organizations headed, and more or less well coordinated by, an executive authority. Any state first and fundamentally extracts resources from society and deploys these to create and support coercive and administrative organizations”. Within these systems there are institutions that convey social interests in state policymaking. In essence, the “administrative and coercive organizations are the basis of state power”, {{and the degree to which}} these state organizations are independent from control of the dominant-class depend on the case. There is often a struggle, or a clash of interests between the dominant-class and the state. For this reason, it is important for analysts to take into account not only the relationship between classes, but also between states and between states and both dominant and subordinate classes (according to Marxists). It is important to look at state relations internationally, and class-structured economies and political interests when trying to understand state organizations.|$|E

This paper reports the synthesis of 3 - and 4 -arm star branched polymers via ring opening polymerisation (ROP) utilising multi-functional hydroxyl initiators and Sn(Oct) 2 as precatalyst. The structures produced include mono-functional hydrophobic and multi-functional amphiphilic core corona stars. The characteristics of the synthetic process were shown to be principally dependent upon the physical/dielectric properties of the initiators used. ROP’s using initiators that were more available to become directly involved with the Sn(Oct) 2 in the “in-situ” formation of the true catalytic species were observed to require shorter reaction times. Use of microwave heating (MWH) in homopolymer star synthesis reduced reaction times compared to conventional heating (CH) equivalents, this was attributed to an increased rate of “in-situ” catalyst formation. However, in amphiphilic core corona star formation, the MWH polymerisations exhibited slower propagation rates than CH equivalents. This was attributed to <b>macro-structuring</b> within the reaction medium, which reduced the potential for reaction. It was concluded that CH experiments were less affected by this <b>macro-structuring</b> because it was disrupted by the thermal currents/gradients caused by the conductive/convective heating mechanisms. These gradients are much reduced/absent with MWH because it selectively heats specific species simultaneously throughout the entire volume of the reaction medium. These partitioning problems were overcome by introducing additional quantities of the species that had been determined to selectively heat...|$|R
