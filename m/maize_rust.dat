40|$|The rp 1 {{locus of}} maize {{controls}} race-specific {{resistance to the}} common rust fungus Puccinia sorghi. Four mutant or recombinant Rp 1 alleles (rp 1 -NC 3, Rp 1 -D 21, Rp 1 -MD 19, and Rp 1 -Kr 1 N) were identified. They condition necrotic phenotypes {{in the absence of}} the rust pathogen. These Rp 1 lesion mimics fall into three different phenotypic classes: (1) The rp 1 -NC 3 and Rp 1 -D 21 alleles require rust infection or other biotic stimulus to initiate necrotic lesions. These alleles react strongly to all <b>maize</b> <b>rust</b> biotypes tested and also to nonhost rusts. (2) The Rp 1 -MD 19 allele, which has a similar phenotype, also requires a biotic stimulus to initiate lesions. However, Rp 1 -MD 19 shows the race specificity of the Rp 1 -D gene. (3) The Rp 1 -Kr 1 N allele specifies a diffuse necrotic phenotype in the absence of any biotic stimulus and a race-specific reaction when inoculated with <b>maize</b> <b>rust...</b>|$|E
40|$|Eleven popcorn {{varieties}} {{cultivated in}} the humid forest zone of south-western Nigeria {{were subjected to}} natural infections with disease causing agents and vertebrate pest infestation. Data were taken on the incidence and severity of maize field diseases, birds and on rodents attacks. Result of the experiments reveled that all the 11 popcorn varieties were found susceptible to leaf spot diseases {{with varying degrees of}} incidence. Five out of 11 Popcorn varieties namely Mercy, Ashland, Pearl shaped, P 618 and DMRSR were found having <b>maize</b> <b>rust</b> infection. The incidence of occurrence of streak was found in New A 2, Pearl shaped and Grace, while the remaining popcorn varieties had no streak infection. The popcorn variety with the least leaf blight incidence of 12. 4 was New A 2 followed with Prayer with the incidence of 14. 6 %. There was no incidence of smut and downy mildews recorded on the popcorn varieties. The vertebrate pests found associated with popcorn include bird species such as Ploceus cucullatus (Weaverbirds), Streptopelia semitorquata (Dove) and Francolinus bicalcaratus (Bush fowl), while the rodents include species such as Xerus erythropus (Red legged Ground Squirrel), Rattus rattus (Black grey Rat), Mastomys natalensis (Multimammate Rat) and Thryonomys swinderianus (Grass cutters/Cane rats). The activities of these vertebrate pests were more significant in P 618, followed by Mercy, Yellow composite and Mixed grain...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{mold and}} rust are {{diseases}} that can significantly reduce sorghum grain yield. Breeding for resistance to these diseases is hindered by inefficient disease screening. A viable option to greatly improve breeding efficiency {{is to identify}} molecular markers or genes linked to the host resistance. In this study, we applied 14, 739 single nucleotide polymorphism markers to the sorghum mini core of 242 accessions that had been evaluated for rust resistance in both greenhouse and field and for grain mold {{in the field for}} 2 years. Through association mapping we have identified two loci linked to grain mold resistance and five loci linked to rust resistance. Among the two loci linked to grain mold resistance, one contained a homolog of the maize nonhost resistance gene Rxo 1. Two of rust-linked loci each contained the rust resistance gene homologous to the <b>maize</b> <b>rust</b> resistance gene Rp 1 -D which is the B locus (the A locus containing Pu was not linked in this study) and to the wheat rust resistance gene Lr 1. The remaining loci contained genes important in other steps of the defense response, such as cyclophilins that mediate resistance response preceding hypersensitive response (HR) and Hin 1 directly involved in producing HR. The results from this study will facilitate marker-assisted selection of host resistance to grain mold and rust in sorghum...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Zea mays L. {{has been}} the most {{cultivated}} crop and the crop with the largest yield in China since 2012. We constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for the maize inbred line Qi 319, which may be used as a key source for disease-resistant maize breeding in China. The BAC contains 270, 720 clones, with an average insert size of 90 kb. The coverage of the library is about 10. 43 genome equivalents when considering a haploid genome size of 2300 Mb, providing a 99. 99 % likelihood of isolating any maize gene or sequence in the library. An average of 12 clones were obtained by polymerase chain reaction screening by using primer pairs linked to the genes for resistance to <b>maize</b> southern <b>rust</b> and rough dwarf. The results indicate that the library can satisfy the requirements for recovering specific sequences. The library is available to researchers to whom it may be of interest...|$|R
40|$|The <b>maize</b> Rp 1 <b>rust</b> {{resistance}} locus is {{a complex}} consisting {{of a family of}} closely related resistance genes. The number of Rp 1 paralogs in different maize lines (haplotypes) varied from a single gene in some stocks of the inbred A 188 to > 50 genes in haplotypes carrying the Rp 1 -A and Rp 1 -H specificities. The sequences of paralogs in unrelated haplotypes differ, indicating that the genetic diversity of Rp 1 -related genes is extremely broad in maize. Two unrelated haplotypes with five or nine paralogs had identical resistance phenotypes (Rp 1 -D) encoded in genes that differed by three nucleotides resulting in a single amino acid substitution. Genes in some haplotypes are more similar to each other than to any of the genes in other haplotypes indicating that they are evolving in a concerted fashion...|$|R

40|$|The Rp 1 -D {{gene for}} {{resistance}} to <b>maize</b> common <b>rust</b> (Puccinia sorghi) {{is a member}} of a complex locus (haplotype) composed of Rp 1 -D and approximately eight other gene homologs. The identity of Rp 1 -D was demonstrated by using two independent gene-tagging approaches with the transposons Mutator and Dissociation. PIC 20, a disease resistance (R) gene analog probe previously mapped to the rp 1 locus, detected insertion of Dissociation in an Rp 1 -D mutation and excision in three revertants. Independent libraries probed with the PIC 20 or Mutator probes resulted in isolation of the same gene sequence. Rp 1 -D belongs to the nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat class of R genes. However, unlike the rust resistance genes M and L 6 from flax, the maize Rp 1 -D gene does not encode an N-terminal domain with similarity to the signal transduction domains of the Drosophila Toll protein and mammalian interleukin- 1 receptor. Although the abundance of transcripts of genes from the rp 1 complex changed with leaf age, {{there was no evidence of}} any change due to inoculation with avirulent or virulent rust biotypes. A set of 27 Rp 1 -D mutants displayed at least nine different deletions of Rp 1 -D gene family members that were consistent with unequal crossing-over events. One mutation (Rp 1 -D*- 24) resulted in deletion of all but one gene family member. Other unique deletions were observed in the disease lesion mimic Rp 1 -D*- 21 and the partially susceptible mutant Rp 1 -D*- 5. Different rp 1 specificities have distinct DNA fingerprints (haplotypes). Analysis of recombinants between rp 1 specificities indicated that recombination had occurred within the rp 1 gene complex. Similar analyses indicated that the rust R genes at the rp 5 locus, 2 centimorgans distal to rp 1, are not closely related to Rp 1 -D...|$|R
40|$|As doenças foliares do milho estão entre os fatores mais limitantes à produtividade, sendo o desenvolvimento de genótipos resistentes um dos principais alvos do melhoramento genético. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram determinar o potencial genético de dez linhagens endogâmicas desenvolvidas pela Empresa GS Pesquisas, para uso como testadoras e na obtenção de híbridos, com elevado desempenho agronômico e resistência a doenças foliares; identificar o tipo de ação gênica predominante para resistência à Mancha-branca do milho; Exserohilum turcicum; Physopella zeae; e Puccinia polysora. Os F 1 s dos cruzamentos dialélicos das dez linhagens e as testemunhas P 3069, P 30 F 90, BG 7060, Balu 761 e Dow 2 A 120 foram avaliados em quatro locais (Dourados  MS; Sorriso  MT; Jaciara - MT e Pitangueiras - PR), utilizando o delineamento em blocos completamente casualizados, com três repetições. As parcelas foram constituídas de fileiras únicas de 5 metros de comprimento, no espaçamento de 0, 80 m entre fileiras e 0, 20 m entre plantas dentro da fileira, totalizando 25 plantas/parcela. Foram {{realizadas}} análises de variância e da capacidade geral e específica de combinação para: produtividade de grãos (t ha- 1, corrigido para estande ideal de 25 plantas por parcela e umidade de 14 %); altura média da planta (cm); altura média da espiga (cm) e notas de severidade às doenças Mancha-branca, Mancha foliar de E. turcicum, e Ferrugens tropical e polissora. As linhagens com maior frequência de alelos favoráveis foram LGS 2, LGS 9, LGS 4 e LGS 3, participando na formação dos melhores híbridos (LGS 3 x LGS 9, LGS 2 x LGS 6, LGS 2 x LGS 4 e LGS 2 x LGS 3), apresentando excelente desempenho em relação às testemunhas, para os diferentes caracteres avaliados. A partir dos resultados dos dialelos, infere-se que os efeitos gênicos aditivos são os mais importantes para resistência à Mancha-branca e altura de espiga, enquanto os não aditivos são mais importantes para produtividade, altura de planta, resistência à E. turcicum, P. zeae e P. polysora. Corn leaf {{diseases are}} among the most limiting factors of yield, what makes the development of resistant genotypes one of the major targets of genetic improvement. The objectives of this research were to define the genetic potential of ten inbred lines developed by the Enterprise GS Researches, to use them as testers and to obtain hybrids with high agronomic performance and resistance to leaf diseases; to identify the predominant type of gene action for resistance to the white spot of corn; Exserohilum turcicum; Physopella zeae; and Puccinia polysora. The F 1 s of the diallel crosses from the ten lines and the checks P 3069, P 30 F 90, BG 7060, Balu 761 and Dow 2 A 120 were evaluated in four locations (Dourados - MS; Sorriso - MT; Jaciara - MT and Pitangueiras - PR) using the randomized block designs, with three repetitions. The plots were consisted of single rows of five meters of length with the space among rows of 0. 80 m. and 0. 20 m. among plants in the rows, totaling 25 plants/portion. The characters evaluated were: grain yield (t ha- 1, corrected to ideal stand of 25 plants and 14 % moisture); plant height (cm); ear height (cm) and grades of severity to the diseases white spot, turcicum leaf blight, tropical <b>rust</b> and <b>Maize</b> southern <b>rust.</b> The lines with higher frequency of favorable alleles were LGS 2, LGS 9, LGS 4 and LGS 3 participated {{in the formation of the}} best hybrids (LGS 3 x LGS 9, LGS 2 x LGS 6, LGS 2 x LGS 4 and LGS 2 x LGS 3), showing excellent performance in relation to checks, for different evaluated characters. From the results of the diallel, it is possible to infer that the additive effects are most important for resistance of white spot and ear height, while the non-additive are most important to the yield, plant height, resistance of à E. turcicum, P. zeae and P. polysora. Puccinia polysora.
