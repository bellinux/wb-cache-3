40|$|Numerous {{abandoned}} uranium mines (AUM) {{within the}} Navajo Nation contribute uranium (U), arsenic (As) and other metals to the soil, air and groundwater {{that continue to}} pose potential health risks to Navajo residents. The prevalence of inflammatory-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) has increased among the Navajo community in recent decades. Environmental exposure to metal contaminants may alter the circulation {{in ways that are}} associated with the inflammation-driven process of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Thus, we hypothesize that exposures to AUM metal contaminants are associated with pro-atherogenic changes in the circulation as evidenced by increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and serum inflammatory potential. To assess the relative contribution of mining metals exposures on community health, we assessed oxLDL and its relationship to CVD and T 2 D biomarkers in the Navajo, and then these data were linked to <b>mining</b> <b>contaminant</b> exposure metrics (water intake and urine metals). As proof-of-concept and to examine a possible mechanism, acellular assays investigated if As and U could directly oxidize purified human LDL cholesterol. Lastly, since serum represents the balance of inflammation, i. e. inflammatory potential, transcriptional responses of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL 2) were measured from primary endothelial cells treated with participant serum. These responses were linked to <b>mining</b> <b>contaminant</b> exposures (water intake and AUM proximity). Regression modeling showed that estimated annual intake of As from drinking water is a significant predictor of oxLDL in this population, despite oxLDL levels being similar to levels in other populations without evidence of CVD. We found that As, but not U, oxidized the protein but not the lipid components of LDL cholesterol. Linear regression modeling showed that AUM proximity solely and strongly predicted serum inflammatory potential as measured by endothelial cell transcription of VCAM- 1, ICAM- 1 and CCL 2. Taken together, our data suggest that exposure to U mining waste in a population with several CVD risk factors influences pro-atherogenic changes in the circulation, and that other exposure routes, metals, and mixtures should be investigated. Our data may aid in modifying clinical treatment decisions and exposure reduction strategies.

One important aspect of these models is the quantity of inter-basin groundwater flow from regional systems to the north. This component of flow, together with its uncertainty, must be properly accounted for in the CAU flow models to provide a defensible regional framework for calculations of radionuclide transport that will support determinations of the Yucca Flat-Climax <b>Mine</b> <b>contaminant</b> boundary.

The study aims at the {{integrated}} use of existing meteorological information with the drainage basin morphometry of the mine catchment for determining the preferential flow path for the <b>mine</b> <b>contaminants.</b> The study reveals that the actual mining area lies at the headwaters of two watersheds: Watershed A and Watershed B. The streams in Watershed A drain in a North East- South West direction, whereas the streams of watershed B trend in a South East – North West direction. The peak runoff estimates show that {{in case of a}} heavy rainfall event, more surface discharge will be generated in Watershed A mainly due to its large surface area thus, leading to potential contamination in the south of the mining area. The runoff estimates for a maximum rainfall event of 104 mm/day is equal to 21. 527 m 3 /s for Watershed A and 8. 310 m 3 /s for Watershed B.

40|$|Porous {{media are}} broadly {{found in nature}} and their study is of high {{relevance}} in our present lives. In geosciences porous media research is fundamental in applications to aquifers, mineral <b>mines,</b> <b>contaminant</b> transport, soil remediation, waste storage, oil recovery and geothermal energy deposits. Despite their importance, there is as yet no complete understanding of the physical processes involved in fluid flow and transport. This fact {{can be attributed to}} the complexity of the phenomena which include multicomponent fluids, multiphasic flow and rock-fluid interactions. Since its formulation in 1856, Darcy's law has been generalized to describe multi-phase compressible fluid flow through anisotropic and heterogeneous porous and fractured rocks. Due to the scarcity of information, a high degree of uncertainty on the porous medium properties is commonly present. Contributions to the knowledge of modeling flow and transport, as well as to the characterization of porous media at field scale are of great relevance. This book addresses several of these issues, treated with a variety of methodologies grouped into four parts: I Fundamental concepts II Flow and transport III Statistical and stochastic characterization IV Waves The problems analyzed in this book cover diverse length scales that range from small rock samples to field-size porous formations. They belong to the most active areas of research in porous media with applications in geosciences developed by diverse authors. This book was written for a broad audience with a prior and basic knowledge of porous media.

40|$|Attenuation of acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) metals {{originating from}} abandoned mines and waste rock dumps is investigated {{in this thesis}} at Slättberg in central Sweden, where acid mine leachate has been discharging for over 70 years into the receiving wetland stream and mire. Risk assessment of AMD and related polluted lands requires a holistic approach that is able to study the complexity of pollution emissions and impacted landscapes. In this thesis a link between geochemical contaminant fate modelling and landscape analysis is presented for AMD risk assessment. A simple geochemical landscape analysis tool is developed to analyse and model geochemical abundances, geochemical gradients, geochemical flow patterns and geochemical barriers in the studied stream and mire sediments. Sampling locations at geochemical barriers are identified using landscape geochemical and GIS methods. A sequential chemical extraction procedure is used to investigate fractions which are expected to act as potential sinks of the six studied metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the sediments. For data modelling robust statistical methods of Exploratory Data Analysis are used to treat small sample sizes with multimodal character and outlying values. The spatial variability of metal retention in the sediments is studied by multivariate data analysis methods. Results show that the developed simple geochemical landscape analysis method can be used efficiently for the risk assessment of toxic <b>mine</b> <b>contaminants</b> in the complex receiving wetland landscape. It {{is suggested by the}} analysis that the oxidising geochemical barrier in the stream sediments can be sufficiently characterised by the distribution of Fe fractions.

40|$|Controlled {{recirculation}} {{has been}} used in the metal/nonmetal mining industry for energy savings when heating and cooling air, in undersea mining and for increasing airflow to mining areas. For safe and effective use of controlled district recirculation, adequate airflow to dilute contaminants must exist prior to implementation, ventilation circuit parameters must be accurately quantified, ventilation network modeling must be up to date, emergency planning scenarios must be performed and effective monitoring and control systems must be installed and used. Safety and health issues that must be considered and may be improved through the use of controlled district recirculation include blasting fumes, dust, diesel emissions, radon and <b>contaminants</b> from <b>mine</b> fires. Controlled recirculation methods are expected to become more widely used as mines reach greater working depths, requiring that these health and safety issues be well understood. The U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted two controlled recirculation tests over three days at a Wyoming trona mine, utilizing an inline booster fan to improve airflow to a remote and difficult-to-ventilate development section. Test results were used to determine the effect that recirculation had on air qualities and quantities measured in that section and in other adjacent areas. Pre-test conditions, including ventilation quantities and pressures, were modeled using VnetPC. During each test, ventilation quantities and pressures were measured, as well as levels of total dust. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer gas was used to simulate a <b>mine</b> <b>contaminant</b> to monitor recirculation wave cycles.

40|$|Following {{the decline}} of the UK metal mining {{industry}} by the 1920 s, over 3, 000 abandoned metal mines exist in England and Wales. Contaminated drainage from this historical industry causes approximately 20 % of all water quality failures in England and Wales. In this thesis, a holistic geographical approach, incorporating aspects of hydrology, hydrogeochemistry and freshwater ecology, is employed to investigate the hydrological, sedimentological and ecological impacts of the abandoned Dylife lead/zinc mine on the Afon Twymyn (central Wales). Examination of river sediment quality highlights the need for measurements of the quality of this component of the river ecosystem and, in particular, measurement of bioavailable as opposed to total metals. The majority of heavy metals in bed sediments of the Afon Twymyn exist in highly mobile geochemical phases, potentially posing serious threats to ecological integrity. Significant metal flushing occurred during flood events at Dylife mine and a distinct seasonal pattern was observed with greater levels of flushing occurring during flood events in the summer months. It is suggested that investigations of contaminant/ecosystem relations and potential remediation strategies should include high-resolution temporal sampling of river water chemistry under conditions of flood flow. Paradoxically, a range of biological indices failed to identify significant negative impacts of metal <b>mine</b> <b>contaminants</b> on macroinvertebrate communities, suggesting there is little contamination of the river ecosystem. However, Canonical Correspondence Analysis did identify significant differences in community structure between polluted and unpolluted river stretches, suggesting that standard unimetric biological indices might only be successful in identifying impacts at the most severely polluted mine sites. It is suggested that the ecological approach of the European Union Water Framework Directive to the assessment of river ecosystem status may not yield an accurate representation of contamination in rivers such as the Afon Twymyn where contamination by mining is moderate, circum-neutral and the mining operation is long abandoned.

30|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{performed}} on chromosomes, coloration, diet, thermoregulation, and geometric morphometrics which have provided evidence for clinal variation of lizards in Chile (Lamborot 1991; Lamborot et al. 2012; Vásquez et al. 2007; Vidal et al. 2007; Sepúlveda et al. 2008; Fariña et al. 2008; Vidal et al. 2008). In spite of these evidences, our results do not show clinal variation in head shape among the five studied localities of M. atacamensis. The PCA showed a superposition of all the localities both in dorsal and lateral view, indicating that the different morphs may be found in all the studied localities. However, this analysis showed some tendency to group the Pan de Azúcar and Tres Playitas localities in dorsal view, and Caldera and Tres Playitas in the lateral view (Figure  3). Although the results of the a posteriori analysis show a tendency of segregation in two relative warps in dorsal view and three in lateral view, the majority of the results obtained did not show significant differences among localities. Although Fariña et al. (2008) showed a latitudinal gradient in the diet of M. atacamensis, we did not find a similar pattern {{in the shape of the}} head as shown in the study of Vidal et al. (2006) in L. pictus. Kaliontzopoulou et al. (2010) found significant different differences in the form of the head of Podarcis bocagei, related to the habitat utilized. In the present case, M. atacamensis uses the same habitat in its entire distribution range (Ortiz 1980 b; Heisig 1993; Sepúlveda et al. 2006), which may explain in part the lack of clinal differences in head form. The same is true of L. petrophilus (Fontanella et al. 2012); although there are differences in the shape of the cranium from north to south, this is due to the fact that this species occupies different niches latitudinally. In Strengeriana maniformis, Pedraza and Campos (2007) did not find significant differences in the form of the gonopod among habits with and without mining contamination; they found, as in the present case, that the different morphs are distributed in both types of habitats, which may indicate that this species has some plasticity to <b>mining</b> <b>contaminants.</b> M. atacamensis may also have some plasticity in diet, depending upon the food available, explaining in part the lack of clinal variation in head form over a latitudinal range.|$|R

Paradoxically, populations of both fish species exposed to the highest concentrations of mine-related metals (cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, uranium and zinc) in surface water and sediment had the lowest tissue (bone, liver and muscle) concentrations of these metals. The degree of reduction in tissue concentrations of exposed populations was also specific to each metal and inversely related to its degree of environmental increase above background. Several explanations for diminished metal bioaccumulation in fishes from the contaminated region were evaluated. Geochemical speciation modeling of metal bioavailability in surface water showed no differences between the contaminated region and the control sites. Also, the macro-nutrient (calcium, magnesium and sodium) water concentrations, that may competitively inhibit metal uptake, were not elevated with trace metal contamination. Reduced exposure to contaminants due to avoidance behavior was unlikely due {{to the absence of}} refugial water bodies with the requisite metal concentrations lower than the control sites and very reduced connectivity at time of sampling. The most plausible interpretation of these results is that populations of both fish species have modified kinetics within their metal bioaccumulation physiology, via adaptation or tolerance responses, to reduce their body burdens of metals.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of post-mining landscapes as case studies {{is an important}} part of the evaluation of current rehabilitation practices. A necessary part of this assessment is to predict the surface stability of the landform using erosion and landform evolution modelling techniques. In the short term, erosion on a rehabilitated mine site can lead to increased sediment loads and transport of other <b>mine</b> related <b>contaminants</b> in downstream waterways. It is well recognized that in many mine areas the erodibility of surface materials can, and does, vary. This is a particularly significant issue on mine sites, where the surface conditions may range from areas of undisturbed natural surface materials, waste rock dumps constructed with materials exhumed from the sub-surface, and other areas that have a mix of waste rock and soil to enhance the growth of vegetation. A further significant issue is that when the subsurface materials are exposed to surface conditions they can weather rapidly, changing their erodibility. This paper uses a new version of the SIBERIA landscape evolution and soil erosion model to evaluate the former Nabarlek uranium mine site in the Northern Territory, Australia. This new version of SIBERIA uses spatially variable erosion and hydrology parameters across the study domain to represent different erodibilities of surface materials, thus allowing better representation of catchment heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that the model predicts erosion rates similar to that of other modelled results and independent field data, providing confidence in the model and its parameterization.

40|$|A three-year {{multidisciplinary}} {{study was}} conducted on the relationship between mine waste contamination and the effects on aquatic and terrestrial habitats in the Methow River below abandoned mines near Twisp in Okanogan County, Washington (U. S. A.). Ore deposits in the area were mined for gold, silver, copper and zinc until the early 1950 's. An above-and-below-mine approach was used to study potentially impacted sites. Although the dissolved metal content of water in the Methow River was below the limits of detection, eleven chemicals of potential environmental concern were identified in the tailings, mine effluents, groundwater, streamwater and sediments (Al, As, B, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn). The potential for ecosystem level impacts was reflected in the risk of contamination in the mine waste to communities and populations that are valued for their functional properties related to energy storage and nutrient cycling. Dissolved and sediment metal contamination changed the benthic insect community structure in a tributary of the Methow River below Alder Mine, and at the population level, caddisfly larval development in the Methow River was delayed. Arsenic accumulation in bear hair and Cd in fish liver suggest top predators are effected. In situ exposure of juvenile triploid trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to conditions at the downstream site resulted in reduced growth and increased mortality among exposed individuals. Histopathological studies of their tissues revealed extensive glycogen inclusions suggesting food is being converted into glycogen and stored in the liver but the glycogen is not being converted back normally into glucose for distribution to other tissues in the body. Subcellular observations revealed mitochondrial changes including a decrease in the number and increase in the size of electron-dense metrical granules, the presence of glycogen bodies in the cytoplasm, and glycogen nuclei in exposed trout hepatocytes, which are signs that Type IV Glycogen Storage disease is occurring. GSD IV is caused by either a deficiency or inactivation of the glycogen branching enzyme that results in the synthesis of an abnormal glycogen molecule that is insoluble and has decreased branch points and increased chain length.

40|$|The Mount Morgan Mine is a {{historic}} mine site located in Central Queensland, Australia which has heavily impacted portions of the adjacent Dee River. As part of overall closure planning a chemical load balance study was performed for the Mt. Morgan <b>mine</b> site. The <b>contaminants</b> of concern (COC) included in this analysis are sulphate (SO 4), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). The load balance model was developed based on detailed groundwater quality monitoring at the site (since 2003) and used groundwater flow estimates obtained from a 3 D groundwater flow model calibrated for the site. The analysis indicates that seepage from the flooded Open Cut/Sandstone Gully represents the single largest source of contaminants on the site exceeding all other contaminant sources {{by a wide margin}} (except for the Lower Mundic Waste, which contributes the highest iron loading). Seepage from the Western Dump and Shepherds Dump represent other dominant sources of contaminant loads, in particular with respect to sulphate, aluminum, and copper. The load balance further suggests that the Mundic West and Frog Hollow sumps intercept nearly 90 % of the contaminant load that is generated by the Open Cut/Sandstone Gully and downstream waste units. Seepage interception is less efficient in the Shepherd’s catchment, where the interception system removes only 20 - 40 % of the contaminant load supplied by seepage from the Shepherd’s Tailings Dam and the Shepherd’s Outer Dump. The load balance study also identified several data gaps which resulted in the installation of additional monitoring wells on site and along the Dee River.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in which three selected metals-contaminated mine drainage water samples were treated by chemical precipitation followed by flotation using colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs) to concentrate the precipitates. Drainage water samples used in the experiments were collected from an abandoned turn-of-the-century copper mine in south-central Wyoming, an inactive gold mine in Colorado's historic Clear Creek mining district, and a relatively modern gold mine near Rapid City, South Dakota. The copper mine drainage sample was nearly neutral (pH 6. 5) while the two gold mine samples were quite acidic (pH {approx} 2. 5). Metals concentrations ranged from a few mg/L for the copper mine drainage to several thousand mg/L for the sample from South Dakota. CGAs are emulsions of micrometer-sized soap bubbles generated in a surfactant solution. In flotation processes the CGA microbubbles provide a huge interfacial surface area and cause minimal turbulence as they rise through the liquid. CGA flotation can provide an inexpensive alternative to dissolved air flotation (DAF). The CGA bubbles are similar in size to the bubbles typical of DAF. However, CGAs are generated at ambient pressure, {{eliminating the need for}} compressors and thus reducing energy, capital, and maintenance costs associated with DAF systems. The experiments involved precipitation of dissolved metals as either hydroxides or sulfides followed by flotation. The CGAs were prepared using a number of different surfactants. Chemical precipitation followed by CGA flotation reduced contaminant metals concentrations by more than 90 % for the copper mine drainage and the Colorado gold <b>mine</b> drainage. <b>Contaminant</b> metals were concentrated into a filterable sludge, representing less than 10 % of the original volume. CGA flotation of the highly contaminated drainage sample from South Dakota was ineffective. All of the various surfactants used in this study generated a large sludge volume and none provided a significant concentration factor with this sample. For the two samples where CGA flotation was effective, the separation was very rapid and the concentrate volume was reduced when compared to gravity separation under similar conditions. Effective separations were achieved with very low chemical dosages and low residence times, suggesting the possibility of economic viability for processes based on this concept. The CGA flotation experiments described in the following report {{were conducted}} to provide preliminary data with which to assess the technical feasibility of using the method for remediation of metals-contaminated mine drainage waters. The experiments were conducted using common, low-cost, precipitating reagents and CGA prepared from several surfactants. Results were evaluated in terms of metals concentration reduction, reagent consumption, and concentrate volume. The results of these preliminary experiments indicate that CGA flotation may be a useful tool for the treatment of some types of mine drainage...|$|R
40|$|Acid mine {{drainage}} (AMD) is {{an environmental}} pollutant that degrades water bodies and harms aquatic life. In the Appalachian Mountains {{of the eastern}} U. S., over 7, 500 miles of streams are impacted by AMD. Current methods of active treating AMD such as neutralization with limestone are labor-intensive and costly. Passive treatments with lower maintenance and management costs are the more sustainable alternatives for AMD management. The research reported herein explores the possibility of applying flowback water from natural gas drilling operations and the chelating agent 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) as additive to passively treat AMD. The hypothesis is that chemicals present in the flowback water will form insoluble salts {{with those in the}} mine residue and precipitate on the mine rock to passivate the surface [...] Additionally, GOPS will improve upon the passivation process by complexing with metal ions in the precipitate to form a multilayer hydrophobic coating. In order to develop a protocol for measuring the optimal dosage of flowback water and GOPS for AMD prevention, several preliminary batch tests were conducted. These tests evaluated the reaction time and volumes of flowback water and GOPS appropriate for further column testing, as measured by concentrations of Fe, Ba, and SO 42 -. From batch studies, it is observed that when 55 mL of flowback water was added to 500 mg of <b>mine</b> residue, the <b>contaminants</b> of major concern, Fe and SO 42 - reached their lowest levels. Meanwhile, a dosage of 0. 0001 M GOPS is optimum to improve the microencapsulation. Results from the test column were compared to an identical control column, which was treated with deionized water. The results suggest that, for the experiment duration of one month, flowback water and GOPS have done an effective job in curbing the release of Fe and SO 42 - from mine residue.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{groundwater}} {{in many regions}} around {{the world has been}} compromised due to pollution from anthropogenic activities such as deposition of solid wastes containing heavy metals in landfills, industrial spills and leaching from <b>mine</b> tailings. Inorganic <b>contaminants</b> such as lead, cobalt, and cadmium have been a growing concern owing to their detrimental environmental and health effects. Several methods have been used to remediate contaminated soils and groundwater. These methods include phytoremedation, biosorption, neutralization, and chemical oxidation. These methods, however, have several limitations and disadvantages including quality control, lack of selectivity and generation of additional contamination and waste sludge. Electrokinetic remediation is a growing technology used largely to remediate and restore soils and groundwater affected by organic and inorganic contamination. Electrokinetics is the application of a direct current to a wet soil to transport or remove water and/or ions via the soil pores. Two main phenomena are observed when a voltage gradient is applied to a wet and compacted soil. The first is the movement of the soil's pore fluid towards the cathode, known as electro?osmosis. The second is electro?migration which is the movement of ions towards the oppositely charged electrode. Though much work reported in the literature has focused on the application of electrokinetic phenomena to remediate contaminated soils, this thesis focuses on utilizing electrokinetic phenomena to prevent groundwater contamination at an industrial mine site. The first objective of this work was to investigate the applicability of an electrokinetic barrier to prevent groundwater contamination downstream of a tailings management area at a Canadian mine site by trapping cobalt near the cathode. To meet the first objective, direct current was applied either continuously or intermittently. The second objective was to examine the fate of the cobalt accumulated in the soil after the termination of the electrokinetic barrier. The experimental studies showed the effectiveness of the applied voltage gradient in reducing the net flow of water downstream of the barrier and diminishing cobalt concentration and mass in the effluent. Furthermore, the influences of electro?osmosis, electro?migration, and the sharp pH gradient which favored cobalt adsorption/precipitation near the cathode resulted in trapping cobalt in the cathode region near the inlet of the cell. Additionally, using intermittent current to power the electrokinetic barrier yielded results that were generally comparable to those obtained with continuous current. This finding offered important insights for future work on the use of solar powered electrokinetic barriers. Wash out tests in which the potential gradient was stopped midway through the test were conducted to address the second objective. The concentration of cobalt in the effluent did not increase after the termination of the potential gradient, {{for the duration of the}} test. The accumulated cobalt was retained in the soil and was not washed out of the cells. In summary, this study demonstrated that an electrokinetic barrier can be successfully used to prevent groundwater contamination due to cobalt by taking advantage of the coupled effects of electro?osmosis, electro?migration and water electrolysis at the electrodes...|$|R
40|$|Coupled {{modeling}} of subsurface multiphase fluid and heat flow, solute transport and chemical reactions {{can be used}} for the assessment of mineral alteration in hydrothermal systems, waste disposal sites, acid <b>mine</b> drainage remediation, <b>contaminant</b> transport, and groundwater quality. A comprehensive non-isothermal multi-component reactive fluid flow and geochemical transport simulator, TOUGHREACT, has been developed. A wide range of subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes is considered under various thermohydrological and geochemical conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, and ionic strength. The program can be applied to one-, two- or three-dimensional porous and fractured media with physical and chemical heterogeneity. The model can accommodate any number of chemical species present in liquid, gas and solid phases. A variety of equilibrium chemical reactions are considered, such as aqueous complexation, gas dissolution/exsolution, and cation exchange. Mineral dissolution/precipitation can proceed either subject to local equilibrium or kinetic conditions. Changes in porosity and permeability due to mineral dissolution and precipitation can be considered. Linear adsorption and decay can be included. For the purpose of future extensions, surface complexation by double layer model is coded in the program. Xu and Pruess (1998) developed a first version of a non-isothermal reactive geochemical transport model, TOUGHREACT, by introducing reactive geochemistry into the framework of the existing multi-phase fluid and heat flow code TOUGH 2 (Pruess, 1991). Xu, Pruess, and their colleagues have applied the program to a variety of problems such as: (1) supergene copper enrichment (Xu et al, 2001), (2) caprock mineral alteration in a hydrothermal system (Xu and Pruess, 2001 a), and (3) mineral trapping for CO{sub 2 } disposal in deep saline aquifers (Xu et al, 2003 b and 2004 a). For modeling the coupled thermal, hydrological, and chemical processes during heater tests at proposed nuclear waste disposal site at Yucca Mountain (Nevada), Sonnenthal and Spycher (2000) and Spycher et al. (2003) enhanced TOUGHREACT on (1) high temperature geochemistry, (2) mineral reactive surface area calculations, and (3) porosity and permeability changes due to mineral alteration. On the other hand, Pruess et al. (1999) updated the TOUGH 2 simulator to TOUGH 2 V 2. The present version of TOUGHREACT was developed by introducing the work of Sonnenthal and Spycher (2000) to the original work of Xu and Pruess (1998), and by replacing TOUGH 2 (Pruess, 1991) by TOUGH 2 V 2 (Pruess et al, 1999). The TOUGHREACT program makes use of ''self-documenting'' features. It is distributed with a number of input data files for sample problems. Besides providing benchmarks for proper code installation, these can serve as self-teaching tutorial in the use of TOUGHREACT, and they provide templates to help jump-start new applications. The fluid and heat flow part of TOUGHREACT is derived from TOUGH 2 V 2, so in addition to the current manual, users must have manual of the TOUGH 2 V 2 (Pruess et al., 1999). The present version of TOUGHREACT provides the following different TOUGH 2 fluid property or ''EOS'' (equation-of-state) modules: (1) EOS 1 for water, or two waters with typical applications to hydrothermal problems, (2) EOS 2 for multiphase mixtures of water and CO{sub 2 } also with typical applications to hydrothermal problems, (3) EOS 3 for multiphase mixtures of water and air with typical applications to vadose zone and nuclear waste disposal problems, (4) EOS 4 that has the same capabilities as EOS 3 but with vapor pressure lowering effects due to capillary pressure, (5) EOS 9 for single phase water (Richards. equation) with typical applications to ambient reactive geochemical transport problems, (6) ECO 2 for multiphase mixtures of water, CO{sub 2 } and NaCl with typical applications to CO{sub 2 } disposal in deep brine aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Due to mining, {{considerable}} {{amounts of}} heavy metal bearing mineralsare scattered {{in the atmosphere}} in the form of dust and make the surrounding air, water and soils polluted. Runoff water movingfrom the mountainstowardsplains may also transport heavy metals from mines to the soils. One type ofpollutions is contamination withheavy metals. The purpose of the present research has been to investigate the effect of heavy metals of mine on soil, water, plant and dust pollution. Materials and Methods: Gushfil mine is located 3 kilometers southwest of Sepahanshahr, Isfahan. Soil profiles were dug 500 meters apart along three parallel transects, between east of Sepahanshahr and Gushfil mine. The profiles were described and samples were collected from their horizons. Ore, wells, plant and dust were sampled as well. Total concentrations of lead, zinc and cadmium were measured in the samples. To find the origin of polluted dust and soil, lead isotopes contents in the samples were measured and regressional relationships between the ratios of these contents were investigated. Results and Discussion Sepahanshahr soils are not contaminated by zinc, lead and cadmium, but within a distance of one to two kilometers from the Gushfil mine, the soils are polluted by zinc and lead. Cadmium contamination was not observed in the studied soils. In all of the soils, the heavy metals content varies downwards irregularly. The reason for this variation trend is that the studied soils are alluvial. In different periods of time, alluvium parent materials have been transported by runoff water from the lead and zinc mines towards the alluvial piedmont plain. The studied heavy metals have been distributed irregularly in different horizons of the soils that have been formed in these parent materials. Lead and cadmium concentrations of drinking water in the studied area are much higher than the maximum amount allowed by the World Health Organization. Cadmium content in all trees of the Sepahanshahr urban park and in alfalfa, lead content in olive trees and lead and cadmium concentrations in Holly hock (Althaea officinalis), Spurge (Euphorbiarigida) and Rhizome (Acanthe phylum bracteatum) are higher than dietaryallowance. Significant correlation between heavy metal concentrations reduction in dust samples and increase of distance from the <b>mine</b> expresses that <b>contaminant</b> heavy metals enter the atmosphere due to mine explosions. In dolomitic sandstone rich in sphalerite mineral, the total amounts of lead and zinc are maximum. The maximum amount of cadmium and too much lead and zinc were observed in a shale fragment, sampled from a location of a fault in the mine. Contents of the three metals were less in black and green shales, compared with the other samples. In dolomitic sandstone rich in gallon mineral, the amounts of the three metals are high and its lead content is maximum with respect to other rocks excluding dolomitic sandstone rich in sphalerite mineral. Significant correlation between ratios of lead isotopes contents of the rocks, soil and dust showed that the soils of the alluvial piedmont plain located at the footslope of the western mountains of the studied area have formed in alluvium parent materials originated from western mountains. The studied heavy metals have been transported together with these alluviums from the mine towards the alluvial piedmont plain. The other origin of these metals is the dust which is produced during the Gushfil mine explosions. This dust is translocated towards the Sepahanshahr and makes the surrounding environment of the mine polluted. Conclusions: Origin of zinc, lead and cadmium in soil, water, plant and dust in the studied area is rocks of Gushfil mine. Transportation of these metals from the mine towards the environment can be explained by two mechanisms: 1) together with runoff water flowing from the western mountains towards the alluvial piedmont plain and 2) in the form of dust which originates from the mine and moves eastwards. The soils are not contaminated with cadmium. With increase of distance from the mine, contamination of lead and zinc decreases in soil and dust {{in such a way that}} in the Sepahanshahr soils, pollution of these metals is not observed. The soils located within a distance of 1 to 2 kilometers from the Gushfil mine are contaminated with lead and zinc. Water is polluted with lead and cadmium and the cadmium content of the plants is higher than dietaryallowance...|$|R

Chemical components can also be treated by linear adsorption and radioactive decay. The first version of the non-isothermal reactive geochemical transport code TOUGHREACT was developed (Xu and Pruess, 1998) by introducing reactive geochemistry into the framework of the existing multi-phase fluid and heat flow code TOUGH 2 (Pruess, 1991). TOUGHREACT was further enhanced with the addition of (1) treatment of mineral-water-gas reactive-transport under boiling conditions, (2) an improved HKF activity model for aqueous species, (3) gas species diffusion coefficients calculated as a function of pressure, temperature, and molecular properties, (4) mineral reactive surface area formulations for fractured and porous media, and (5) porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure changes owing to mineral precipitation/dissolution (Sonnenthal et al., 1998, 2000, 2001; Spycher et al., 2003 a). Subsequently, TOUGH 2 V 2 was released with additional EOS modules and features (Pruess et al., 1999). The present version of TOUGHREACT includes all of the previous extensions to the original version, along with the replacement of the original TOUGH 2 (Pruess, 1991) by TOUGH 2 V 2 (Pruess et al., 1999).
