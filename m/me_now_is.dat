I am trusting my instinct and it is telling <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? I kind of knew. My lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone." [...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career." ...|$|E
500|$|Paramount Pictures {{dropped its}} {{original}} {{protest against the}} film after their director Ivan Reitman, re-titled his film No Strings Attached. Screen Gems then moved forward with the title Friends with Benefits. At the same time, NBC was developing a sitcom with the same title, but the movie production company stated that due to its production schedule, they didn’t expect an issue to arise. Screen Gems chose to accelerate production fearing that they would lose their title to the competing Paramount project. Director Will Gluck spoke about the frustration of comparing the two films, stating: [...] "I wish there was more space between them. The thing that's irking <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> people are saying we're remaking No Strings Attached. We're not remaking it. The two movies were being made at the same time." [...] Gluck, {{in an interview with}} The New Zealand Herald, said that both films are different. Similar sentiments were expressed by Kunis, stating, [...] "It's just two different movies. There's only [...] so many stories you can tell in the world. This {{is just one of the}} many." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E

He later wrote: [...] "After more than forty years, we have had no third world war, and the balance of nuclear terror... may have helped to prevent one. But I am {{not at all sure}} of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race... Each of us has a responsibility to think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism." ...|$|E
