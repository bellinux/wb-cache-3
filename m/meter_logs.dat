40|$|Abstract. Water-rock {{interactions}} {{within the}} seafloor {{are responsible for}} significant energy and solute fluxes between basaltic oceanic crust and the overlying ocean. Permeability is the primary hydrologic property controlling the form, intensity, and duration of seafloor fluid circulation, but after several decades of characterizing shallow oceanic basement, we are still learning how permeability is created and distributed and how it changes as the crust ages. Core-scale measurements of basaltic oceanic crust yield permeabilities that are quite low (generally 10 � 22 to 10 � 17 m 2), while in situ measurements in boreholes suggest an overlapping range of values extending several orders of magnitude higher (10 � 18 to 10 � 13 m 2). Additional indirect estimates include calculations made from borehole temperature and flow <b>meter</b> <b>logs</b> (10 � 16 to 10 � 11 m 2), numerical models of coupled heat and fluid flow at the ridge crest and within ridge flanks (10 � 16 to 10 � 9 m 2), and several othe...|$|E
40|$|The {{yield of}} water wells drilled in {{crystalline}} rock aquifers {{is determined by}} the occurrence and interaction of open, saturated fractures which decrease with increased depth, outside of the influence of large-scale features such as fault zones. These trends suggest that in the shallow subsurface, (i) fluid flow is controlled by specific fracture types, and (ii) there is a bounding depth below which groundwater flow is significantly reduced. These hypotheses are tested in this paper. The analysis of fracture properties identified in boreholes offers an approach to investigate the depth evolution of groundwater systems in crystalline rocks. Optical televiewer, caliper and heat pulse flow <b>meter</b> <b>logs</b> are utilized to investigate the attributes, distributions, orientations, and the contribution to flow of 570 fractures that intersect 26 bedrock wells drilled in crystalline rocks of North Carolina. Results indicate that the dominant fracture types are foliation parallel fractures (FPFs) (42 %), other fractures (32 %) and sheet joints (26 %). The boreholes are drilled into five lithologic terranes and intersect seven major lithologic and rock fabric types, consisting of: (1) felsic gneiss, (2) andesitic to basaltic flows, (3) diorite, (4) mafic gneiss, (5) gneiss and amphibolite, (6) gneiss and mylonite and (7) schist. The dominant fracture type in the upper 40 m is sheet joints. Rocks with sub-horizontal planar fabric prefer to develop FPFs instead of sheet joints. Fractures with the largest apertures are mostly restricted to shallow depths, where sheet joints dominate. However, some sheet joints and FPFs with large apertures are observed at depths greater than 40 m. Flow intervals identified from borehole logs reveal that sheet joints and FPFs are the dominant fracture type where the majority of flow is observed and are therefore likely to control most of the flow in the shallow subsurface. In contrast, FPFs and other fractures are the dominant conduits for channeling flow at greater depths. Fracture and flow analyses indicate that the majority of flow (> 80 %) occurs at depths shallower than 75 m, suggesting the existence of a bounding depth in the shallow subsurface below which permeabilities of fractured crystalline rocks are significantly reduced.   M.

40|$|The Basal Unit of West Woodbourne Field in Barbados is a 250 m thick {{succession}} of finely-interbedded sandstones and mudstones deposited by Paleogene, fine-grained, deep-water systems off the northern South American margin and deformed as sediments were translated to the subduction {{zone of the}} Caribbean and Atlantic plates. Closely spaced gamma ray, neutron, density, spontaneous potential, formation microimager and dip <b>meter</b> <b>logs,</b> limited core, and published reports of local outcrops, were used to define three scales of vertical stratigraphic variation within this 1. 5 km 2 field: (1) decimeters to meters thick log facies; (2) meters to tens of meters thick log successions; and (3) tens to hundred meter thick intervals that are continuous laterally across the field. These variations record changes in sediment supply and depositional energy during progradation and abandonment events varying in scale from local shifts in distributary channels to regional changes in sediment transport along the basin. Well log correlations suggest the Basal Unit comprises a turbidite fan system (250 m thick) trending north to northeast, composed of six, vertically-stacked, distributary channel complexes. Three architectural elements are identified within each distributary channel complex: (1) Major amalgamated channels (30 - 40 m thick, 150 - 200 m wide and at least 900 m long) pass down depositional dip into proximal second-order channels that bifurcate basinward (15 - 20 m thick, symmetric successions); (2) Lobe deposits (20 - 50 m thick, 400 m wide, and at least 400 m long) are composed of upward-coarsening successions that contain distal second-order channels (1 - 10 m thick); and (3) Laterally extensive overbank deposits (5 - 10 m thick), which vertically separate distributary channel-lobe complexes. Reservoir heterogeneities within the Basal Unit are defined by the lateral extent and facies variations across a hierarchy of strata within channel-lobe complexes. Although laterally extensive muddy overbank deposits generally inhibit vertical communication between stacked channel-lobe complexes, in places where high-energy first-order channel sandstones incise underlying muddy overbank deposits, sandstones in subsequent intervals are partially connected. The Basal Unit is bounded on the southwest by a northwest-southeast trending fault that rises 30 degrees towards the northwest to define a structural trap on the northeast side of the field...|$|E

40|$|Re-evaluation of acoustic, {{gamma ray}} and dip <b>meter</b> <b>logs</b> from the Cominco American Federal No. 2 {{well in the}} Sevier Desert basin of west-central Utah sheds {{new light on the}} {{interpretation}} of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian stratigraphy and Mesozoic structure in a region that has been influential in the development of ideas about crustal shortening and extension. The most prominent of several major thrust faults (the Canyon Range and Pavant thrusts) have been interpreted by DeCelles and Coogan (2006) [Regional structure and kinematic history of the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt, central Utah: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 118, n. 7 - 8, p. 841 - 864, [URL] as having been cut and in part re-activated between late Oligocene and Holocene time by as much as 47 km of displacement on the gently west-dipping Sevier Desert detachment. This interpretation, which is based upon a combination of outcrop, seismic reflection and well data, depends critically on the Canyon Range thrust intersecting the Cominco well at a depth of 2, 551 to 2, 557 m (8, 370 - 8, 389 ft.), and terminating downwards against a re-activated Pavant thrust. Our work suggests that the fault at 2, 551 m (8, 370 ft.) is a strand of the Pavant thrust, and that the Canyon Range thrust cuts the well at a depth of 1, 222 m (4, 010 ft.). This alternative interpretation depends in turn on identification of the section between the two faults as terminal Neoproterozoic to middle Cambrian Prospect Mountain Quartzite through Chisholm Formation rather than Neoproterozoic "Pocatello Formation," "Blackrock Canyon Limestone" and lower Caddy Canyon Quartzite. To support this interpretation we present evidence for stratigraphic repetition and for deformation at the 1, 222 m (4, 010 ft.) level. Use of the lithostratigraphic terms "Pocatello" and "Blackrock Canyon" in west-central Utah is shown to be inappropriate, and among the reasons that the critical interval in the Cominco well has been misinterpreted by some authors. If the Canyon Range and Pavant thrusts are both found in the Cominco well, as we suggest, then they cannot be used as a piercing point for the estimation of displacement on the Sevier Desert detachment or as justification for the existence of the detachment. Published estimates of extension across the Sevier Desert basin therefore need to be reduced, potentially to as little as ∼ 10 km...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the within- and between-tree variations in the physical and mechanical properties of Pinus radiata (radiata pine). Forty eight trees from a 25 -year-old plantation on the Canterbury plains near Dunsandel in the South Island of New Zealand were felled and cross-cut to give three 3. 6 <b>meter</b> <b>logs.</b> Each log was identified by tree number and position up the height of the tree (butt, middle and top log). At the sawmill the logs were sawn, first by removing 40 mm thick slices known as flitches from opposite sides of the trunk until a 100 mm thick plank known as a cant was left at the centre. The flitches were re-cut at the breast bench circular saw to yield timbers of nominal dimensions 100 x 40 mm. In re-cutting the 100 mm wide cant gave 3 - 5 boards depending on the diameter of the log. The position of every board was recorded relative to the pith and numbered. A total of 915 boards from the 48 trees (144 logs) were obtained. The boards were filleted (i. e. stacked with uniform and sufficient spacing between each layer both in the vertical and horizontal directions so as to ease air circulation) and air-dried to approximately 12 % moisture content. After drying the boards were dressed to 90 x 35 mm and grouped into. one of the four Australian structural grades (F 4, F 5, F 8 and F 11) as each board passed through a stress grading machine. The modulus of elasticity of the boards was measured both in flatwise bending and axial tension. The strength of the boards was determined by destructive testing in tension and compression parallel to the grain. After failure in tension short clear planks (i. e. planks with no knots and any other natural defects) were cut from each board. From these short planks small clear specimens were prepared for the determination of stiffness, bending strength and compression strength parallel to the grain. The investigation of density, stiffness and strength in relation to the vertical and radial positions within a tree revealed that there is a significant variation in all properties with changes in radial positions across the diameter, and a significant variation in strength properties, but not stiffness with change in vertical position up the height of the tree. Regarding between-tree variation, all properties changed significantly. With reference to the production of structural framing timber, stiffness and density were compared as criteria for sorting trees and identifying superior material within logs. This analysis revealed that stiffness is a better criterion for selecting superior trees within the natural population of a forest stand, to improve the value of mill production and to achieve a better outturn in higher value grades (F 5 and above). A regression analysis between the properties of the in-grade timber and clearwood showed that there is a very strong relationship between the modulus of elasticity of clearwood and that of the in-grade timber. As expected there was a general decrease in strength and stiffness of the graded timber as the grade value decreased from F 11 to F 4. Strength and stiffness values in tension, bending and compression have been compared with the current New Zealand, Australian and European code design values, generally giving good recovery of higher value grades (F 5 and above), especially for strength...|$|E

We hypothesised that rein tension patterns in walk and trot reflect general gait kinematics, but are also determined by individual horse and rider effects. Six professional riders rode three familiar horses in walk and trot. Horses were equipped with rein tension <b>meters</b> <b>logged</b> by inertial measurement unit technique. Left and right rein tension data were synchronized with the gait. RESULTS: Stride split data (0 - 100 %) were analysed using mixed models technique to elucidate the left/right rein and stride percentage interaction, {{in relation to the}} exercises performed. In walk, rein tension was highest at hindlimb stance. Rein tension was highest in the suspension phase at trot, and lowest during the stance phase. In rising trot {{there was a significant difference}} between the two midstance phases, but not in sitting trot. When turning in trot there was a significant statistical association with the gait pattern with the tension being highest in the inside rein when the horse was on the outer fore-inner hindlimb diagonal.

The aim {{of this study was to}} illustrate and analyse the rein tension patterns in a number of rider/horse combinations across a variety of exercises in the canter gait. Our hypothesis was that some riders will follow the movement of the horse more closely than others. Data were collected from eight professional riders riding each three (in one case two) horses that were familiar to them in canter. Horses were instrumented with rein tension <b>meters</b> <b>logged</b> by inertial measurement unit technique (IMU).

Stride-split data (0 - 100 percentages) were analysed using mixed models technique to elucidate the inside/outside and tride percentage interaction, taking into account the exercises performed. In general, tension was maximal just before the beginning of vertical stance, as defined by the maximal acceleration of the head, with the release closer to the suspension phase. The release was significantly more marked on the outside rein, but between riders and horses the pattern varied substantially. In total 26 % of the variation was represented by riders and 21 % by the horses.

The instrument {{was used in}} two bedrock wells to evaluate its ability to identify fractures that contribute to ground water flow. The wells are bored through approximately 280 feet of crystalline metamorphic bedrock to a total depth of approximately 310 feet. Prior to deploying the MP Troll 9000, the wells were logged using both conventional and advanced boreholegeophysical methods. These methods included caliper logging, gamma logging, fluid-resistivity logging, fluidtemperature logging, and both optical- and acoustic-televiewer logging. The wells were also logged under ambient and pumping conditions (< 1 gpm) using a heat-pulse flow meter to locate fractures that contribute to flow and estimate associated discharge rates and the direction of vertical flow in the open borehole. The logs were used to corroborate {{the results of the}} vertical water quality profiles obtained using the MP Troll 9000. Water quality profiles within the wells were recorded under both ambient conditions and at pumping rates of 0. 25 - 0. 8 gpm.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 To {{compete with}} other {{building}} materials, the wood products industry {{must find a way}} to increase value and lower costs. Wood stiffness is important for most wood uses. Value can be increased and costs can be lowered by sorting logs for stiffness in the woods using acoustic devices mounted on harvesters and processors in order to properly allocate logs to their processing destination. This decreases shipping costs because logs do not have to be reshipped if they are delivered directly to their final processing location and increases value recovery because only logs that are fit for the end use are processed. The goal of this study was to determine if four increasingly more difficult-to measure variables - length from the butt, acoustic velocity, bark percentage, and wood density - can be used to predict the acoustic velocity variation along the length of a tree in Douglas-fir and thus improve the utility of acoustic devices as tools for the optimal bucking of trees into logs which have been sorted according to stiffness. Research was undertaken in five stands. Six trees were selected from each stand. Time of flight (TOF) acoustic velocity measured across the bole of the tree had little value in predicting the longitudinal resonance acoustic velocity of a section of the tree. Although TOF across the bole was statistically significant it had a very low correlation coefficient and lacked the ability to accurately and precisely predict resonance acoustic velocity. Wood density, moisture content, and bark percentage were not significant predictors of resonance acoustic velocity of a section of a tree. The use of tree length resonance acoustic velocities was found to be a statistically significant and strongly correlated predictor of acoustic velocity of tree section. Distance of a log section from the butt of the tree and distance of a section from the butt squared were statistically significant and strongly correlated predictors of acoustic velocity of tree sections. Final models including resonance acoustic velocity measurements, distance from the butt, and distance from the butt squared were developed with high coefficients of determination (R² 0. 849 using all tree length acoustic velocities (velocities taken every 3 meters up the tree that measured acoustic velocity of the entire tree after the previous 3 meter section), R² 0. 827 using initial tree length acoustic velocity (acoustic velocity of the entire tree), and R² 0. 678 using initial 3 <b>meter</b> <b>log</b> acoustic velocity). The models developed were found to be stand dependent, indicating a possible need for model calibration for each stand to be harvested. Lower acoustic velocity in the butt of a tree due to high microfibril angle inhibits the predictive capability of models based on acoustic velocity measurements taken from the butt of the tree to predict acoustic velocity of 3 meter sections after the first 6 meters of the tree. Acoustic velocity models based on a 3 <b>meter</b> <b>log</b> acoustic velocity or tree length acoustic measured after the first 6 meters of the tree have been removed are the best predictors of the acoustic velocity of 3 meter sections after the first 6 meters of the tree. Final models based on measurements taken after the first 6 meters of the tree included resonance acoustic velocity measurements and distance from the butt had high coefficients of determination (R² 0. 860 using third tree length acoustic velocity and R² 0. 887 using third 3 meter section acoustic velocities). These models were also found to be stand dependent. The use of either a single tree length acoustic velocity measurement or a single log acoustic velocity measurement with distance from the butt and/or distance from the butt squared has the potential to increase value recovery from a log by predicting the stiffness in that log and effectively matching it to its end use...|$|R

The physical and mechanical properties of wood-wool boards made from seven wood species (meranti merah I, pinus I, mahoni Uganda, meranti tembaga, leda, akasia and meranti merah II) catalyzed with CaCl 2 solution are in conformity with the DIN 1101 Standard. However, only four wood species (meranti merah I, meranti tembaga, leda and meranti merah II) catalyzed with Ca(OH) 2 suspention meet the standard requirement...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE Portable lung {{function}} <b>logging</b> <b>meters</b> that allow measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and {{forced expiratory volume}} in 1 second (FEV(1)) are useful for the diagnosis and exclusion of asthma. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the within and between-session variability of PEF and FEV(1) for four <b>logging</b> <b>meters</b> and to determine the sensitivity of meters to detect FEV(1) and PEF diurnal changes. METHODS Thirteen assessors (all hospital staff members) were asked to record 1 week of 2 -hour PEF and FEV(1) measurements using four portable {{lung function}} meters. Within-session variability of PEF and FEV(1) were compared for each meter using a coefficient of variation (COV). Between-session variability was quantified using parameter estimates from a cosinor analysis which modeled diurnal change for both lung function measures and also allowed for variation between days for individual sessions. RESULTS The mean within-session COV for FEV(1) was consistently lower than that for PEF (p < 0. 001). PEF showed a higher but not significantly different (p = 0. 068) sensitivity for detecting diurnal variation than FEV(1). PEF was also slightly more variable between days, but not significantly different than FEV(1) (p = 0. 409). PEF and FEV(1) diurnal variability did not differ between the 4 meters (p = 0. 154 and 0. 882 respectively), but within-session FEV(1) COV differed between meters (p = 0. 009). CONCLUSION PEF was marginally more sensitive to within-day variability than FEV(1) but was less repeatable. Overall, differences between the 4 meters were small, suggesting that all meters are clinically useful...|$|R
40|$|We present two {{different}} methods for measuring waves {{from the information}} provided by the speed <b>log</b> <b>meter</b> onboard. The first method processes data in the time domain, and is based in the measurement of the standard deviation of the voltage signal period at the transducer output. The second method is based in the measurement of the - 3 dB bandwidth of the frequency peaks in the spectral domain. Our results show a Lorentzian widening of the spectrum due to the effect of waves similar to the effect of jitter in electrical oscillators. As a predictable phenomenon, this work can lead to the design of new low-cost wave measurement systems and enhanced autopilot systems. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} the facies of the Calcare Massiccio formation, and to define its depositional environment, at Cava Gola della Rossa, Northern Apennines. First of all, carbonate facies were observed in the field, {{and a series of}} Calcare Massiccio about 10, 40 <b>meters</b> long was <b>logged.</b> Then, 17 thin sections were prepared for microfacies analysis. Six different facies were identified in the field: Gastropod Mudstones, Pisoids and Fenestral Packstones, Oncoidal lenses Packstones, Peloids Grainstones, Pisoids Rudstones, Fenestral Mudstones. There is a ciclical repetition of facies, the association of which makes up for a peritidal depositional cycle. The wall of Cava Gola della Rossa is thus made of a superposition of carbonate periti dal cycles...|$|R
