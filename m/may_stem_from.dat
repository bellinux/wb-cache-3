5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, plagioclase and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that, because exposure to stressful conditions {{can alter the}} function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the development of fibromyalgia <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> stress-induced disruption of the HPA axis.|$|E

5000|$|Private defence always <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> and {{is always}} {{directed}} at an unlawful human attack; necessity, {{on the other}} hand, <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> either <b>from</b> an unlawful human attack or from chance circumstances, such {{as an act of}} nature.|$|R
5000|$|The Santacruzan (from the Spanish santa cruz, [...] "holy cross") is {{the ritual}} pageant {{held on the}} last day of the Flores de Mayo. It honors the finding of the True Cross by Helena of Constantinople (known as Reyna Elena) and Constantine the Great. Its {{connection}} with <b>May</b> <b>stems</b> <b>from</b> the old <b>May</b> 3 date of Roodmas, which Pope John XXIII abolished in 1960 in favour of the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on September 14.|$|R
25|$|Facial nerve {{disorders}} <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{a myriad}} of contributing factors: Bell’s palsy, injury resulting from surgical error, trauma to the temporal bone, otitis media, multiple sclerosis, mumps, chicken pox, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Motives for criticizing Israel in the UN <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{legitimate}} concerns over policy or from illegitimate prejudices. (...) However, {{regardless of the}} intent, disproportionate criticism of Israel as barbaric and unprincipled, and corresponding discriminatory measures adopted in the UN against Israel, {{have the effect of}} causing audiences to associate negative attributes with Jews in general, thus fueling anti-Semitism.|$|E
25|$|Besides the Turkic tribes {{mentioned}} above, {{there is}} indication that modern Tuvans are descended also from Mongolic, Samoyedic, and Kettic groups of peoples. Of the extinct Southern Samoyed groups, Mator, Koibal, Kamas, and Karagas were assimilated mostly into the eastern Tuvans {{such as the}} Todzhins, Tofalars, Soyots, and Dukha. The Irgit tribe is also suggested as being from Samoyedic ancestors. The Tuvan name for the Yenisei river <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> an ancient Samoyedic name. Tribes such as Tumat, Mingat, Mongush, and Salchak are recognized as having a Mongolic origin.|$|E
5000|$|A person {{quoted in}} Translating LA stated that Iranians in Los Angeles had [...] "a {{wish to be}} invisible, which <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> the anti-Iranian feeling during the U.S. hostage episode." ...|$|R
50|$|Andrzej Sariusz-Skąpski (20 November 1937 - 10 April 2010) was a Polish activist. He was President of the Federation of Katyn Families, an {{interest}} that <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> his father's death there.|$|R
50|$|Occasional {{criticism}} is also found. In Israel, anti-British sentiment <b>may</b> historically <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> British rule and {{policies in the}} mandate era, and in modern times from the perceived anti-Israel stance of the British media.|$|R
25|$|Local {{anesthetic}} toxicity {{is indicated}} by numbness and tingling around the mouth, metallic taste, or ringing in the ears. Additionally, this may lead to seizures, arrhythmias, and may progress to cardiac arrest. This reaction <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> an allergy, excessive dose, or intravascular injection. Other complications include nerve injury which has an extremely low rate of 0.029-0.2%. Some research even suggests that ultrasound lowers the risk to 0.0037%. The use of ultrasound and nerve stimulation has greatly improved practitioners’ ability to safely administer nerve blocks. Nerve injury most often occurs from ischaemia, compression, direct neurotoxicity, or needle laceration, and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|In these interviews, Morton {{claimed to}} have been born in 1885. He was aware that if he had been born in 1890, he would have been {{slightly}} too young to make a good case for being the inventor of jazz. He {{said in an interview that}} Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz, a view not accepted by Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries. The contradictions <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> different definitions of the terms ragtime and jazz. These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD boxed set in 2005, The Complete Library of Congress Recordings. The collection won two Grammy Awards. The same year, Morton was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|E
25|$|Some anglophone sources wrongly list a race {{called the}} Pau Grand Prix in 1901. This <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a {{mistranslation}} {{of the contemporary}} French sources such as the magazine La France Auto of March 1901. The name of the 1901 event was the Circuit du Sud-Ouest and it was run in three classes around the streets of Pau. The Grand Prix du Palais d'Hiver {{was the name of}} the prizes awarded for the lesser classes ('Light cars' and 'Voiturettes'). The Grand Prix de Pau {{was the name of the}} prize awarded for the 'Heavy' (fastest) class. Thus Maurice Farman was awarded the 'Grand Prix de Pau' for his overall victory in the Circuit du Sud-Ouest driving a Panhard 24 hp.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{that the concept of}} ikemen and older, masculine men <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a stylized transformation of the wakashu aesthetic of a beautifulboy-like nobleman during the Edo period in kabuki plays.|$|R

25|$|Filch is {{revealed}} to be a Squib in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when Harry accidentally discovers that {{he is trying to}} teach himself basic magic from a Kwikspell correspondence course. Nonetheless, Filch is at least able to use wizarding devices that have their own innate magic, such as the Secrecy Sensor used in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It is hinted that his dislike of students <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> his disappointment and jealousy at not being able to do magic. In the Half Blood Prince, Harry and Hermione jokingly suspect that he is in a relationship with Irma Pince, the librarian at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book, when the school starts preparing itself for the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch is seen yelling that students are out of bed. He is later seen overseeing the evacuation of younger students.|$|E
25|$|In general, sexual {{dimorphism}} can {{be attributed}} to greater intraspecific competition in one sex, either between rivals for access to mates and/or to be chosen by mates. This <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the other gender being constrained by providing greater parental investment, in terms of factors such as gamete production, gestation, lactation, or upbringing of young. Although there is much variation in species, generally the more physically aggressive sex is the male, particularly in mammals. In species where parental care by both sexes is required, there tends to be less of a difference. When the female can leave the male to care for the offspring, then females may be the larger and more physically aggressive. Competitiveness despite parental investment has also been observed in some species. A related factor is the rate at which males and females are able to mate again after producing offspring, and the basic principles of sexual selection are also influenced by ecological factors affecting the ways or extent to which one sex can compete for the other. The role of such factors in human evolution is controversial.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins and}} the {{earliest}} {{appearance of the}} name [...] "Dunstanburgh" [...] are uncertain. Versions of the name, [...] "Dunstanesburghe" [...] and [...] "Donstanburgh" [...] were in use {{by the time of}} the castle's construction, however, and Dunstanburgh <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a combination of the name of the local village of Dunstan, and the Old English word [...] "burh", meaning fortress.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{waterfall}} and the river the forms it <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> the Chinook Jargon word [...] "Scoquel", the name given to lamprey eels common in the river and estuaries of the area.|$|R
5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a personal belief {{that his wife}} Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name of the}} {{waterfall}} and the hotel with the same name that once sat on the lot prior to the Columbia Gorge Hotel <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a Native American word that means [...] "rushing waters".|$|R
500|$|The {{earliest}} Sanskrit text {{to mention}} Kerala is the Aitareya Aranyaka of the Rigveda. [...] Kerala is also {{mentioned in the}} Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the two Hindu epics. The Skanda Purana mentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal who {{is referred to as}} Manikkam Keralar, synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam temple. Keralam <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the Classical Tamil cherive-alam ("declivity of a hill or a mountain slope") or chera alam ("Land of the Cheras"). The Greco-Roman trade map Periplus Maris Erythraei refers to Keralaputra as Celobotra.|$|E
500|$|In Celtic mythology, the red fox is a {{symbolic}} animal. In the Cotswolds, witches {{were thought to}} take the shape of foxes to steal butter from their neighbours. In later European folklore, the figure of Reynard the Fox symbolises trickery and deceit. He originally appeared (then {{under the name of}} [...] "Reinardus") as a secondary character in the 1150 poem [...] "Ysengrimus". He reappeared in 1175 in Pierre Saint Cloud's Le Roman de Renart, and made his debut in England in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Nun's Priest's Tale. Many of Reynard's adventures <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> actual observations on fox behaviour; he is an enemy of the wolf and has a fondness for blackberries and grapes.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Pollard termed {{some of the}} pre-1623 {{versions}} as [...] "bad quartos" [...] {{because of}} their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory. Where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other. The differences <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from Shakespeare's own papers. In some cases, for example, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello, Shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions. In the case of King Lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is {{so different from the}} 1608 quarto that the Oxford Shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.|$|E
50|$|Jones' {{dispute with}} Tru-Life <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a dispute between Cam'ron and Jay Z, as Tru-Life was signed to Jay Z's Roc-La-Familia label at the time. Jim Jones has also criticized Jay Z's {{performance}} {{as president of}} Def Jam Recordings.|$|R
50|$|It is {{speculated that}} he may have been of aristocratic origin, as he was sent to Caen to be educated, which would have been {{virtually}} impossible for most. His detailed writing on maritime matters <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> his island upbringing.|$|R
5000|$|Biddulph's name {{may come}} from Anglo-Saxon/Old English bī dylfe = [...] "beside the pit or quarry". It <b>may</b> also <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a {{corruption}} of the Saxon/Old English Bidulfe, meaning [...] "wolf slayer", {{and as a result}} the Biddulph family crest is a wolf rampant.|$|R
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the characters of Jacob Tyler and Richard Allen Hance {{seems to have been}} based on that of Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris, two convicts whose time in prison together formed the basis of a partnership that saw them torture and kill several young women in 1979. Tyler's delusional visions of his victims consenting to be murdered <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> West German serial killer Waldemar Szczepinski, who chose his victims based on their response to him ringing their doorbells—those who answered he deemed to have given their permission to be killed and their houses burgled; those who did not were simply left alone. The character also draws inspiration from American serial killer Herbert Mullin, who likewise felt that his victims had offered him permission to kill them. Mullin claimed that their last words were often [...] "I understand".|$|E
500|$|Although many attend regular {{education}} classes, some children with AS may utilize {{special education services}} because of their social and behavioral difficulties. Adolescents with AS may exhibit ongoing difficulty with self care or organization, and disturbances in social and romantic relationships. Despite high cognitive potential, most young adults with AS remain at home, yet some do marry and work independently. The [...] "different-ness" [...] adolescents experience can be traumatic. Anxiety <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals, from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations, or from concern with failing in social encounters; the resulting stress may manifest as inattention, withdrawal, reliance on obsessions, hyperactivity, or aggressive or oppositional behavior. Depression is often the result of chronic frustration from repeated failure to engage others socially, and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop. Clinical experience suggests the rate of suicide may be higher among those with AS, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by systematic empirical studies.|$|E
500|$|Campbell of Islay {{speculates that}} the boobrie may have {{originated}} from sightings {{of the great}} auk. He noted {{he had been told}} stories of the creature by various people, and regarded it as having [...] "a real existence in the popular mind". He considered the tale of the boobrie in its water horse manifestation resembled the Norse myth of [...] "the ploughing of the Asa". Referring to Forbes' 1905 dictionary of [...] "Gaelic names of beasts" [...] in which bubaire is defined as a common bittern, and a detailed description given by scholar James Logie Robertson of the bull o' the bog (an alternative name for a bittern) in The Scotsman in 1908, Henderson hypothesises that the boobrie <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the bittern. Referring to the bittern's [...] "strangely weird sound" [...] and highlighting its [...] "weird hollow cry" [...] during the night and throughout the evening, he describes it as resembling quietly bellowing cattle, particularly during the bird's breeding season. Records indicate that the bird was rare in Scotland but had been sighted {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century, although catching sight of a bittern was believed to be a harbinger of death or disaster.|$|E
5000|$|Petronilla is {{traditionally}} {{identified as the}} daughter of Saint Peter, though this <b>may</b> <b>stem</b> simply <b>from</b> the similarity of names. It is believed she may have been a convert of the saint (and thus a [...] "spiritual daughter"), or a follower or servant. [...] It is said that Saint Peter cured her of palsy.|$|R
30|$|Pruritus {{occurred}} {{as a side}} effect of medication and erythema affected her scalp. The patient distrusted medications, had general fatigue and voiced repeated dissatisfaction and complaints about the assistance of her family. She gradually began to talk about death from the fifth month, which <b>may</b> have <b>stemmed</b> <b>from</b> a belief of Buddhism.|$|R
50|$|Folate {{deficiency}} {{most commonly}} arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet, but <b>may</b> also <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate, usually {{a result of}} genetic variation.The relationship between folate and B12 is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in megaloblastic anemia, characterized by organic mental change.|$|R
