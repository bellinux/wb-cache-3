5|$|Hyde Park Township is {{a former}} civil {{township}} in Cook County, Illinois, United States that existed as a separate municipality from 1861 until 1889 when it was annexed into the city of Chicago. Its borders are Pershing Road (formerly 39th Street) on the north, State Street on the west, Lake Michigan and the Indiana state line on the east, and 138th Street and the Calumet River on the south.

5|$|NY12D was {{originally}} assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now NY12 between Boonville and Lowville. The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped , placing NY12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners (in the Town of West Turin) and on NY26 between Potters Corners and Lowville. The overlap between NY12D and NY26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY12D was realigned onto its current routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls, replacing then-New York State Route337.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundation}} of accountable Pony Express history {{rests in the}} few tangible areas where records, papers, letters and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence.

Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

The NY10 designation remained in place from Tupper Lake east to Upper Saranac Lake, forming an overlap with NY3; however, it was completely replaced by NY3 from Saranac Lake east. Between Upper Saranac Lake and Saranac Lake, the routing of NY3 was previously unnumbered, as was the routing from Watertown to Tupper Lake.|$|E
5|$|A poor {{supply of}} fresh water and {{dwellings}} without adequate drainage led to a cholera outbreak in the town in 1832. The Ashton Poor Law Union was established in 1837 and covered <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now Tameside. A new workhouse was built in 1850 which provided housing for 500 people. It later became part of Tameside General Hospital. Construction on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA) began in 1837 to provide passenger transport between Manchester and Sheffield. Although a nine-arch viaduct in Ashton collapsed in April 1845, the line was fully opened on 22 December 1845. The SA was amalgamated with the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, the Great Grimsby & Sheffield Railway, and the Grimsby Docks Company in 1847 to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS). In 1890, the MS bought the Old Hall and demolished it {{to make way for}} the construction of new sidings.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1st and 2nd century {{geographer}} Ptolemy, Deva was in {{the lands}} of the Cornovii. Their land bordered that of the Brigantes {{in the north and}} the Ordovices in the west and included parts of what is now Cheshire, Shropshire, and north Wales. When the Romans' treaty with the Brigantes– who occupied <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now Northern England– failed the Romans embarked on military conquest of the area. The campaigns were initially led by Sextus Julius Frontinus and later Gnaeus Julius Agricola. Their expansion into the north of Britannia during the reign of Vespasian meant that the Romans needed a new military base. Chester was a strategic site for a fortress, commanding access to the sea via the River Dee and dividing the Brigantes from the Ordovices. Legio II Adiutrix was sent to Chester and began the construction of a legionary fortress in the mid AD70s.|$|E

5000|$|The time {{preceding}} World War I was a {{very important}} time for Östersund {{due to the fact that}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> characterized Östersund as a city was established then.

[...] "If it had come to moving Åreskutan rock by rock we'd have deemed it possible" [...] an older Good Templar later said. When the population constantly grew new constructions were made.

5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{targeted}} {{as a key}} area for population development since the 1960s. In 1959, the London County Council negotiated 5000 new homes {{to be built in}} Ashford as overspill from London, which created <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now South Ashford and Kennington. The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town for growth. In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England. Subsequently, the Ashford's Future Company was set up to support a mix of publicly and privately funded projects in the town.|$|E
5|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{most of the}} land was used for growing crops and raising {{livestock}} such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale's residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E

5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E
5|$|In the Pleistocene era Mingulay {{was covered}} by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides. After the last retreat of the ice around 20,000 years ago, sea levels were lower than at present and circa 14,000 BP it was joined to a single large island {{comprising}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is now the Outer Hebrides. Steadily rising sea levels since that time then isolated the island, which {{is made up of}} Hebridean gneiss interspersed with some granite. The ice deposited both erratic blocks of rock and boulder clay on {{the eastern side of the}} island around Mingulay Bay. The rest of the island is covered in peat, thin acidic soils, or bare rock.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is known}} about Blois' episcopate comes from his acta, or records; 86 of them survive.

Nor has any such document survived. Blois' acta show him to have been an active and diligent administrator, especially concerned with the establishment of vicarages and with parish care. He also spent time mediating disputes, including one in 1204 over a church at Eynesbury that was disputed between Saer de Quincy, the canons of Newnham Priory and monks of St Neot's Priory. Most of his clerks and household members appear to have been non-relatives, with only another William de Blois, appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham by the bishop before becoming Bishop of Worcester in 1218, being a relative.|$|E
