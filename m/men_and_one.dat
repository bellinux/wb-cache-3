5|$|Edward Christian, {{brother of}} Fletcher Christian, had been {{appointed}} Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely in 1800 by the Bishop of Ely. As the Chief Justice, Christian was entitled to try the rioters alone. The government, in this case via the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, nevertheless appointed a Special Commission, consisting of Justice Abbott and Justice Burrough. The rioters were tried in the assizes at Ely during the week commencing June 1816. 23 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>one</b> woman were condemned, of which five were subsequently hanged. General unrest and riots such as that at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824 and subsequently the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829.|$|E
