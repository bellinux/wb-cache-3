50|$|The <b>Main</b> <b>Directory</b> of National Nature Parks and Nature Preservation, which {{supervised}} the protected areas of Ukraine, {{was created in}} 1995. In 2001 the Directory was reorganized into the State Service for Nature Preservation. Of all {{the different kinds of}} protected natural areas, the most important are considered to be nature preserves (zapovedniks), national nature parks, and nature reserves (zakazniks). The total area of the protected areas of Ukraine consists of 3268000 ha, or around 5.4% of the total area of the country. The largest categories of protected areas are regional nature reserves, which account for over a third of the Nature Preservation Fund, and national nature parks, which represent about a quarter. The smallest are botanic gardens and zoos. In 2010, the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, through the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, submitted a proposition for parliamentary review, which outlined a plan {{for the development of the}} national ecological program of nature preservation through the year 2020. This proposal would increase the protected natural areas of Ukraine twofold.|$|E

50|$|In December 1935, the {{original}} case surrounding Zinoviev began to widen {{into what was}} called the Trotsky-Zinoviev Center. Stalin allegedly received reports that correspondences from Trotsky were found among the possessions of one of those arrested in the widened probe. Consequently, Stalin stressed the importance of the investigation and ordered Nikolai Yezhov to take over the case and ascertain if Trotsky was involved. The central office of NKVD that was headed by Genrikh Yagoda was shocked when it was known that Yezhov (at that time a mere party functionary) has discovered the conspiracy, {{due to the fact that}} they (NKVD) had no relations to the case. This would have led to inevitable conclusion about unprofessionalism of the NKVD leaders who completely missed the existence of the conspiratorial Trotskyist center. In June 1936, Yagoda reiterated his belief to Stalin that there was no link between Trotsky and Zinoviev, but Stalin promptly rebuked him. Bewilderment was strengthened by the fact that both Zinoviev and Kamenev for a long time were under constant operational surveillance and after the murder of Kirov were held in custody.

(1) : Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO) (2) : Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University (3) : Music and Audio Research Lab, New York University [URL] Description [...] - The BirdVox- 70 k dataset {{contains}} 6 audio recordings, {{each about}} ten hours in duration. These recordings come from ROBIN autonomous recording units, placed near Ithaca, NY, USA {{during the fall}} 2015. They were captured {{on the night of}} September 23 rd, 2015, by six different sensors, originally numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Andrew Farnsworth used the Raven software to pinpoint every avian flight call in time and frequency. He found 35402 flight calls in total. He estimates that about 25 different species of passerines (thrushes, warblers, and sparrows) are present in this recording. Species are not labeled in BirdVox- 70 k, but it is possible to tell apart thrushes from warblers and sparrrows by looking at the center frequencies of their calls. The annotation process took 102 hours. The dataset can be used, among other things, for the research, development and testing of bioacoustic classification models, including the reproduction of the results reported in [1]. For details on the hardware of ROBIN recording units, we refer the reader to [2]. [1] V. Lostanlen, J. Salamon, A. Farnsworth, S. Kelling, J. Bello.

Towards the Automatic Classification of Avian Flight Calls for Bioacoustic Monitoring. PLoS One, 2016. Data Files [...] The BirdVox- 70 k_full-night-audio folder contains the recordings as FLAC files, sampled at 24 kHz, with a single channel (mono). Metadata Files [...] The BirdVox- 70 k_annotations folder contains CSV files, where each row correspond to a different location in the time frequency domain (columns "Center Time (s) " and "Center Freq (Hz) "). /! CAUTION: in addition to the 35402 flight calls, Andrew Farnsworth pinpointed 29 artificial beeps produced by the recording device itself. These beeps are labeled as "alarm" instead of "flight call". For collecting positive samples for avian flight call detection, make sure you filter out the rows corresponding to alarms. The approximate GPS coordinates of the sensors (latitudes and longitudes rounded to 2 decimal points) and UTC timestamps corresponding {{to the start of the}} recording for each sensor are included as CSV files in the <b>main</b> <b>directory.</b> Please Acknowledge BirdVox- 70 k in Academic Research [...] When BirdVox- 70 k is used for academic research, we would highly appreciate it if scientific publications of works partly based on this dataset cite the following publication: V.
