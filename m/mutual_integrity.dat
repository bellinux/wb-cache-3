40|$|Their poverty {{condition}} and inadequacy of government assistance {{at all levels}} (from federal to state to local) in Igbo communities of South-eastern Nigeria propels the locals to explore the self-help pathway in cooperative association as an alternative means for addressing their collective and individual needs. Over the years, the cooperative ideal has become a sustainable model {{of support for the}} Igbos of this region particularly in the rural village communities. However, the advancement of this form of livelihood in the area is fraught with many difficulties ranging from members’ distrust of government development policies, ‘nominal’ (defunct and struggling) cooperative formation, poor membership education/illiteracy, group leadership problems, youth urban migration, group patron clientism, urban-rural encroachment and group gender disparity issues. Social capital is arguably the dominant concept for examining cohesion and cooperative acts among people (Bourdieu, 1997 and Putnam, 2000). ‘Trust and reciprocity’, as principle attributes of social capital that condition most sustained cooperative interactions among members of the groups, is examined in this thesis. This research also assesses the inter-linking (bridging) bond that exists between the cooperative groups, their communities (including dispersed community members elsewhere in Nigeria and abroad) and the government. For example: Why do the ‘nominal’ cooperatives in the study communities lack this attribute? Does ‘trust’ determine the type of attention that community cooperatives receive from their government? What factor(s) facilitate assistance from the government and other community development groups especially the diaspora? Are there avenues to achieve best practice in these relationships for sustained cordiality? The thesis applies the Igbo cultural understanding of social capital as ugwu in discussing relational bonds within select cooperatives and non-cooperative farmer groups in the study communities using field tools adapted from the World Bank’s Social Capital Implementation Framework (SCIF). Previous studies conducted by some African scholars such as Uchendu (1965), Mbiti (1969), Njaka, (1974), Ekeh, (1975), Iroegbu, (1997), Ohadike, (1994), Korieh (2006), Nwagbara, (2007) were drawn upon in the discussions. The researcher adopted a mixture of qualitative (un-structured interviews) and quantitative methods (questionnaires) in gathering and analysis of data. The research found that members of active smallholder cooperative societies uphold their <b>mutual</b> <b>integrity</b> (ugwu) and membership ties but contrastingly adopt a prebendalist attitude (similar to the ‘nominal’ cooperatives) in interactions with the government. Cooperative societies’ ‘ugwu’ - social capital - bond did not necessarily antecede bridging social capital particularly at interactions with the government. The research recommends that since ‘ugwu’ is central in Igbo cooperative life; the government could work closely with local institutions to formalize and strengthen this and in the process rebuild bridging trust with the locals. The churches and other traditional community institutions are mediators that could help in this process. It is hoped this study will help encourage best practice in smallholder cooperative functions and rural development practice...|$|E

Since the 802. 11 i design does not emphasize availability, several DoS attacks are possible. We review the known DoS attacks on unprotected management frames and EAP frames, and discuss ways of mitigating them in 802. 11 i. The practicality of a DoS attack against Michael MIC Failure countermeasure is discussed and improvements are proposed.

30|$|In general terms, {{reliable}} inputs (or inputs from reliable SUs) must be appropriately filtered {{and accepted}} {{prior to the}} execution of the fusion and decision processes. One of the possible strategies may consist in the utilization of a combination of <b>mutual</b> authentication, data <b>integrity</b> protection, and data encryption in order to restrict data inputs only to those from trustworthy users and consequently prevent illegitimate manipulation of data [16]. The work of Rifà-Pous and Garrigues [30] and also the IEEE 802.22 standard apply in this context. For example, IEEE 802.22 defines the secure control and management protocol (SCMP), a security mechanism derived from IEEE 802.16, providing authentication, authorization, message integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SCMP guarantees that only authorized devices can access the network and that a device generating spurious data can be unauthorized by the base station. Additionally, if a geo-location database and localization techniques are used, it is also possible to compare the estimated position of an authenticated transmitter and its a priori known location. Rifà-Pous and Garrigues [30] propose a centralized solution that enables a fusion center to validate the identity of the SUs and authenticate their sensing reports and is appropriate for large CR networks. This solution uses cryptographic signatures based on simple hash functions and symmetric keys and requires the fusion center and the SUs to hold valid certificates.|$|R

In spite of those benefits from mobile agent system, security in mobile agent system is especially hard to achieve when a mobile agent is executed on remote platform that may behave maliciously or mobile agent may behave maliciously on the remote platform. There has been a lot of work done in the area of mobile agent’s security. Recently, Bae et al. proposed a security scheme for mobile agent system using an IDENTITY- BASED digital signature scheme and claimed that their scheme provided complete security to mobile agent system. However, in this paper, we show that their security scheme still suffers from some security weakness such as man in middle attack and previous agent platform can forge the signature. And then we further propose a new security scheme for secure mobile agent system that solves the weakness of their protocol using dynamic generated partial multi signature with message flexibility and provides the security services such as <b>mutual</b> authentication, confidentiality, <b>integrity,</b> nonrepudiation and the prevention of replay and exclude attack. The propose scheme is suitable and practical for protecting mobile agent from malicious platform in e-commerce scenario over the Internet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—IEEE 802. 11 i {{standard}} {{defines the}} security specifications of IEEE 802. 11 series Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). It is {{the replacement of}} the old security standard named Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), and it aims to eliminate all known attacks against WEP. It certainly provides solutions to the confidentiality, <b>mutual</b> authentication and <b>integrity</b> aspects of the WLAN security but not the availability aspect. Many researchers have shown that IEEE 802. 11 i standard cannot prevent various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks including de-authentication, disassociation and memory/CPU DoS attacks.

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) also includes a number of devices connected to the internet where wearable devices are also included. Both systems enable researchers to develop healthcare systems with additional intelligence as well as prediction capabilities both for lifestyle and in hospitals. It offers as much persistence as a platform to ubiquitous healthcare by using wearable sensors to transfer the information over servers, smartphones, and other smart devices in the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS). Security is a challenging issue in TMIS, and resourceful access to health care services requires user verification and confidentiality. Existing schemes lack in ensuring reliable prescription safety along with authentication. This research presents a Secure Authentication and Prescription Safety (SAPS) protocol to ensure secure communication between the patient, doctor/nurse, and the trusted server. The proposed procedure relies upon the efficient elliptic curve cryptosystem which can generate a symmetric secure key to ensure secure data exchange between patients and physicians after successful authentication of participants individually. A trusted server is involved for mutual authentication between parties and then generates a common key after completing the validation process. Moreover, the scheme is verified by doing formal modeling using Rubin Logic and validated using simulations in NS- 2. 35. We have analyzed the SAPS against security attacks, and then performance analysis is elucidated. Results prove the dominance of SAPS over preliminaries regarding <b>mutual</b> authentication, message <b>integrity,</b> freshness, and session key management and attack prevention...|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} {{sovereign}} state emerged from Europe {{after the end}} of the Thirty Years’ War and the Westphalian Peace in 1648. The key tenets of a post-Westphalian order are territorial <b>integrity,</b> <b>mutual</b> respect of each other’s sovereignty, and the equality among states (Schmidt 2011). States become a unit of analysis in international relations. Yet, the boundaries of states have been breached with the rapid development of capitalism that drove European states to imperialism and ultimately colonialism (Lenin 1916 [1982]). After the Second World War, although colonialism has lost its appeal in shapes and forms, replaced it is a new wave of neo-colonialism based on a system of unequal exchange that leads to the underdeveloped peripheral countries continue to serve the rich core industrialised countries. Early dependency theorists asked why developing countries remained underdeveloped, and exploitation was among their common conclusions (Dos Santos 1971; Frank 1967; Amin 1974). Whilst dependency theory shares the same critical epistemological root as Marxism, it is nonetheless different in that Marxism examines exploitation from the micro-economic process of production, whereas dependency school looks from a macro-economic perspective of the global exchange system. After the Second World War, the global economic order is structured under international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both legacies of the US directed Bretton Woods conference. Far from setting a level playing field for the underdeveloped countries, their policies forced the domestically weak countries to carry out liberal reforms such as privatisations, lowering tariffs, abandoning foreign exchange controls. These countries were forced to play “casino capitalism” under the rules of the West, effectively serving themselves on a plate for the developed countries to consume (Strange 1997). The Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 is a case in point when the central banks of Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines were attacked by Western-led hedge funds.|$|R

Basically, {{there are three}} components in RFID system which consists of reader, back-end server and tags. RFID tags are normally small and can be deployed in many solutions such as goods and luggage tracking, and access control system. The widespread deployment of RFID system across many solutions is a good impact {{to the community and}} it’s simplifies a lot of business transactions. However, massive deployment of RFID system into several solutions may potentially impose security and privacy threats. Since RFID tag and reader communicate through contactless radio frequency channel, messages can easily be captured by any unknown reader. RFID system without any trust and integrity element poses security threat because secret data can easily be revealed to adversary system due to unverified RFID platform. Numerous works done by several researchers have shown that unprotected RFID platform can be compromised either by malicious codes or man in the middle attack. System integrity verification for RFID reader, tag and back-end server have to be implemented to provide system trust for RFID system. The proposed back-end server and RFID reader with the embedded trusted computing technology will provide the system integrity measurements and verifications. This research utilized Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as a tamper proof hardware to protect the integrity of RFID system. The proposed solution provides <b>mutual</b> attestation and <b>integrity</b> verification for trusted RFID protocol by using TPM and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption for encrypting data transfers within trusted RFID system. Our scheme offers the most enhanced security feature in RFID system by using mutual attestation technique with respect to protect user privacy. This solution also highlights the importance of trusted computing technology towards solving the privacy and security issues.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{introduce}} mentoring each organization ought {{to comply with}} several rules. First, mentoring-friendly environment has to be provided. Second, the relation between mentoring and career success must be made clear and last but certainly not least future benefits are to outweigh costs. However the above mentioned circumstances may significantly differ between organizations. In this way different kinds of mentoring outcomes can be achieved. In {{there is very little}} agreement in the literature as to what is and what is not mentoring. A very specific example of mentoring outcome are all-consuming organizations. Such companies are characterized by fairly charismatic leadership, separation from community and demand for a cult. Hence they are often described by a comparison to religious sects. Unfortunately this phenomenon has so far never been described in HRD literature and thus there is no methodology to research it. The papers is a methodological one and attempts to create proper research tool for indicating mentoring in all-consuming organizations. Garvey and Garrett-Harris (2005) define mentoring as a learning and development relationship between two people without and specifying their positions within organization. This criterion has been stressed by e. g. Noe, Greenberger & Wang (2002) and Russell & Adams (1997). They commonly specified that HRD mentoring involves an intense, one-on-one relationship in which an experienced, senior person provides assistance to a less experienced, more junior colleague in order to latter’s professional and personal development. In addition to that mentoring works most efficiently when chemistry and mutuality in the relationship is seen. Mentoring relationships ought to be built upon <b>mutual</b> respect, honesty, <b>integrity,</b> comfort, confidentiality and commitment to the relationship and expectations between the mentor and protégé. Mentoring programs can be found in all kinds of business activities but they may significantly differ. It is strongly related to organizational culture which influences corporate environment – most important factor determining mentoring outcome. What is more organizational culture throughout its values, norms and believes strengthens the message from mentor to mentee (Schein 1985). The clearer the culture the easier to apply mentoring. Thus in all-consuming organizations, due to their characteristics corporate culture is strong as it’s easily perceived by artifacts, values and norms. However question arises whether all-consuming companies introduce mentoring as we know it. This study is significant for several reasons. First it digests the so far knowledge regarding all-consuming organizations and mentoring. Second it designs a research tool for indicating mentoring in all-consuming organizations. The newly projected tool will add a new value to HRD theory and practice. Katarzyna Susabowsk...|$|R
