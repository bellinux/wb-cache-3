5|$|The most {{significant}} survivals in sculpture are in High crosses, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland. They are {{found throughout the}} British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross, apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> at Iona. Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands {{and they can be}} dated to the period c. 750 to 1150. All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of King David is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the Kildalton Cross from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic styles.|$|E

The coral community disturbance <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>began</b> several years ago, and low algal turf growth suggests indirect effects of hurricane Mitch, because the surge suspended sediments.

5|$|Æthelberht (Old English: Æðelbrihte), {{also called}} Saint Ethelbert the King, (died 20 May 794 at Sutton Walls, Herefordshire) was an eighth-century saint and a king of East Anglia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom which today {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Little {{is known of}} his reign, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> in 779, according to later sources, and {{very few of the}} coins issued during his reign have been discovered.

5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{expansion}} to {{the west}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> early in his reign. There is firm evidence of a war waged in the early 620s between Edwin and Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi, king of the Ulaid in Ireland. A lost poem {{is known to have}} existed recounting Fiachnae's campaigns against the Saxons, and the Irish annals report the siege, or the storming, of Bamburgh in Bernicia in 623–624. This should presumably be placed in the context of Edwin's designs on the Isle of Man, a target of Ulaid ambitions. Fiachnae's death in 626, at the hands of his namesake, Fiachnae mac Demmáin of the Dál Fiatach, and the second Fiachnae's death a year later in battle against the Dál Riata probably eased the way for Edwin's conquests in the Irish sea province.|$|E

5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a creole with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night's Dream and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E

40|$|The {{road to the}} {{independence}} referendum <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begin</b> with devolution in the late 1990 s, but a key question is: what have been the impacts on health and clinical research since the process of devolution was initiated? This paper identifies and interrogates the change of narratives, relevant to the health debate under devolution, which frames discussions around potential Scottish independence. Pre-devolution {{there is a strong}} sense of Scotland as having unique health problems and hence, the 'sick man of Europe' label, which required policy responses from the devolved government. Under devolution,, this engendered a second narrative built around the 'living lab' concept. Our key question is how did the 'living lab' concept and the pulling together of a health and wealth agenda emerge from the narrative of Scotland as the 'sick man of Europe'...|$|R
5|$|Mount St. Helens {{remained}} dormant {{from its}} last {{period of activity}} in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels {{in the next two}} days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale.

Since it is apparently an autograph, with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the pericopes at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> the work as early as 1150 (Parkes 1983, pp.115–27).

5|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style home in Ledyard, Connecticut {{that was built}} circa 1696. Evidence {{suggests}} that the house <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>begun</b> as a single-story, one-room house and later expanded to a two-story, two-room house by 1726. The house underwent major additions and renovations by Theophilus Avery and later his grandson, Theophilus Avery.

The Avery Homestead is historically significant as a well-preserved example of an 18th-century farmhouse with fine craftsmanship. The home is also historically important because more than twelve generations of the Avery family have resided there {{over the course of}} three centuries. The Avery Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Occupational segregation, the {{differential}} distribution of groups of workers across occupations, provides {{one of the}} most important mechanisms for creating, maintaining and legitimating social inequality. In this study I examine trends in occupational race segregation from 1980 through 2009 / 2010 and use fixed-effects regression analysis to assess how changes in occupational characteristics such as earnings, benefits and demographic composition are associated with changes in the representation of black men and women. My findings show that after 1980 trends toward racial occupational integration slowed and after 2000 <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>began</b> to reverse. Race and sex continue to be important for understanding the occupational distributions of black and white workers as black workers are disadvantaged relative to white workers and black men are especially disadvantaged...|$|R
