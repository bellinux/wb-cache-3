5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines. Vegetable matter eaten by jackals {{in these areas}} includes fruits, such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood, and the cones of common medlars. The jackal is implicated {{in the destruction of}} grape, watermelon, <b>muskmelon,</b> and nut crops. Near the Vakhsh River, their spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winter they feed on wild stony olives. Around the edges of the Karakum Desert, jackals feed on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish, muskrats, the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry, dried apricots, watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and grapes.|$|E

It is found on fruit, vegetable, and other food crops, including pineapple, sugar-apple, coconut, <b>muskmelon,</b> yam, figs, strawberry, sweet potato, mangoes, bananas, avocado, date palm, common guava, pomegranate, common pear, apple, eggplant, cacao tree, and soybean. It infests ornamental plants, including indoor plants, and it is common in greenhouses.

60|$|To be sure, one of {{the native}} fruits seems a sort of joke when you hear it first named, and when you are offered a 'loquat', if you are of a {{frivolous}} mind you search your mind for the connection with 'loquor' which it seems to intimate. Failing in this, you taste the fruit, and then, {{if it is not}} perfectly ripe, you are as far from loquaciousness as if you had bitten a green persimmon. But if it is ripe, it is delicious, and may be consumed indefinitely. It is the only native fruit which one can wish to eat at all, with an unpractised palate, though it is claimed that with experience a relish may come for the pawpaws. These break out in clusters of the size of oranges {{at the top of a}} thick pole, which may have some leaves or may not, and ripen as they fancy in the indefinite summer. They are of the color and flavor of a very insipid little <b>muskmelon</b> which has grown too near a patch of squashes.|$|E
60|$|After dinner (at {{which we}} cut the first {{watermelon}} and <b>muskmelon</b> that our garden has grown), Mr. Thoreau and I {{walked up the}} bank of the river, and at a certain point he shouted for his boat. Forthwith a young man paddled it across, and Mr. Thoreau and I voyaged farther up the stream, which soon became more beautiful than any picture, with its dark and quiet sheet of water, half shaded, half sunny, between high and wooded banks. The late rains have swollen the stream so much that many trees are standing up to their knees, as it were, in the water, and boughs, which lately swung high in air, now dip and drink deep of the passing wave. As to the poor cardinals which glowed upon the bank a few days since, I could see only a few of their scarlet hats, peeping above the tide. Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it. He said that, when some Indians visited Concord a few years ago, he found that he had acquired, without a teacher, their precise method of propelling and steering a canoe. Nevertheless he was desirous of selling the boat of which he was so fit a pilot, and which was built by his own hands; so I agreed to take it, and accordingly became possessor of the Musketaquid. I wish I could acquire the aquatic skill of the original owner.|$|E
40|$|<b>Muskmelons</b> and cantaloupes are {{climacteric}} fruits that {{lose the}} green {{color of their}} fruit rinds upon ripening. Their yellow or orange appearance is easily recognized by consumers {{as a sign of}} ripeness. However, these melons have a short shelf life, as this loss of chlorophyll is associated with ethylene synthesis. Observations and comparisons of these melons with the non-climacteric, long-keeping, yellow-rinded casaba melons suggest that through genetic recombination {{it should be possible to}} develop cultivars of <b>muskmelons</b> and cantaloupes combining the consumer-driven characteristic of non-green (yellow or orange) mature fruit color with long shelf life.

Near the Vakhsh River, the jackal's spring diet consists almost exclusively of plant bulbs and the roots of wild sugar cane, while during winters it feeds on the fruit stones of wild stony olives. In the edges of the Karakum Desert, the golden jackal feeds on gerbils, lizards, snakes, fish and muskrats. Karakum jackals also eat the fruits of wild stony olives, mulberry and dried apricots, as well as watermelons, <b>muskmelons,</b> tomatoes and grapes. In Hungary, its most frequent prey animals are common voles and bank voles.

There are about 6, 700 acres of Buckner coarse sand in Muscatine County. This soil dries out rapidly, and irrigation by either furrow or overhead rotary sprinkler system is a common practice with commercial growers in this district.
