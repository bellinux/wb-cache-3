500|$|In 1958, Kneale's play Mrs Wickens in the Fall, {{transmitted}} by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the CBS {{network in the}} United States, retitled The Littlest Enemy. Broadcast on 18 June as part of The United States Steel Hour anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length. It was Kneale's only involvement with American television, {{and he was not}} pleased with the result. [...] "I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>I</b> would never ever again have anything done on a television network in America," [...] he later commented.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1949, Nixon, {{although}} {{anxious to}} advance his political career, {{was reluctant to}} run for the Senate unless he was confident of winning the Republican primary. He considered his party's prospects in the House to be bleak, absent a strong Republican trend, and wrote [...] "I seriously doubt if we can ever work our way back in power. Actually, in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>I</b> do not see any great gain in remaining a member of the House, even from a relatively good District, if it means we would be simply a vocal but ineffective minority." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregg Allman's lyrical {{contributions}} to the band's debut album have been called [...] "remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man, expertly executed in a minimalist, almost haiku style." [...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} Hour Glass, [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album." [...] On the writing of the record, Allman wrote in his memoir My Cross to Bear, [...] "I wrote most of that whole first record in that one week. I had total peace of mind. L.A. and all its changes didn’t even cross <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> felt like I was starting all over, which I was." [...] Most of the songs on the album were written at Rose Hill Cemetery.|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>I</b> would have made those saves. And {{the fact of the}} matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Although jams {{had always}} been an {{integral}} aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw songs being created with more structure. One specific jam {{would lead to the}} breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when [...] "...Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad cracked up and played along... I always had fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E

500|$|In the interim, Hoppus and Barker {{continued}} {{playing music}} together in +44. The group {{first began to}} lay down electronic demos in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room shortly after the breakup. +44's debut, When Your Heart Stops Beating, was released the following year but stalled commercially and received mixed reviews. Barker starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers with his then-wife, former Miss USA Shanna Moakler. The couple's later split, reconciliation and subsequent breakup made them tabloid favorites. Meanwhile, DeLonge disappeared from public eye, making no appearances, granting no interviews and remaining silent until September 2005, when he announced his new project, Angels & Airwaves, promising [...] "the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation." [...] He later revealed he was addicted to painkillers at the time, recalling [...] "I was losing <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>I</b> was on thousands of painkillers, and I almost killed myself," [...] and {{did not realize that}} his promise of revolution sounded highly ambitious. The group released two albums in 2006 and 2007: We Don't Need to Whisper and I-Empire. During the hiatus, Hoppus shifted his attention to producing albums (most notably Commit This to Memory by former tour-mate Motion City Soundtrack) and hosting his podcast, HiMyNameisMark, while Barker launched a shoe line and worked on three other musical projects—the Transplants, +44, and TRV$DJAM, a collaboration with friend Adam Goldstein (DJ AM).|$|E
500|$|I Am... (January 2002) marked several {{milestones}} for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased {{her control}} over her music by composing {{all of the}} songs on the album under the pseudonym [...] "Crea", of which the 2000 single [...] "M" [...] was the first. [...] "Connected" [...] (November 2002) and [...] "A Song Is Born" [...] (December 2001) were the exceptions. I Am... also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion" [...] of some of her earlier songs. Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of I Am..., focusing {{on issues such as}} faith and world peace. [...] "A Song Is Born", in particular, was directly influenced by the events. The single, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex's non-profit Song Nation project, which raised money for charity."まず、浜崎あゆみとKEIKOがデュエットした『a song is born』が2001年12月12日にリリースされた。" [...] She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a [...] "peace muse", explaining, I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> knew it wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes. It sounds odd coming from me, but I realize what I say and how I look has a great impact.|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{arrived at}} Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to find no boats {{available}} {{to take him}} on to Manaus. Days of inactivity and boredom followed, with [...] "nothing to read except some lives of the Saints in French and Boussuet's sermons". Waugh passed {{some of the time}} by writing a short story; although not identified in the diaries, this story has been generally accepted as [...] "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Apart from using different names and some minor details this story {{is the same as the}} episode that Waugh later used as the climax to A Handful of Dust: an elderly settler (modelled in manner, speech and appearance on Christie), rescues and holds captive a lost explorer and requires him to read aloud the novels of Dickens, in perpetuity. The story was published in 1933, in America in Hearst's International–Cosmopolitan, and in Britain in Nash's Pall Mall Magazine. In an article written many years later, Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: [...] "The idea [...] came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lonely settler ... and reflecting how easily he could hold me prisoner. Then, after the short story was written and published, the idea kept working in <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to discover how the prisoner got there, and eventually the thing grew into a study of other sorts of savage at home and the civilized man’s helpless plight among them." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>I</b> felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>I</b> would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>I</b> felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
