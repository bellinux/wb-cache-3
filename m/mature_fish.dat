5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than {{one in a million}} of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a <b>mature</b> <b>fish,</b> but there is a much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.|$|E

40|$|In {{the annual}} cyprinodont Cynolebias whitei the cell types {{responsible}} for the increase of pituitary growth {{at the onset of}} maturation and for pituitary hyperplasia in old specimens were identified as gonadotropic cells and thyrotropic cells, respectively. The gonadotropic cells showed a high affinity to anti-carp alpha beta-GTH serum, both at light- and electron-microscopical levels. The allometric relation of total gonadotropic cell volume to body length, determined for fish from six weeks up to six months of age, showed no inflections. Therefore pituitary growth in <b>maturing</b> <b>fish</b> may be partly a result of proliferation of gonadotropes, although gonadotropic cells do not contribute to pituitary hyperplasia in old fish. Thyrotropic cells showed a weak affinity to anti-carp alpha beta-GTH serum at light-microscopical level. Under the electron microscope thyrotropic cells displayed signs of activation in <b>maturing</b> <b>fish</b> and signs of proliferation in old fish. The allometric relation of thyroid gland volume to body length paralleled that of pituitary volume to body length. Histologically the thyroid gland showed signs of inactivity in adult fish and of hyperplasia in old fish. The possibility, that gonadal maturation, pituitary thyrotropic activity, and growth of the thyroid in <b>maturing</b> <b>fish</b> are related through the inhibitory action of gonadal steroids on thyroid hormone release, is discussed. Pituitary hyperplasia in old fish is the result of proliferation of thyrotropic cells. Similar hyperplasia of pituitary and thyroid glands was observed in old Nothobranchius korthausa...|$|R

25|$|Young halibut {{are highly}} migratory and {{generally}} migrate in a clockwise direction {{east and south}} throughout the Gulf of Alaska. Halibut in older age classes {{tend to be less}} migratory, but continue to move predominately on a clockwise direction. <b>Mature</b> <b>fish</b> are also involved in winter spawning migrations towards deeper waters, migrating across several areas in some instances. Research has indicated small, localized spawning populations may occur in deep waters such as in Chatham Straight in northern Southeast Alaska. However, because of the free-floating nature of larvae and subsequent mixing of juvenile halibut from throughout the Gulf of Alaska, only one genetic stock of halibut is known in the northern Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The {{bar jack}} is a benthopelagic predator, taking its prey both in {{midwater}} {{and along the}} seafloor. The diet consists mostly of fish, up to 90% of the fishes intake in some studies, with planktonic crustaceans and small cephalopods taken in minor volumes. There is significant change in diet with age in fish studied off Cuba, which may reduce intraspecific competition in the species. Young fish prefer planktonic organisms, predominantly decapod and fish larvae; fish reaching sexual maturity prey on shrimp and small fish, while <b>mature</b> <b>fish</b> feed almost exclusively on small fish. The fish species preferred by bar jack appear to be mostly small sand dwellers such as blennies and gobies or small reef dwellers including wrasses, butterflyfish and filefish, with the diet of the latter leading to the accumulation of coral derived ciguatera toxin in the jack's flesh. Other lesser taken prey items include gastropods, nematodes and benthic algae {{as well as a}} range of crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|In {{the recent}} past the European market for spiny dogfish has {{increased}} dramatically, {{which led to the}} overfishing and decline of the species.

2500|$|By {{measuring}} {{the thickness of}} individual rings, it has been assumed (at least in some species) to estimate fish growth because fish growth is directly proportional to otolith growth. [...] However, some studies disprove a direct link between body growth and otolith growth. [...] At times of lower or zero body growth the otolith continues to accrete leading some researchers to believe the direct link is to metabolism, not growth per se. Otoliths, unlike scales, do not reabsorb during times of decreased energy making it even more useful tool to age a fish. [...] Fish never stop growing entirely, though growth rate in <b>mature</b> <b>fish</b> is reduced.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{provides}} new data on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar life-history traits across France. Using a long-term recreational angling database (1987 - 2013) covering 34 rivers in three regions (genetic units), {{a decline in}} individual length, mass and a delayed adult return to French rivers was reported. Temporal similarities in trait variations between regions {{may be attributed to}} common change in environmental conditions at sea. The relative rate of change in phenotypic traits was more pronounced in early <b>maturing</b> <b>fish</b> [1 sea-winter (1 SW) fish] than in late <b>maturing</b> <b>fish</b> (2 SW fish). Such contrasted response within populations highlights the need to account for the diversity in life histories when exploring mechanisms of phenotypic change in S. salar. Such detailed life-history data on returning S. salar have not previously been reported from France. This study on French populations also contributes to reducing the gap in knowledge by providing further empirical evidence of a global pattern in S. salar across its distribution range. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that the observed changes in life-history traits are primarily associated with environmental changes in the North Atlantic Ocean. They also emphasize the presence of less important, but still significant contrasts between region and life history. (C) 2017 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles...|$|R

40|$|In some years, the Bering Sea trawl fishery {{incidentally}} harvests (bycatch) {{large numbers}} of chum salmon. Because chum salmon were declining in some western Alaska areas, {{the origins of the}} chum salmon bycatch were important. Tagging studies have shown that chum salmon originating in Asia and North America migrate through the eastern Bering Sea. Genetic stock identification (GSI), a method of estimating stock composition in mixed-stock fisheries, has helped in evaluating stock contributions to salmon fisheries on the western coast of North America. Through cooperative efforts between state and federal agencies, a comprehensive genetic baseline for Pacific Rim chum salmon stocks has been developed, which enables GSI in fisheries such as the Bering Sea trawl fishery. In 1994, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Auke Bay Laboratory, initiated a feasibility study of GSI in determining the origins of the chum salmon bycatch in the Bering Sea trawl fishery. Sampling in 1995 was intensified and resulted in samples covering the entire fishing season, representing nearly 11 % of the total chum salmon bycatch.
