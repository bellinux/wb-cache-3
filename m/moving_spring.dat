40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{the dynamic}} {{responses}} of a Timoshenko beam {{subjected to a}} moving mass, and a <b>moving</b> <b>sprung</b> mass are analyzed. By making recourse to Hamiltonâ€™s principle, governing differential equations for beam vibration are derived. By using the modal superposition method, the partial differential equations of the system are transformed into a set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The resulted set of ODEs is represented in state-space form, and solved {{by means of a}} numerical technique. The accuracy of the results has been ascertained through comparing the results of our approach with those available from previous studies; moreover, a reasonable agreement has been obtained. The quantities of the dynamic response of the beam for the case of <b>moving</b> <b>sprung</b> mass are confronted with moving mass and also moving load cases. Through extensive numerical campaign, it is concluded that with respect to the applied values of suspension system properties, the deflections of the beam subjected to moving load case are an upper bound for <b>moving</b> <b>sprung</b> mass results...|$|R

60|$|There was a {{beautiful}} cloister, a double walk with clustered columns running down the centre and a vaulted roof, and with a fountain {{in the midst of}} the quadrangle. There was a chapel on one side, the buildings of the Priory on the others.

60|$|He, {{like every}} one else, liked, and even loved {{personally}} that perplexing subject, John Lucas Brownlow, alias Jock. The boy was too generous, honourable, truthful, and kindly {{to be exposed}} to the stigma of removal; but he was the perplexity of everybody. He could not be convinced of any necessity for application, and considered a flogging as a slight risk quite worth encountering for the sake of diversion. He would execute the most audacious pranks, and if he was caught, would take it as a trial of skill between the masters and himself, and accept punishment as amends, with the most good humoured grace in the world. Fun seemed to be his only <b>moving</b> <b>spring,</b> and he led everybody along with him, so as to be a much more mischievous person than many a worse lad.|$|E
60|$|Henrietta {{did not do}} much to {{reconcile}} him to the anxious care with which he was guarded. She {{was proud of his}} talents, of his accomplishments, of his handsome features, and she would willingly have been proud of his excellence in manly sports, but in lieu of this she was proud of the spirit which made him long for them, and encouraged it by her full and entire sympathy. The belief that the present restraints must be diminished at Knight Sutton, was a <b>moving</b> <b>spring</b> with her, as much as her own wish for the scenes round which imagination had thrown such a brilliant halo. Of society they had hitherto seen little or nothing; Mrs. Langford's health and spirits had never been equal to visiting, nor was there much to tempt her in the changing inhabitants of a watering-place. Now and then, perhaps, an old acquaintance or distant connexion of some part of the family came for a month or six weeks, and a few calls were exchanged, {{and it was one of}} these visits that led to the following conversation.|$|E
60|$|He {{had had a}} time {{of happy}} labour in Scotland, fully {{carrying}} out the designs with which he and his cousin James Kennedy had taken upon them the ministry. Their own birth, and the appointments their King gave them, so soon as their age permitted, made them able to exert an influence that told upon the rude and unenlightened clergy around. It had been almost a mission of conversion, to awaken a spirit of Christianity in the country, that had so long been a prey to anarchy. The King's declaration, 'I will make the key keep the castle, and the bracken- bush keep the cow, though I live {{the life of a}} dog to bring it about,' had been the <b>moving</b> <b>spring</b> of their lives. James had fought hour by hour with the foul habits of lawlessness, savagery, and violence, that had hitherto been absolutely unchecked; and while he strove with the sword of justice, the two young priests worked within the Word of truth, to implant some sense of conscience in the neglected people.|$|E

6000|$|In all his joy, however, Dr. May {{could not}} cease bewailing the {{alteration}} {{in his old}} friend, and spent half the evening in telling Margaret how different he had once been, in terms little less measured than Ethel's: [...] "I never saw such a change. Mat Fleet {{was one of the}} most warm, open-hearted fellows in the world, up to anything. I can hardly believe he is the same--turned into a mere machine, with a <b>moving</b> <b>spring</b> of self-interest! I don't believe he cares a rush for any living thing! Except for your sake, Margaret, I wish I had never seen him again, and only remembered him as he was at Edinburgh, as I remembered dear old Spencer. It is a grievous thing! Ruined entirely! No doubt that London life must be trying--the constant change and bewilderment of patients preventing much individual care and interest. It must be very hardening. No family ties either, nothing to look to but pushing his way. Yes! there's great excuse for poor Mat. I never knew fully till now the blessing it was that your dear mother was willing to take me so early, and that this place was open to me with all its home connections and interests. I am glad I never had anything to do with London!" ...|$|E
60|$|The heroic, or rhyming, plays, were {{borrowed}} from the French, to whose genius they are better suited than to the British. An analogy may be observed between all the different departments of the belles lettres; and none seem more closely allied, than the pursuits of the dramatic writer, {{and those of the}} composer of romances or novels. Both deal in fictitious adventure; both write for amusement; and address themselves nearly to the same class of admirers. Nay, although the pride of the dramatist may be offended by the assertion, it would seem, that the nature of his walk is often prescribed by the successful impression of a novel upon the public mind. If we laugh over low adventures in a novel, we soon see low comedy upon the stage: If we are horror-struck with a tale of robbers and murder in our closet, the dagger and the green carpet will not long remain unemployed in the theatre; and if ghosts haunt our novels, they soon stalk amongst our scenes. Under this persuasion, we have little doubt that the heroic tragedies were the legitimate offspring of the French romances of Calprenede and Scuderi. Such as may deign to open these venerable and neglected tomes, will be soon convinced of their extreme resemblance to the heroic drama. A remarkable feature in both, is the ideal world which they form for themselves. Every sentiment is lofty, splendid, and striking; and no apology is admitted for any departure from the dignity of character, however natural or impressive. The beauty of the heroine, and the valour of the hero, must be alike resistless; and the <b>moving</b> <b>spring,</b> through the whole action, is the overbearing passion of love. Their language and manners are as peculiar to themselves, as their prowess and susceptibility. The pastoral Arcadian does not differ more widely from an ordinary rustic, than these lofty persons do from the princes and kings of this world. Neither is any circumstance of national character, or manners, allowed as an apology for altering the established character, which must be invariably sustained by the persons of the heroic drama. The religion, and the state of society of the country where the scene is laid, may be occasionally alluded to as authority for varying a procession, or introducing new dresses and decorations; but, in all other respects, an Indian Inca, attired in feathers, must hold the same dignity of deportment, and display the same powers of declamation, and ingenuity of argument, with a Roman emperor in his purple, or a feudal warrior in his armour; for the rule and decorum of this species of composition is too peremptory, to give way either to the current of human passions, or to the usages of nations. Gibbon has remarked, that the kings of the Gepidae, and the Ostrogoths in Corneille's tragedy of Attila, are profound politicians, and sentimental lovers;--a description which, with a varying portion of pride, courtesy, and heroism, will apply to almost all the characters in plays drawn upon this model.|$|E
