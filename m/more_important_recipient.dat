5000|$|The {{stimulus}} {{effects of}} the EITC and other consumption-augmenting policies have been challenged by more recent and rigorous studies. Haskell (2006) finds that the unique spending patterns of lump-sum tax credit recipients and the increasingly global supply chain for consumer goods is counter-productive to producing high, localized multipliers. He places the local multiplier effect somewhere {{in the range of}} 1.07 to 1.15, more in line with typical economic returns. The lower multiplier is due to recipients emphasizing [...] "big-ticket" [...] durable-good purchases, which are typically produced elsewhere, versus locally produced products and services such as agricultural products or restaurant visits. However, Haskell points to a silver lining: there are perhaps <b>more</b> <b>important</b> benefits from <b>recipients</b> who use the credit for savings or investment in big-ticket purchases that promote social mobility, such as automobiles, school tuition, or health-care services.|$|R
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{has been}} shown to be an {{important}} pathogen in liver transplant recipients. The presence of primary infection and the use of OKT 3 monoclonal antibod-ies appear to be risk factors for symptomatic infection. In my experience, the disease is clinically similar to the CMV disease seen in other transplant groups except that infection of the liver may be clinically <b>more</b> <b>important</b> in liver <b>recipients</b> than in other transplant recipients. Various regimens for prevention of CMV infection in transplant recipients have been investigated, including vaccination, prophylaxis with a variety of polyclonal immu-noglobulin preparations, the use of immunomodulators such as interferon-a, and an-tiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir. These studies have been performed in kidney or bone marrow recipients and may not be applicable to liver recipients. Studies in progress on which no data are currently available employ human monoclonal immunoglobulin and ganciclovir. It is not possible at present to make any specific recommendations for pro-phylaxis. It is likely that ongoing randomized studies and further understanding of host-vi-rus interactions in CMV disease will lead to useful prophylactic regimens in this group of patients...|$|R

During this period Morocco {{was one of the}} most <b>important</b> <b>recipients</b> of FDI inflows in the Middle East and North African. This period is characterized by the adoption of the adjustment plan of 1983 - and the accompanying complementary measures relating a more open and flexible economy - that ushered in a radical change in Moroccan’s strategy of economic development. We use an empirical model using some macro-economic variables, which allows us to obtain a general characterization of FDI in Moroccan economy. ...|$|R

Data from 504 questionnaires filled out by college students from Seoul and Beijing were used for statistical analysis. The four segments of apparel shopping values are, hedonic shopping segment, low involvement shopping segment, high involvement shopping segment, and utilitarian shopping segment. In the high involvement shopping segment, Korean respondents considered store atmosphere, convenience, and the services of salespersons to be <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the other segments. Chinese respondents in both the hedonic shopping segment and high involvement shopping segment considered store atmosphere <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the other segments. Korean respondents considered store service <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the Chinese respondents in the hedonic shopping segment, but Chinese respondents were more likely to consider store convenience to be <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than Korean respondents. In the low involvement shopping segment, Korean respondents considered store atmosphere, store services, and the selection of goods <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than Chinese respondents did. In the high involvement shopping segment, Korean respondents considered the services of salespersons to be <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the Chinese respondents but the Chinese respondents evaluated store convenience as <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than Korean respondents.
