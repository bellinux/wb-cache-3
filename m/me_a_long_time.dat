500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was {{directed}} by Tim Pope, who had directed all of the band's previous videos since 1982's [...] "Let's Go to Bed". The video was filmed in England's Pinewood Studios in October 1987. Set on a cliff overlooking a sea, the video recreates many of the memories detailed in the song's lyrics. When a fanzine asked Smith what the song was about, {{he said it was}} inspired by [...] "something that happened to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago—see the video!" [...] While Smith had claimed for years that the video was shot at the same place that inspired the song, he later admitted that the bulk of it was filmed in a studio, utilising footage of the water and cliffs of Beachy Head taken for the band's 1985 video for [...] "Close to Me".|$|E

2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a new love {{interest}} for established character; Chris Warner. Alison James, who had theatre background, was cast in the role. After appearing on the show for three years, James decided to quit and the character was killed off. She stated, [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to decide to leave Shortland Street because it isn't easy {{to walk away from}} something you love. I also had this fear I'd never get work again – it's a real fear. So it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to wrestle with the idea that saying no to work wasn't unwise, and that if you actually want to grow and develop as an actor you do have to stop and move on." [...] She found her final scenes draining, [...] "Everyone was acting around me and I was there, but my acting had basically stopped. I remember lying there thinking, 'I’m going to miss all these people.' I was quite teary, actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition. I {{may have had}} novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals, no burning desire to achieve some end. Second, I didn’t {{have a sense of}} {{what it takes to be}} a serious writer. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to develop this." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{know how}} hard {{everyone}} in that locker room worked to get themselves in position to win that game today and for it to end like that, and {{for me to be}} the cause is very tough to swallow right now", Romo said after the game. [...] "I take responsibility for messing up at the end there. That's my fault. I cost the Dallas Cowboys a playoff win, and it's going to sit with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> I don't know if I have ever felt this low." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{repeated}} softly, [...] "I don't understand myself. You've known <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> Andrew. You wouldn't write me down as altogether a sentimental ass, would you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Levy {{has said}} that his views on Israel's {{policies}} toward the Palestinians developed only after joining Haaretz. [...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, I was young and brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, and I would think, 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|From August to October 2006, Lisa Mitchell rose to {{national}} prominence as a contestant on Australian Idol Season 4, performing cover versions {{and two of}} her own compositions, which were [...] "See It in Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Too Far Gone". Mitchell had auditioned in Albury in April, aged 16, and moved through the selection process to the final six before being eliminated in mid-October. In June 2009 Mitchell reflected on her time on Australian Idol: [...] "I was uncomfortable with elements of the show and unhappy about the compromises sometimes. I didn’t know what I wanted with music but I did know that I loved it. I think {{that was what the}} experience cemented. It’s taken <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to find my own way. But I never went back to school".|$|E
2500|$|Sundfør {{released}} her fourth studio album, Ten Love Songs, on 16 February 2015. The album showcased Sundfør experimenting {{with an electronic}} dance pop sound alongside textured orchestral arrangements. The album {{was considered to be}} Sundfør's international breakthrough, while also debuting at number one in Norway, receiving universal acclaim from music critics and appearing on various year-end lists. She later went on tour in promotion of the album. Sundfør has stated that after she finished the album she became ill, both physically and mentally: [...] "I was getting flu all the time. Depression, anxiety. It's taken <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to get back again. I was wobbling and...I'm still struggling with it." [...] She believes this was partly a result of almost every aspect of the album's making, including production, composition, mixing and recording, which she mostly worked on by herself, but also {{as a result of the}} album's themes, [...] "in which she delved into her own life to examine the links between extreme love and violent hatred." [...] It was shortly after when she began work on Music for People in Trouble.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Stephen," [...] she pleaded, [...] "I am sorry--to {{be such a}} fool--but {{this thing}} has lived with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> and--would you go away? It would be kindest." ...|$|E

60|$|As I stood dreaming {{beside the}} giant {{thing that had}} brought me safely through the earth's crust, my {{traveling}} companion, the hideous Mahar, emerged from {{the interior of the}} prospector and stood beside <b>me.</b> For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> she remained motionless.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, but, Sam, what am I {{going to}} do if that money isn't gotten back? The Sandersons can't afford to lose it, and even if I went to work right away, it would take <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to earn four {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|R

5000|$|Swift {{has said}} that the song was [...] "the hardest to write on the album", saying: [...] "it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> really <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to filter through {{everything}} I wanted to put in the song without it being a 10-minute song, which you can’t put on an album. I wanted a story that could work {{in the form of a}} song and I called my co-writer Liz Rose and said, ‘Come over, we’ve gotta filter this down,’ and it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> really <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to get it." [...] Rose also {{has said that}} the song was originally [...] "10, 12 or 15 minutes long" [...] before cutting down to [...] "the important pieces". Even after cutting, the song is the longest track on the album.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, as I've {{only just}} arrived," [...] she remarked, [...] "I might be forgiven if I {{do not change}} my skirt. I packed so hurriedly {{that it will take}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to find my things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But he did ask <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago, you know, papa," [...] Elma put in demurely. [...] "And at that time, you remember, you {{objected to}} the match; so of course, as in duty bound, I at once refused him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so sorry," [...] he answered, {{taking the}} vacant chair by her side.

6000|$|... "I feel a true {{interest}} in Fritz," [...] she resumed, lowering her voice {{so as not}} to be heard by the musicians at the other end of the room. [...] "Until to-day, I have heard nothing of him since he left Wurzburg. I like to talk about him--he once did <b>me</b> <b>a</b> kindness <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since.
