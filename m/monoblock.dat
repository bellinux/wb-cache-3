5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a <b>monoblock</b> steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E

HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency.

40|$|AbstractThe {{thickness}} of Tungsten <b>monoblocks</b> composing the future ITER divertor {{is supposed to}} be 8 mm only. Therefore, severe erosion caused by high heat fluxes during transients, such as Type I ELMs and disruptions, is a limiting factor to PFCs lifespan. Under the influence of extreme heat fluxes expected during ITER transients serious surface modification of the Tungsten <b>monoblocks</b> is anticipated. Moreover, melting of a thin surface layer is likely to happen. Melt motion contributes seriously to the material erosion. The other sources of erosion are melt splashing, in the form of droplet ejection, and evaporation. These mechanics lead to a cold dense secondary plasma region formation near the irradiated surface. Intense re-radiation of the incoming plasma flow energy in the secondary plasma layer results in a significant reduction of the heat flux reaching the target surface. Accounting for this vapor shielding effect is essential to estimate the surface erosion under influence of intense plasma flow properly. In this paper a simple model capable of reproducing one of the key features of vapor shielding, namely the saturation of the energy absorbed by the target, is proposed. This model allows for an approximate analytical solution that indicates parameters the saturation energy depends on. The model is validated against the experimental data obtained at MK- 200 pulse plasma accelerator...|$|R

SEM analysis indicates no measurable change to the surface state after the exposure in Magnum-PSI.

Moreover, main chamber tungsten sources are thought to dominate the contamination of the plasma core. We present here in particular new developments aimed at improving the description of the interface between the plasma and the wall, namely a way to treat sheath physics in a more faithful way using the output of 1 D particle in cell simulations.

40|$|Over {{the period}} of the ITER Engineering Design Activity (EDA) the results from physics experiments, modelling, {{engineering}} analyses and R&D, have been brought together to provide a design for an ITER divertor. The design satisfies all necessary requirements for steady state and transient heat flux, nuclear shielding, pumping, tritium inventory, impurity control, armour lifetime, electromagnetic loads, diagnostics, and remote maintenance. The design consists of 60 cassettes each comprising a cassette body onto which the plasma facing components (PFCs) are mounted. Each cassette is supported by toroidal rails which are attached to the vacuum vessel. For the PFCs the final armour choice is carbon-fibre-composite (CfC) for the strike point regions and tungsten in all remaining areas. R&D has demonstrated that CfC <b>monoblocks</b> can routinely withstand heat loads up to 20 MW m 2 and tungsten armour 0 MW m 2. Analysis and experiment show that a CfC armour thickness of 20 mm will provide sufficient lifetime for at least 1000 full power pulses. The thickness of the cassette body is sufficient to shield the vacuum vessel, so that, if necessary, rewelding is possible, and also provides sufficient stiffness against electromagnetically generated loads. The cassette design provides efficient and proven remote maintenance which should allow exchange of...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIf the {{decision}} is made not to apply a toroidal chamfer to tungsten <b>monoblocks</b> at ITER divertor vertical targets, exposed leading edges will arise {{as a result of}} assembly tolerances between adjacent plasma-facing components. Then, the advantage of glancing magnetic field angles for spreading plasma heat flux on top surfaces is lost at the misaligned edges with an interaction occurring at near normal incidence, which can drive melting for the expected inter-ELM heat fluxes. A dedicated experiment has been performed on the COMPASS tokamak to thoroughly study power deposition on misaligned edges using inner-wall limited discharges on a special graphite tile presenting gaps and leading edges directly viewed by a high resolution infra-red camera. The parallel power flux deducted from the unperturbed measurement far from the gap is fully consistent with the observed temperature increase at the leading edge, respecting the power balance. All the power flowing into the gap is deposited at the leading edge and no mitigation factor is required to explain the thermal response. Particle-in-cell simulations show that the ion Larmor smoothing effect is weak and that the power deposition on misaligned edges is well described by the optical approximation because of an electron dominated regime associated with non-ambipolar parallel current flow...|$|R
40|$|The ITER divertor, in its full-power {{operation}} phase, {{will need}} to withstand steady-state heat fluxes of up to 10 MW•m− 2. In addition, “slow” plasma transients such as re-attachment events must be considered, during which the surface heat fluxes will increase significantly {{in a short period}} of time (∼few seconds). To mitigate such transients, ITER plans to use the divertor gas injection system (GIS) to introduce radiating impurity species (probably using a hydrogenic carrier gas to improve response time) into the divertor plasma. We consider here various aspects of this process. First, we assess the time needed for critical damage to occur to the vertical target <b>monoblocks</b> by considering two limits: surface tungsten melting and critical heat flux to the coolant channel. This provides us with the time limits before which the plasma heat flux must be reduced to tolerable values. A dedicated experimental test bench has been used to measure the travel time of the injected gas from the valve to the divertor subvolume, using a manifold with the same pipe length as envisaged for the actual ITER device and studying a wide range of gas mixtures and throughputs. Once the gas has arrived in the divertor, we use the existing database of SOLPS 4. 3 simulations of the ITER divertor to estimate, for the case of neon as radiative species, the neon residence time, together with some new time-dependent SOLPS-ITER simulations to assess the time response of the divertor vertical target heat flux...|$|R
