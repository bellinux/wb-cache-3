5000|$|A {{machine tool}} may have several spindles, {{such as the}} {{headstock}} and tailstock spindles on a bench lathe. The main spindle is usually the biggest one. References to [...] "the spindle" [...] without further qualification imply the main spindle. Some machine tools that specialize in high-volume mass production {{have a group of}} 4, 6, or even more main spindles. These are called <b>multispindle</b> machines. For example, gang drills and many screw machines are <b>multispindle</b> machines. Although a bench lathe has more than one spindle (counting the tailstock), it is not called a <b>multispindle</b> machine; it has one main spindle.|$|E
50|$|Well-known {{brands of}} such {{machines}} have included National-Acme, Hardinge, New Britain, New Britain-Gridley, Acme-Gridley, Davenport, Bullard Mult-Au-Matic (a vertical <b>multispindle</b> variant), Thomas Ryder and Son, and others.|$|E
40|$|We {{outline the}} theory of sets with {{distributive}} operations: multishelves and <b>multispindles,</b> with examples provided by semi-lattices, lattices and skew lattices. For every such a structure we define multi-term distributive homology and show some of its properties. The main result is a complete formula for the homology of a finite distributive lattice. We also indicate the answer for unital spindles and conjecture the general formula for semi-lattices and some skew lattices. Then we propose a generalization of a lattice as a set {{with a number of}} idempotent operations satisfying the absorption law. Comment: 30 pages, 3 tables, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|Computer {{numerical}} controlled (CNC) lathes {{are rapidly}} replacing the older production lathes (<b>multispindle,</b> etc.) {{due to their}} ease of setting, operation, repeatability and accuracy. They are designed to use modern carbide tooling and fully use modern processes. The part may be designed and the tool paths programmed by the CAD/CAM process or manually by the programmer, and the resulting file uploaded to the machine, and once set and trialled the machine will continue to turn out parts under the occasional supervision of an operator.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} chucking {{machine is}} very similar to an automatic screw machine, except it handles larger work, which due to its size is more often chucking work and less often bar work. The Fay automatic lathe was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a screw machine is limited to around 80 mm practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to 300 mm chucks. The chucks are air-operated. Many of these machines are <b>multispindle</b> (more than one main spindle).|$|E
50|$|In the <b>multispindle</b> segment, some {{machine tool}} {{builders}} also build hybrid machines {{that are part}} CNC and part old-school control (some stations are CNC while others are cam-op or actuated with simple hydraulic cycles). This lets shops with certain mixes of work derive competitive advantage from the lower cost compared with all-CNC machines. The variety of machines that allow profitable production within certain niches reflects the variety of work that exists: some high-volume work remains the province of cam-op; full CNC with all {{the bells and whistles}} outcompetes on some flexible low-volume work; and hybrid machines may yield the lowest unit price on mixes in between.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Multispindle</b> lathes {{have more}} than one spindle and {{automated}} control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called screw machines, while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. Screw machines usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a screw machine is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a screw machine can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per interchangeable part much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Bryant Chucking Grinder Company {{was founded}} in 1909 by William LeRoy (Roy) Bryant, one of the machine tool {{entrepreneurs}} mentored by James Hartness of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J&L). Roy Bryant had joined J&L in 1897, became chief draughtsman in 1899, and was chief engineer by 1905. While working on tooling for chucking lathes, he invented a <b>multispindle</b> grinder for second-operation work, which he patented (...) [...] He took Hartness's advice and formed a company to build his grinders, and the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company joined J&L as one of several firms that made Springfield, Vermont an important center for machine tools and their tooling, such as accessories and cutting tools. (Others were the Fellows Gear Shaper Company and the Lovejoy Tool Company). Hartness helped finance the Bryant venture and was the firm's first president; Roy Bryant afterward assumed the post.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term screw machine has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term screw machine was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic screw machine was applied, and the term hand screw machine or manual screw machine was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic screw machines, and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term screw machine no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of screw machine remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called screw machines there were variations, such as single-spindle versus <b>multispindle,</b> horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|E
40|$|We {{prove that}} the {{degenerate}} part of the distributive homology of a <b>multispindle</b> {{is determined by the}} normalized homology. In particular, when the <b>multispindle</b> is a quandle Q, the degenerate homology of Q is completely determined by the quandle homology of Q. For this case (and generally for two term homology of a spindle) we provide an explicit KÃ¼nneth-type formula for the degenerate part. This solves the mystery in algebraic knot theory of the meaning of the degenerate quandle homology, brought over 15 years ago when the homology theories were defined, and the degenerate part was observed to be non trivial. Comment: 19 pages. 2 nd version: the proof of Lemma A. 8 is simplified. 3 rd version: a few typos corrected, some colors in pictures changed to darke...|$|E

40|$|DE 3828101 A UPAB: 19930928 The {{section of}} the {{rotating}} tool detected by the sensor (21 - 24) is large compared to the typical form alteration of the tool, so that the output signal of the sensor corresponds to an "averaged" value. The distance sensor is arranged secured in such a way, that it detects the tool before, {{during and after the}} engagement. The evaluation unit (31) e. g. microcomputer determines the signal AC frequency or amplitude from the output signal of the sensor. The output signal of the sensor is filtered by a high pass filter and the evaluation unit determines the signal AC frequency or amplitude from the high pass filtered signal.
