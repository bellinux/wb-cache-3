40|$|Previous studies {{revealed}} that the filaments of cytokeratin express different antigenic sites in the basal and suprabasal cell compartment of the skin and oral mucosa. It has been demonstrated that the keratin polypeptide subunit of molecular weight 67, 000 dalton (67 K) is a valuable marker of the suprabasal cells, since the normal basal cells remain unlabeled by antibodies against this large polypeptide. In the present study, {{the distribution of the}} 67 K polypeptide has been investigated on human and guinea pig keratinocyte suspensions, purified basal cells of guinea pigs, normal human abdominal skin and normal human buccal mucosa, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. The results of this investigation confirmed ultrastructurally that the 67 K-antigen expression is lacking in the epidermal basal cell compartment. However, it could be shown that 67 K polypeptide is a component of the tonofilaments in the upper <b>Malpighian</b> <b>cell</b> layers of the skin and oral mucosa.

40|$|Using {{standard}} osmium fixation and methacrylate embedding techniques, a {{study has}} been made of the melanocyte of human biopsy skin removed under general and local anaesthesia. Melanogenesis was easily observable in the melanocytes, but immature pigment granules were rarely seen in the Malpighian cells. The passage of melanin from melanocyte to <b>Malpighian</b> <b>cell</b> [...] cytocrine secretion-is thought to have been observed. Phagocytes near the dermal-epidermal]unction seem to have their pigment granules in vacuoles, rather than surrounded directly by the cytoplasmic matrix as in the melanocytes. This, together with the failure to observe "effete " melanocytes, prompts the suggestion that the phagocytes are melanocytes which have migrated from the epidermis into the dermis. A melanin granule is shown with alternating dark and lighter transverse striations, concerning which structure little can at present be said. The distinctive cells seen in the basal layer of the epidermis, which Masson (1, 2) called "clear cells " on account of their appearance in stained sections, {{have been the subject of}} much uncertainty. They have also been the subject of terminological profusion: the dear cell, the melanoblast, the melanocyte, the dendritic cell, and even the Langerhans cell, meaning the same thing. Clear cell is a good description of appearance in section, and melanocyte an accurate description of function, and it has been recommended (3) that the latter term be used to the exclusion of all others. The recommendation has met with wide, though not complete (4, p. 62), agreement, and is followed in this paper. Pautrier et al. (5) early suggested that the melanocytes form a syncytial system to nourish the epidermis with nutrients obtained from the dermis. Billingham (6) considers that the cells, by means of the branching network formed by their dendrites, are ideally suited to spread virus-type infections through the epidermis. Later, with Medawar (7), he regards the cells as a definite system called the epidermal glial system. These authors also agree with Masson (l) that the Langerhans cell, considered by Langerhans (8) to be a distinct cell of neural function, is merely a...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} maturation of MCV in vivo, we injected tritiated thymidine intradermally into 23 lesions of molluscum contagiosum and obtained biopsies at intervals from 1 hour to 8 days later. The tissues were processed for electron microscopic autoradiography, and the patterns of viral maturation were determined by the localization of silver grains over developing virions at different time intervals. The findings demonstrate that maturation of molluscum contagiosum (MCV) in vivo is asynchronous. Some virions mature rapidly, within 1 to 2. 5 hours, but the majority mature more slowly; 94 percent are mature in 5 days. A comparative study revealed that maturation of virions in infected cells occurred more rapidly in the granular layer than in the malpighian layer.

40|$|The type of {{variegation}} of eyes of white-mottled mutants of D. hydei, either small-spotted or large-spotted, {{depends on}} the specific chromosome rearrangement involved. This distinction between mutants, though handsome, is not absolute because very seldomly small-spotted types do show a larger pigment aggregate and some "large-spotted" flies have no large spots at all, but only minor spots. Because of a pleiotropic action of the white gene, we could study the variegation of Malpighian tubules. The quasi-linear array of <b>Malpighian</b> <b>cells</b> enables a thorough statistical analysis. The problem was in how far the variegation of the tubes that is correlated with the variegation of eyes (in as far as numbers of pigmented and unpigmented cells are concerned) is also connected with a cell-lineage type of determination.

40|$|Theoretical models {{developed}} {{to explain the}} coupled solute-water transport in various absorptive epithelia consider the movement of water to be a passive process produced by the localized secretion of ions into channels associated with the epithelium (cf. 6, 9 - 13, 20, 28). This standing gradient hypothesis has been extended to Malpighian tubules of insects (7, 14). In these particular cells, osmotic gradients {{are thought to be}} established within extracellular compartments associated with basal infoldings of the plasma membrane as well as between microvilli on the lumenal surface of these cells (7, 11 - 14, 17). Essential to the validity of the standing gradient hypothesis is that high molecular weight substances such as blood proteins be prevented from accumulating within THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY • VOLUME 47, 1970 • pages 2 99 - 303 299 the channels formed by the basal infoldings of the <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> (7).

However, little has been done to demonstrate morphologically the diffusion barrier to proteins inferred by physiologists, largely because of the lack of adequate electronopaque tracers which are of small enough dimensions and which can be localized precisely enough to reflect physiological events. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with a molecular weight of approximately 40, 000 permits the localization, movement, and permeability of cells to protein with rather precise localization (19). For this reason, it was felt of interest to determine if an exogenous protein such as HRP when injected into the hemocoel fluid could gain entrance into the extracellular spaces formed by the basal plasma membrane infoldings of the <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> and, if so, to further determine if this protein could be transported across the plasma membrane and could accumulate within the cytoplasm.

40|$|The {{dispersal}} unit of C. mopane {{consists of}} a seed borne within an indehiscent fruit. Both the seed and fruit are short-lived Under natural environmental conditions the seeds seldom remain viable {{for more than a}} year and pericarps of fruits are usually completely degraded after one year. The transitory nature of the testa is reflected in its anatomical structure as it is thin-walled and unlignified at maturity. Seed structure does not conform to that of the typical legume. The thin testa is highly permeable to water and lacks the characteristic <b>malpighian</b> <b>cells</b> and other sclerenchymatous elements. Although water does not penetrate the pericarp of newly-matured fruits, the pericarp soon becomes permeable under natural environmental conditions. Dye experiments using the apoplastic tracer acid fuchsin. revealed that once the fruit becomes permeable, it initially allows water to enter mostly through the ventral and dorsal sutures. With increased scarification of the pericarp, water is able to penetrate over its entire surface. An aril that originates partly from the funicle and partly from the outer integument circumvents the seed. The cells of the aril contain gum-like or mucilaginous substances that swell considerably when they are in contact with water. The aril is situated along the circumference of the seed, in close proximity to the carpel sutures and may aid fruit opening by increasing tension on the fruit valves The aril is abundantly supplied with vascular bundles as well as with an air canal that forms a highly efficient water transporting system during imbibition. If seeds are removed from fruits prior to imbibition, the aril swells to such an extent that its cells, including the vascular tissue, become disrupted. Imbibitional damage was constantly observed in seedlings that originated from seeds that were removed from fruits prior to imbibition. Seedlings originating from seeds left enclosed in fruits did not show similar damage In enclosed seeds the aril cells and vascular connections remained intact during imbibition. As the seeds of C. mopane are highly water permeable and lack a functional lens to control the rate of water entry, it is proposed that the pericarp governs the passage of water to the seed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} a novel member of the vertebrate sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter symporter family from Drosophila melanogaster. This gene, named bloated tubules (blot), shows significant sequence similarity to a subgroup of vertebrate orphan transporters. blot transcripts are maternally supplied and during embryogenesis exhibit a complex and dynamic pattern in a subset of ectodermally derived epithelia, notably in the Malpighian tubules, and in the nervous system. Animals mutant for this gene are larval lethals, in which the <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> are distended with an enlarged and disorganised apical surface. Embryos lacking the maternal component of blot expression die during early stages of development. They show an inability to form actin filaments in the apical cortex, resulting in impaired syncytial nuclear divisions, severe defects in the organisation of the cortical cytoskeleton, and a failure to cellularise. For the first time, a neurotransmitter transporter-like protein has been implicated in a function outside the nervous system.

The insects pertained to colonies reared in the laboratory and originated from domestic specimens collected in the Brazilian states of São Paulo (north) and Minas Gerais (south). Since nuclear phenotypes in this species are affected by single cold shocks, it was expected that these phenotypes could also be changed by sequential shocks. Nuclear phenotypes indicative of mechanisms of cell survival (nuclear fusion and heterochromatin decondensation) and cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) were observed concomitantly in all the conditions tested. Nuclear fusion and heterochromatin decondensation were not found relevant for the presumed acquisition of the cold-hardening response in T. infestans.

Special interest was given to the dormant overwintering period when we hypothesized that the primary role of spherites is to supply minerals for basic vital processes. The investigation was carried out by light and transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron energy-loss spectroscopy and energy-filtering TEM. Spherites are present only in the middle Malpighian tubule segment, consisting of Type 1 cells, characterized, among other features, by a round, apically placed nucleus and numerous spherites, and a few Type 2 cells with an elongated nucleus in the centre and sparse spherites. At the beginning of dormancy in November juveniles, minerals are accumulated in spherites and then decline until March. In one-year-old May larvae, spherites are commonly rich in minerals, and from July onwards they are progressively exploited in the adults. Spherite destruction starts with apoptosis in senile October individuals. The findings suggest that the mineral supply of spherites in Malpighian tubules is crucial to supporting vital processes throughout the life cycle of T. neglectus...|$|R

Feulgen-DNA classes> 64 C, with resulting giant nuclei, may occur only through nuclear and cellular fusions, elicited by stressing agents such as heat shock and fasting. Although apoptosis {{has been reported in}} <b>cells</b> of <b>Malpighian</b> tubule epithelia, especially under stress conditions, the association between cell death and the degree of polyploidy resulting from different phenom-ena (either development or stress) has not yet been investigated.

The susceptibility to apoptosis was unrelated to an exclusive degree of nuclear ploidy reached in Malpighian tubules by insect development or elicited by stress. The occurrence of apoptosis in the giant nuclei suggests that the nuclear and cellular fusion, previously assumed to be a mechanism of cell survival in blood-sucking hemipterans, may not be totally effective against stressful conditions.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying {{ion transport}} in insect Malpighian tubules {{have been studied}} extensively {{in a number of}} species (for reviews, see Maddrell and O’Donnell, 1992; Nicolson, 1993; Pannabecker, 1995; Beyenbach, 1995). Consensus has now been reached on a model for ion and fluid transport, which is driven primarily by an apical vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. In <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells,</b> the electrogenic transport of H+ into the tubule lumen establishes a proton gradient and an electrical potential difference across the apical membrane, which drives movement of alkali cations from the cell to the lumen through apical Na+/nH+ and/or K+/nH+ antiporters (Zhang et al., 1994). In addition, the proton pump generates a favourable electrical gradient for anion movement (Cl–), which may be either transcellular or through the paracellular shunt (Dÿkstra et al., 1994; Beyenbach, 1995). With the exception of some insects that make use of sodium (e. g. Glossina: Gee 1976; Libellula: Nicholls, 1985), potassium acts as the primary driving force of urine formation in Malpighian tubules. Blood-sucking species can switch from a mixed Na+/K+ in basal conditions to a preferentially Na+-driven fluid secretion after a blood meal (e. g. Rhodnius: Maddrell, 1980). Basolateral K+ transport systems must permit adequate K+ uptake to maintain fluid secretion. The existence of Ba 2 +-sensitive K+ channels has been confirmed in tubules o...|$|R
40|$|Only one seed {{is carried}} inside the {{indehiscent}} fruit of Colophospermum mopane. Both the seed and fruit constitute the dispersal unit and the seed germinates while still inside the fruit. The mature seed of C. mopane has a thin seed coat that shows little differentiation, {{similar to the}} seed coats of typical Leguminous overgrown seeds. The <b>malpighian</b> <b>cells</b> that usually form a mechanical layer of protection are absent {{and this may be}} attributed to the seed being enclosed in an indehiscent fruit where the pericarp forms the protective layer. The thin, undifferentiated seed coat may also be an adaptation to low rainfall as it allows for the rapid uptake of water where rainfall occurs in small quantities or is of short duration. The seed originates from a bitegmic ovule. The inner layer of the inner integument persists throughout most of seed development and differentiates into an endothelium. The remainder of the inner integument degenerates completely at the time of fertilisation but the entire outer integument persists and differentiates into the seed coat. The integumentary cells display high mitotic activity in both the anticlinal and periclinal planes throughout seed ontogeny another feature reminiscent of overgrown or neotenous seeds. Up to the 5 mm stage of the young seed, the older cell layers towards the outside of the integument are obliterated and resorbed as they are continually being replaced by new cell layers that originate from the inner layers. After the 5 mm stage, the cells of the subepidermal layer begin to divide periclinally and anticlinally {{to keep pace with the}} inner layers. The senescent cells of the middle layer are then obliterated between the dividing cells of the inner integumentary layers and the subepidermal layers. The number of cell layers remains more or less constant throughout seed ontogeny because the obliteration of the older layers prevents the seed coat from becoming thick and multiplicative. The anticlinal divisions bring about the lateral extension of the seed coat to give rise to an aril that circumvents the seed. Another feature reminiscent of overgrown seeds is the convoluted appearance of the cotyledons which suggests that extensive seed growth is limited by the size of the fruit locule. As a consequence of the convoluted cotyledons the seeds may be regarded as ruminate. Rumination is, however, not only an outcome of seed growth inside the limited space of the fruit locule but also of uneven anticlinal divisions in the endothelium during early stages of embryogenesis. The entire vascular supply of the seed is limited to the aril and no secondary ramifications of vascular traces occur in the remainder of the seed coat. Due to extensive anticlinal divisions of the seed coat the primary vascular bundle is stretched in a lateral plane, causing the xylem strands to separate from the surrounding parenchyma cells, as well as from one another. This causes an air canal to develop in the primary vascular bundle that originates from the funiculus. The lateral extension of the aril also causes the position of cambiai-like meristematic areas that initially surround the primary vascular bundle to shift so that the area occupied by these cells becomes V-shaped or U-shaped. The cambial-like meristematic areas give rise to secondary vascular bundles. The micropyle is small and occluded with a dark staining substance that makes it impermeable to water. The integuments as well as the mature seed coat contain high concentrations of tanniniferous substances. The large seed size of the xerophytic C. mopane may be explained by its common origin from the ancestors of Guibourtia and Copaifera that occurred in high rainfall zones...|$|R

Insects in each of these subgroups received either a heat shock at 40 oC for 1 h or were maintained at 28 oC (control for heat shock). The Malpighian tubules were removed one and seven days af-ter each assay and subjected to the Feulgen reaction for identification and counting of the various nuclear pheno-types. Insect survival was high (90 %) even after 40 days of starvation but decreased thereafter. Necrosis rather than apoptosis, increased with fasting. Feeding after fasting increased the frequency of apoptosis but not of necrosis. The short heat shock as used here did not additionally affect the responses induced by fasting and refeeding. P. megistus nymphs could withstand relatively long periods of fasting although individual variation in the mean length of cell survival had been found especially after a three-month fasting. The results related to cell necrosis suggest that part of the <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> may not have developed highly efficient mechanisms for dealing with fasting. For those cells resistant to fasting, feeding subsequent to fasting acted only as a mild stressing agent and heat shock wa...|$|R
40|$|The {{function}} of excretion in insects is {{performed by the}} Malpighian tubules, a functional equivalent of the vertebrate kidney. Malpighian tubules are long, thin tubes connected to the hindgut. Upon {{the determination of the}} <b>Malpighian</b> tubule major <b>cell</b> type early in embryogenesis, the tubular architecture is achieved by extensive cell division and cell rearrangements. During the tube elongation process, cells exchange their neighbors, allowing the short and fat Malpighian tubule primordia to grow and become a thin tube. Cell rearrangement and intercalation underlie the morphogenesis of other epithelial tissues in Drosophila melanogaster, such as the embryonic epidermis. Recent work has provided insights in the cellular and molecular basis of cell intercalation. These advances are reviewed and discussed with regard to what is known about Malpighian tubule morphogenesis. Mature Malpighian tubules are composed of two cell types, each having a specific function in excretion: The principal cells and the stellate cells. Drosophila and mammalian kidney development show striking similarities, as the recruitment of the stellate <b>cells</b> to the <b>Malpighian</b> tubules, like the cells of the metanephric mesenchyme, requires that cells undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. The molecular similarities between these two cases is reviewed here...|$|R
40|$|Malpighian tubules are {{critical}} organs for epithelial fluid transport and stress tolerance in insects, and are under neuroendocrine control by multiple neuropeptides secreted by identified neurons. Here, we demonstrate roles for CRF-like diuretic hormone 44 (DH 44) and Drosophila melanogaster kinin (Drome-kinin, DK) in desiccation and starvation tolerance. Gene expression and labelled DH 44 ligand binding data, {{as well as}} highly selective knockdowns and/or neuronal ablations of DH 44 in neurons of the pars intercerebralis and DH 44 receptor (DH 44 -R 2) in <b>Malpighian</b> tubule principal <b>cells,</b> indicate that suppression of DH 44 signalling improves desiccation tolerance of the intact fly. Drome-kinin receptor, encoded by the leucokinin receptor gene, LKR, is expressed in DH 44 neurons {{as well as in}} stellate <b>cells</b> of the <b>Malpighian</b> tubules. LKR knockdown in DH 44 -expressing neurons reduces Malpighian tubule-specific LKR, suggesting interactions between DH 44 and LK signalling pathways. Finally, although a role for DK in desiccation tolerance was not defined, we demonstrate a novel role for Malpighian tubule cell-specific LKR in starvation tolerance. Starvation increases gene expression of epithelial LKR. Also, Malpighian tubule stellate cell-specific knockdown of LKR significantly reduced starvation tolerance, demonstrating a role for neuropeptide signalling during starvation stress...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear phenotypes of <b>Malpighian</b> tubule {{epithelial}} <b>cells</b> of 5 th instar male nymphs of the blood-slicking insect Panstrongylus megistus {{were studied}} immediately, {{after a short}} (1 h) cold shock at 0 degreesC, and 10 and 30 days later. The objective was to compare the responses to a cold shock with those known to occur after hyperthermia {{in order to provide}} insight into the cellular effect of cold in this species. Nuclei which usually exhibited a conspicuous Y chromosome chromocenter were the mst frequent phenotype in control and treated specimens. Phenotypes in which the heterochromatin was unravelled, or in which there was nuclear fusion or cell death were more abundant in the shocked specimens. Most of the changes detected have also been found in heat-shocked nymphs, except for nuclear fusion which generates giant nuclei and which appeared to be less effective or necessary than that elicited after heat shock Since other studies showed that a short cold shock does not affect the survival of more than 14 % of 5 th instar nymphs of P. megistus with domestic habit and can induce tolerance to a prolonged cold shock, heat shock proteins proteins are probably the best candidates for effective protection of the cells and the insects from drastic damage caused by low temperature shocks...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of some inhibitors on both the {{activities}} of ATPases isolated from Locusta Malpighian tubules microsomal preparations and in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid production has been carried out. Inhibitors investigated included ouabain, vanadate, furosemide, acetazolamide, SITS and SCN(^_). It was important to establish the effects of temperature and[K(^+) ] on the inhibitory action of both ouabain and vanadate. Ouabaindid not significantly inhibit either Na(^+), K(^+) -ATPase or in vitro Malpighian fluid production at temperatures below 30 C. In contrast vanadate was negatively influenced by temperature. Vanadate was most effective at temperatures between 20 and 30 C. High [K]+ +enhanced vanadate but antagonised ouabain inhibition of Na, K -ATPase. Under optimal conditions ouabain inhibited both Na(^+), K(+) -ATPase (pI(_ 50) = 6. 8) and in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid production (piso = 4. 3). Similarly vanadate inhibited Na*, K*-ATPase (pI(_ 50) = 5. 8) and in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid secretion (pI(_ 50) = 4. 8). Vanadate was found to be nonspecific as it also inhibited both Mg(^ 2 +),-ATPase and Mg(^ 2 +), HCO(^-) (_ 3) -ATPase activities. With the exception of SITS, all other inhibitors studied inhibited in vitro Malpighian tubule fluid section. However, SITS was found to be a strong inhibitor of Mg(^ 2 +), HCO(^-) (_ 3) -ATPase. All results are discussed with reference to the role of ATPases in the process of ion and water transport across the Malpighian tubules. Cytochemical and biochemical studies based on ERNST (1972 a,b) technique were carried out as the first attempt to localise Na(^+),K(^+) -ATPase in Locusta <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells.</b> K(^+) -NPPase was localised mainly along the cytoplasmic side of the basal cell membrane in foldings but was inconsistently inhibited by ouabain. Biochemical studies showed that paraformaldehyde fixation of the Malpighian tubules and inclusion of 20 mM Sr C 1 (_ 2) in the standard incubation medium reduced the total NPPase activity by 73 %. Use of β-glycerophosphate indicated that the reaction product observed {{in the present study was}} not due to nonspecific alkaline phosphatase activity. However, the results were inconclusive and led to further questioning of the validity of ERNST (1972 b) procedure in localisation of Na(^+),K(^+) -ATPase in insect epithelia...|$|R
40|$|The capa peptide family, {{originally}} {{identified in}} the tobacco hawk moth, Manduca sexta, is now known {{to be present in}} many insect families, with increasing publications on capa neuropeptides each year. The physiological actions of capa peptides vary depending on the insect species but capa peptides have key myomodulatory and osmoregulatory functions, depending on insect lifestyle, and life stage. Capa peptide signaling is thus critical for fluid homeostasis and survival, making study of this neuropeptide family attractive for novel routes for insect control. In Dipteran species, including the genetically tractable Drosophila melanogaster, capa peptide action is diuretic; via elevation of nitric oxide, cGMP and calcium in the principal <b>cells</b> of the <b>Malpighian</b> tubules. The identification of the capa receptor (capaR) in several insect species has shown this to be a canonical GPCR. In D. melanogaster, ligand-activated capaR activity occurs in a dose-dependent manner between 10 − 6 and 10 − 12  M. Lower concentrations of capa peptide do not activate capaR, either in adult or larval Malpighian tubules. Use of transgenic flies in which capaR is knocked-down in only <b>Malpighian</b> tubule principal <b>cells</b> demonstrates that capaR modulates tubule fluid secretion rates and in doing so, sets the organismal response to desiccation. Thus, capa regulates a desiccation-responsive pathway in D. melanogaster, linking its role in osmoregulation and fluid homeostasis to environmental response and survival. The conservation of capa action between some Dipteran species suggests that capa’s role in desiccation tolerance may not be confined to D. melanogaster...|$|R
40|$|Homeostasis of the {{internal}} environment of vertebrates and invertebrates is maintained by a collection of organs involving the gastrointestinal system, the renal system and the pulmonary system, whose surfaces facing the external world are covered by a layer of highly polarized epithelial cells as the barrier and sites for substance exchange between body and the external world. As most studies on epithelial transport are done in animal cell- or tissue-models, this dissertation is set to address questions on two in vitro epithelial models: monolayers of cultured epithelial <b>cells</b> and <b>Malpighian</b> tubules of insects. In the field of epithelial transport across mammalian small intestines, most of the cell monolayers {{that have been used}} in the past are abnormal: they are either derived from cancerous cells or poorly differentiated compared to normal tissues. By strictly controlling cultural conditions, we successfully developed an epithelial cell culture derived from normal dog jejune with full differentiation, which can form cell monolayers with remarkable resemblance to the normal small intestinal epithelia in morphology, expression of the junctional proteins and membrane transporter, and electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, different channels can be induced when the cell monolayer is treated with different hormones and agents, suggesting its wide application in basic and applied research studies. Malpighian tubule of the yellow fever mosquitoes Aedes aegypti has been the epithelial transport model in our lab for more than twenty years. The V-type H+ ATPase is thought to provide driving force for transepithelial electrolyte and fluid secretion in Malpighian tubules. Here we immunohisochemcially localized the proton pumps to the apical membranes of the mitochondria-rich principal <b>cells</b> of the <b>Malpighian</b> tubules, and measured enzymatic activities of the V-type H+ ATPase as 50 ~ 60 % of the total ATPase activities. In comparison the activities of the Na+/K+ ATPase were almost undetectable. To understand the functions of Malpighian tubules, we also modeled the tubule into equivalent electrical circuits. However in our previous studies, the model was incomplete, as contribution of gap junction resistance between <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> to the circuit has never been revealed. In this dissertation, we accurately measured the electrical resistance of gap junctions in a single cell by circuit analysis and rectified the values of all the electrical elements in our previous model. The equivalent electrical circuit has for the first time become complete. The results also show that gap junctions in Aedes Malpighian tubules are impermeable to the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH, sensitive to the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol, while not so sensitive to elevated intracellular [Ca 2 +]...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular ion {{and volume}} {{homeostasis}} {{is fundamental to}} epithelial cells during water and solute transport. When homeostasis is disrupted, it may result in pathological consequences, e. g. cystic fibrosis. We use Rhodnius prolixus Malpighian tubules as a model epithelium to study the mechanisms of intracellular homeostasis in epithelial cells. Previously published research indicates that intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +) signal {{may be involved in}} the intracellular homeostasis in some vertebrate epithelia by mediating the crosstalk between ion transporters. In this thesis, (I) we investigate if Ca 2 + oscillations are part of crosstalk mechanism between apical and basolateral membrane transporters and, (II) use mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics to decipher proteins involved in crosstalk mechanism. Calcium imaging experiments revealed that the amplitude and the frequency of the intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations displayed by <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> correlated with the fluid transport rate. As the transport rate decreased with increasing concentration of the transport blocker, bumetanide, the Ca 2 + oscillations displayed smaller amplitudes and frequency. Similarly, changes in transcellular potassium (K+) flux, while maintaining constant fluidsecretion rate, caused a concentration-dependent decrease in amplitude and frequency of Ca 2 +oscillations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Ca 2 + oscillations may code information on ion transport flux that could {{be a part of the}} crosstalk mechanism. To further test the role of Ca 2 + in regulating intracellular ion homeostasis, we measured intracellular potassium using imaging. Our results show that inhibiting intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations blocked the ability of the tubule cells to maintain a constant intracellular K+ concentration after the cells were experimentally forced to instantaneously reduce transcellular K+ flux. This indicates that in the absence of Ca 2 + oscillations, the cells are unable to maintain intracellular K+ homeostasis, suggesting that Ca 2 + may be involved in regulating the ability of apical and basolateral transporters to crosstalk. We induced diuresis with serotonin to simulate crosstalk, which is fundamental to diuresis. MS-based proteomics were used to compare serotonin-stimulated samples with control. The results revealed several proteins of interest with a change in the proteome profile, suggesting a potential involvement in crosstalk mechanism. Of these proteins, we validated the roles of WNK and CAMKII, using conventional techniques. Inhibition of WNK significantly reduced fluid transport and reduced amplitude and frequency of Ca 2 + oscillations in a dose dependent manner. Whereas, inhibition of CAMKII significantly reduced fluid transport but failed to affect the cell’s ability to keep an internal ion homeostasis with low K+ challenge. This suggests that the WNK pathway may be fundamental to the crosstalk mechanism, whereas CAMKII might not be involved. In conclusion, there exists a crosstalk mechanism between basolateral and apical membranes of R. prolixus Malpighian tubule that is mediated through Ca 2 + oscillations. MS global proteomic profiling has revealed novel machinery that may be involved in ion transport and be potential markers for crosstalk. However, proteins identified must be further investigated for their physiological role in crosstalk...|$|R
40|$|Stimulation {{of urine}} {{production}} by the Malpighian (renal) tubules in Rhodnius prolixus is regulated {{by at least}} two diuretic hormones, CRF-related peptide and serotonin, that have traditionally been believed to function through the activation of cAMP-mediated intracellular second messenger pathways. In this study I demonstrate that serotonin stimulation triggered, in addition to cAMP, intracellular Ca 2 + waves in the <b>Malpighian</b> tubule <b>cells</b> of R. prolixus. Treatment with the intracellular Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA-AM blocked the intracellular Ca 2 + waves and reduced serotonin-stimulated fluid secretion by 75 %. This suggests a role for intracellular Ca 2 + signaling in the excretory system of R. prolixus. Serotonin stimulated Malpighian tubules (MTs) exposed to Ca 2 +-free saline plus BAPTA-AM secreted an abnormal fluid, showing: increased K+ concentration, reduced Na+ concentration and lower pH. These results along with measurement of transepithelial potential (TEP) suggest that the basolateral Na+:K+: 2 Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) activity is reduced in tubule cells treated with BAPTA-AM, suggesting that Ca 2 + is required to modulate {{the activity of the}} basolateral NKCC. 	Treatment with the non-hydrolysable cell-permeable cAMP analog, 8 Br-cAMP, produced fluid with the same K+ and Na+ concentration and at the same secretion rate as serotonin-stimulated tubules. In addition, 8 Br-cAMP triggered intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations similar to those obtained with serotonin. 8 Br-cAMP-stimulated tubules treated with BAPTA-AM decreased their fluid secretion by about 40 % and increased Na+ concentration, similar to the effect observed on serotonin-stimulated tubules. Therefore, I conclude that the intracellular Ca 2 + waves triggered by serotonin are mediated by cAMP. 	The role of inositol- 3 -phospate (InsP 3) in Ca 2 + release was tested by treating the tubules with the InsP 3 receptor blocker xestospongin. The treatment decreased fluid secretion rate as well as the amplitude of Ca 2 + waves in serotonin-stimulated tubules. These results suggest that serotonin activates the production of InsP 3 and, most likely, diacylglycerol (DAG). Thus, I decided to test whether the protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in serotonin-stimulated secretion. 	The PKC inhibitors chelerythrine and bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) decreased secretion fluid rate in serotonin-stimulated tubules by 50 % and 70 %, respectively. Fluid secreted by tubules treated with BIM showed no differences in K+ and Na+ concentrations compared to controls, however both ion fluxes decreased. The evidence suggests that PKC is involved in serotonin stimulated secretion; the mechanism is still not understood. Taken together, the results suggest that cAMP, Ca 2 + and PLC-PKC pathway are involved in serotonin stimulated secretion. However cAMP stimulation is enough for maximal secretion rate. Therefore PLC-PKC must act downstream of cAMP. Based on those results we hypothesize that serotonin binds a GPCR, increasing cAMP by activation of an adenylate cyclase (AC). Subsequently, cAMP is somehow able to activate PLC, which finally produces Ca 2 + release, PKC activation and NKCC upregulation...|$|R
40|$|Insects {{are highly}} {{successful}} and their large numbers lead to economic loss through crop damage and disease transmission. Insecticides provide {{a valuable tool}} for control of insect populations. However, as resistance is increasing to existing products, new modes of action are required {{for the development of}} novel products. Understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying stress resistance in insects may provide insight into new potential insecticide targets. Malpighian tubules are critical for epithelial fluid transport and xenobiotic tolerance in insects. The function of Malpighian tubules in desiccation stress tolerance was explored by examining changes in gene expression, protein levels, fluid transport rates, and metabolism following stress exposure. The results indicate a reduction in secretion rate during desiccation that is reflected in accumulation of metabolites that are normally processed and excreted by the tubules. Moreover, the involvement of Drosophila melanogaster diuretic hormones corticotrophin releasing factor-like (DH 44) and leucokinin (LK) were examined using genetic manipulations based on the GAL 4 -UAS system. Highly selective manipulation of the DH 44 -producing neurons via knockdown of DH 44 and neuronal ablation indicates that suppression of DH 44 signalling contributes to desiccation tolerance. This result is supported by the finding that knockdown of DH 44 receptor 2 in the <b>Malpighian</b> tubule principal <b>cells</b> improves survival during desiccation stress. Previous work suggests the possibility of interaction between LK and DH 44 signalling as LK receptor (LKR) is colocalised to the DH 44 neurons. This hypothesis is supported by {{the results of this study}} as selective knockdown of LKR and DH 44 in the DH 44 neurons produced opposing effects on desiccation tolerance. Moreover, knockdown of DH 44 in the DH 44 neurons or ablation of these neurons resulted in significantly decreased LKR expression in the Malpighian tubules. Finally, a novel role for the Malpighian tubules in starvation tolerance was uncovered by the study, with LKR gene expression increasing significantly following starvation. Knockdowns of either DH 44 -R 2 or LKR in the Malpighian tubules significantly impaired starvation tolerance. Here, a mechanism for this role of renal epithelia in starvation tolerance is proposed...|$|R
