The development of the code for coastal applications is described, followed by an evaluation of its performance against four test cases representing a variety of flooding problems at different scales.

40|$|Metallic {{copper alloys}} have {{recently}} attracted attention {{as a new}} antimicrobial weapon for areas where surface hygiene is paramount. Currently it is not understood on a molecular level how metallic copper kills microbes, but previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} a wide variety of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile, are inactivated within <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> a <b>few</b> hours of exposure. In this study, we show that bacteria isolated from copper alloy coins comprise strains that are especially resistant against the toxic properties exerted by dry metallic copper surfaces. The most resistant of 294 isolates were Gram-positive staphylococci and micrococci, Kocuria palustris, and Brachybacterium conglomeratum but also included the proteobacterial species Sphingomonas panni and Pseudomonas oleovorans. Cells of some of these bacterial strains survived on copper surfaces for 48 h or more. Remarkably, when these dry-surface-resistant strains were exposed to moist copper surfaces, resistance levels were close to those of control strains and MICs for copper ions were at or below control strain levels. This suggests that mechanisms conferring resistance against dry metallic copper surfaces in these newly isolated bacterial strains are different from well-characterized copper ion detoxification systems. Furthermore, staphylococci on coins did not exhibit increased levels of resistance to antibiotics, arguing against coselection with copper surface resistance traits...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s decade {{there has}} been a sharp {{increase}} in the research for the development of new techniques for the remediation of contaminates sites, because one after another country realized that the economic budget that would require the recovery of all these sites is simply unaffordable. Most countries have developed criteria to prioritize the remediation of those sites that were bearing the most severe risks for humans or the environment. Also an important effort has been done in order to make available new techniques more economic. Regarding both, the risk assessment and the development of new techniques, the most typical research approaches at the lab-scale are either the use of an already contaminated soil or the use of a model soil in which the contaminant is spiked. In the first case, the complexity of the soil matrix makes the derivation of conclusions applicable to other soils quite difficult. In the second case, the simplicity of the soil matrix can make the results more reproducible at different labs, but may be also of limited interest for the real contaminated soils, since that simplicity will be found in very few real cases. Furthermore, the contact time between the contaminants and the real contaminated soils is usually larger than several months and can even be in the order of centuries. Obviously this contact time may not be used in the experiments at the lab scale. In these cases, typically, in the most favorable case, a series of experiments of different contact time are carried out, which range from some <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>few</b> hours to several days or even weeks. Then a comparison is made from which the conclusion is usually that a contact time of several hours <b>or</b> <b>few</b> days is large enough to assure that the different equilibria are reached. Nevertheless, it is also widely known that the transport of contaminants through the soil matrix can be very slow. Also that {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish between the pseudo-steady states that can control the partitioning between different soil compartments and the real thermodynamic partitioning. Thus, there is a clear lack of experimental results obtained for soils that are spiked with a certain contaminant and allowed a variable contact time (ageing) ranging from weeks to years. In this work we present the first results that we have obtained for a soil that presents a moderate background concentration of lead, and was spiked with an additional amount of lead nitrate. The mobility of lead is studied by the BCR sequential extraction procedure, which divides the lead concentration into three fractions (weak acid soluble, reducible and oxidizable), besides the residual fraction that is obtained to investigate the mass balance, and support the quality of the analysis. It has been shown in the literature that the BCR fractionation can be used, together with mathematical models, to do reliable predictions about the maximum removal yield that can be obtained from several remediation techniques, including the electrokinetic remediation. In this paper we present the results of an early stage of the ageing process. The electrokinetic experiment is performed in a duplicated lab column assay using a constant current density and the disposition of the two columns electrically in series, to allow the maximum reproducibility of the results. 12 th International Symposium on Electrokinetic Remediation, EREM 2013 Spanish Ministry of Innovation and the FEDER fund of the EU through the Research Project ERHMES, CTM 2012 - 16824 and the UE project Electroacross IRSES-GA- 2010 26928...|$|R
40|$|Most {{neuroscience}} cognitive experiments involve repeated {{presentations of}} various stimuli across several <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> a <b>few</b> hours. It {{has been observed}} that brain responses, even to the same stimulus, evolve {{over the course of}} the experiment. These changes in brain activation and connectivity are believed to be associated with learning and/or habituation. In this paper, we present two general approaches to modeling dynamic brain connectivity using electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded across replicated trials in an experiment. The first approach is the Markovian regime-switching vector autoregressive model (MS-VAR) which treats EEGs as realizations of an underlying brain process that switches between different states both within a trial and across trials in the entire experiment. The second is the slowly evolutionary locally stationary process (SEv-LSP) which characterizes the observed EEGs as a mixture of oscillatory activities at various frequency bands. The SEv-LSP model captures the dynamic nature of the amplitudes of the band-oscillations and cross-correlations between them. The MS-VAR model is able to capture abrupt changes in the dynamics while the SEv-LSP directly gives interpretable results. Moreover, it is nonparametric and hence does not suffer from model misspecification. For both of these models, time-evolving connectivity metrics in the frequency domain are derived from the model parameters for both functional and effective connectivity. We illustrate these two models for estimating cross-trial connectivity in selective attention using EEG data from an oddball paradigm auditory experiment where the goal is to characterize the evolution of brain responses to target stimuli and to standard tones presented randomly throughout the entire experiment. The results suggest dynamic changes in connectivity patterns over trials with inter-subject variability...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} problems of Artificial Insemination (AI) in Camelidae is its timing {{in relation to}} ovulation in the she-camel. The present article reviewed collection of semen, processing of semen, manipulation of the female and semen deposition technique in Camelidae species. Commonly, semen is collected by electroejaculation, artificial vagina (AV), flushing of the epididymus with saline solution, while the more accepted methods are the former two methods. Semen is usually used in raw condition or after extension, depending on the method of semen processing. In the fresh raw method, whole semen is used within <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> after <b>few</b> hours. Extension of the semen ejaculate is carried out by adding extenders and it is required in more efficient use of AI, in short-term preservation or liquid semen (within a <b>few</b> hours <b>or</b> days) and long-term preservation or frozen semen (months or years). In short-term preservation, semen is used extended under different temperatures (30, 25 or 4 oC). Long-term preservation is carried out by cryopreservation. Packaging methods such as pellets, ampoules or in plastic straws with different volumes (0. 25, 0. 5 or 4 ml) represent different freezing procedures. The quality and survival of spermatozoa of post-thaw semen are highly variable from one male to the other, even after using the same freezing technique. To ensure that the inseminated females ovulate, hormonal manipulation of ovarian activity is used such as the induction of follicular activity and ovulation, as well as, synchronization of these phases {{in a group of}} females. The best time for insemination can only be determined by ultrasonography and/or rectal palpation of the ovaries.
