5|$|The next morning, {{having won}} the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager {{to return to the}} offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being {{prepared}} for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He {{was standing in the doorway}} of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb</b> landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini's {{military}} experience is told {{in his work}} Diario di guerra. Overall, he totaled about nine months of active, front-line trench warfare. During this time, he contracted paratyphoid fever. His military exploits ended in 1917 when he was wounded accidentally by the explosion of a <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb</b> in his trench. He was left with at least 40 shards of metal in his body. He was discharged from the hospital in August 1917 and resumed his editor-in-chief position at his new paper, Il Popolo d'Italia. He wrote there positive articles about Czechoslovak Legions in Italy.|$|E
25|$|By day four, the {{battered}} division {{was too weak}} to make any attempt to reach the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, still existed as a unit; the others were just remnants and battalions in name only. The division, unable to do anything for the 2nd Battalion at the bridge, dug in, forming a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek with its base on the river. The remnants of the 10th and 156th battalions at Wolfheze began to fall back, but several elements were surrounded and captured. Some 150 men of 156th Battalion were pinned down just west of the Oosterbeek. These men broke out in the late afternoon, with 90 of them making it into the perimeter. At the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Frost finally made radio contact with the division and was told that reinforcement was doubtful. Shortly afterwards, Frost was injured by a <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb,</b> and command passed to Major Frederick Gough. Gough arranged a two-hour truce to evacuate his wounded (including Frost), who were taken into captivity. That night, some units managed to hold out for a while and several tried to break out towards Oosterbeek, but by 05:00 on day five, all resistance at the bridge had ceased.|$|E

500|$|At the bridge, Frost {{was finally}} able to make radio contact with his divisional {{commander}} and given the difficult news that reinforcement was doubtful. [...] Shortly afterwards at about 13:30, Frost was injured in the legs by a <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb.</b> Command passed to Major Gough but by late afternoon the position was becoming untenable. As fire took hold of many of the buildings in which the wounded were being treated, a two-hour truce was organised in the late afternoon. The wounded (including Frost) were taken into captivity. Overnight, a few units managed to hold out for a little longer and several groups tried to break out toward the Oosterbeek perimeter. While Major Hibbert was leading a group toward Oosterbeek, he was captured.|$|E
500|$|On 10 May 1940, the Germans {{launched}} their invasion of France and the Low Countries. That day Keith {{and her sister}} [...] escorted the light cruisers [...] and [...] as they carried bullion from the Dutch port of IJmuiden to the United Kingdom for safe-keeping. On 12 May, {{she returned to the}} Hook of Holland in the Netherlands to evacuate Allied troops. After the destroyer [...] had to be run aground on 19 May after she was damaged by German aircraft, she was scuttled by Keith. On 21 May, Keith was one of three destroyers that evacuated 468 civilians from France. Two days later the ship was in Boulogne-sur-Mer, loading British troops to be evacuated, when she was attacked by German troops. She was hit by a <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb</b> and machine gun fire that killed her captain and wounded many others. Keith sailed for the UK immediately afterwards.|$|E
500|$|... "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{has strong}} autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway {{signed on as}} a member of the Red Cross at age 19, [...] and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an {{ambulance}} driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: [...] "I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments". A few days later, on July8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb</b> exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula—a trip that became the inspiration for [...] "Big Two-Hearted River". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed—leaving Nick alone in the woods.|$|E

500|$|Jefferis {{took the}} {{prototype}} Baby Bombard apart {{on the floor}} of his office in MD1 and rebuilt it, and then combined it with a hollow-charge <b>mortar</b> <b>bomb</b> to create what he called the 'Jefferis Shoulder Gun'. Jefferis then had a small number of prototype armour-piercing HEAT rounds made, and took the weapon to be tested at the Small Arms School at Bisley. A Warrant Officer took the Shoulder Gun down to a firing range, aimed it at an armoured target, and pulled the trigger; the Shoulder Gun pierced a hole in the target, but unfortunately also wounded the Warrant Officer when a piece of metal from the exploding round flew back and hit him. Jefferis himself then took the place of the Warrant Officer and fired off several more rounds, all of which pierced the armoured target but without wounding him. [...] Impressed with the weapon, the Ordnance Board of the Small Arms School had the faults with the ammunition corrected, renamed the Shoulder Gun as the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank, and ordered that it be issued to infantry units as a hand-held anti-tank weapon. Production of the PIAT began at the end of August 1942.|$|E
