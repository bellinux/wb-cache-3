5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex {{is the same as the}} total amount of enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply that <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon {{and out of}} contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark {{energy in the form}} of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the later}} 1890s, Carte's health was in decline, and Helen assumed <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{responsibilities}} for the opera company. She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies. In 1894, Carte had hired his son, Rupert, as an assistant. While Carte was ill, in 1897, Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and W. S. Gilbert {{with the first}} revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy. The Savoy put {{on a number of}} shows for comparatively short runs during this period, including Sullivan's The Beauty Stone, which ran for only 50 performances, in 1898. In 1899, Carte finally had a new success with Sullivan and Basil Hood's The Rose of Persia, which ran for 213 performances. Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of the next piece by Hood, The Emerald Isle, for which Edward German completed Sullivan's unfinished score.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{population}} growth in southern Buckinghamshire caused by the railway, Chesham remained relatively unaffected by development. Although there was extensive development in Chesham Bois, roughly halfway between Chesham and Amersham, between 1889 and 1925 the population of Chesham itself grew by less than 2,000, and between 1925 and 1935—the peak of the Metro-land boom—by only 225. Between 1921 and 1928 the season ticket revenue from Amersham and Chalfont& Latimer stations rose by 134%; that from Chesham by only 6.7%. Although the MR owned large tracts of land around Chesham, bought {{in anticipation of a}} revival of the LNWR connection scheme, Selbie chose not to build a housing estate on the site, instead selling much of it to the local council. By this time, service on the Chesham branch was of a relatively poor quality. Improvements to the central London section and the prioritisation of the Aylesbury line had led to ageing surplus stock often being used on the Chesham branch, and the partial electrification caused delays at Rickmansworth as steam locomotives were coupled and uncoupled. As the branch was mainly operated as a shuttle service passengers to and from Chesham were obliged to wait at Chalfont& Latimer station. This had been built to serve a lightly populated area, but the Metro-land development had caused a much larger number of users than it had been designed for, and it had few waiting facilities, poor lighting, inadequate shelter, and dirty toilets. As Amersham grew, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trains which had previously run direct from London to Chesham instead ran to Amersham, causing further crowding as passengers waited for the shuttle service at Chalfont& Latimer. Improving road transport caused an increasing number of commuters to abandon the Chesham line, which in turn prompted the MR to further reduce passenger services.|$|E

Civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production.

Isotope analysis of the bones of inhabitants shows that marine food sources supplied <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet of the Norse Greenlanders, making up between 50% and 80% of their diet by the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|In Louisiana, the Atchafalaya River is an {{important}} distributary of the Mississippi River.

The Old River Control Structure, a dam which regulates the outflow from the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya, was completed in 1963. It is intended to prevent the Atchafalaya from capturing the main flow of the Mississippi and stranding the ports of Baton Rouge and New Orleans.|$|E

25|$|The {{sewing machine}} was {{introduced}} in 1846, and provided an alternative method for the mechanization of shoemaking. By the late 1850s, the industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory, mainly in the US and areas of England. A shoe stitching machine was invented by the American Lyman Blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864. Entering into partnership with McKay, his device {{became known as the}} McKay stitching machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout New England. As bottlenecks opened up in the production line due to these innovations, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing stages, such as pegging and finishing, became automated. By the 1890s, the process of mechanisation was largely complete.|$|E

The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping, and was published by Ron G. Mason and co-workers in 1961, who did not find, though, an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading, like Vine, Matthews and Morley a few years later.|$|E
