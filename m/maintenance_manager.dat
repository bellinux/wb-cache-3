25|$|A {{recently}} completed Spirit reproduction, intended for airworthiness {{is owned by}} the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (ORA), fulfilling a lifelong dream of its primary founder, Cole Palen (1925–1993). The reproduction project had been started by Cole before his own death, and has mostly been subsequently built by former ORA pilot and current vintage aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>manager</b> Ken Cassens, receiving its wing covering, completed with doped fabric in 2015. A restored Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial was obtained by Palen in the 1970s for the project's start, with original, and still functional 1920s-era flight instruments being incorporated — including the same basic type of earth inductor compass used by Lindbergh — matching the ones in the original Spirit at the NASM, with the goal of becoming the most authentic airworthy reproduction of the Spirit yet built.|$|E
25|$|Colegio also owned two homes. Directly behind Huelga Hall was the Art Building. The Art Building was {{a two-story}} farm {{house in the}} Victorian style. It had {{been built in the}} mid-1900s by the Bernt family of Mt. Angel. When Mount Angel College took {{possession}} of the Bernt house, it was renamed Studio San Benito. Under Colegio's ownership, the house was referred to as the Art Building. The Art Building lay vacant and unused for most of Colegio's existence until when in 1980 it was occupied by the family of Arthur Omar Olivo. Mr. Olivo was the grounds keeper and facilities <b>maintenance</b> <b>manager</b> of Colegio César Chávez. After a falling out with Colegio president Irma Gonzales, the Olivo family vacated the Art Building in 1982 shortly before Colegio's closure. Beside the Art House stood another two-story house that was referred to as the Pottery Building. Both the Pottery Building and the Art Building were demolished in the mid-1980s.|$|E

30|$|Maintenance {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} issues in the manufacturing industry due to high costs involved (Savsar 2011). In production systems, <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> concentrate on reducing maintenance costs (Cavalcante and De Almedia 2008). In manufacturing organizations, maintenance-related costs are estimated to be 25 % of the overall operating cost (Cross 1988). According to Maggard and Rhyne (1992), the maintenance can represent between 10 % and 40 % of the production cost in a company. Coetzee (2004) means that the numbers should be 15 % to 50 %. Bevilacqua and Braglia (2000) state that maintenance costs can represent as much as 15 % to 70 % of the total production cost. So, it seems plausible that the maintenance costs may very well represent over 15 % of the total production cost in industry (Salonen and Deleryd 2011). These findings show that maintenance cost cannot be ignored by <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers.</b>|$|R

The results indicates that TDNNs may train more efficiently when robust training techniques are used but offer few other advantages unless temporal information is necessary for the prediction of sensor signals. 1. 0 Introduction Industries find it difficult or impossible to detect small drifts in sensor instrumentation without taking the syste [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> find it {{difficult}} to justify investments in maintenance improvement initiatives. In part, this is due to a tendency by mine <b>managers</b> to regard <b>maintenance</b> purely as a cost centre, and not as a process able to influence productive capacity and profit. It is also hindered by a lack of alignment between commonly used maintenance performance measures and key business drivers, and the lack of formal business training amongst maintenance professionals. With this in mind, a model to assist <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> in evaluating the benefits of maintenance improvement projects was recently formulated. The model considers four cost saving dimensions. These are: 1. reduction in the cost of unplanned repairs and maintenance, 2. increased or accelerated production and/or sales, 3. spares inventory reduction, and 4. reduction in over-investment in physical assets and operating costs. This paper discusses the application of this model and a number of numerical examples are given to justify investments in maintenance improvement projects having varying objectives...|$|R
40|$|Scheduling {{of winter}} {{maintenance}} operations such as plowing or salting {{is a difficult}} and complex problem. Proper selection and timing of such operations is critical to their effectiveness, however scheduling decisions must often be made with strict time and resource limitations imposed upon them. A decision support system which analyses current road conditions and makes scheduling suggestions based on them would be a valuable step toward {{improving the quality of}} treatment, while simultaneously reducing the burden of scheduling on <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers.</b> This thesis proposes a real-time scheduling model based on an Operations Research framework that can be used by <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> to develop and evaluate alternative resources allocation plans for winter road maintenance operations. The scheduling model is implemented as an Integer Linear Program and is solved using off-the-shelf software packages. The scheduling model takes into account a wide range of road and weather condition factors such as road network topology, road class, weather forecasts, and contractual service levels, and produces a vehicle dispatch schedule that is optimal with respect to operating costs and quality of service. A number of heuristics are also explored to aid in efficient approximations to this problem...|$|R
30|$|In most cases, when <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> try to {{determine}} the best policy for their systems, they only consider the cost criterion as the most important and the only criterion to be taken into account. This is a very dangerous point of view (Faghihinia and Mollaverdi 2012). Generally, the most important focus of the current study is to quantify epistemic uncertainty in maintenance engineering models and repair, particularly to be used in multidisciplinary systems and to apply it for design optimization.|$|R

The investigation revealed that the previous windscreen had been fitted with incorrect bolts, which had been replaced on a [...] "like for like" [...] basis by the shift <b>maintenance</b> <b>manager</b> without reference to the maintenance documentation, in order to save time as the plane was due to take off soon and there was a tight schedule. The air pressure difference between the cabin and the outside during the flight proved to be too much, leading to the failure of the windscreen. The incident also brought to attention a design flaw in the aircraft of the windscreen being secured from the outside of the aircraft, putting a greater pressure on the bolts than if they were secured from the inside.|$|E

30|$|In this study, an {{enhanced}} multi-objective maintenance workforce optimisation model for maintenance workforce planning problem is presented. The presented model {{made use of}} an FGP-cum-DE approach. The FGP-cum-DE approach addresses the problem of incorporating decision-makers’ opinions with respect to model objective function into an optimisation model. Based on a selected model from literature, the FGP-cum-DE approach generated satisfactory results for maintenance workforce reliability, efficiency, availability and quality of work done when tested with data from a brewery plant. This assertion {{was based on a}} comparative analysis of DE algorithm performance with those of GA and PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the FGP-cum-DE approach application can be easily be integrated into an existing optimisation model that is multi-objective. The method proposed in the current report probably will create an avenue for enhancing the decision-making capabilities of <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> as information on the workforce planning is obtained in advance. So, the manager has a good control of budgetary plans and implementation. The built-up framework also provides a chance for <b>maintenance</b> <b>managers</b> to enhance their hiring and firing decision-making abilities, by hunting for candidates with the highest potentials of “return-on-investment”. Employment of such candidates potentially puts the organisation at a technological advantage and a good chance to survive in these turbulent business times.|$|R
