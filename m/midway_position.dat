60|$|Chad Cranage {{looks like}} quite a new {{acquaintance}} to-day, for {{he has got}} his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with which the big saucy fellow {{took off his hat}} and stroked his hair to the farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was, after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off, as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a <b>midway</b> <b>position,</b> sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude--that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased, and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.|$|E

40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) {{studies were}} carried out on the failure surface of {{syntactic}} foam material tested in a short beam three point bend test (SBT) by employing 21 × 15 × 3 mm^ 3 dimension bearing specimens. The syntactic foams were fabricated using glass microballoons in epoxy binder. The failure of the tensile, compression, and shear dominated regions were studied by SEM at different magnifications. The tensile region had characteristic features, such as partial debonding of the microballoons from the matrix and cracking of glass microballoons, apart from matrix cracking and some river pattern features. The compression side was characterized by crushing and collapsing of microballoons, resulting in accumulation of debris with no apparent river pattern for matrix-rich regions. The <b>midway</b> <b>positions</b> of the SBT failed surface comprised of deformation bands in the matrix and occasional debonding of microballoons. The morphology recorded in the tensile and compression regions corroborated well with the results obtained on these foam samples in those specimens that were subjected to pure uniaxial tension and compression, respectively...|$|R

50|$|Later, upon more reflection, some liturgical {{aspects of}} {{iconographic}} nature {{as well as}} other previously abolished traditions of church life were reintroduced (such as the Christmas Feast Day). On the occasion of the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, where Luther's followers presented the Augsburg Confession, theologians from Strasbourg, Bucer and Capito, authored the Tetrapolitan Confession, adopted by the cities of Constance, Lindau, Memmingen, and Strasbourg. The Church of Strasbourg adopted this confession and developed a theology midway between Zwinglian symbolism and the Lutheran conception of Holy Communion. This <b>midway</b> <b>position</b> was of a moderate and diaconal nature, and quite characteristic of the Reformation along the Rhine.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{fallacious}} use of the argument to moderation would be to regard two opposed arguments—one person saying that slavery is always wrong, while another believes it to be legitimate—and conclude that the truth must therefore lie somewhere in between. One could imagine a society that accepts a <b>midway</b> <b>position</b> between slavery and non-slavery as truth using the argument to moderation, and its only the cultural values of freedom and decency and the like, that would object. If these values didn't exist then the culture might find the middle ground true. There are also examples where both arguments can be sound, but instilled with differing goals or even misinformation.|$|E

Most {{of the papers}} were published between 1981 and 2000 in European journals such as Dialectica, Logique et Analyse, and Erkenntnis. The papers stand alone, yet throughout the book an overarching view {{of the relationship between}} pragmatics and semantics transpires clearly. Callaway defends a <b>midway</b> <b>position</b> between American analytic philosophy and American pragmatism. The result is a blend of Quine's scientific philosophy and Dewey's social pragmatism.

40|$|The {{creation}} of a new ministry of population by the Federal Government is most opportune. Australia stands at a turning point in its demographic development and it is crucial that a vision of our future population is developed which takes full account of the best scientific and policy thinking and knowledge but which is also inclusive of the wishes and opinions of all Australians. The population and immigration debates in Australia have too often been dominated by interest groups and focused on extreme positions. On the one hand are those who believe Australia should increase its population as rapidly as possible and strive to attain a population of more than double current size. On the other are some extreme environmentalists who argue for an immediate cessation of population growth. Both of these extreme positions would have negative consequences for Australia and most Australians. What is needed is a <b>midway</b> <b>position,</b> which involves growth as well as sustainability. Graeme Hugo[URL]...|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} {{philosophy}} has been unique among the humanities for seeking closer alliance with the sciences. In this Article I examine the place of science in relation to legal positivism. I argue that, historically, legal positivism has been advanced by theorists who were also positivists in the sense the term {{is used in the}} philosophy of social science: they were committed to the idea that the explanation of social phenomena should be conducted using similar methods to those used in the natural sciences. I then argue that since around 1960 jurisprudence, and legal positivism in particular, has undergone change toward anti-positivism. Central to this trend has been the idea that proper jurisprudential inquiry must be conducted from the 2 ̆ 2 internal point of view. 2 ̆ 2 This view amounted to an attempt to combine a scientific-like aim of neutral description with a humanistic method of inquiry. It thus did not entirely abandon its links with scientific inquiry, but it has radically changed their nature. I show that this stance has had a negative impact of narrowing both the range of issues discussed and the kind of method considered appropriate for discussing these questions. I then argue that to counter these isolationist trends jurisprudence would benefit from reorientation of its <b>midway</b> <b>position</b> between science and the humanities in the opposite direction. its aims should be those traditionally associated with the humanities but it should try to bring new insight to these questions with a methodology much closer to that of the sciences...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—It {{is shown}} in this paper that the optimum {{position}} of interleaved repeaters for minimum delay and noise is not the midpoint as commonly practiced. A closed-form solution for the optimum position has been derived in this paper and verified by simulation. Bidirectional buses with the optimum interleaved repeater position are compared to commonly used bidirectional buses and shown to provide an improvement greater than 50 % in the propagation delay and bit-rate per unit area. The area of the induced noise pulse on victim lines is shown to be zero indicating that the aggressor lines are virtually static with the optimum repeater position. The presented optimum repeater positioning also provides lower noise pulse amplitude as well as lower sensitivity of propagation delay and noise pulse peak to segment length variation, compared to commonly used <b>midway</b> repeater <b>positioning.</b> Index Terms—Bidirectional buses, coupling capacitance, delay, interleaved repeaters, noise, on-chip buses, repeater insertion, signal integrity.
