5000|$|... 332P/Ikeya-Murakami (P/2010 V1) is a short-period comet with {{period of}} {{approximately}} 5.4 years first identified independently {{by the two}} Japanese amateur astronomers Kaoru Ikeya and Shigeki Murakami on November 3, 2010. Ikeya identified the comet using a 25-centimeter (10-inch) reflector at 39×, while Murakami used a 46 cm (18-inch) reflector at 78×. Photographic confirmation of the comet was obtained by Ernesto Guido and Giovanni Sostero using a Global-Rent-a-Scope (GRAS) telescope in New Mexico. Both Ikeya and Murakami discovered the comet using <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> through optical telescopes. Such visual discoveries have become rare in recent years.|$|E

The Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory is (as of 2007) the only National Historic Landmark in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in Japan, Italy, Russia, and the United States gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from satellites, to determine polar motion; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites.

50|$|The S-300 (NATO {{reporting}} name SA-10 Grumble) is {{a series}} of initially Soviet and later Russian long range surface-to-air missile systems produced by NPO Almaz, based on the initial S-300P version. The S-300 system was developed to defend against aircraft and cruise missiles for the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Subsequent variations were developed to intercept ballistic missiles.The S-300 system was first deployed by the Soviet Union in 1979, designed for the air defence of large industrial and administrative facilities, military bases and control of airspace against enemy strike aircraft. The system is fully automated, though <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> and operation are also possible. Components may be near the central command post, or as distant as 40 km. Each radar provides target designation for the central command post. The command post compares the data received from the targeting radars up to 80 km apart, filtering false targets, a difficult task at such great distances. The central command post features both active and passive target detection modes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, manual {{observations}} sequence {{has been}} gradually replaced by automatic observation sequence. The difference between <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> sequence and automatic observation sequence is somewhat inevitable. This challenges the homogeneity and {{the continuity of}} historical weather data, and influences atmospheric researches and applications. Therefore, based on {{the understanding of the}} influence caused by the two observation sequences, how to modify the data of <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> sequence to automatic observation sequence has become a problem. In this paper, a model, which modifies the wind speed data of <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> suquence to automatic observation sequence, is established using the wavelet neural network (WNN). The proposed model achieves 13. 38 % in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to automatic observation data sequence.

40|$|Based on {{the data}} from both {{automatic}} and manual meteorological observation in 700 stations of China from 2001 to 2005, analyses have been made on the differences of automatic and <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> in temperature, pressure, relative humidity, ground surface temperature, wind direction and velocity, and precipitation, together with the difference, percentage error and matching rate of wind directions between the two kinds of observation. The differences of all the elements have been studied to get the distribution feature in China and the possible influence of automatic temperature observation on the continuity of temperature data has been tested. The results show that there exists certain difference between automatic and manual meteorological observation, but in most areas the differences of all elements are accepted due to the error range of automatic stations. Many factors may cause the differences, including the flaw of instruments and different observational methods. The differences of all elements are distributed variously in the whole country. Even the difference of the same element may vary on different climatic conditions. The time series of auto and <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> {{still need to be}} further tested to identify significant difference and make homogeneous correction if there is any, to make the data of auto and <b>manual</b> <b>observation</b> valid in use.

In planning the transition from <b>manual</b> <b>observations</b> by human observers {{to the use of}} instrumented readings, either as an aid to or as a replacement of <b>manual</b> <b>observations,</b> the representativeness of instrumented readings vis-à-vis those of human observers and the assurance of continuity of the climatological records are two major challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges were dealt with in the introduction of instruments for visibility observations at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) {{in the past several years}}. HKIA is located in a coastal environment with complex terrain in the vicinity. Apart from being an aeronautical meteorological station for issuing METARs in support of civil aviation, the airport meteorological office at HKIA also serves as the SYNOP station in Hong Kong. A dense network of six forward scatterers was installed along the two runways in HKIA in 2002 and the readings have been operationally used for both METAR and SYNOP reporting since late 2004.

The change from <b>manual</b> <b>observations</b> to automatic weather stations is a major non-climatic change in the climate record.
