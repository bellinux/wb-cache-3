The works were revisited as exact duplicates {{rather than the}} more standard distanced revisitation. This choice of exact duplication contrary to popular practice intrigued Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein liked this quality of his paintings within his paintings, saying [...] "I like {{the combination of a}} very separate quality that each of <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> has within the painting, and the fact that everything works as one painting too." [...] In fact, Lichtenstein commented on this as an attempt to eliminate any modulation: ...|$|E

He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.'

500|$|McCartney became {{interested}} in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted {{in his hometown of}} Liverpool. McCartney said, [...] "I've been offered an exhibition of <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing for the New Statesman and Nation, Raymond Mortimer {{wrote that}} the panels [...] "seems served from Picasso's Crucifixion , but further distorted, with ostrich necks and button heads {{protruding}} from bags—the whole effect gloomily phallic, like Bosch without the humour. These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence." ...|$|E

[...] Of his own work, the artist says, [...] "I suppose, that’s what <b>my</b> <b>painting’s</b> about; life itself is terribly dangerous, terribly cruel, terribly rewarding.

I initiate a discussion with nature by bringing the canvas outside and painting fleeting shadows projected onto the canvas. Although <b>my</b> first four <b>paintings</b> stopped here, the more recent paintings were then brought into the studio, where it was my challenge to formally transform the layered tracings into paintings.

40|$|<b>My</b> oil <b>paintings,</b> glass works, {{and mixed}} media are {{abstract}} meditations on familial relationships and their boundaries. The interaction between colors and layers of pigment reference human interaction. I apply veils of colors, which obscure, alter, or blend into previous layers of color. These layers metaphorically reference how family relationships affect the person {{we are and}} influence who we become. I approach <b>my</b> oil <b>paintings</b> serially and often {{refer to them as}} sisters or a family. I often work on two or more canvases at a time allowing each painting to share palettes and a similar language of shapes. When I work this way, it allows me to explore different responses to an experience. The interaction of the paint embodies struggle, and new shapes and shades of color emerge as the boundaries of painted areas are dissolved or declared. I also layer color and pigment in <b>my</b> glass <b>paintings.</b> Here, I place finely ground colored glass onto clear glass sheets, then fire it, rework it, and fire it again. Reworking the glass allows me to build a history of layers, which I relate to the way that a person carries around a history of experiences. Lastly, in my prints, I use multiple stencils to apply layers of ink to conceal or reveal the history of the work and reference the ever-changing nature of relationships. This dance of emergence and disappearance of color relates to the forced kinship of family and calls to mind the levels in relationships we build with people, consciously or not...|$|R
2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had better {{things to say about}} it than the people who looked at <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> had to say about my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly to {{many other}} {{contemporary}} Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by Mexicanidad, a romantic nationalism that had developed {{in the aftermath of}} the revolution. The Mexicanidad movement claimed to resist the [...] "mindset of cultural inferiority" [...] created by colonialism, and placed special importance on indigenous cultures. Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture — a mixture of indigenous and European elements — was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate. Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished [...] "to be worthy, with <b>my</b> <b>paintings,</b> of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me". To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school. Instead, she cultivated an image of herself as a [...] "self-taught and naive artist".|$|E
2500|$|Koger and Postuma sanded Clapton's 1964 SG Standard (not, as {{is found}} in various sources, a 1961 model, and not an SG Special) and painted it with {{oil-based}} enamel paint in the [...] "gaudy dayglo colours of the day." [...] As Koger explained, [...] "the single thread running through all of <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> is nostalgia for paradise." [...] The theme of the SG's design is [...] "good versus evil, heaven versus hell, {{and the power of}} music in the universe to rise above it all as a force of good". The centrepiece on the face is a cherub holding a triangle, surrounded by yellow stars on a celestial blue background ("a Fool hallmark"). The angel's curly hairstyle was inspired by Clapton's hairstyle at the time. Flames come up {{from the bottom of the}} guitar (the bass-bout with the volume and tone controls) and the treble point has rainbow-coloured arcs.

40|$|The {{journey of}} this {{research}} began with exploring the notion of invisible space which cannot be perceived by the human eye, {{and the process of}} image visualisation expressed through <b>my</b> abstract <b>paintings,</b> which is supported by my theoretical research. ‘Invisible Space’, the title of one of <b>my</b> recent <b>paintings,</b> evokes the notion of a very small space such as a cell or nerve tissues which form part of the human body and have the potential to simultaneously symbolise a cosmological space. In my practice, I adopt painting as a pertinent method to realise my subjects and motifs. I consider how my painting is situated in contemporary art theory and practice by exploring artists and writers relevant to my underlying concept. I explore how my subject is presented in painting and drawing, and how my research can be developed logically and systematically in response to my practice. In this report, I analyse the three key elements: 1) abstraction that explores macro & micro space; 2) colour experiments and 3) cultural traditions and gesture through Korean Monochrome painting...|$|R
2500|$|Rather than {{attempt to}} {{reproduce}} his subjects, Lichtenstein's work tackled {{the way in}} which the mass media portrays them. He would never take himself too seriously, however, saying: [...] "I think my work is different from comic strips -- but I wouldn't call it transformation; I don't think that whatever is meant by it is important to art." [...] When Lichtenstein's work was first exhibited, many art critics of the time challenged its originality. His work was harshly criticized as vulgar and empty. The title of a Life magazine article in 1964 asked, “Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?” Lichtenstein responded to such claims by offering responses such as the following: [...] "The closer my work is to the original, the more threatening and critical the content. However, my work is entirely transformed in that my purpose and perception are entirely different. I think <b>my</b> <b>paintings</b> are critically transformed, but it would be difficult to prove it by any rational line of argument." [...] He discussed experiencing this heavy criticism in an interview with April Bernard and Mimi Thompson in 1986. Suggesting that it was at times difficult to be criticized, Lichtenstein said, “I don’t doubt when I’m actually painting, it’s the criticism that makes you wonder, it does.” ...|$|E
