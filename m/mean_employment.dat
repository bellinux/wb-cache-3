At firms with offshore captive centers, the fraction of domestic workers employed in occupations requiring little personal input fell by over 8 % during the last decade, although <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> levels for these occupations was steady in firms that were not offshoring.

40|$|I {{show that}} a {{trade-off}} between inflation volatility and average unem-ployment arises in a New Keynesian model with search and matching fric-tions in the labor market. In this environment, unemployment rises more and faster in a recession than it decreases in an expansion. A monetary authority focused solely on stabilizing inflation exacerbates labor market volatility and leads to higher average unemployment. When the model is calibrated to the U. S. economy, the welfare gains of adopting the optimal policy rather than a policy of price stability {{are found to be}} substantial. Moreover, the bulk of those welfare gains arises from the increase in <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> achieved by the Ramsey policymaker. This result points to the importance of the asymmetric nature of unemployment fluctuations in shaping monetary policy trade-offs. The introduction of imperfect un-employment insurance does not change the results in a significant way...|$|E

40|$|We pool eight Spring QLFS {{quarters}} for 1992 - 1995 and 2000 - 2003 to examine female employment changes by ethnic group.

We show that qualifications have played an increasingly important role {{and there has been}} increased polarisation between the employment of women with a degree compared to those without. This is especially large for Pakistani/Bangladeshi women. Our decomposition analysis shows that employment changes between the early 1990 s and the 2000 s are mainly a consequence of changes in characteristics. However, decomposing white/non-white <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> differences demonstrates a fall in the unexplained discriminatory component for most ethnic groups.

40|$|We {{provide new}} {{evidence}} {{on the effectiveness of}} West German labour market programmes by evaluating training and employment programmes that have been conducted 2000 - 2002 after the first large reform of German labour market policy in 1998. We employ exceptionally rich administrative data that allow us to use microeconometric matching methods and to estimate interesting effects for different types of programmes and participants at a rather disaggregated level. We find that, on average, all programmes fail to improve their participants ’ chances of finding regular, unsubsidised employment. Rather, participants accumulate 2 - 13 more months of unemployment than nonparticipants over the 2. 5 years following programme start, which, in addition to direct programme costs, induces net costs in terms of benefit payments and wage subsidies amounting to, on average, 1500 - 7000 EUR per participant. However, we show that there is some scope for improvements in <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> rates as well as potential for considerable cost savings by a reallocation of participants and nonparticipants to the different programmes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} gross labour flows in a context where modeling the migration decision as a wage-maximizing process may be inadequate due to regional wage rigidities that result from central wage bargaining. In such a context, the framework that has been developed by Borjas et al. (1992) on the selectivity of internal migrants with respect to skills has to be extended to allow migrants to move to regions that best reward their skills {{in terms of both}} wages and employment. The extended framework predicts skilled workers to be disproportionately attracted to regions with higher mean wages and employment rates as well as higher regional wage and employment inequalities. Estimates from a labour flow fixed effects model and a GMM estimator show that these predictions hold, but only the effects for <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> rates and employment inequality are robust and significant. The paper may thus be able to explain why earlier attempts to explain skill selectivity in Europe within a pure wage-based approach failed to replicate the US results.

30|$|In any case, {{neither of}} the two {{alternative}} benefit regimes seems to cause a significant variation in employment stability. However, the results are significantly different for the final simulation, in which {{the gap between the}} probability of exiting to a permanent contract and the probability of exiting to a temporary contract, from either employment or unemployment, is decreased by 20  %. The large increase in employment stability and the decrease in job turnover induced by the increase in the probability of entering into a permanent contract are both notable. In this case, job stability increases by 10  % for young and middle-age workers and by 7  % for older workers. This increase in job stability is primarily related to lengthier employment spells and, to a lesser extent, to shorter unemployment episodes. In particular, <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> duration increases by 35, 36 and 23  % for young, middle-age and older workers, respectively. It is also notable that the growth in the share of workers that obtain permanent contracts increases from 47 to 79  %, from 36 to 77  % and from 34 to 71  %, respectively, for each age group.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} an {{analysis}} of the spatial job search patterns of black, white, and Latino workers in Los Angeles. We find that blacks and Latinos tend to search in areas where employment growth is low, whereas whites tend to search in areas where it is high. Moreover, over half of the mean racial and ethnic differences in the quality of spatial job search (as measured by <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> growth in areas searched) is explained by racial residential segregation. In addition, racial segregation is a more important explanation of racial differences in spatial job search quality than systematic differences in social networks and job search meth-ods, though these factors matter. Spatial job search quality has a positive and sig-nificant effect on the employment of whites and blacks, but not Latinos, and explains nearly 40 percent of the difference between white and black employment rates. These results are consistent with the existence of spatial mismatch in urban labor markets and imply that racial residential segregation limits the job opportu-nities of blacks, {{and to a lesser extent}} Latinos, in metropolitan areas. Key words: spatial mismatch, geographic job search, race...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze {{existing}} wage data to quantify the employment success of community and technical college graduates by program as an indicator of economic development in West Virginia. Data for the variables were obtained from archival databases and a cooperative agreement between state agencies. Descriptive statistics were utilized to examine employment rates, range of earnings, and employment in-industry of community and technical college graduates from 23 programs from 1997 to 2002. Graduates in the health fields demonstrated both the highest and lowest ratios of employment, with the <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> rate for all programs of 68. 12 percent. The average annual wage of all programs was $ 24, 993. 41, with six of the seven programs in the health professions reporting earnings over the mean.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the UK food manufacturing industry is highly fragmented and consists of some 5, 000 firms. Of these, however, the ten largest companies are estimated to account for one-third of all sales. The importance of the 100 largest private sector firms has traditionally been relatively high within the industry and in 1975, for example, they produced 55 per cent of the food sector's net output, compared with the 40 per cent provided by a similar sample in the total manufacturing sector. Similarly, evidence from both Ashby and Mordue demonstrates that during the 1970 s the average size of food manufacturers/processors overtook that of manufacturers as a whole in terms of numbers employed. By the same measure, businesses {{with more than one}} hundred employees continued to expand at a faster rate in food than the average for all manufacturers, so that the <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> size of these larger food enterprises in the late 1970 s was more than one-third greater than in all manufacturing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{burden of}} silicosis, {{pulmonary}} tuberculosis and COPD {{is described in}} 624 South African goldminers 18 months after cessation of work. METHODS: This was a prevalence study. Questionnaires were administered, and spirometry, chest radiography, tuberculosis investigations, and urine HIV antibody assays were performed. RESULTS: Attendance was 80. 1 % (624 / 779), mean age 49. 4 years, and <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> duration 25. 6 years. Most subjects had had medium (26. 5 %) or high (65. 4 %) dust-exposure jobs. Current smoking rate was 35 %, with ever smoking 61 %. HIV antibodies were detected in the urine in 22. 3 %. Prevalences were: silicosis 24. 6 %, past tuberculosis 26 %, current tuberculosis 6. 2 %, airflow obstruction 13. 4 % and chronic productive cough 17. 7 %. Almost 50 % of these miners {{had at least one}} of these respiratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: A heavy burden of silicosis, tuberculosis and COPD was present in this group of former goldminers.

30|$|A central {{conclusion}} {{from our}} simulation exercises {{is that when}} UIS entitlement duration drops, the overall time spent employed increases, but labour market turnover also coincidentally increases. Notably, the results on overall time spent employed are driven primarily by the drop in unemployment duration caused by shorter UIS benefit periods. For example, when the entitlement duration drops by 50  %, overall time spent employed increases by 0.67, 2.33 and 2.58  % for young, middle-age and older workers, respectively. Mean unemployment duration drops by approximately 5, 37 and 42  %, respectively, and <b>mean</b> <b>employment</b> duration decreases by approximately 0.57, 3 and 6  %, respectively. Thus, in this context, job turnover also increases. The number of unemployment spells increases by 1.4, 3.2 and 2.5  % for the respective age groups, whereas the number of job spells increases by 1.6, 4.6 and 3.5  %, respectively. Interestingly, when we dig deeper {{and look at the}} 25 th and 75 th percentiles, we observe that this gain in employment stability occurs primarily for low-stability workers. For these workers (those located below the 25 th percentile), employment stability increases by 2.86, 4.76 and 6.82  % for the respective age groups. Again, this increase in employment stability is driven primarily by a decrease in unemployment duration.|$|E
