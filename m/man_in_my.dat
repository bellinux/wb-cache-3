It marked {{the first of four}} consecutive ballads on that side, which some music critics objected to at the time. Never a fan of Harrison's solo work, Robert Christgau would comment on the album: [...] "Harrison sings as if he's doing sitar impressions, and four different people, including a little <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head who I never noticed before, have expressed intense gratitude when I turned the damned thing off during 'Be Here Now'." ...|$|E

500|$|Yancey, {{like most}} members of the planter class, was a strong believer in a {{personal}} code of honor. [...] In September 1838, Yancey returned for a brief return visit to Greenville. [...] A political slur by Yancey in a private conversation was overheard by a teenage relative of the aggrieved party. [...] Yancey was confronted by another relative (and his wife’s uncle), Dr. Robinson Earle. [...] Conversation turned to violence, and the always-armed Yancey ended up killing the doctor in a street brawl. [...] Yancey was tried and sentenced to a year in jail for manslaughter. [...] An unrepentant Yancey was pardoned after only a few months, but while incarcerated he wrote for his newspaper, [...] "Reared with the spirit of a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bosom — and taught to preserve inviolate my honor — my character, and my person, I have acted as such a spirit dictated." ...|$|E

She added, [...] "It's all about where I'm from and love of theater and love of music and love of the lie in art, and Steven really knows and understands that, [...] So we're making a beautiful video, and I'm so excited." [...] In May 2010, Gaga told The Times about the concept of the video: [...] " [...] purity of my friendships with my gay friends, and how I've been unable to find that with a straight <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. It's a celebration and an admiration of gay love—it confesses my envy of the courage and bravery they require to be together.

2500|$|The 1990 album Romantic? {{failed to}} sell and in 1992, Virgin Records {{cancelled}} the band's recording contract. This had a devastating effect on the band, causing Oakey to seek counselling for depression, and Sulley to have a breakdown. The emotional problems of the pair nearly caused the band to break up. Thanks mainly {{to the efforts of}} Catherall, by 1993 Oakey and Sulley had recovered and the band was back on its feet. They signed to Eastwest Records which resulted in the release of the gold selling album Octopus and the hit singles [...] "Tell Me When" [...] and [...] "One <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart".|$|E

Abe's statement before receiving sentencing began, [...] "The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert...

2500|$|In 1995 the Octopus album {{gave the}} UK another hit single with [...] "One <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart". This {{provided}} Sulley her highest public {{profile in the}} band's history. The song was a ballad sung by Sulley on lead vocals, with Oakey and Catherall providing supporting vocals. The stylish accompanying video, set in a Parisian cafe, gave (the now 32-year-old) Sulley the best opportunity to demonstrate her considerable screen presence since [...] "Don't You Want Me". Although only moderately successful (it reached number thirteen in the UK charts), it was described years later in The Guardian as [...] "one of the best love songs of the 1990s", and has been remixed and re-released {{a number of times}} since.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to the 2004 revival, {{the show}} {{featured}} largely the original 1979 album tracks, {{with a few}} lyric amendments, plus the song [...] "The Last <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Life", written for the show's incarnation as Song and Dance in 1982. The production came about after Webb met a commissioning editor for BBC Radio 2 at a concert honouring Don Black in late 2013 at which she'd performed two songs from the piece. Asked whether she could still do the whole show, she suggested that, with a small band, it could be recorded for radio broadcast. The producer Robert Mackintosh then suggested a week's run prior to the recording, the popularity of which led to another three weeks at a second theatre. The recording was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, alongside an interview with Lloyd Webber and Black conducted by Anneka Rice.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} musical activity—or lack thereof—Bellini {{pleaded guilty in}} the letter to Florimo in March 1844: [...] "If you reflect {{for a moment that}} a young <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> position, in London and Paris for the first time, cannot help amusing himself immensely, you will excuse me." [...] However, in January 1834, he had signed a {{contract}} to write a new opera for the Théâtre-Italien which would be presented {{at the end of the}} year. [...] At the same time, he had been invited to write a new opera for the San Carlo in Naples for the 1834–35 Carnival season, but declined given the Paris commitment and stated that it might be possible to do so by May 1835 when he knew who were to be the contracted singers. Florimo immediately began to try to persuade his friend to take up this offer, indicating that Malibran had been engaged for Naples in January 1835.|$|E

Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and Look published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as [...] "a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet". Tate, Duke and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued {{after the completion of}} the film. During the shooting of Valley of the Dolls, Tate confided to Parkins that she was [...] "madly in love" [...] with Polanski. [...] "Yes, there's no doubt that Roman is the <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life," [...] Tate was quoted as saying in the New York Sunday News. Tate promoted the film enthusiastically.

Tate was quoted as saying, [...] "I learned a great deal about acting in , particularly in my scenes with Lee Grant.... She knows what acting is all about and everything she does, from little mannerisms to delivering her lines, is pure professionalism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sunderland escaped in {{disguise}} to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where he lay low for some time, before being officially arrested, and immediately released, by the Dutch authorities. Offering his {{service to the}} Prince of Orange, {{he moved on to}} Utrecht, where he remained quietly {{for the duration of the}} upheavals in England, when William III and Mary II took the throne. Afterwards he wrote to Sir John Churchill, a prominent English statesman, asking him to [...] "make things easy for a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> condition". Despite his notorious rudeness and bad temper, Sunderland had a surprising ability to make lasting friendships, and some of his friends, including John Evelyn and Thomas Tenison, had influence with the new regime. His sister Dorothy had married George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, a key advisor to William III in the early years of his reign, and though he and Sunderland had never been close, Halifax felt obliged from [...] family solidarity to make a plea on Sunderland's behalf. At first, William III excepted Sunderland from the Indemnity Act of 23 May 1690, but he was allowed to return to the country early the next year. At the same time, he had been excepted from James’ 1692 Instrument of Pardon.|$|E
