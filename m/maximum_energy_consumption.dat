40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cross-layer algorithm for joint routing, scheduling, and power control in wireless sensor networks. We {{consider the case}} of energy-constrained sensor nodes that continually communicate data packets to a common base station. The objective is to reduce <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of individual nodes and the overall network without severely degrading network throughput. Our cross-layer design studies two multi-hop routing protocols. One routing protocol determines packet routes according to a shortest-path criterion. The other protocol selects routes that minimize the <b>maximum</b> cumulative <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> within the network. Hence, this energy-aware routing protocol does not only factor in link qualities but also node energies—it introduces fairness in the way energy is consumed across the network. The algorithm jointly performs link scheduling and power control to minimize packet delays and transmit powers. Simulation results of network throughput and <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> indicate performance improvements for the cross-layer protocol with energy-aware routing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Energy {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the major problems in the design of a wireless sensor network (WSN). Multiple base stations can be used to dramatically reduce the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of sensor nodes. We consider the following problem of deploying k base stations in a wireless sensor network: Given a wireless sensor network where the location of each sensor node is known, partition the whole sensor network into k disjoint clusters and place one base station for each cluster such that the <b>maximum</b> total <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of any cluster is minimised. We propose the first heuristic for this problem. The time complexity of our heuristic is O(kn 3), where n is the number of sensor nodes of the sensor network. In the special case where k is equal to 1, we propose a quadratic-time algorithm for optimally deploying the base station. Our simulation results show that our heuristic is efficient. ...|$|R

40|$|Based on an {{extensive}} dataset containing aggregated hourly <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> readings of residents during March 2011 and October 2012 in South Ontario, Canada, this paper estimates the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of circulating pumps of residential swimming pools (CPRSP) non-intrusively, and quantifies {{the impact of}} CPRSP on the power system. The main challenges are that, first, widely used non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) methods are not applicable to this work, due to the low sampling rate {{and the lack of}} the <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> pattern of CPRSP; second, temperature-based building energy disaggregation methods are not suitable for this work, as they highly depend on the accurate base load estimation and predefined parameters. To overcome these issues, in this paper, first it is found that, during the pool season, for homes with and without swimming pools, the ratio between their base loads is approximately equal to the ratio between their temperature-dependent <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions,</b> then a novel weighted difference change-point (WDCP) model has been proposed. The advantages of the WDCP model are that, on one hand, it doesn&# 39;t depend on the base load estimation and predefined parameters; on the other hand, it has no requirement on the data sampling rate and the prior information of <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> patterns of CPRSP. Based on the WDCP model it is shown that, the average hourly <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> of CPRSP is 0. 7425 kW, and the minimum and the <b>maximum</b> hourly <b>energy</b> <b>consumptions</b> are 0. 5274 kW at 9 : 00 and 0. 9612 kW at 17 : 00, respectively.
