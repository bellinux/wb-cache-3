5|$|The Crown {{kept the}} {{freehold}} {{of the land}} south of the street except for No.79, which was granted to Nell Gwyn's trustees in 1676 or 1677 by Charles II. The buildings constructed {{on the south side}} of Pall Mall in subsequent years were grander than those on the north owing to stricter design and building standards imposed by the crown commissioners. When the <b>main</b> <b>road</b> was relocated further north, some houses suddenly had their backs facing the <b>main</b> <b>road,</b> losing available land for gardening. In 1664, residents filed a petition to turn the old road into gardens, which was successful. The trustees of the Earl of St Albans received a sixty-year lease on most of this from April 1665 so that trustees could issue sub-leases to their tenants.|$|E

50|$|The Queensland Government {{responded with}} the {{establishment}} of the Queensland <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> Board in 1920. Prior to this, the onus was on local shire councils to fund road construction and management. They were largely unable to provide the finances or technical skills to respond to challenges posed by increased car use. After the Board's establishment, co-operative funding arrangements occurred with local councils, who generally maintained roads after their construction. The initial policy of the <b>Main</b> <b>Roads</b> Board was to construct roads that operated as feeders to railway networks and aided the development of newly settled and existing districts.
