5|$|Moving back to 1919, {{the elderly}} Raoul visits Christine's gravesite and places {{the music box}} near her tombstone. He stands {{in silence for a}} <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turns to leave, but stops upon noticing a fresh red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem lying on the ground with Christine's {{engagement}} ring attached to it; implying that the Phantom still lives and still loves Christine.|$|E
5|$|They again hear Josh's agonized {{cries for}} help and follow them to a derelict, {{abandoned}} house containing symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Mike races upstairs {{in an attempt to}} find Josh while Heather follows. Mike then says he hears Josh in the basement. He runs downstairs while a hysterical Heather struggles to keep up. Upon reaching the basement, something attacks Mike and causes him to drop the camera and go silent. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike facing a corner. Something then attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera and go silent as well. The footage continues for another <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> ends.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Frazier (32–3) fought George Foreman for {{a second}} time. With a shaved head for a new image Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the big shots which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited his <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E

25|$|On August 2, 1860, Ward led the Foreign Arms Corps against Chingpu (上海青浦), {{the next}} town from Sung-chiang on the {{approaches}} to Shanghai, {{and this time the}} Taiping were prepared. As the Corps stormed a garrison wall, Taiping forces lying in ambush waited for the optimum <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> delivered a withering barrage of close-range musket fire. Within 10 minutes, the Foreign Arms Corps had suffered 50% casualties, and Ward himself was shot in the left jaw, with an exit wound in the right cheek, scarring him for life and leaving him with a speech impediment.|$|E
25|$|Psychobilly guitarists often play rockabilly-style hollowbody archtop guitars with f-holes and a tremolo bar. Guitarists {{may play}} punk-style power chords one <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> shift into rockabilly-style fingerpicking and rockabilly guitar-style seventh chords. Notes are often bent, either by pulling the string down or {{by using the}} tremolo bar. Gretsch hollowbody guitars are a popular choice. Guitarists often use 1950s-style tube {{amplifiers}} such as by makers such as Fender and {{it is common to}} see stacks of two speaker cabinets. As with rockabilly guitarists, the overdrive tone usually comes from what is produced naturally by overdriving the tube amp, rather than by plugging into a distortion pedal.|$|E
25|$|Word {{had spread}} through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds — I among them — {{looked up at the}} burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> leap to the {{pavement}} below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.|$|E

25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a fait accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E
25|$|Phillips {{was arrested}} {{that day at}} his school. He was held in maximum {{security}} {{as he made his}} first court appearance. It was determined that Clifton's cause of death was due to stabbing and clubbing with a baseball bat. Phillips claimed the event happened one afternoon when he was home alone, Maddie came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball, Phillips agreed even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Maddie threw the ball at him and he hit it, which caused the ball to strike the 8-year-old's eye, causing her to bleed, leading Clifton to cry and scream. Phillips panicked, fearing the reaction that his father would give when he got home and saw the aftermath. Phillips proceeded to drag Clifton into his home and then into his room and strangle her with a phone cord for approximately 15 minutes. Soon after, he hit her again with the baseball bat and stashed her under his bed, not long after Josh's father entered the house, Phillips went to interact with his father for a short <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went back to his room and found that Clifton was still alive moaning under his bed, he took off the mattress and stabbed her 11 times, killing the 8-year-old.|$|E

25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E
500|$|I mean, don't you {{sometimes}} stop and go, don't you feel hyper aware {{of who you}} are in the <b>moment?</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> think, 'God, I'm me inhabiting my flesh and bones, saying my words, breathing the air that I breathe but you're also outside of it and thinking, 'But why? Why am I me? Why... why... what is my place here?' [...] Well, that happens to me all the time.|$|E
500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that <b>moment.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|As the Marines {{formed into}} a horseshoe-shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura's {{battalion}} {{began a series}} of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below {{the east side of the}} ridge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops hoisted a [...] "regimental" [...] gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which [...] "could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese," [...] however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the Paramarines swept forward, killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson's command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William J. McKennan, [...] "The Japanese attack was almost constant, like a rain that subsides for a <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> pours the harder... When one wave was mowed down – and I mean mowed down – another followed it into death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer {{and singer}} Joe Henry, in a 2011 interview, cited [...] "Ode" [...] as [...] "an {{incredibly}} deft bit of {{writing in the}} way that that story is unfolded. … [...] places the character in a <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the story just starts to unfold around it", and was a song that influenced him early in his life listening to music on the radio.|$|E

2500|$|Mehmed IV's {{retaliation}} was severe. As archeologists I.

[...] In Bucharest, Ottoman soldiers destroyed the vineyards south of Dealul Mitropoliei. The order to destroy Târgoviște's fortifications was carried out, leaving the new Prince, Gheorghe I Ghica, to settle permanently in Bucharest. Nonetheless, Seimeni banners continued to be attested after that <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> well into the late Phanariote era.|$|E
