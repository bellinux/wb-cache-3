5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead including their <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
50|$|Daniel Lawrence Schacter (born June 17, 1952) is an American psychologist. He is a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. His {{research}} has focused on psychological and biological aspects of human <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> amnesia, with a particular emphasis on the distinction between conscious and nonconscious forms of <b>memory</b> <b>and,</b> more recently, on brain mechanisms of <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> brain distortion, <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> future simulation.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} associations between working <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> both reading and mathematics abilities, {{and the possible}} mediating factors of fluid intelligence, verbal abilities, short-term <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> phonological processing skills, {{in a sample of}} 46 children aged between 6 and 11 years with reading disabilities. Participants were tested on measures of complex <b>memory,</b> verbal <b>and</b> visuospatial short-term <b>memory,</b> IQ, phonological processing, language, literacy and mathematics. As a whole, the sample was characterized by deficits in complex <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> visuospatial short-term <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> by low IQ scores, whereas language, phonological short-term <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> phonological processing abilities fell in the low average range. The severity of reading difficulties was significantly associated with working <b>memory,</b> language <b>and</b> phonological processing abilities, whereas poor mathematics abilities were associated with complex memory score, phonological short-term <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> phonological processing scores. These findings suggest that working memory skills indexed by complex memory represent an important constraint on the development of skill and knowledge in the key domains of reading and mathematics. Possible mechanisms for the contribution of working <b>memory</b> to learning <b>and</b> the implications for educational practice are considered...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} small fodder enemies attempt to hinder Crash in his journey, much of them {{appearing}} in the previous Crash of the Titans. The Ratnicians, who previously worked for Doctor Neo Cortex, have since gone feral and vegetarian, and now work for the minor antagonist Doctor N. Gin. The Brat Girls, who previously worked for Nina Cortex, have betrayed her and now run the Evil Public School and supervise the Ratcicles in the Ratcicle Kingdom. The Doom Monkeys make a return appearance as employees of Nitrus Brio in the Sludge Junkyard. Two new fodder enemies make their debut in the game: the Znu, a group of small, warty creatures that inhabit Mount Grimly, and the Slap-E's, hand-shaped robots that share Doctor Cortex's <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> personal problems.|$|E

While {{following}} the spirit manifestation, he stumbles upon a burning house and rescues the real Alessa, who was immolated in a ritual to impregnate {{her with the}} cult's god. Losing consciousness outside the house, he awakens in the town and resolves to learn if she survived. During his journey, Travis unlocks his repressed childhood <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> defeats monstrous forms of his parents: {{his mother had been}} committed to a local mental institution after attempting to kill him, and his father had killed himself, unable to live with the guilt of having his wife condemned.

That night, Archer dreams {{that he is}} attacked by Reptilians, and Hernandez tries to help him {{come to terms with}} his <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> new-found adulation.

Returning to Starfleet Command, Archer is able to keep his emotions in check, and ultimately receives an unexpected thanks from Soval. Elsewhere, Doctor Phlox learns that some humans still hold a grudge over the Xindi attack, xenophobically blaming all aliens, and Phlox's presence in a bar results in a brawl.|$|E

40|$|Explanations implicating {{memory in}} {{the causes and}} {{severity}} of checking symptoms have focused primarily on retrospective <b>memory,</b> <b>and</b> relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to prospective memory. Limited research has examined the relationship between prospective <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> executive functions. We assessed whether impairments in prospective <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> executive function predict checking symptoms in a sample of 106 adults. Checking symptoms were assessed using the Padua Inventory Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR). All participants completed the prospective <b>memory</b> questionnaire (PMQ) <b>and</b> four computerised executive function tasks from the CANTAB, measuring inhibition, planning, attention set-shifting <b>and</b> working <b>memory.</b> Prospective <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> inhibition predicted checking symptom severity. Importantly, there were no correlations between internally cued prospective <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> inhibition or between prospective <b>memory</b> aiding strategies <b>and</b> inhibition. These variables appear to have an independent role in checking. The current findings highlight prospective <b>memory</b> <b>and</b> inhibition as key contributors to the checking symptom profile and provide the first evidence that these cognitive processes may independently contribute to checking symptoms. These findings have implications for a model in which memory performance is thought to be secondary to impairments in executive functions...|$|R

Director Bennett Miller filmed several vignettes featuring actors discussing movie <b>memories</b> <b>and</b> the business of filmmaking. Cirque du Soleil, who was concurrently renting the Hollywood and Highland Center for their show Iris, performed a dance number at the ceremony inspired by their aforementioned show.

5|$|Pearce {{stars as}} a man who, {{as a result of}} a past trauma, suffers from {{anterograde}} amnesia (the inability to form new <b>memories)</b> <b>and</b> suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E
