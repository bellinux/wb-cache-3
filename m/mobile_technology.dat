5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and <b>mobile</b> <b>technology</b> along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it {{was decided}} to make Type-0 a PSP exclusive, {{cancelling}} the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for <b>mobile</b> <b>technology</b> to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed Crisis Core, but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on The 3rd Birthday. Because of these conflicting projects, Type-0 came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was Final Fantasy Live, referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, Final Fantasy Type-0, was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Key Competencies for Educating ICT ProfessionalsInternational audienceIt is {{recognised}} in {{the literature}} that <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies</b> {{have the potential to}} ’disrupt’ established practices in ways that require adaptation if educators are to harness their potential. Thus, {{there is a need for}} participatory models of research and partnership that give teachers agency over the process of professional development with new technologies at a time when there is increasing pressure for educators to respond to the proliferation of <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies.</b> This paper reports on the development and initial testing of a participatory narrative ecology approach to developing teachers’ professional practice with <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies</b> in the UK. A prototype, haptic infographic was developed that teachers and teacher educators could use to story the development of their pedagogical practice as they appropriated <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies</b> in various contexts. The narrative ecology model was developed through a participatory methodology of working with school and university partners in teacher education. The objective was, to explore the model as a participatory approach to developing educators’ critical analysis of the process of appropriating <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies</b> for educational purposes and, to capture the subsequent process of pedagogical adaptation. This paper focuses in detail on both the narrative ecology model and how it was used in the case of a secondary school science teacher. The emerging evidence suggests that the process of adaptation to <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies</b> in education is prolonged and complex. Yet in a digital age of rapidly increasing connectivity and converging cultures there is a need for further research into the implications of <b>mobile</b> <b>technologies</b> and how educators can be located as central agents in changing and adapting pedagogical practices.

In 2005, Huawei began a joint venture with Siemens, called TD Tech, for developing 3G/ TD-SCDMA mobile communication technology products. The US$100 million investment gave the company a 49% stake in the venture, while Siemens held a 51% stake. In 2007, after Nokia and Siemens co-founded Nokia Siemens Networks, Siemens transferred all shares it held in TD Tech to Nokia Siemens Networks.
