50|$|The female {{hornbill}} {{builds a}} {{nest in the}} hollow of a large tree trunk, sealing the opening with a plaster made up mainly of feces.

The young chicks have no feathers and appear very plump. The mother is fed by her <b>mate</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> slit in the seal. The clutch consists of one or two eggs, which she incubates for 38-40 days. The female voids feces through the nest slit, as do the chicks from the age of two weeks.

40|$|Compartment-specific Ras {{signaling}} is {{an emerging}} paradigm {{that may explain}} the multiplex outputs from a single GTPase. The fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, affords a simple system in which to study Ras signaling {{because it has a}} single Ras protein, Ras 1, that regulates two distinct pathways: one that controls <b>mating</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> Byr 2 -mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and one that signals through Scd 1 -Cdc 42 to maintain elongated cell morphology. We generated Ras 1 mutants that are restricted to either the endomembrane or the plasma membrane. Protein binding studies showed that each could interact with the effectors of both pathways. However, when examined in ras 1 null cells, endomembrane-restricted Ras 1 supported morphology but not mating, and, conversely, plasma membrane-restricted Ras 1 supported mating but did not signal to Scd 1 -Cdc 42. These observations provide a striking demonstration of compartment-specific Ras signaling and indicate that spatial specificity in the Ras pathway is evolutionarily conserved...|$|R

40|$|Background: Assortative mating {{can help}} explain how genetic {{variation}} for male quality is maintained even in highly polygynous species. Here, {{we present a}} longitudinal study examining how female and male ages, as well as male social dominance, affect assortative mating in fallow deer (Dama dama) over 10 years. Assortative mating could help explain the substantial proportion of females that do not mate with prime-aged, high ranking males, despite very high mating skew. We investigated the temporal pattern of female and male matings, {{and the relationship between}} female age and the age and dominance of their mates. Results: The peak of yearling female matings was four days later than the peak for older females. Younger females, and especially yearlings, mated with younger and lower-ranking males than older females. Similarly, young males and lowerranking males mated with younger females than older males and higher-ranking males. Furthermore, the timing of matings by young males coincided with the peak of yearling female matings, whereas the timing of older male matings (irrespective of rank) coincided with the peak of older female matings. Conclusions: Assortative <b>mating,</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> combination of indirect and/or direct female mate choice, can help explain th...|$|R
40|$|The readout of {{detector}} arrays {{requires the}} monolithic or hybrid integration of a integrate circuit multiplexer with the detector array. In most LWIR and VLWIR applications, a hybrid approach is used. For example, the detector array may be built from HgCdTe and the readout integrated circuit may be silicon CMOS [1]. The two integrated circuits are <b>mated</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> bump-bonding {{process in which}} each detector element has its own metallized interconnect (e. g. indium bump) to a corresponding silicon multiplexer unit cell. The multiplexer unit cell may contain an integrating capacitor and other circuitry for amplification and detector biasing {{as well as for}} the unit cell readout selection. The vast majority of integrated circuits for this purpose (and for the majority of most other purposes, as well) have been made of silicon. In this paper, the use of GaAs-based integrated circuits instead of silicon CMOS ICs is explored. The major reasons for considering GaAs for readout electronics applications, in accordance with "Woodall's Rule " [2] are as follows: First, GaAs-based devices are less susceptible to carrier freeze-out, so we expect GaAs readouts to produce les...|$|R
40|$|Perturbation of {{pheromone}} signaling modulates {{not only}} mating but also virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic human pathogen known to encode three Gα, one Gβ, and two Gγ subunit proteins. We {{have found that}} Gαs Gpa 2 and Gpa 3 exhibit shared and distinct roles in regulating pheromone responses and mating. Gpa 2 interacted with the pheromone receptor homolog Ste 3 α, Gβ subunit Gpb 1, and RGS protein Crg 1. Crg 1 also exhibited in vitro GAP activity toward Gpa 2. These findings suggest that Gpa 2 regulates <b>mating</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> conserved signaling mechanism. Moreover, we found that Gγs Gpg 1 and Gpg 2 both regulate pheromone responses and mating. gpg 1 mutants were attenuated in mating, and gpg 2 mutants were sterile. Finally, although gpa 2, gpa 3, gpg 1, gpg 2, and gpg 1 gpg 2 mutants were fully virulent, gpa 2 gpa 3 mutants were attenuated for virulence in a murine model. Our study reveals a conserved but distinct signaling mechanism by two Gα, one Gβ, and two Gγ proteins for pheromone responses, mating, and virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans, and it also reiterates that the link between mating and virulence is not due to mating per se but rather to certain mating-pathway components that encode additional functions promoting virulence...|$|R

The nearly one hundred {{species of the}} most ubiquitously distributed ciliate, Euplotes, all evolved multiple mating types. Based on analyses of Mendelian genetics, these mating types have for long been assumed {{to be determined by}} multi-allelic series of genes inherited at a single genetic locus (i. e., the mating-type or mat locus) and responsible for the synthesis of mating type-pecific signaling proteins. The chemical characterization of these signaling proteins (known as pheromones) from an array of Euplotes species has now permitted us to evolve in the study of Euplotes mating types from an approach of Mendelian genetics to an approach of molecular genetics. In this new experimental context, we have cloned and characterized structurally the pheromone (mating-type) gene families of Euplotes species that take different positions in the phylogenetic tree of the genus Euplotes. It appeared that, in accord with the prediction of the Mendelian genetics, early branching species (e. g., E. polaris, E. raikovi and E. nobilii) inherit their mating types at a single multi-allelic locus. However, in disagreement with the prediction of the Mendelian genetics, late branching species (e. g., E. crassus and E. focardii) inherit their mating types at two distinct loci that are likely the result of an event of gene duplication in the germinal (micronuclear) genome. One locus appears to be structurally and functionally homologous with the multi-allelic locus of the early branching species, while the second locus appears to be structurally homologous but functionally divergent...|$|R

Virtual studies are an interesting way to investigate ideal or preferred criteria when people looking for their mates. This study addresses what criteria are important for girls and boys in selecting their prospectus spouses. Since parents’ opinions are also {{an important factor in}} mate selection in Iran, we asked mothers’ opinions about their ideal son/daughter in laws in order to find possible differences in preferred criteria when sel ecting mates for their son or their daughters and also the generation gap between mothers and children in mate selection. Participants were 15 young boys and 15 girls and their mothers. Participants were introduced to several prospectus <b>mates</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> virtual or cyberspace environment and had options to look at different criteria for each. They were asked to choose the one they prefer and the process of their selection was recorded by a computer programming. Then participants’ mothers also did this process. The differences between boys and girls and their mothers were measured. The differences between mothers in selecting criteria for their ideal son-in-laws and ideal daughter-in-laws were also measured. The results showed that physical beauty was more important to boys than to girls while the criteria of responsibility and being loved were more important to girls than to boys. Income, field of study, and being handsome were more important criteria for mothers when choosing son-in-law than when selecting daughter-in-law. The girls paid more attention to loving and being loved and relations before marriage than their mothers. Choosing a handsome bride was the more important criterion for boys than for their mothers.
