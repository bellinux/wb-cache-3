50|$|Among Petzval's {{other works}} are the {{invention}} of opera glasses, lens system calculations {{that led to the}} perfection of a telescope and microscope (1843), computations for efficient binoculars, and construction of new floodlights (1847). His plan for the construction of lighting systems for ships on the Danube could not be carried out, however. His special <b>mirror</b> <b>lamp</b> (Petzval lamp), which made possible a maximum utilization of light energy, was used particularly for the bright projectors developed by Petzval. Petzval can also be regarded as the inventor of the modern unastigmatic lens system, based on records from his estate. About 1860, Petzval conducted photogrammetric measurements using equipment he had designed. He also proved scientifically that glowing solid compounds emit more light than burning gases. Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach later applied this principle to the gas lamp he designed.|$|E
40|$|Branding {{is being}} adopted by {{charities}} and written about in charity literature {{with increasing frequency}} (Tapp 1996; Hankinson 2001). There is evidence to suggest, however, that the conceptualisation of values in corporate branding may be not be compatible with the conceptualisation of values in the charity context. To support this argument, the paper explores the values dimensions of key branding models using the metaphors of <b>mirror,</b> <b>lamp</b> and lens. It is suggested that the apparent negotiability of certain brand values in the for-profit context is incompatible {{with the need for}} non-negotiable values in the charity sector. It is proposed that charity brands should focus solely on the communication of organisational values that emanate from the charity itsel...|$|E

2500|$|The British {{postponed}} {{their attack}} to 8 August, reduced {{the depth of}} the objective and made six [...] "Chinese" [...] attacks on 7 August, to inflict losses and mislead the defenders. The attack differed little from previous attempts, although careful briefings were conducted and elaborate measures taken to maintain communication, using contact-patrol aircraft to observe ground flares, <b>mirrors,</b> <b>lamps</b> and panels. Visual signalling posts and relay posts for runners were prepared and messenger-pigeons taken forward. Infantry wore shiny tin discs on the back of their equipment, to be visible from the air and a wireless station was set up near Favière Wood. Visual signalling still failed again during the attack, due to mist, dust and smoke. Congestion in the British trenches in front of Trônes Wood made a fresh attack impossible until next day. On 9 August, some battalions had not arrived by zero hour, the attacks failed and British troops isolated in Guillemont were overwhelmed and captured.|$|R
