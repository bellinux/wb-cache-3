5000|$|A {{direct debit}} or direct {{withdrawal}} is a financial transaction {{in which one}} person withdraws funds from another person's bank account. Formally, the person who directly draws the funds ("the payee") instructs his or her bank to collect (i.e., debit) an amount directly from another's ("the payer's") bank account designated by the payer and pay those funds into a bank account designated by the payee. Before the payer's banker will allow the transaction to take place, the payer must have advised the bank {{that he or she}} has authorized the payee to directly draw the funds. It is also called pre-authorized debit (PAD) or pre-authorized payment (PAP). After the authorities are set up, the direct debit transactions are usually processed electronically. Direct debits are typically used for recurring payments, such as credit card and utility bills, where the payment amounts vary from one payment to another. However, when the authorization is in place, the circumstances in which the funds are drawn as well as the dates and amounts are a matter of agreement between the payee and payer, with which the bankers are not concerned. In countries where setting up authorization is easy enough, direct debits can also be used for irregular payments, such as for <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>transactions</b> or at a point of sale. The payer can cancel the authorization for a direct debit at any time, and the banker can decline to carry out a debit if the transaction would breach the terms of the bank account out of which payment is to be made, for example if it were to cause the account to overdraw. (Banking law does not authorize a bank to alter the payment amount.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Outpatient {{drugs are}} {{dispensed}} through both community and <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacies. There is no empirical evidence that substitution of community pharmacy with <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> reduces overall drug expenditures. The need {{for evaluating the}} potential effects on utilization and costs of the possible extension of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> services in Medicaid provides the rationale for conducting this study. This study compares drug utilization and drug product cost in community vs. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy dispensing services in a Medicaid population. Methods This study is a retrospective cohort study comparing utilization and cost patterns in community vs. <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy. A simulation model was employed to assess drug utilization and cost in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy using community pharmacy claim data. The model assumed that courses of drug therapy (CDT) in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy would have utilization patterns {{similar to those found}} in community pharmacy. A 95 % confidence interval surrounding changes in average utilization and average cost were estimated using bootstrap analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed by varying drug selection criteria and supply, fill point, and medication possession ratio (MPR). Sub-analyses were performed to address differences between <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> and community pharmacy related to therapeutic class and dual-eligible patients. Data for the study derived from pharmacy claims database of Ohio Medicaid State program for the period January 2000 -September 2004. Drug claims were aggregated to obtain a set of CDTs representing unique patient IDs and unique drug products. Drug product cost estimates excluded dispensing fees and were used to estimate the cost reduction required in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to become cost neutral in comparison with community pharmacy. Results The baseline model revealed that the use of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> vs. community pharmacy would result in a 5. 5 % increase in drug utilization and a 5. 4 % cost reduction required in <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> to become cost neutral. Results from Ohio Medicaid drugs for chronic use revealed a 5. 1 % increase in utilization and a 4. 9 % cost reduction required to become cost neutral in comparison with community pharmacy. Conclusion The results of the simulation model indicate that <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy increases drug utilization and can also increase drug product cost if the cost per unit is not reduced accordingly. Prior consideration should be given to the patient population, day-supply, disease, therapy, and insurance characteristics to ensure the appropriate use of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> pharmacy services. </p...|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{will argue}} that America’s current {{marriage}} crisis {{is a problem that}} could be solved by encouraging <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> marriages.

Part II of this Article will suggest <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> marriage as a solution to this crisis and it will address, and reject, the commonly held assumption that <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> marriages are a vehicle for abuse.
