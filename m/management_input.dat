5000|$|Lancaster Synthesis, {{initially}} {{based in}} Lancaster and then Morecambe, Lancashire UK. This business {{was founded by}} Eric Wildsmith and Wilf Maughan and specialised in the manufacture and supply of organic research chemicals. The business was sold to MTM PLC for £20,000,000 in 1989, following which Maughan retired and Wildsmith was eventually ousted as Managing Director by the Executive Chairman of MTM : Richard Lines. MTM subsequently went bankrupt, Lines and the MTM Financial Director, Tom Baxter were jailed for fraud, and Lancaster Synthesis (by then rebranded MTM Research Chemicals) was sold to BTP PLC in 1993 - who reverted the name to Lancaster Synthesis. BTP in turn was later sold to Clariant, who {{had no idea what}} to do with a catalogue company - and eventually agreed a sale to Johnson Matthey for £14,000,000. Unfortunately a few weeks before the sale was due to complete, an unexplained major fire destroyed the scale-up plant and the majority of the bulk stock. This has echoes of another destructive fire on the eve of the MTM takeover, which totally destroyed a manufacturing laboratory. The Lancaster Synthesis sites have now all closed, with all UK operations moved to the newer Avocado facilities at Heysham. During the period of MTM ownership, a series of other companies were acquired and brought under notional control: Loba Feinchemie (Fischamend, Austria), Farchan Laboratories (Gainesville, Florida) Monomer Polymer & Dajac Labs (USA). These were all sold back to their previous owners or local management following the MTM collapse as they required too high a <b>management</b> <b>input</b> from the UK, and had never been properly integrated. Not long after Farchan was returned to local management it also was destroyed in a fire, subsequently relocating to Columbus, OH close to the location of its founding, where its initial technology had been based on research into high performance aviation fuels during WWII by Henry Channon. During the period of MTM ownership a short-lived distribution agreement existed for Farmitalia-Carlo Erba to distribute Lancaster Synthesis products through a Carlo Erba rebranded version of the LS catalogue. However this venture was a failure and only lasted for one catalogue edition: the Italians proved unable to commit the required marketing resources to the project.|$|E

Cover abundance of vascular and non-vascular plants and environmental variables were measured in 32 10 × 10 -m plots located in five blocks with different management treatments. Ordination of the floristic data separated the block with the highest <b>management</b> <b>inputs</b> from other blocks. Several adventive species were significantly more abundant in this block, while several native species were either absent or uncommon, but were significantly more abundant in other study blocks. H. pilosella was significantly more abundant in blocks with lower <b>management</b> <b>inputs.</b> Diversity was significantly higher in the block with the highest <b>management</b> <b>inputs.</b> The native tussock Poa colensoi had significantly greater cover abundance while Festuca novae-zelandiae tussocks were significantly taller in this block.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{management}} ability in explaining efficiency on New York dairy farms using both Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier estimation. First, we test whether computed technical, cost, and revenue efficiencies under DEA are due to a missing input, which we argue may be the <b>management</b> <b>input.</b> Using an unbalanced panel of individual farm data from the Cornell University?s Dairy Farm Business Summary (DFBS) from 1993 - 2004 we define 6 inputs, including operator labor, hired labor, purchased feed, livestock, capital, and crop inputs, and two outputs, including milk output and all other outputs. We define the <b>management</b> <b>input</b> in two ways. First, the DFBS asks farmers to estimate their own values of labor and management. Second, the panel nature of the data set allows us to use the previous year?s net farm income {{as a measure of}} farmer management ability. Using the lagged data prevents any contemporaneous bias in efficiency measurement and is consistent with Stigler?s conjecture that differences in management ability should be captured in profits. To test for the effects of the missing <b>management</b> <b>input</b> we first calculate DEA efficiency scores using the original six inputs and two outputs. These efficiencies are recalculated first using operators? values of labor and management, and then using lagged net farm income, in place of the operator labor input. The resulting efficiency scores are compared. We find weak evidence of the missing <b>management</b> <b>input</b> using our two measures, and that change in computed efficiencies resulting from including the <b>management</b> <b>input</b> depends on whether one uses an input or output orientation. The change in efficiencies using operators? values of labor and management are small, often less than 1 percent. Using lagged net farm income as the <b>management</b> <b>input</b> increases computed input-oriented technical efficiency by an average of 1 percent and cost efficiency by 1. 2 percent. Output oriented technical efficiency increases by 1. 7 percent and revenue efficiency increases by nearly 2 percent. The impact of this measure of the <b>management</b> <b>input</b> on the allocative components of cost and revenue efficiencies was negligible, indicating that this measure of management ability serves more to explain differences in technology choice than allocative abilities. We also estimate input- and output-oriented technical efficiencies, cost efficiencies and revenue efficiencies using stochastic frontier functions. The technical efficiencies are estimated using distance function methodologies. We transform our <b>management</b> <b>input</b> variables to a per cow basis and include them as efficiency effects variables along with operator age, education, farm size, and years of participation in the DFBS. This allows us to measure the impacts of management ability on farm efficiency while controlling for other factors that may also affect efficiency. We estimate conditional mean and heteroscedastic efficiency term specifications for each frontier model. We again find that using lagged net farm income per cow may be a preferred measure of management ability than farmers? own estimates of the value of their labor and management per cow. We find that, at the margin, this measure of management ability increases input-oriented technical efficiency by 1. 4 ? 1. 5 percent and cost efficiency by between 1. 7 ? 2. 9 percent, depending on specification. Output oriented technical efficiency and revenue efficiency increase at the margin by 1. 8 ? 3. 0 percent and by 2. 4 ? 4. 2 percent respectively. We also find increasing efficiency with operator education, farm size, and extended DFBS participation and decreasing efficiency with operator age. Finally, we present a discussion of whether an input or output orientation is more appropriate for the farms in our sample and compare the dairy farm efficiencies predicted by DEA and the stochastic frontiers. We find that, for our data set, the distributions of farm efficiencies are very similar under DEA and stochastic frontier estimations, but individual farm rankings are quite different between the two...|$|E

30|$|The {{domestication}} {{of plant}} and animal species has historically centred very much on exploiting favourable interactions between genetic improvement and <b>management</b> <b>inputs,</b> with domesticated stocks requiring but rewarding intensified <b>management</b> <b>inputs.</b> A classic example of favourable, synergistic interactions in plant breeding is afforded by the dwarf wheats of the “Green Revolution” which began in Mexico in the 1950 s. These wheats could respond very well to increased fertiliser, with greatly increased yields (Borlaug 1970), whereas such fertiliser inputs made the more traditional long-strawed wheats prone to lodging which would vitiate their yield potential. (Admittedly, a question now exists over the long-term sustainability of such fertiliser use, but it is not seen as detracting from the illustrative value of this example.) In animal breeding, a good example exists in breeding for improved reproductive performance in sheep in New Zealand (Young 2015), boosting lambing percentages with twins and triplets instead of mainly single lambs. That can mean much improved meat production from the same, or even fewer, capital stock (see Figure 8 in Cocks and Brown 2005). But it does depend for its practical success on providing benign farm conditions with reliable and plentiful supplies of high-quality feed (Burton n.d.), so almost all the lambs can survive and prosper.|$|R
