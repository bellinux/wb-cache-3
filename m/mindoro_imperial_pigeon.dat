50|$|The {{mountain}} <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Ducula badia), {{also known}} as the maroon-backed <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> or Hodgson's <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> is a species of bird in the pigeon and dove family with a wide range in south-eastern Asia.|$|R
50|$|Its {{taxonomy}} {{is confusing}} and remains unsettled. It has sometimes included the Torresian, yellowish and silver-tipped <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeons</b> as subspecies. The widespread nominate subspecies of the pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> differs {{from all these}} by its plain white thighs and undertail coverts (though often with a dark spot at the very tip), and its narrowly dark-tipped bluish bill. For comparison, the other species' have black-spotted undertail coverts and thighs (spotting mainly near thighs in silver-tipped <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon),</b> the bill of the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> is greenish-yellow, and the bills of the yellowish and silver-tipped <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeons</b> are bluish at the base and yellowish at the tip. Furthermore, the yellowish <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> has a distinctive yellowish tinge to its plumage (some pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeons</b> may also appear yellowish, but infrequently to the same extent), and the silver-tipped <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> has silvery-grey remiges. However, the taxon melanura of the Moluccas, which usually is considered a subspecies of the pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> resembles the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> in bill, thighs and undertail coverts, but has a significantly broader black tail-tip. Consequently, some have suggested it should be placed under the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> while others have suggested it should be considered an entirely separate species, D. melanura (for which the name black <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> has been used - an unfortunate choice, as only the tail has significantly more black than {{the other members of}} this group, and the name black <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> usually has been used for D. melanochroa). Yet others have considered melanura to be invalid, instead believing it only is a morph of D. b. bicolor, as both types can be found on some islands.|$|R
5000|$|The pink-bellied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Ducula poliocephala) {{otherwise}} known as the Philippine zone-tailed <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> the zone-tailed <b>pigeon,</b> the Philippine <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> or balud, {{is found in the}} Philippines. It is a fruit-eating bird.According to the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International's Red Book, the pink-bellied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> is a [...] "near threatened" [...] species as of 2000. This is due to the loss of habitat and exploitation by humans.|$|R
2500|$|... b) The pacifica {{subgroup}} of six species, similar to aenea but with enlarged ceres, and {{distributed throughout the}} Pacific. The Pacific (D. pacifica) and the Micronesian (D. oceania) <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeons</b> are similar allospecies, while the Polynesian (D. aurorae) and Marquesan (D. galeata) <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeons</b> are larger birds with dark plumage. The red-knobbed <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (D. rubricera) and the spice <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (D. myristicivora) are similar but found in Melanesia and New Guinea.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} {{considered}} a subspecies of the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (which in turn sometimes {{is considered a}} subspecies of the pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon),</b> but is increasingly treated as a separate species. It resembles the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> but has a distinctly yellow-tinged plumage and a bluish base to the bill.|$|R
50|$|The {{yellowish}} <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Ducula subflavescens), {{also known}} as the yellow-tinted <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> or Bismarck <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (leading to easy confusion with D. melanochroa), is a relatively large species of bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to forest and woodland in the Bismarck Archipelago. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{taxonomy}} {{is confusing}} and remains unsettled. It {{has sometimes been}} considered a subspecies of the pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon.</b> When recognized as a separate species, the number of subspecies of the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> also remains unsettled. Many recognize two: The widespread D. s. spilorrhoa (nominate) and D. s. constans of the Kimberleys. However, the latter is sometimes considered a junior synonym of former. Alternatively, {{it has been argued}} that it should be considered a separate species, the Kimberley imperial-pigeon (D. constans Bruce, 1989). Two additional taxa, subflavescens of the Bismarck Archipelago and melanura of the Moluccas, have been associated with the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon.</b> The former has a distinctive yellowish-tinged plumage and a bluish basal half of the bill, and is increasingly treated as a separate species, the yellowish <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon</b> (D. subflavescens). [...] Most recent authorities place melanura under the pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> but it has black spotting to the undertail coverts and a greenish-yellow bill similar to the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon.</b> However, melanura also has a significantly broader black tail-tip than the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{confusion}} is not helped by English naming. [...] D. bicolor is variously {{described as the}} nutmeg pigeon, the Torres Strait pigeon, and the pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon.</b> D. spilorrhoa is also described as the nutmeg pigeon, the white nutmeg pigeon, the Australian pied pigeon, the Australian pied <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon,</b> the Torres Strait pigeon or the Torresian <b>imperial</b> <b>pigeon.</b>|$|R
