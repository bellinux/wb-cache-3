5|$|Later {{excursions}} by the Romans {{were generally}} {{limited to the}} scouting expeditions in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The Ravenna Cosmography utilises a 3rd- or 4th-century Roman map and identifies four loci (meeting places, possibly markets) in southern Scotland. Locus Maponi is possibly the modern Lochmabenstane near Gretna which continued {{to be used as}} a <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> well into the historic period. Two of the others indicate meeting places of the Damnonii and Selgovae, and the fourth, Manavi may be Clackmannan. From the time of Caracalla onwards, no further attempts were made to permanently occupy territory in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish–American War {{brought the}} Fort into usage as a <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> for troops from across Nebraska. Camp Meiklejohn, Camp Augur and Camp Vincent were all {{subordinate}} troop sites around Omaha under {{command of the}} Fort.|$|E
500|$|Task Force A left port in {{the evening}} of 5 June, but {{struggled}} in bad seas which affected their equipment and ability to converge at their meeting point. By 00:37 on 6 June the lead boats were on schedule and had reached the <b>muster</b> <b>point.</b> Between 02:00 and 04:00 the ships operated radar and radio equipment as they headed toward a point [...] offshore. From there the task force simulated a landing attempt; by running fast to within [...] of the beach {{before returning to the}} 7-mile marker under cover of smoke. During this time only a small German response was observed including searchlights and intermittent gunfire. Shortly after 05:00 the operation ended and the task force laid mines before heading toward Newhaven, reaching port by midday.|$|E
5000|$|Carmargo {{was named}} by {{veterans}} of the Mexican-American War for Camargo, Tamaulipas, a <b>mustering</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

50|$|During the Second Boer War, Molteno {{was used}} as a <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for troops prior to the famous Battle of Stormberg, as it was the closest railway station. The area also saw {{extensive}} Boer guerilla activity.|$|R
500|$|At 9:30am, the {{defenders}} {{surrendered to the}} 'Nazis' and withdrew to the downtown <b>muster</b> <b>point,</b> and the city was occupied. The fake Nazis began a widespread harassment campaign, sending armed troops throughout the city. A tank was driven down Portage Avenue, {{one of the main}} streets of the downtown area. Some people were taken to an internment camp at Lower Fort Garry; those interned included prominent local politicians like Premier John Bracken (arrested with several members of his cabinet at a caucus meeting), Mayor John Queen, Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Roland Fairbairn McWilliams, and visiting Norwegian ambassador to the United States [...] One council member, Dan McClean, escaped but was recaptured after an intensive search. Chief of Police George Smith avoided capture because he was dining out when soldiers arrived at his office. The Union Flag at Lower Fort Garry was replaced with the swastika. The city was renamed [...] "Himmlerstadt", and Main Street was termed [...] "Hitlerstrasse".|$|E
500|$|The castle {{was located}} [...] {{from the port}} of King's Lynn. In the 12th century it would have {{typically}} have been reached by boat, through a channel in the marshy Babingley River that ran nearby. Following the Norman conquest of England, the land had been granted to Bishop Odo, the Earl of Kent, who may have used it as an administrative centre; there were many Saxo-Norman buildings {{on the site of}} the later castle. Although Norfolk was a prosperous region during this period, the location of the castle was not strategically important: its only militarily significance would have been as a regional <b>muster</b> <b>point,</b> and the surrounding lands were thinly populated, with poor, acidic agricultural soil. The attraction of the site to William is believed to have been that it was a relatively cheap and easy place in which to build a substantial new building and establish a large hunting park. Historian Richard Hulme argues that William essentially built [...] "a palatial hunting lodge" [...] on the site.|$|E
500|$|Arnold and Major General David Wooster, who had overall {{command of}} Connecticut's defense forces {{and was also}} in New Haven, hurriedly {{recruited}} about 100 volunteers locally. [...] They then headed for Redding, the <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> specified by militia Major General Gold S. Silliman, who oversaw Fairfield County's defenses. [...] Silliman had mustered a force of 500 volunteers from eastern Connecticut. [...] Under Wooster's direction Arnold and his fellow officers moved their small force toward Danbury so they could intercept and harass the British as they returned to their ships. [...] Wooster divided the force, with Arnold and Silliman leading 400 men {{to the village of}} Ridgefield, Connecticut to block the British march, while he led 200 men to harass the British rear guard. [...] By 11 am on April 27 Wooster's column had caught up with and engaged Tryon's rear guard. [...] In two brief skirmishes, Wooster was mortally wounded, but the action delayed the British long enough for Arnold and Silliman to establish a crude breastwork just north of Ridgefield. [...] In the ensuing battle, the militia companies put up stiff resistance before they were flanked and driven off. [...] Arnold's horse was shot, and when it went down, his leg was pinned under it. [...] Arnold was very nearly bayoneted by a British soldier, but shot him with a pistol and managed to get away with a minor wound to his left leg. [...] The British camped for the night near Ridgefield, and then proceeded on toward the coast, harassed by militia all the way. [...] Arnold and Silliman rallied their troops, which grew to include Continental Army and artillery units as well as militia units from further afield. [...] Arnold eventually established a fairly strong position on Campo Hill (in present-day Westport, Connecticut) near the beach where the British expected to embark. [...] The British managed to elude his attempt to entrap them, and drove off many of the militia with their field artillery before embarking on their ships and sailing back to New York. [...] During the final skirmishing, Arnold had a second horse shot out under him. [...] When Congress learned of the action on May 2, it finally promoted Arnold to major general, although his seniority of rank was behind those promoted in February.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1898, the U.S. Army {{established}} [...] "Camp Bryan Grimes" [...] in Raleigh {{and named}} {{it for the}} former Confederate general. It served as a <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for North Carolina troops in the Spanish-American War.|$|R
50|$|Camp Stanford {{served as}} the <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for Company G, 1st Regiment of Cavalry, California Volunteers which was mustered into the United States service on the June 12, 1863. Company F, of that {{regiment}} was mustered into service there on October 31, 1863.|$|R
50|$|Camp Leon was {{the initial}} <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for the Kilcrease Light Artillery, {{also known as}} Villepique's Light Battery, by September 1863.

50|$|During the {{rebellion}} of Simon de Montfort in the 1260s {{there was no}} fighting either. However King Henry III's son Prince Edward (the future Edward I) did capture a rebel named Adam Gurdon in a battle at Alton and brought him to Guildford Castle and it {{was used as a}} <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> during King Edward I's foreign wars.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Kedleston Hall {{was offered}} by Richard Curzon, 2nd Viscount Scarsdale {{for use by}} the War Department. Kedleston Hall {{provided}} various facilities during the period 1939 - 45 including its use as a <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> and army training camp. It also formed one of the Y-stations used to gather Signals Intelligence via radio transmissions which, if encrypted, were subsequently passed to Bletchley Park for decryption.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} cattle grazing through the Macleay River Gorges, called 'The Falls', since the 1840s, with <b>mustering</b> <b>points</b> (yards and huts) {{occurring}} at Top Creek, (Sunderlands) Middle Yards, Kunderang, Left Hand, Oven Camp, Youdales Hut, Green Gully, Yarrowitch River and Front Tableland.

50|$|The Spanish-American War {{brought the}} Fort into usage as a <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> for troops from across Nebraska. Camp Meiklejohn, Camp Augur and Camp Vincent were all {{subordinate}} troop sites around Omaha under {{command of the}} Fort.|$|E
50|$|In 1639 {{during the}} First Bishops' War, Duns became the <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for the Covenanting army led by General Leslie, {{gathered}} there to face King Charles I's English host encamped at Berwick. Leslie {{took up residence}} in the Castle and ordered a redoubt to be constructed on Duns Law. The opposing armies did not engage but on 18 June the Pacification of Berwick was signed. The remains of Leslie's fortifications are still evident on top of Duns Law.|$|R
5000|$|In late August 1513 the Master of Angus {{rode out}} with his father the Earl, {{and his younger brother}} Sir William Douglas of Glenbervie {{at the head of a}} large Douglas {{contingent}} and their adherents. On reaching the <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> at the Ellemford, north of Duns, they joined with the largest and most modern army that Scotland had ever fielded. The army proceeded under King James into England where it eventually met with the army of the Earl of Surrey at Flodden Edge.|$|R
50|$|General Order 46 of May 16, 1898 {{assigned}} commanding {{officers and}} training camps {{to the new}} corps. Major General James H. Wilson was designated commander, with the corps to assemble at Camp Thomas, Georgia. For reasons that cannot be immediately determined—but which may have stemmed from the near-collapse of organization at Camp Thomas, which was also the <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for the First and Third corps—the Sixth Corps was never organized and Wilson was transferred to command of the First Division in the First Army Corps.|$|R
50|$|While {{en route}} to the {{invasion}} force's <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> at Gesoriacum, Macro and Cato's century is detailed to escort Imperial Secretary Narcissus, but they are attacked on the road by a group of Syrian mercenaries intending to kill Narcissus.

50|$|Ashbel P. Willard, {{governor}} of the state of Indiana and a native of New Albany, dedicated the Floyd County Fairgrounds in 1859. That year, the Indiana State Fair was held in New Albany. During the Civil War, the fairgrounds were converted to become Camp Noble and used as a <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> for the area's regiments.|$|E
50|$|Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel {{chose the}} Curragh as a <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> {{for the cause}} of James II during the Williamite War in Ireland.

50|$|Its {{purpose in}} the war was twofold. Firstly it served as a <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for convoys. Over {{the course of the}} war 3,367 convoys, {{comprising}} 84,297 vessels departed from HMS Westcliff. Secondly, it was Naval Control for the Thames Estuary. Notable in its career was the accidental sinking of the Liberty ship SS Richard Montgomery which, still containing several thousand tons of explosives, is visible from the North Kent coast and Southend beach at low tide, and continues to pose a threat to navigation and the surrounding area to this day.|$|R
5000|$|For many years, {{the main}} purpose of the {{structure}} was for agricultural shows, and from this came its [...] "Cattle Castle" [...] nickname. In wartime, the building became an important military structure. It was the home of Strathcona's Horse before they departed for the Boer War. In the First World War, it was the <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and it served as a general recruiting centre and the home to the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa and the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards during the Second World War.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Primary care internationally is {{approaching}} a new paradigm. The change agenda implicit in this threatens to de-stabilise and challenge established general practice and primary care. Discussion The Primary Care Amplification Model offers {{a means to}} harness the change agenda by 'amplifying' the strengths of established general practices around a 'beacon' practice. Conclusion Such 'beacon' practices can provide a <b>mustering</b> <b>point</b> for an expanded scope of practice for primary care, integrated primary/secondary service delivery, interprofessional learning, relevant local clinical research, and a focus on local service innovation, enhancing rather than fragmenting the collective capacity of existing primary care. </p...|$|R
50|$|The common was {{originally}} {{set aside for}} Captain Daniel Gookin in 1655, but reverted to the community {{when he did not}} claim it. The first meeting house was built 1663, and part of the land was set aside as a militia training ground in 1694. It was used as a <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> for the local militia when the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775.|$|E
5000|$|In 1829 the Mexican {{government}} granted empresario Lorenzo de Zavala land {{in eastern}} Texas. [...] The land grant covered {{an area that}} is now Jasper County. Thomas Huling purchased some of this land, and in 1834 founded the town of Zavala, named for the empresario, and also known as <b>Muster</b> <b>Point.</b> The town was incorporated on December 24, 1838 by the Republic of Texas, and a post office was erected in 1839.|$|E
50|$|In 1485, Long Mountain by Trelystan was the <b>muster</b> <b>point</b> of the Welsh army of Henry Tudor (King Henry VII) led by {{his famous}} {{military}} commander Sir Rhys ap Thomas. They marched {{from there to}} Bosworth Field, where they defeated King Richard III. Sir Rhys was a descendant of the Princes of Deheubarth, whose castle of Dinefwr he inherited from his father. Sir Rhys’ wife Efa (English: ‘Eva’) was a direct descendant of Elystan via his grandson Idnerth ap Cadwgan ab Elystan.|$|E

50|$|To {{judge the}} {{effectiveness}} of any military formation one first needs to determine what was its function. The early Saxon armies were aggressive small raiding units that could be quickly combined in a larger unit to take land and goods. The later army's function was defensive and was the military expression of an organised state. It not only depended on raising manpower through the fyrd, but on a network of burghs that provided supply bases and <b>mustering</b> <b>points.</b> It was this system that allowed Alfred and his successors to conquer England and for Harold to move his army rapidly against the Danes and defeat them at Stamford Bridge then move elements 250 miles south to Hastings.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls were}} faced in {{concrete}} and had large steel doors which protected road gateways. Construction was undertaken because {{the town had}} in its history been destroyed by tsunamis several times. Killer waves struck in 1611, in 1896, where more than 1,800 people died, and in 1933, where 911 people died. The seawalls, which could theoretically stop breaking waves up to 8 m high, were designed to divert tsunamis to the sides around the town using channels and river dykes. Local municipal agencies regularly carried out annual tsunami drills simulating an emergency. Volunteers would close the seawall gates and residents would go to <b>muster</b> <b>points</b> above the town. The system worked well when a tsunami from the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile struck the town.|$|R
