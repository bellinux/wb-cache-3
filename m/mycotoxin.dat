5|$|The {{fruit body}} of Tricholoma pardinum is an {{imposing}} mushroom with a pale grey cap up to 15cm (6in) in diameter that {{is covered with}} dark brownish to greyish scales. The gills are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown stalk. The spore print is white. One of the more toxic members of the genus Tricholoma, the species has been implicated {{in a number of}} episodes of mushroom poisoning, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell and taste, and it bears a superficial resemblance to several edible species, like Tricholoma terreum. Ingesting T.pardinum—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent gastroenteritis caused by an unknown <b>mycotoxin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and ergot alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the ergot fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 <b>mycotoxin)</b> and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mycotoxins</b> are {{secondary}} metabolites of moulds. Contamination of {{food and}} feed by <b>mycotoxins</b> {{is a major problem}} for human and animal health. Ingestion of <b>mycotoxins</b> may cause a range of toxic responses, from acute toxicity to long term or chronic health disorders. Several <b>mycotoxins,</b> either from the same or from different fungal species, occur simultaneously in plant products. However, its implication for food safety assessment is generally not known, as there is relatively little information on the interaction between concomitantly occurring <b>mycotoxins</b> and the consequence for the toxicity. <b>Mycotoxins</b> with similar mode of action would be expected to have at least additive effects.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mycotoxins</b> are {{secondary}} metabolites of molds {{that have}} {{adverse effects on}} humans, animals, and crops that result in illnesses and economic losses. A. flatoxins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins, tremorgenic toxins, and ergot alkaloids are the <b>mycotoxins</b> of greatest agro-economic importance. <b>Mycotoxins</b> can be classified as hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, immunotoxins, and so forth. Cell biologists put them into generic groups such as teratogens, mutagens, carcinogens, and allergens. Exposure to <b>mycotoxins</b> is mostly by ingestion, but also occurs by the dermal and inhalation routes. The diseases caused by exposure to <b>mycotoxins</b> are known as mycotoxicoses. All <b>mycotoxins</b> are low-molecular-weight natural products (i. e., small molecules) produced as secondary metabolites by filamentous fungi. <b>Mycotoxins</b> usually enter the body via ingestion of contaminated foods, but inhalation of toxigenic spores and direct dermal contact are also important routes. Aims {{of the study was}} to elaborate the importance of determination and examination of <b>mycotoxins</b> in food in R. Macedonia. Material and methods: The rapid methods for detection and measurement of <b>mycotoxins</b> are ELISA, LFD, FPIA and others. They are basic methods for evaluations of <b>mycotoxins</b> in food. Conclusion: Quality assurance of data generated is highly important to reference laboratories monitoring cereals in food or feed, as inaccurate results could have dire consequences for public health or the economy. ...|$|R
25|$|There {{are some}} {{varieties}} of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of <b>mycotoxin</b> via inhalation {{is not possible}} in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, {{as it relates to}} indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|Patulin is a <b>mycotoxin</b> {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} molds, in particular, Aspergillus and Penicillium and Byssochlamys. Most commonly found in rotting apples, in general the amount of patulin in apple products is viewed as a measure {{of the quality of the}} apples used in production. In addition, patulin has been found in other foods such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. While not considered a particularly potent toxin, a number of studies have shown patulin to be genotoxic, which has led some to theorize that it may be a carcinogen, although animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin has shown antimicrobial properties against some microorganisms. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50µg/L in apple juice.|$|E
500|$|Dicoumarol was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} coumarin (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of [...] "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (Galium odoratum, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in licorice, lavender, and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into dicoumarol, in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol {{is considered to be a}} fermentation product and <b>mycotoxin.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to give a {{comprehensive}} overview of the current knowledge on plant metabolites of <b>mycotoxins,</b> also called masked <b>mycotoxins.</b> <b>Mycotoxins</b> are secondary fungal metabolites, toxic to human and animals. Toxigenic fungi often grow on edible plants, thus contaminating food and feed. Plants, as living organisms, can alter the chemical structure of <b>mycotoxins</b> {{as part of their}} defence against xenobiotics. The extractable conjugated or non-extractable bound <b>mycotoxins</b> formed remain present in the plant tissue but are currently neither routinely screened for in food nor regulated by legislation, thus they may be considered masked. Fusarium <b>mycotoxins</b> (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, nivalenol, fusarenon-X, T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, fusaric acid) are prone to metabolisation or binding by plants, but transformation of other <b>mycotoxins</b> by plants (ochratoxin A, patulin, destruxins) has also been described. Toxicological data are scarce, but several studies highlight the potential threat to consumer safety from these substances. In particular, the possible hydrolysis of masked <b>mycotoxins</b> back to their toxic parents during mammalian digestion raises concerns. Dedicated chapters of this article address plant metabolism as well as the occurrence of masked <b>mycotoxins</b> in food, analytical aspects for their determination, toxicology and their impact on stakeholders...|$|R

Mycotoxicoses pose a nutritive-medical, but also a diagnostic problem, because certain <b>mycotoxins</b> cause changes in a number of organs. Diseases caused by <b>mycotoxins</b> are not contagious, they are connected with food and/or specific feed, they are similar to avitaminoses, they are not treated with antibiotics or other medicines, and they do not cause an immunological response in the organism because they are of small molecular mass so that animals are permanently protected from their effects. The content of <b>mycotoxins</b> in food and/or feed in practical conditions more often causes the appearance of chronic mycotoxicoses, and the effects of smaller quantities over a longer time period are the same as of bigger quantities over a short period.
