500|$|Beiderbecke {{died in his}} apartment, No.1G, 43-30 46th Street, in Sunnyside, Queens, on August 6, 1931. The {{week had}} been quite hot, making sleep difficult, and late into the evenings, Beiderbecke had played piano, both to the {{annoyance}} and {{to the delight of}} his neighbors. On the evening of August 6, at about 9.30 pm, his rental agent, George Kraslow, heard noises coming from across the hallway. [...] "His hysterical shouts brought <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> apartment on the run," [...] Kraslow told Philip Evans in 1959.|$|E
500|$|After Bennett's {{first visit}} to Germany there {{followed}} three extended visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his Naiads overture. During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany, ("as fitting a Yorkshireman" [...] as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison: took <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house and gave me the printed score of [...] 'Melusina', and afterwards we supped at the 'Hôtel de Bavière', where all the musical clique feed... The party consist of Mendelssohn, [...] David, Stamity ... and a Mr. Schumann, a musical editor, who expected to see me a fat man with large black whiskers.|$|E

500|$|With this {{increase}} in his practice, Blackstone also saw an increase in his out-of-court work, writing opinions and recommendations for various Oxford colleges, the MP Jonathan Rashleigh and the fourth Earl of Abingdon, who paid him to draft several private Acts of Parliament. In April 1765 Blackstone began to actively seek judicial appointment. In December 1761 he asked Lord Shelburne, a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as Chief Justice of Chester, writing again in July 1762 to [...] "prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Majesty's Notice", anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas. Parliamentary service was considered a [...] "desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would-be English judges", something that did not necessarily bode well for Blackstone. Naturally inarticulate and reticent, he was an infrequent and [...] "indifferent" [...] speaker during his first session of Parliament, speaking only 14 times in seven years. His chosen career did lend him to politics, in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees {{to provide them with}} technical expertise in drafting legislation. He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762, after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up, but lost to George Perrott, a leading Exchequer barrister. The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone, after the appointment of Lord Camden (a Whig) as Lord Chancellor.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{relationship}} with Prince {{in an interview with}} Norwegian station NRK in November 2014 she said, [...] "I did meet him a couple of times. [...] We didn’t get on at all. [...] In fact we had a punch-up." [...] She continued: [...] "He summoned <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house after 'Nothing Compares 2U'. I made it without him. [...] I’d never met him. [...] He summoned <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house – and it’s foolish to do this to an Irish woman – he said he didn’t like me saying bad words in interviews. So I told him to fuck off....He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine." [...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990. Prince said the events she described never took place, replying to the allegations in his song [...] "Days of Wild", which deals with misogyny. In a 2004 interview with Graham Norton, O'Connor claimed that the story was [...] "much exaggerated by the press" [...] and referred to him as [...] "a sweet guy".|$|E
2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, [...] "As soon as I finished it, I turned back to page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied {{that he was a}} fan of my books, and he invited <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E

2500|$|Jean-Pierre Rives {{turned to}} art {{full-time}} after his retirement from rugby in 1984. Art {{had been his}} passion since early boyhood, and he immersed himself in it with dedication that soon earned him critical acclaim. Rives' chosen media became painting and sculpture, which he took up {{when he was still}} a rugby player, after meeting a well-known French sculptor and Prix de Rome winner, Albert Feraud. The two men found a commonality of aesthetics, and Rives moved to a house not far away from Feraud's home in Bagneux. Many of Rives' earlier sculptures were created in Feraud's atelier, where both artists worked side by side. [...] "He invited <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> studio, and I never got out," [...] Rives told Hugh Schofield of the BBC. Rives considers Albert Feraud a great man and an inspiration. Another artist that inspired Rives' work is a Polish-born French painter Ladislas Kijno.|$|E

That's how he {{introduced}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cronies when he dragged me {{along to the}} studio or racetrack... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E
2500|$|However, Li Chengqian's {{plot was}} betrayed by his guard Gegan Chengji (紇干承基), and after an {{investigation}} ordered by Emperor Taizong and conducted by Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Xiao Yu, Li Shiji, {{as well as}} responsible officials from {{the supreme court and}} the legislative and examination bureaus of government, Li Chengqian was removed. [...] The other conspirators, including Hou, were sentenced to death. [...] Emperor Taizong initially considered commuting Hou's death sentence because of his accomplishments, but the other officials opposed, and Emperor Taizong stated to Hou, [...] "I have to bid you, Duke, farewell. [...] From now, I can only see your portrait!" [...] Both he and Hou wept. [...] As Hou was about to be beheaded, he stated to the general overseeing the execution, [...] "I, Hou Junji, am not the type to commit treason, but I stumbled many times and reached this point. [...] But as I destroyed two kingdoms as a general, please speak for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>His</b> Imperial Majesty to request that I could have a son remaining to carry on the lineage, on the basis of my accomplishments." [...] Emperor Taizong, when he heard this, pardoned Hou's wife and children but exiled them to the modern Guangdong region, and confiscated his properties.|$|E

2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me what I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
