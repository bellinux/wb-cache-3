5000|$|A {{sideline}} to the Il-62 story concerns alleged industrial espionage. As the Il-62 {{was developed}} {{at about the}} same time as the VC10, to which it bears a marked external resemblance, British Cold War commentators implied that the VC10 design may have been copied by dubbing the Il-62 the [...] "VC10-ski." [...] (Thiel, 2001). No evidence of this was ever presented. There are significant differences between the Il-62 and the VC10, as the Russian type is larger, lifts a greater load and is suited only to developed airports vis-a-vis the British type's adaptability to [...] "up-country" [...] bases. Unlike the VC10, the Il-62 uses conservative technology, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> linkages, and is an entirely civil machine, whereas the VC10 was designed to double as an airlifter as well as a military freighter. The Il-62 found more buyers and was built in larger numbers than the VC10 (292 vs 54), and was still in civilian service (as at 2016) whereas the VC10 has long been retired from that role (in 1966 BOAC described the aircraft as uneconomic and asked for government subsidies to continue its operation. At the end of its civilian career some VC10s were used by Britain's Royal Air Force in support roles). China and Czechoslovakia were two countries that considered buying the VC10 (for CAAC and Czechoslovak Airlines, respectively), before opting for the Il-62 (see VC10: Sales and airline service).|$|E

40|$|Virtual <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> for the {{optimization}} {{of steady}} and unsteady airloads on a compressor cascade are assessed numerically. The effects of mechanical surfaces are realized with plasma actuators, located {{both on the}} pressure and on the suction side of the blade trailing edge. Suction side plasma actuation is thought to reproduce the effects of mechanical wing spoilers, whereas pressure side plasma actuation is meant {{to act as a}} mechanical Gurney flap. Indeed, actuators are operated to generate an induced velocity field that is opposite relative to the direction of the freestream velocity. As a consequence, controlled recirculating flow areas are generated, which modify the effective mean line shape, as well as the position of the Kutta condition application point—and in turn the developed airloads. Proper triggering of pressure/suction side actuation is found to be effective in altering the blade loading, with effects comparable to those of <b>mechanical</b> <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Traveling wave mode simulations show that significant reductions in the peaks of the blade pitching moment can be achieved on the whole spectrum of interblade phase angles. It is proved that virtual <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> can provide effective load alleviation on the cascade, with potential remarkable reduction of fatigue phenomena...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical jars {{look like}} a long, tubular piece of {{machined}} metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' {{depends on how much}} sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the <b>mechanical</b> jars, <b>controlled</b> at <b>surface</b> by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.|$|R

Hydraulically powered <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength.

It is considered that the load (input disturbance) is unmeasurable, only its bounds corresponding to normal operation are known. To solve the fault detection problem, a detector was proposed for a class of linear control systems that can be implemented with low computational costs. The method is applicable for electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) with unknown load. The proposed fault detection approach is validated through simulations for jamming detection of aircraft <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> driven by EHA...|$|R

40|$|With a diffusion-assisted post-crosslinking method, polymer {{microspheres}} containing epoxy {{groups are}} crosslinked with ethylenediamine (EDA), gradually diffusing and reacting in the particles via amine/epoxy ring-opening reactions as confirmed by FT-IR and DSC results. Using a microcompression test, {{we find that}} the mechanical property (deformability under different applied force, breaking points, and recoverability) of the crosslinked microspheres is varied when different amounts of EDA are used in the system, resulting from different crosslinking density of the particles. An additional feature of the EDA treatment is to generate amine groups {{on the surface of the}} microspheres, enabling us to produce hybrid microspheres. We exploit them as immobilization sites for gold nanoparticles, forming gold-coated crosslinked microspheres. We also introduce a sequential functionalization method to fabricate crosslinked microspheres with selective functional groups on the surface. This approach can be a facile method to produce functional microspheres with <b>controlled</b> <b>mechanical</b> and <b>surface</b> properties...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} types of actuators have been previously investigated as flow control devices. Potential applications include the control of boundary layer separation in external flows, as well as jet engine inlet and diffuser flow control. The operating principles for such devices are typically based on either <b>mechanical</b> deflection of <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> (which include MEMS flap devices), mass injection (which includes combustion driven jet actuators), or through the use of synthetic jets (diaphragm devices which produce a pulsating jet with no net mass flow). This paper introduces some of the initial flow visualization work related {{to the development of a}} relatively new type of combustion-driven jet actuator that has been proposed based on a pulse detonation principle. The device is designed to utilize localized detonation of a premixed fuel (Hydrogen) -air mixture to periodically inject a jet of gas transversely into the primary flow. Initial testing with airflow successfully demonstrated resonant conditions within the range of acoustic frequencies expected for the design. Schlieren visualization of the pulsating air jet structure revealed axially symmetric vortex flow, along with the formation of shocks. Flow visualization of the first successful sustained oscillation condition is also demonstrated for one configuration of the current test section. Future testing will explore in more detail the onset of resonant combustion and the approach to conditions of sustained resonant detonation...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage.
