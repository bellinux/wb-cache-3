40|$|Background - The high {{prevalence}} of gluten sensitivity {{in patients with}} stiff-person syndrome (SPS) lead us to investigate the relationship between gluten sensitivity and GAD-antibody-associated diseases. Methods - We used ELISA assays for anti-GAD and for serological markers of gluten sensitivity. Patients were recruited from clinics based at the Royal Hallamshire hospital, Sheffield, UK. Patients with gluten sensitivity were followed up after {{the introduction of a}} gluten-free diet and serological testing was repeated. Results - Six of seven (86 %) patients with SPS were positive for anti-GAD, <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> 109 U/ml; This compared with 9 / 90 (11 %) patients with idiopathic sporadic ataxia, <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> 32 U/ml, 16 / 40 (40 %) patients with gluten ataxia, <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> 25 U/ml, and 6 / 10 patients with type 1 diabetes only, <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> 8 U/ml. None of 32 patients with celiac disease only, and of 40 patients with genetic ataxia were positive for anti-GAD. The titre of anti-GAD reduced following the introduction of a gluten-free diet in patients with SPS who had serological evidence of gluten sensitivity. The same was observed in patients with gluten ataxia and anti-GAD antibodies. This was also associated with clinical improvement. Conclusion - These findings suggest a link between gluten sensitivity and GAD antibody-associated diseases...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies {{to human}} {{skeletal}} muscle myosin were detected in 90 % of sera from patients with polymyositis by radioimmunoassay using purified human myosin as antigen, and the <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> was 4. 24 X 10 (- 10) M. The incidence and the <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of anti-myosin antibodies {{were significantly higher}} than in patients without polymyositis. Anti-myosin antibody titres correlated with steroid therapy in polymyositis patients. Titres in untreated patients with polymyositis correlated with the severity of muscle weakness. Radioimmunoassay for anti-myosin antibodies should prove to be useful in the diagnosis of polymyositis and the evaluation of clinical state...|$|E
40|$|In chronic active {{hepatitis}} (CAH) {{evidence exists}} that circulating autoantibodies against liver specific lipoprotein (LSP) could {{play a role in}} the development of hepatocellular injury. We evaluated the presence of autoantibodies in CAH against LSP using rabbit LSP, as antigen in a radioimmunoprecipitation test. Fifty-one patients with histologically diagnosed CAH were investigated. Among these 16 were HBsAg+, 15 were HBsAg-/anti-HBc+, 10 were non-A, non-B, 10 were autoimmune CAH. Anti-LSP were detected in six of 16 (37 %) HBsAg+ (<b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of 1 : 198); four of 15 (33 %) HBsAg-/anti-HBc+ (<b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of 1 : 246); two of 10 (20 %) non-A, non-B (<b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of 1 : 185); seven of 10 (70 %) autoimmune CAH (<b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of 1 : 307). No correlation was evident between the titre of anti-LSP and the values of AST, bilirubin or IgG. The findings seem to be consistent with the following conclusions: (a) CAH patients develop an humoral immune response to determinants in LSP which are not species specific. This is further evidence that rabbit LSP could be considered a suitable alternative to the human preparation in evaluation of autoimmunity in CAH and (b) the different behaviour of anti-LSP in patients with viral CAH (B, non-A, non-B) in respect of patients with autoimmune CAH suggests a variable importance of these antibodies in the mechanism of ongoing liver cell injury according to the various types of CAH...|$|E

40|$|Two cold-recombinant {{influenza}} A (H 1 N 1) viruses {{were tested}} in several groups of human volunteers. Only minor clinical symptoms were seen and no febrile reactions occurred. With serologically primed individuals virus shedding was low, but a high proportion showed rises in serum antibody levels after vaccination and <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> were high. With serologically unprimed volunteers shedding was high, about 75 % yielding viruses but only at low titres and for a short duration. No revertant viruses were found {{and there was no}} evidence of transmission to potentially susceptible individuals housed in close contact to the vaccinees. Serum antibody responses with unprimed volunteers were, however, low. Only about one half showed increases in serum antibody titres after vaccination and <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> were low. Nevertheless, challenge with live attenuated virus indicated a high degree of protection based on virological evidence of infection...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the persistence of}} bactericidal antibody titres following immunisation with serogroup C meningococcal glycoconjugate vaccine at age 6 - 15 years {{in order to examine}} changes in persistence of antibodies with age. Design: Observational study. Setting: Secondary and tertiary educational institutions in the United Kingdom. Participants: Healthy adolescents aged 11 - 20 years previously immunised between 6 and 15 years of age with one of the three serogroup C meningococcal vaccines. Intervention: Serum obtained by venepuncture. Main outcome measures: Percentage of participants with (rabbit complement) serum bactericidal antibody titres of at least 1 : 8; geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of serogroup C meningococcal serum bactericidal antibody. Results: Five years after immunisation, 84. 1 % (95 % confidence interval 81. 6 % to 86. 3 %) of 987 participants had a bactericidal antibody titre of at least 1 : 8. Geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of bactericidal antibody were significantly lower in 11 - 13 year olds (147, 95 % confidence interval 115 to 188) than in 14 - 16 year olds (300, 237 to 380) and 17 - 20 year olds (360, 252 to 515) (P< 0. 0001 for both comparisons). Within these age bands, no significant difference in geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of bactericidal antibody between recipients of the different serogroup C meningococcal vaccines was seen. More than 70 % of participants had received a vaccine from one manufacturer; in this cohort, geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> were higher in those immunised at aged 10 years or above than in those immunised before the age of 10. Conclusions: Higher concentrations of bactericidal antibody are seen five years after immunisation with serogroup C meningococcal vaccine at age 10 years or above than in younger age groups, possibly owing to immunological maturation. This provides support for adolescent immunisation programmes to generate sustained protection against serogroup C meningococcal disease not only for the vaccine recipients but also, through the maintenance of herd immunity, for younger children.

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on 86 {{children}} aged 1 - 14 years who had titres of antibodies against poliovirus type 3 lower than 1 : 32 and against type 2 higher than 1 : 4. After a booster dose of poliomyelitis vaccine type 2 + 3, seroconversion took place in 44 (90 %) of 49 children whose original titre was lower than 1 : 4 and the geometrical <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> increased to 1 : 244. Of 37 children with low original titres of antibodies against type 3, i. e., 1 : 4, 1 : 8, or 1 : 16, the titre increased fourfold or more in 31 (84 %) and the geometrical <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> rose to 1 : 175.

40|$|Repeated {{hybridization}} {{and selection}} among wild-type isolates produced strains of Aspergillus nidulans with increased penicillin titre. Four independent selection lines were established, each originating from a sexual cross between two different heterokaryon-incompatible wild-type isolates. In each generation, two selected high-titre sister strains were crossed {{to produce the}} next generation. An initial increase in titre was obtained in each line, but after four or five generations of selection the genetic variation was considerably reduced {{and the rate of}} response to selection had decreased. From a base population of wild-type isolates with a <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of 8. 6 unitslml the progeny <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> was raised to between 16 and 20 units/ml in each line. The gradual nature of the response suggests that a number of genes determine penicillin titre in the wild-type isolates used. The gene action throughout the selection programme was predominantly additive...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} reactogenicity and {{immunogenicity}} of an inactivated hepatitis A vaccine {{in two different}} immunisation schedules. DESIGN [...] Randomised trial. SETTING [...] One London teaching hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 104 healthy adult volunteers (71 men, 33 women aged 19 - 60). INTERVENTIONS [...] Hepatitis A vaccine to group 1 (54 volunteers) at 0, 1, and 2 months and to group 2 (50) at 0, 1, and 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Symptoms at and after each dose; liver function, hepatitis A virus specific serum immune response; and responses in saliva and parotid fluid in immunised volunteers and subjects with natural immunity. RESULTS [...] The vaccine was well tolerated; 97 % (96 / 99) and 100 % of those immunised developed serum antibody after one and two doses of vaccine respectively. Geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> increased progressively after each dose and were significantly higher in men but not women in group 2 after the third dose (ratio between geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> 0. 265, 95 % confidence interval 0. 18 to 0. 39; p less than 0. 001). At one year this group-sex interaction was absent; geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> for both sexes were significantly higher in group 2 (ratio 0. 330, 0. 227 to 0. 478; p less than 0. 0001). Antibody responses {{were not significantly different}} between the groups at two years. Compared with naturally infected subjects immunised volunteers developed poor or undetectable virus specific IgG and IgA responses in saliva and parotid fluid. CONCLUSIONS [...] The vaccine was safe and highly immunogenic, and the differences in the immune responses in saliva and parotid fluid are unlikely to affect its efficacy...|$|R

40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} techniques employing sheep monospecific antisera {{to human}} IgG subclasses on unfixed cryostat sections have revealed the IgG subclass distribution in autoantibodies to pancreatic islets (ICA), thyroid epithelial (TMA), gastric parietal (PCA) and adrenal fasciculata (AdA) cells. Whereas antibodies were detected {{in all four}} subclasses in 21 of 27 TMA positive sera (<b>mean</b> IgG <b>titre</b> 29 +/- 5. 2), 13 of 15 PCA (<b>mean</b> IgG <b>titre</b> 41 +/- 3. 8) and eight of 14 AdA sera (<b>mean</b> IgG <b>titre</b> 10 +/- 3. 1), only four of 35 ICA positive sera (<b>mean</b> IgG <b>titre</b> 45 +/- 3. 6) reacted in all four subclasses. Approximately 50 % of ICA positive sera showed a restricted polyclonal response to the 'common' pancreatic antigen and 12 % of these sera reacted only with IgG 2 subclass. The restriction rarely applied to co-existent thyrogastric antibodies in these sera and was independent of the ability of ICA to fix complement. Lesser subclass restrictions were observed in antibody responses to the 'common' antigen of the adrenal cortex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Older spousal {{caregivers}} of dementia patients {{have been found}} to show a relatively poor antibody response to medical vaccination. The present case control study compared the antibody responses to vaccination of younger parental {{caregivers of}} children with developmental disabilities and parents of typically developing children. Methods: At baseline assessment, 32 parents of children with developmental disabilities and 29 parents of typically developing children completed standard measures of perceived stress and child problem behaviours. They also provided a blood sample and were then vaccinated with the thymus-dependent trivalent influenza vaccine. Further blood samples were taken at 1 - and 6 -month follow-ups. Results: Relative to parents of typically developing children (<b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> = 458, SD = 155. 7 at 1 -month and <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> = 265, SD = 483. 0 at 6 -month followup) caregivers (<b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> = 219, SD = 528. 4 at 1 -month and 86, SD = 55. 0 at 6 - month) mounted a poorer antibody response than controls to the B/Malaysia strain of the vaccine. It was those caregivers reporting more child problem behaviours that tended to show the weakest antibody response. Conclusion: The negative impact of caregiving on antibody response to vaccination would not appear to be restricted to older spousal caregivers, but is also evident in younger parents caring for children with developmental disabilities. The behavioural characteristics of the care recipients may be a determinant of whether or not antibody response to vaccination is compromised...|$|E

40|$|In a {{study of}} a Caucasian {{population}} in Western Australia the prevalence of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was 41 % in the 9 - to 10 -year age group, 80 % in the 16 to 19 -year age group and 92 % in young adults. The age-specific annual seroconversion rates indicated two peaks of primary EBV infection in the population studied - one under 5 {{years of age and}} the other at adolescence. The geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> rose with age, from 23 at 5 - 6 years to 53 at 36 - 40 years. It was shown that in 73 families studied there was evidence of probable spread of EBV infection among siblings, particularly between those of the same sex. Serological study of patients with infectious mononucleosis indicated that 100 % of those examined had antibody to EBV and the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> was elevated to 210. Rising titres and seroconversion was demonstrated in these patients together with successful establishment of EBV-carrying cell lines from the peripheral blood in two-thirds of the cases...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out during an {{outbreak}} of rotavirus type 2 infection in a neonatal nursery to determine the protective role of antibodies in cord blood and breast milk. The range, distribution, and geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of rotavirus-specific antibody in the cord blood were similar among rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative neonates, {{and the amount of}} virus excreted did not correlate with antibody levels. Despite the protective effect of breast feeding, the pattern of rotavirus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in the expressed breast milk of mothers of babies who were rotavirus excreters and non-excreters was similar. Nevertheless, a higher proportion of expressed breast milk samples contained rotavirus-specific IgA group 2 (92 %) and type 2 (97 %) specific antibodies than type I (67 %) antibodies, and the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of group 2 and type 2 specific antibodies were tenfold higher than type I antibodies. Among breast-fed babies who excreted rotavirus there was no correlation between type 2 rotavirus-specific IgA antibodies in expressed breast milk and the amount of neonatal virus excretion.

40|$|Thirty (30) {{vials of}} Newcastle Disease (ND) vaccine. La Sota were {{procured}} locally and tested for potency when stored {{under conditions of}} irregular power supply. The vaccines were of the same batch and were eighteen months to the expiration time. The potency of the vaccines was tested using Haemagglutination (HA) test before storage. The vaccines’ immunogenicity was determined in a batch of 250, 3 weeks old white cockerels after which the vaccines were stored in the refrigerator with two-third of the storage period at 0 - 4 o C and the remaining one third at room temperature of 26 - 30 o C. During the study, the methods of vaccine storage were alternated frequently to reflect the frequent power outages. The humoral immune response of the vaccinated chickens was estimated by Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) test. The potency of the vaccines was tested on days 28, 56, 84, 112 and 140 post storage. On day 140, another batch of 250, 3 weeks old white cockerels were vaccinated with a vial from the stock and the humoral immune response of these chickens was evaluated at 3 weeks post vaccination.

40|$|Ability of a {{synthetic}} Aluminium-Magnesium Silicate [AMS] to inhibit activities of canine parvovirus [CPV] {{was investigated in}} vitro and in vivo. Five samples of CPV isolated in Nigeria, were each incubated with equal amount of {{a synthetic}} AMS on a volume to weight [v/w] basis, for one hour and then centrifuged. Viral titres of the supernatants were tested by the haemagglutination [HA] test and their <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> compared with <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of portions of same viral samples, not incubated with the AMS.

As control, five puppies and five adult dogs from same class as the experimental dogs were similarly infected but were not treated. Incubating parvovirus with AMS reduced its load from mean HA titre 825. 6 ± 261. 1 to mean HA, 270. 8 ± 132. 1 [p < 0. 05].

40|$|Single-dose {{immunization}} against tetanus was {{studied in}} 511 previously non-immunized residents of rural villages in Upper Volta. Males and females were equally represented {{and a wide}} age range was covered. A single dose of adsorbed tetanus toxoid containing 17. 5 Lf units of toxoid and 3. 86 mg of aluminium phosphate per 0. 5 ml dose was used. Blood samples were taken 7 days, 2 months, and 12 months after immunization, and serum antitoxin titres were determined by neutralization titrations in mice. Adverse reactions were negligible. Only 2 participants gave evidence of prior immunization by developing detectable antitoxin titres after 7 days; they were eliminated from the study.

40|$|The {{detection}} of immunoglobulin (1 g) G and IgM antibodies to dengue 1 virus was studied {{by a simple}} enzyme immunoassay, in which infected cultured cells infected with dengue virus were used as antigen (EIA-ICC). Detection of anti-dengue 1 IgG by EIA-ICC was correlated with haemagglutination assays. EIA-ICC anti-dengue 1 IgM detection was less sensi-tive than IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IgG and IgM responses in dengue 1 infection were studied by EIA-ICC, using sera collected at different intervals after onset of illness: IgM and IgG appeared on the 4 th day of disease; the highest IgM <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> were detected on the 7 th day and IgM was not detected in sera obtained after the 60 th day; the highest <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of anti-dengue 1 IgG were seen in sera obtained between 22 and 30 d after onset of illness. EIA-ICCs for 6 flaviviruses and 1 alphavirus were conducted with sera from patients infected with dengue 1, and primary and secondary infections of other flaviviruses. The results showed that anti-dengue 1 IgG detection was sensitive, and the antibodies were cross-reactive among the flaviviruses. Anti-dengue 1 IgM detected in dengue 1 patients was mostly type specific. The pattern of secondary dengue infection, i. e. the presence of IgG and a low titre or absence of IgM antibodies, was observed in the sera of 6 patients obtained {{in the first week}} after onset of illness.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study of}} safety of {{combined}} vaccination against myxomatosis and VHD was performed using a duly reconstituted vaccine {{made of a}} live homologous myxomatosis component SG 33 strain and of an inactivated VHD component in adjuvant AG 88 strain. The vaccine was administered intradermally to {{a representative sample of}} pet rabbits. A local reaction at the vaccine administration area was frequently observed from 2 to 3 days after vaccination in young animals. These local reactions were less frequently observed in adults. The reaction consisted of a local rash which usually disappeared 2 to 3 days after vaccination (maximum 1 week). The immune response following vaccination was monitored by antibody production against VHD and myxomatosis using, for the VHD vaccine component, an IHA titration method, and, for myxomatosis component, an ELISA titration method. Antibody production after vaccination was observed for both components. Maximum VHD IHA titre (192 ± 130) was obtained in vaccinated animals one month after vaccine administration. Antibodies were still detected in these animals one month later (94 ± 39). <b>Mean</b> <b>titre</b> obtained in unvaccinated controls was equal to 0. Maximum myxomatosis ELISA titre (10518 ± 2417) was obtained two months after vaccine administration. <b>Mean</b> <b>titre</b> obtained {{at the same time in}} unvaccinated controls was close to 0 (889 ± 744) ...|$|E

40|$|Haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) {{antibodies}} to BK virus, including BK-virus-specific IgM, were determined {{before and after}} renal transplantation in 20 patients, in 57 patients with malignant disease, and in 66 healthy controls, Before transplantation 11 of the renal transplant recipients were seronegative, but eight later serocconverted, two before and six after transplantation. Twenty of the patients with malignant disease and 22 controls were also seronegative. The geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of BK HAI antibodies was significantly higher among transplanted patients (1 / 180) than among controls (1 / 90). BK-virus-specific IgM antibody was detected in seven renal transplant recipients, six patients with malignant disease, and 13 healthy controls. In transplant recipients BK-virus-specific IgM antibody usually persisted throughout {{the duration of the}} study, and studies on controls from whom second serum samples were available suggested that they too had persistent BK-virus-specific IgM responses. The geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of BK-virus-specific IgM HAI antibody was significantly greater in post-transplantation sera (1 / 223) than in control sera (1 / 28). The specificity of the detection of BK-virus-specific IgM HAI antibody was confirmed by direct visualisation of antibody by immune electron microscopy. The persistence of BK-virus-specific IgM suggested that BK virus continued to provide an antigenic stimulus. Nevertheless, there was no obvious association between the serological findings and any clinical features, and prospective studies will be needed to elucidate any such association...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of IgG antibodies to Bordetella pertussis {{was investigated in}} serum samples from 550 subjects, aged 4 – 24 years, to determine the optimal age for booster immunisation.

Geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of anti-pertussis antibodies in subjects aged 4 – 6 years were significantly lower than those in other age groups, which reflects waning immunity following vaccination. High positive titres in older children and adolescents suggested acquired B. pertussis infection, and booster doses at the ages of 7 and 15 years are therefore suggested...|$|R

Among the 51 persons who developed antibodies, the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> was 1 : 57 and among the other 13 it was 1 : 49. Although the trial was conducted in adult females, the number of side effects from the vaccine was remarkably scanty and insignificant. This trial would seem to emphasize the importance of avoiding the use of rubella vaccine in women of child-bearing age without first excluding pregnancy with meticulous care and using active and controllable contraceptive methods for the two months following vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Studies in {{experimental}} animals suggest that antibody responses to certain polysaccharide antigens may be restricted in IgG subclass distribution. To determine if human antibodies to pneumococcal polysaccharides are similarly restricted we measured the IgG subclass specific response to immunization with purified polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. For the type 3 pneumococcal antigen, the geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> of IgG 2 antibody was {{significantly greater than}} that of IgG 1, IgG 3 or IgG 4, in both pre-immunization and post-immunization sera. A significant rise in <b>mean</b> <b>titre,</b> comparing pre- to post-immunization sera was observed only for IgG 2 antibody. Similar predominance of IgG 2 antibody was found for pneumococcal polysaccharides types 6, 18, 19 and 23. In contrast, antibody to the protein antigen tetanus toxoid was exclusively of the IgG 1 subclass. Patients with IgA/IgG 2 deficiency demonstrated a normal IgG response to tetanus, a normal IgM response to pneumococcal polysaccharides, but no IgG antibody to pneumococcal antigens. IgG 2 subclass restriction of antibody to pneumococcal polysaccharides suggest that these antigens may elicit an immune response analogous to the murine type 2 T-cell independent immunogens which show IgG subclass restriction and the requirement of a mature B cell subset defined by the Lyb 5 + alloantiserum. Our findings support the possibility of subclass-specific inducing or regulating mechanisms for human responses to carbohydrate or polysaccharide antigens...|$|E
40|$|Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne {{infection}} of humans, and its diffusion has increased worldwide. In 2007 an outbreak occurred in Italy. In this study, the antibody response of 133 patients followed up {{starting from the}} acute phase of infection was investigated. Antibody titres were periodically scored up to 1 year since the infection: 82. 7 % of the IgM antibody disappeared within 12 months, and the IgG response lasted longer than 12 months. Nevertheless, the IgG <b>mean</b> <b>titre</b> was lower in 95. 5 % of patients {{at the end of}} follow-up, thus suggesting a decrease within a relatively short period...|$|E
40|$|Background: Memory {{responses}} require immune competence. We {{assessed the}} influence of priming with AS 03 -adjuvanted pandemic vaccine (PandemrixH) on memory responses of HIV patients, kidney recipients (SOT) and healthy controls (HC). Method: Participants (HIV: 197, SOT: 53; HC: 156) were enrolled in a prospective study and 390 / 406 (96 %) completed it. All had been primed in 2009 / 2010 with 1 (HC) or 2 (patients) doses of PandemrixH, and were boosted with the 2010 / 2011 seasonal influenza vaccine. Geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> and seroprotection rates were measured 12 months after priming and 4 weeks after boosting. Primary and memory responses were directly compared in 191 participants (HCW: 69, HIV: 71, SOT: 51) followed during 2 consecutive seasons...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{neonates}} born to HBsAg-positive {{mothers were}} vaccinated with a 20 μg {{dose of the}} SmithKline Biologicals recombinant DNA yeast-derived vaccine within 24 hours after birth, with similar inoculations repeated 1 and 2 months later. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} recombinant vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic. A 100 % seroconversion rate was achieved 4 months after the vaccine dose and the anti-HBs geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> progressively rose from 14 to 31, 279 and 361 IU/l at months 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Although a longer period of observation and comparison with a historical control group are needed to evaluate its protective efficacy in this high-risk population, the fact that no vaccinated newborns have been infected is encouraging.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine possible maternally transferred antibodies (maAb) against rabies in raccoon dogs. Ten cubs born from a rabiesimmune animal were bled on days 31, 36, 43, 50, 57 and 64 post partum. The geometric <b>mean</b> <b>titres</b> of the cubs were 1. 19, 1. 18, 0. 45, 0. 25, 0. 25 and 0. 16 IU/ml, respectively. Up to 36 days post partum maAb were detected in all cubs at levels ≥ 0. 5 IU/ml and at day 56 post partum all animals had maAb levels < 0. 5 IU/ml. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that vaccine baits should not be distributed before July if the vaccination campaign is aimed at immunizing young raccoon dogs as well...|$|R
