40|$|To {{ensure the}} {{desirable}} vacuum in the milking machines, use is currently made predominantly of rotary vacuum pumps. These vacuum pumps {{are driven by}} a squirrel-cage induction motor. Until recently, the vacuum in the system to achieve the required value was controlled by a <b>main</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sucking in ambient air into the system. During the milking process itself and during other activities (flushing, sanitation), this control method consumed {{a large amount of}} electricity. The technical solution to electricity demand reduction was introduced with the emergence and development of frequency converters. The frequency converters control the operation of the asynchronous electric motor so that the actual delivery of the vacuum pumps equals the volume of air sucked into the vacuum pipe. The motor supply by the frequency converter brings about a host of adverse phenomena. This paper is dedicated to motor heating and heat losses {{on the surface of the}} electric motor at different regulations of vacuum in milking machines. The objective of the paper is to determine the immediate specific heat flows along the surface of the electric motor of the milking machine during milking using a control valve regulation and a control using the frequency converter, and compare the resulting value.

40|$|Purpose: The {{development}} of a control valve for closed circuit requires comprehensive technologies in the overall precision machinery industry, from the {{development of}} casting materials for the housing to various types of parts. The {{development of a}} new type of control valve would have great advantage with a long lifecycle. Therefore, it is necessary to secure the MCV (<b>Main</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Valve)</b> development technology that applies various sensors. This paper aims at providing a fundamental base for the establishment of design systems including the flow chamber design database of the MCV for wheel loaders, strength and rigidity design system, and the system for energy efficiency improvement. Particularly, this study set up the basic design database for the flow chamber design to establish the flow chamber design database, and secured the stability of the flow chamber from the basic design stage. In addition, major design variables were determined by utilizing a statistical technique in order to design such flow chamber. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the I-DEAS to analyze the MCV structure characteristics. In addition, it uses the factorial design and sensitivity analysis to select important factors for the MCV design. Findings: This study establishes the unit flow chamber database for the MCV housing unit and the governing equation for the flow chamber. Research limitations/implications: Since the MCV damage often occurs due to the problem with the material itself and in the manufacturing process, it is difficult to tell clearly whether it occurred as the MCV reached the failure pressure. Practical implications: The basic data needed to design the MCV can be provided, and the required time for the design and the reliability of the design can be reduced and improved respectively. Originality/value: The verification of the design factors obtained from the flow analysis and structural analysis as well as the DOE was made by fabricating a sample MCV and performing tests on it...|$|E
40|$|Recently CNH {{developed}} {{a new series of}} wheel excavators equipped with a Electronic Control Unit (ECU) that use a new control software. It was critical to test and validate the design of this new control system before deployment to ensure high customer satisfaction and reducing warranty costs. Test on a Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform accelerates the verification and validation process. A validated HIL set-up, being a repeatable and reliable test platform with a short turnaround time is ideal for developing standardized processes for ECU testing and calibration. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show the development of the wheel excavator model for HIL application. In particular the model of the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical system of the wheel excavator arm are reported. An analytical model of the hydraulic system includes orifice flow equations, fluid compressibility equations for all the oil volumes, as well as the force balance equations for all the cylinders. In order to describe the motion of the excavator arm both kinematic and dynamic models were developed from the fundamental theory for robotic manipulators [1]. The kinematic model is derived following the Denavit-Hartenberg guidelines while the dynamic model is created by writing Newton- Euler equations for each link of the arm. By combining the equations, a dynamical model in terms of the joint variables is obtained. The mathematical model have many nonlinearities because of nonlinear opening characteristics and dead zone of <b>main</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> geometrical relationship in the kinematic model, frictions, ecc. These aspects make modeling very complex. The model has been built in a modular approach so that model updates due to a modification of the system configurations could be performed starting from available model, by single component specifications, thereby reducing the total effort for the new models. The model must have same specific property due to the HIL application; the first of all is that the model must run in real time. A second general target is that the developed model easily fit into the available simulation models environment for HIL closed-loop simulation, in particular it must turn employing maximum 15 % of resources at fixed time step 1 ms and with one of the following numerical integrators typologies: ODE 1 to ODE 4.

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R
