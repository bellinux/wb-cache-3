The changes of water quality may induce the variation of metal’s corrosion behavior. In this paper, carbon steel as common material of hydraulic structure was the investigated object, and its early corrosion behavior affected by microbes (algae and microbe) in eutrophic lakes was studied using immersion test, electrochemical measurements and infra-red spectrometry techniques. The experimental waters were natural eutrophic water and microbes-cleaned water. The former was fetched from eutrophic East Lake in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and the preparation of later was making natural eutrophic water sterilized and algae removed by UV radiation. In order to present the changes of carbon steel’s corrosion behavior in natural eutrophic freshwater with and without microbes, comparative experiments were conducted in lab. Both weight loss method and electrochemical techniques showed that, the corrosion rates of carbon steel decreased in early stage for the influence of microbe existence.

This thesis work is a step towardsfulfilling this gap by studying the Davis tube experiment performed on 13 different samples fromLeveäniemi <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> deposit. The methodology adapted to map WLIMS concentrate quality includesstudy and analysis of feed, DT and WLIMS. Analyses were made using experimental data, processingdata using some analytical tools, some data-processing tools and post processing tools.

The results fromthis study has reviled that DT can be used to predict WLIMS concentrate quality to an acceptablelevel of confidence. Furthermore, results show that a combination of DT and WLIMS informationproduce very accurate and highly reliable models for predicting and mapping WLIMS concentratequality. This work serves as the first step towards studying an unexplored field pertaining to magneticiron ore concentrate and has opened door to possible future work that could take this work a stepfurther.
