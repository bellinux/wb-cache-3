40|$|Projected {{increases}} in air temperature and precipitation due {{to climate change}} in Arctic wetlands could dramatically affect ecosystem function. As a consequence, {{it is important to}} define controls on evapotranspiration, the major pathway of water loss from these systems. We quantified the multi-year controls on midday Arctic coastal wetland evapotranspiration, measured with the eddy covariance method at two vegetated, drained thaw lake basins near Barrow, Alaska. Variations in near-surface soil <b>moisture</b> and atmospheric <b>vapor</b> pressure deficits were found to have nonlinear effects on midday evapotranspiration rates. Vapor pressure deficits (VPD) near 0. 3 kPa appeared to be an important hydrological threshold, allowing latent heat flux to persistently exceed sensible heat flux. Dry (compared to wet) soils increased bulk surface resistance (water-limited). Wet soils favored ground heat flux and therefore limited the energy available to sensible and latent heat flux (energy-limited). Thus, midday evapotranspiration was suppressed from both dry and wet soils but through different mechanisms. We also found that wet soils (ponding excluded) combined with large VPD, resulted in an increased bulk surface resistance and therefore suppressing evapotranspiration below its potential rate (Priestley-Taylor &alpha; < 1. 26). This was likely caused by the limited ability of mosses to transfer moisture during large atmospheric demands. Ultimately, in addition to net radiation, the various controlling factors on midday evapotranspiration (i. e., near-surface soil <b>moisture,</b> atmospheric <b>vapor</b> pressure, and the limited ability of saturated mosses to transfer water during high VPD) resulted in an average evapotranspiration rate of up to 75 % of the potential evapotranspiration rate. These multiple limitations on midday evapotranspiration rates have the potential to moderate interannual variation of total evapotranspiration and reduce excessive water loss in a warmer climate. Combined with the prevailing maritime winds and projected {{increases in}} precipitation, these curbing mechanisms will likely prevent extensive future soil drying and hence maintain the presence of coastal wetlands...|$|R
40|$|Spray {{polyurethane}} foams (SPFs) have {{advantages over}} alternative insulation methods {{because they provide}} air sealing in complex assemblies, particularly roofs. Spray foam can provide the thermal, air, and vapor control layers in both new and retrofit construction. Unvented roof strategies with open cell and closed cell SPF insulation sprayed to the underside of roof sheathing have been used since the mid- 1990 s to provide durable and efficient building enclosures. However, there have been isolated incidents of failures (either sheathing rot or SPF delamination) that raise some general concerns about the hygrothermal performance and durability of these systems. The primary risks for roof systems are rainwater leaks, condensation from diffusion and air leakage, and built-in construction moisture. This project directly investigated rain and indirectly investigated built-in construction <b>moisture</b> and <b>vapor</b> drives.

30|$|When panel {{products}} absorb <b>moisture,</b> {{either in}} <b>vapor</b> or liquid form, overall TS occurs {{both from the}} swelling of the particles themselves and the springback [30, 31]. Particle swelling occurs because wood, from which the particles are made, is naturally hygroscopic. Furthermore, absorbed moisture could cause bond breakage and bring about particle separation. Springback {{is a result of}} releasing the stress of the board, which is caused by the compression of pressing. Nevertheless, when a board desorbs moisture and returns to a dry stage, there is part of the overall swelling never recovers to its original form. That is springback which generates permanent change of thickness and henceforth called irrecoverable TS.|$|R
