40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method, {{developed by the}} authors, for manufacturing polymer composites with the matrix manufactured in a layered manner (via 3 D printing – Fused Deposition Modeling) out of a thermoplastic material. As an example of practical application of this method, functional prototypes are presented, which were used as elements of foundry tooling – patterns for sand molding. In case of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>prototype</b> castings or short series of products, foundries usually cooperate with modeling studios, which produce patterns by conventional, subtractive manufacturing technologies. If patterns have complex shapes, this results in high manufacturing costs and significantly longer time of tooling preparation. The method proposed by the authors allows manufacturing functional prototypes {{in a short time}} thanks to utilizing capabilities of additive manufacturing (3 D printing) technology. Thanks to using two types of materials simultaneously (ABS combined with chemically hardened resins), the produced prototypes are capable of carrying increased loads. Moreover, the method developed by the authors is characterized by manufacturing costs lower than in the basic technology of Fused Deposition Modeling.

40|$|Introduction: Mitral valve {{lies between}} the left atrial and left {{ventricular}} chambers {{of the heart}} guarding unidirectional flow to the left ventricle during ventricular diastole. Dimensions of the valves and circumference of valvular openings {{play a crucial role}} in the hemodynamics of heart and in valve replacement procedures. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty formalin fixed hearts were used in the study. The circumference, cross-sectional area, length of annulus, length and height of cusps of mitral valves were measured tabulated and analyzed. Result: On analysis of the data, it was found that 55. 83 % of mitral valves had a circumference between 7. 5 and 10 cm. The cross-sectional area of mitral valve was in the range of 5. 1 - 7. 5 cm 2. The anterior cusp of mitral valve showed a wide range of variation in length from a minimum of 0. 73 cm to the maximum of 5. 71 cm. Minimum height of anterior cusp was 1. 11 cm and maximum height was 3. 74 cm. The posterior cusp of mitral valve also showed a wide range in length ranging from 2. 15 cm to 9. 31 cm. Minimum height of posterior cusp 0. 61 cm and maximum height of posterior cusp was 2. 55 cm. The length of accessory cusp was 2 cm or less and the height was 0. 76 - 1. 02 cm.

40|$|New {{aeronautical}} ground lighting {{techniques are}} becoming increasingly important {{to ensure the safety}} and reduce the maintenance costs of the plane's tracks. Until recently, tracks had embedded lighting systems whose sources were based on incandescent lamps. But incandescent lamps have several disadvantages: high energy consumption and frequent breakdowns that result in high maintenance costs (lamp average life-time is similar to 1500 operating hours) and the lamp's technology has a lack of new lighting functions, such as signal handling and modification. To solve these problems, the industry has developed systems based on light-emitting diode (LED) technology with improved features: (1) LED lighting consumes one tenth the power, (2) it improves preventive maintenance (an LED's lifetime range is between 25, 000 and 100, 000 hours), and (3) LED lighting technology can be controlled remotely according {{to the needs of the}} track configuration. LEDs have been in use for more than three decades, but only recently, around 2002, have they begun to be used as visual aids, representing the greatest potential change for airport lighting since their inception in the 1920 s. Currently, embedded LED systems are not being broadly used due to the specific constraints of the rules and regulations of airports (beacon dimensions, power system technology, etc.). The fundamental requirements applied to embedded lighting systems are to be hosted on a volume where the dimensions are usually critical and also to integrate all the essential components for operation. An embedded architecture that meets the lighting regulations for airport runways is presented.

40|$|The Montreal Protocol {{phase-out}} of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{has required}} manufacturers to develop refrigeration and air-conditioning systems that use refrigerants {{that can not}} damage stratospheric ozone. Most refrigeration industries have adapted their designs to use hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants; new automobile air- conditioning systems use HFC- 134 a. These industries are now being affected by scientific investigations of greenhouse warming and questions {{about the effects of}} refrigerants on global warming. Automobile air-conditioning has three separate impacts on global warming; (1) the effects of refrigerant inadvertently released to the atmosphere from accidents, servicing, and leakage; (2) the efficiency of the cooling equipment (due to the emission of C 0 {sub 2 } from burning fuel to power the system); and (3) the emission of C 0 {sub 2 } from burning fuel to transport the system. The Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) is an index that should be used to compare the global warming effects of alternative air-conditioning systems because it includes these contributions from the refrigerant, cooling efficiency, and weight. This paper compares the TEWI of current air-conditioning systems using HFC- 134 a with that of transcritical vapor compression system using carbon dioxide and systems using flammable refrigerants with secondary heat transfer loops. Results are found to depend on both climate and projected efficiency of C 0 {sub 2 }systems. Performance data on <b>manufacturing</b> <b>prototype</b> systems are needed to verify the potential reductions in TEWI. Extensive field testing is also required to determine the performance, reliability, and ``serviceability`` of each alternative to HFC- 134 a to establish whether the potential reduction of TEWI can be achieved in a viable consumer product...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{aircraft}} engine nacelle structures employ advanced composite materials to reduce weight and thereby increase overall performance. Use of advanced composite materials on existing aircraft nacelle structures includes fiber-reinforced epoxy structures and has typically {{been limited to}} regions furthest away from the hot engine core. Portions of the nacelle structure that are closer to the engine require materials with a higher temperature capability. In these portions, existing nacelle structures employ aluminum sandwich construction and skin/stringer construction. The aluminum structure is composed of many detail parts and assemblies and is usually protected by some form of ablative, insulator, or metallic thermal shield. A one-piece composite inner cowl for a new-generation engine nacelle structure has been designed using fiber-reinforced bismaleimide (BMI) materials and honeycomb core in a sandwich construction. The new composite design has many advantages over the existing aluminum structure. Multiple details were integrated into the one-piece composite design, thereby significantly {{reducing the number of}} detail parts and fasteners. The use of lightweight materials and the reduction of the number of joints result in a significant weight reduction over the aluminum design; manufacturing labor and the overall number of tools required have also been reduced. Several significant technical issues were addressed {{in the development of a}} BMI composite design. Technical evaluation of the available BMI systems led to the selection of a toughened BMI material which was resistant to microcracking under thermal cyclic loading and enhanced the damage tolerance of the structure. Technical evaluation of the degradation of BMI materials in contact with aluminum and other metals validated methods for isolation of the various materials. Graphite-reinforced BMI in contact with aluminum and some steels was found to degrade in salt spray testing. Isolation techniques such as those used for graphite-reinforced epoxy structures were shown to provide adequate protection. The springback and producibility of large BMI structures were evaluated by <b>manufacturing</b> <b>prototype</b> hardware which had the full-scale cross section of the one-piece composite structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this trial}} was to produce activated charcoal from 5 raw material species which are abundantly potential. The production was conducted in an experimentally designed kiln, expectedly appropriate as a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>prototype</b> of activated charcoal for the inherent endeavors or small-scale village industries, which would be feasible technically, economically, and environmentally. The parameters related to the technical analysis covered the manufacture of charcoal from three wood species (bakau, mangium, and tusam) and coconut shell; analysis on raw material for such charcoal and on the mixed charcoal from the market; activation process using water vapor and air at consecutively 0. 25 bar and 4 - 5 atmospheric pressures, with the temperature as high as 705 - 805 °C; and analysis on iod number {{for the quality of}} activated charcoal. For economic evaluation, the inherent parameters covered production cost, activated charcoal price, and other related aspects. For the comparative assessments were used activated charcoals from sawdust and coconut shell from industry. The results are as follows:The yields of resulting activated charcoal were varying, i. e 77 % from mangrove charcoal as the highest, followed in decreasing order at 73 % from coconut shell charcoal, 66 % from both mangium and mixed charcoal, until 58 % from tusam charcoal as the lowest. lod number of activated charcoal ranged between 472 - 722 mg/g, with the one from coconut shell charcoal as the highest and the mangrove charcoal as the lowest. The increase of iod number in coconut shell activated charcoal was the highest with six times higher in comparison to the one in its regular charcoal, followed in decreasing order by those mixed charcoal, tusam charcoal. until mangrove charcoal as well as mangium charcoal as the lowest (i. e consecutively 3. 98 times, 3. 39 times and 2. 45 limes). Compared to the Indonesian requirement standard for activated charcoal, such production trial of activated charcoal seemed to be insatis factory. This is caused by overall iod numbers which were still below 750 mg/g. However, the iod number in activated charcoal from coconut shell in this trial was still higher than the one in the corresponding activated charcoal produced commercial industries (i. e 722 mg/g). Meanwhile, the iod number in activated charcoal from mixed charcoal (654 mg/g) was lower, but still higher than those from tusam and mangium. The retort for the production trial activated charcoal was constructed of stainless steel reactor with 120 liter volumetric capacity and capable of producing 10 kg per day, using regular charcoal as raw material and firewood as a fuel. This retort was designed as a prototype model for the production of activated charcoal for small-scale industries. The method of production expectedly will not bring about enviromental impacts, since the generated vapour/gas during the activation was immediately incinerated in the fuelwood fire pol. The analysis revealed that the production using coconut shell charcoal as raw material in the retort with design capacity of 250 kg per month and 5 years technical life could be sold at Rp 6, 000. - per kg of activated charcoal and therefore could bring in some net benefit at 5. 5 %. Activated charcoal production using mixed wood charcoal did not give significant any benefit. The benefit of activated charcoal production using coconut shell in that period would be even higher...|$|E
