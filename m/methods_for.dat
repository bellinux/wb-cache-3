The findings of this study revealed that the randomization <b>method</b> <b>for</b> RV coefficient performed better than the permutation <b>method</b> <b>for</b> Hotelling T-squared test in terms of relative efficiency of the test statistic value for both Cauchy distribution and Normally distributed data since the standard deviation of the test statistic measure for the randomization test for RV coefficient (Standard deviation= 0. 22 and 0. 16 respectively) is lesser than that of the permutation <b>method</b> <b>for</b> Hotelling T-squared test (standard deviation = 1. 09 and 0. 39 respectively). This result implies that the variation on the test statistic value <b>for</b> the randomization <b>method</b> <b>for</b> RV coefficient is smaller than that of the permutation <b>method</b> <b>for</b> Hotelling T-squared test; hence the randomization <b>method</b> <b>for</b> RV coefficient was concluded to be the most relatively efficient method between the two methods under observation.
