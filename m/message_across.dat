With the advent of internet radio, these stations, particularly Genesis FM have acquired a global audience, while still retaining their local flavor.

25|$|Although the Roman Catholic propagandists did {{put forth}} some {{effective}} propaganda campaigns, primarily {{the campaign against}} Luther regarding the Peasants War, they neglected to get their <b>message</b> <b>across</b> to the general public. They failed to capitalize {{in the ways that}} the Protestant propagandists were able to; they did not commonly produce works in the vernacular of the people, which had been an effective tactic for Protestants. Also Roman Catholic publications, either in German or Latin, produced during the reformation years were greatly outnumbered by the Protestants. The sheer volume of Protestant publications made it impossible for the Roman Catholic propagandists to quell the Protestant ideas and doctrine that transformed religious thought and doctrine in the sixteenth century.|$|E
25|$|However, if the tsar’s {{policies}} were too extreme or too disliked, {{he was not}} considered the true tsar. In these cases, {{it was necessary to}} replace this “fake” tsar with the “true” tsar, whoever he may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their <b>message</b> <b>across.</b> But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees. However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church. Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they felt as though she had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.|$|E
25|$|Users {{were able}} to {{purchase}} and form clubs. There were four clubhouse designs available to purchase – the Basic Clubhouse, the Desert Haven, nDream's War Room Clubhouse, and the Crystal Seashores Clubhouse. Each club had a leader, who was the user that purchased the club. The leader could elect up to 4 sub-leaders and could have up to 32 members in total, including the owner. A user could only {{be a member of}} up to five clubs, including the club that the user may have been the leader of. Though the user could own multiple clubhouse designs, they could only be the leader of one club and decided which clubhouse design would be used as the meeting place for their club. In a similar way to personal spaces, the club's owner was able to set up and decorate a private clubhouse as a meeting point for club members, and the club members could enter the clubhouse at any time. The clubhouses also featured a notice board where the leader or sub-leaders could post messages and announcements to other members. Japan's Basic Clubhouse's video screen had the option to access a Home member's page after they had entered their PSN information. Users could block other users from being a member of their club. In addition to all the standard features of the clubhouses, the War Room Clubhouse helped club owners or sub-leaders get their <b>message</b> <b>across</b> during club meetings or discussions. It also included a special access point allowing users to teleport from the War Room to other set locations.|$|E

When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer Russell Carpenter, he would resort to simple statements such as [...] "this will be the Sam Peckinpah shot" [...] to get his <b>message</b> <b>across</b> to Carpenter. Actor Lance Henriksen recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film. Producer James Jacks recalled that Woo was not [...] "the most powerful person on the set but as far as I was concerned, he was certainly the most respected".|$|E

Writing again in 1991, Furnas suggested potential Dooley targets might include the Bork and Souter confirmation hearings, and the omnipresence of blue jeans; but that an impediment to a revival of interest in Dooley was the present-day view of dialect works as demeaning. English professor John W. Lowe stated that Dooley [...] "set the model for an ethnic spokesman who could be entertaining and informative {{at the same time}} using humor to mask a subversive form of humor and get a <b>message</b> <b>across.</b> Then, the Irish made it, and they found his brogue and dialect embarrassing." ...|$|E

Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said [...] "When you entertain someone and make it funny, sometimes you can get a <b>message</b> <b>across</b> [...] Not that we're out here to send messages everywhere." [...] The episode featured two musical numbers, including [...] "Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance", a salute to the 1960s protest songs [...] with similarities to John Lennon's [...] "Give Peace a Chance".

500|$|With Skelton's support Dunglass {{secured the}} Unionist {{candidacy}} at Coatbridge for the 1929 general election. It {{was not a}} seat that the Unionists expected to win, and he lost to his Labour opponent with 9,210 votes to Labour's 16,879. It was, however, valuable experience for Dunglass, who was of a gentle and uncombative disposition and not a natural orator; he began {{to learn how to}} deal with hostile audiences and get his <b>message</b> <b>across.</b> When a coalition [...] "National Government" [...] was formed in 1931 to deal with a financial crisis Dunglass was adopted as the pro-coalition Unionist candidate for Lanark. The electorate of the area was mixed, and the constituency was not seen as a safe seat for any party; at the 1929 election Labour had captured it from the Unionists. With the backing of the pro-coalition Liberal party, which supported him rather than fielding its own candidate, Dunglass easily beat the Labour candidate.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{gave the}} film an {{overwhelmingly}} positive response, {{in particular the}} ensemble cast's performance and credibility. Although The Indian Express spoke positively of the cinematography and the film's story, it noted that [...] "the message that the film carries with it tends to get diluted towards the climax. Praising the film's cast for their performance and the cinematography of Binod Pradhan, Taran Ardash wrote that the film would be successful with the urban audiences. The Hindustan Times summarized the film as being a [...] "well-scripted, skilfully crafted [...] thought-provoking entertainer". Saisuresh Sivaswamy of Rediff.com wrote that films like Rang De Basanti can easily get into [...] "preachiness", but believed Mehra got his <b>message</b> <b>across</b> while avoiding this, also appreciating the music, cinematography, dialogues and art direction. The Hindu credited Kamlesh Pandey for writing a story {{that would have been}} a difficult film to make, but it added by saying that the transformation of the youngsters into heroes seemed poetic. Although the screenplay, direction and the cast were also well-appreciated, the reviewer felt that Rahman's soundtrack lacked pace.|$|E

[...] Lisa's political convictions are generally liberal and she often contests other's views. She is a vegetarian, feminist, environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights and the Free Tibet movement. In a special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism, even speaking the Cornish language to get her <b>message</b> <b>across.</b> While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church {{in which she was}} raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode [...] "She of Little Faith" [...] (season 13, 2001) after she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path.

500|$|Paul had {{received}} little media attention {{during the early}} stages of the Democratic and Republican primary contests. But as Vice President George H.W.

It was noted that if Bush became unacceptable to conservatives, they would not turn to Dukakis, but would most likely vote for Paul as a protest. During this time, publications also started discussed Paul's tax policy. It called for a flat income tax rate of 10% on all earnings over $10,000 annually. Paul sold his tax plan while campaigning in Utah. In front of 250 people in Kane County, he hailed California's 1978 passage of Proposition 13 as starting the [...] "tax revolt and [...] a <b>message</b> <b>across</b> the country. The next big message for this country should be the overwhelming passage of the tax initiatives... in November." [...] Paul was also part of C-SPAN's program Road to the White House, which followed different candidates on the campaign trail. In June, they aired Paul's address to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.|$|E
500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: [...] "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now I understand what you have to do. Put your political <b>message</b> <b>across</b> with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E

500|$|Milne {{was with}} Dundee United {{for a further}} three seasons and still a regular player in the team, {{although}} he scored less frequently. Milne's increasingly fractious relationship with manager Jim McLean was also becoming common knowledge; in December 1983 McLean publicly criticised Milne, stating [...] "I have {{tried to get the}} <b>message</b> <b>across</b> to him that it is when he is not playing well that he needs to work hardest. It is plainly not sinking in." [...] Ironically some months later in August 1984, it was Milne who scored both goals against Nottingham Forest in a pre-season testimonial match for McLean. However, after the game the pair again fell out because of a brief conversation Milne had with Brian Clough which led McLean to believe the player was trying to arrange a deal away from United; by this time Milne had grown increasingly frustrated over being frequently fined a week's wages for breaking minor club rules and generally offending McLean's strict sense of discipline. The financial strain this caused led to him to work as a casual labourer in order to meet his mortgage repayments. By this time his drinking had become more of a problem, resulting in a struggle to maintain fitness.|$|E

When Peggy had a mastectomy, hundreds of viewers wrote to the BBC to thank producer, Matthew Robinson for tackling [...] "a difficult subject so sensitively".
