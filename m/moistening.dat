5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the <b>moistening</b> boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E

40|$|Background. Acid etching {{prior to}} {{orthodontic}} bracket bonding {{may result in}} enamel wear or cracks following bracket removal. The manufacturer of Fuji Ortho LC glass-ionomer (GI) claims that it can bond brackets to wet unetched enamel. This study aimed to compare the bracket bond strength to etched and unetched enamel under dry and wet conditions. Methods. In this in vitro study, 60 intact premolar teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} 6 groups (etched and dried, etched and <b>moistened</b> with distilled water, etched and <b>moistened</b> with saliva, unetched and dried, unetched and <b>moistened</b> with water, unetched and <b>moistened</b> with saliva). In all the groups, Leon 4 brackets were bonded to the enamel using Fuji Ortho LC GI. The teeth were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 hours and subjected to shear loads at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min in a Zwick machine for bond strength testing. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey test and independent ttest. Results. The mean bond strength values in groups 1 (etched, dry), 2 (etched, <b>moistened</b> with water), 3 (etched, <b>moistened</b> with saliva), 4 (unetched, dry), 5 (unetched, <b>moistened</b> with water) and 6 (unetched, <b>moistened</b> with saliva) were 21. 86, 16. 46, 10. 49, 8. 12, 9. 15 and 9. 52 MPa, respectively. Significant differences in bond strength were detected between groups 1 and 2 and all the other groups (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Fuji Ortho LC GI provided adequate bond strength between brackets and enamel. To acquire higher bond strength, brackets must be bonded to etched and dried enamel...|$|R

25|$|Carleton S. Coon {{also has}} a {{hypothesis}} for why noses on Mongoloids are very distinct. Typically, the nose is not very prominent {{on the face of}} a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment. Regardless of the environment that the mongoloid is in, his nose helps reduce the stress of the environment on their body by <b>moistening</b> the air inspired to cool the body off instead of doing a straight up heat exchange.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian bread {{was made}} almost {{exclusively}} from emmer wheat, {{which was more}} difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat. The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets {{that needed to be}} removed by <b>moistening</b> and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and sieved and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the grindstone back and forth, rather than with a rotating motion.|$|E
25|$|Women's orgasms are {{preceded by}} {{erection}} of the clitoris and <b>moistening</b> {{of the opening}} of the vagina. Some women exhibit a sex flush, a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans retracts under the clitoral hood, and the labia minora (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.|$|E

The following was {{the features of}} the data analyzed by the statistical parameters of the spontaneous luminescence and the fitting curves of the water-induced luminescence. The results show that the UWL intensity rises with the <b>moistened</b> time prolonged. It is concluded that the intensity depends on the <b>moistened</b> time mainly. If the <b>moistened</b> kernels owned a more porous structure, in the initial phase of imbibition, a higher UWL emission would be noted. Consequently, the further quantitative research of the relevant could lead a novel testing method about the wheat’s activity and quality.  </p...|$|R

25|$|Though {{some species}} are quite drab, the most {{conspicuous}} jewel bugs are often brilliantly colored, exhibiting {{a wide range of}} iridescent metallic hues that change with the view angle. The colors are the result of a combination of factors. Some species like Chrsyocoris stockerus and Scutellera nobilis display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the topmost chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the bottom layer. The colors can be restored by <b>moistening</b> the surfaces with water.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced {{overfeeding}} and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined. In the necropolis of Saqqara, in {{the tomb of}} Mereruka, an important royal official, there is a bas relief scene wherein workers grasp geese around the necks in order to push food down their throats. At the side stand tables piled with more food pellets, and a flask for <b>moistening</b> the feed before giving it to the geese.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include <b>moistening</b> food {{and helping to}} create a food bolus. This lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Only about 30% starch digestion {{takes place in the}} mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop.|$|E

500|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{metabolic}} end products of oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Oxidising a gram of carbohydrate produces 0.60 grams of water; a gram of protein produces 0.41 grams of water; and a gram of fat produces 1.07 grams of water, {{making it possible for}} xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking water. The kangaroo rat for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the day, reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at rest. Herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat. Species such as the addax antelope, dik-dik, Grant's gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to drink. The camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life. It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung, and is able to lose 40% of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration. Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey. Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal, seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows. At depths of more than [...] , these remain at between [...] regardless of the external temperature. Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate, panting, sweating and <b>moistening</b> the skin of their forelegs with saliva. Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size. Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies, a form of adaptive insulation. The emperor penguin has dense plumage, a downy under layer, an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth.|$|E

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of storage periods and media of scion on the success level of green budding and its water content in the rubber plant. This experiment was conducted at Pakuwon experimental garden with altitude of 450 m above sea level, Latosol type of soil, and B type of climate according to the classification of Schmidt and Fergusson, from January to July 2014. Randomized complete block design in single factor with nine treatments and three replications was used in this study. The nine treatments used were: (1) storage of scion for 2 days without media, (2) Two days stored with <b>moistened</b> newsprint paper, (3) Two days stored with <b>moistened</b> sawdust media, (4) Two days stored with <b>moistened</b> cocopeat media, (5) Four days stored without media, (6) Four days stored with <b>moistened</b> newsprint paper, (7) Four days stored with <b>moistened</b> sawdust media, (8) 4 days stored with <b>moistened</b> cocopeat media, and (9) without storing/control (K). The results showed that the storage of rubber scion for 2 - 4 days can reduce the success level of green budding due to the decrease in water content of scion. In condition when scion had to be stored, it should be a maximum of 4 days by using <b>moistened</b> newspapers or sawdusts storage media. Both of the storage media can still maintain the water content of scion at about 94. 8 % and 93. 9 %, respectively, compared to the water content of scion without storage treatment...|$|R

2500|$|Empedocles {{established}} four ultimate elements {{which make}} all the structures in the world—fire, air, water, earth.

According to the different proportions in which these four indestructible and unchangeable elements are combined with each other the difference of the structure is produced. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements thus arising, that Empedocles, like the atomists, found the real process which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or decrease. Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element. This theory of the four elements became the standard dogma for the next two thousand years.|$|E
