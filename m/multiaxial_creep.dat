40|$|Time for the {{disposal}} of the nuclear waste is shortly at hand. The concept for {{the disposal}} in Finland and Sweden is to store the nuclear waste deep into the bedrock for at least 100 000 years. The nuclear waste is first inserted to a cast iron canister and then the package is sealed inside a copper canister (made of oxygen free phosphorus doped copper Cu-OFP), main function {{of which is to}} protect the inner parts from corrosion caused by the groundwater. The copper canister will be subjected to hydrostatic pressure inside the bedrock, and therefore creep to some extent. To see how the copper canister behaves in the repository, <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> testing to Cu-OFP must be done. To get as realistic results as possible, the creep testing specimens shouldn’t experience cold work before the actual testing. This thesis examines the possibility to use a new testing bar geometry manufactured by wire-erosion to minimize the amount of cold work, usually caused by specimen preparation (for example milling). The new testing approach involves a square shaped bar, which has circumferentially two sharp octagon shaped notches. The square bar is made by wire-erosion instead of the earlier used double notched round bar made by turn-milling. The main goal is to find out, how the new geometry suits for <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> testing and whether the results are more realistic if the effect of cold work could be minimized. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the literature study part, issues related to creep properties of Cu-OFP are explored. Theory related to the creep testing methodologies is discussed: mainly uniaxial and <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> properties as well as creep modelling issues are being studied. Also the effects of sulphide rich groundwater on the creep properties of Cu-OFP are investigated. In the experimental research part, ten multiaxial Cu-OFP creep tests were performed from which four specimens were manufactured according to the new square geometry. The other six tests were carried out with the round geometry manufactured by turn-milling. FE analysis and post metallurgical evaluation is added in the end {{to get a better view}} of the processes taking place inside the specimen. Also the determination of skeletal point and corresponding skeletal stresses for square and round geometry is made by FEM. The study indicates that the amount of cold work in square specimens seems to be lower than in the round specimens or non-existent. However, more tests by square specimens are needed for the final validation. The creep results seem to behave as the creep behaviour models predict. The determination of skeletal point for sharp notches is challenging, but a suitably small skeletal zone was possible to define. In the future a round geometry made completely by wire-erosion could be a good choice for <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> testing...|$|E

The current creep damage models are either too cumbersome to be readily employed and/or not sufficiently accurate for practical applications.

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{focuses on}} the creep mechanisms of the Ni-base alloy NiCr 23 Co 12 Mo (Alloy 617). The aim {{is to develop a}} physical-based, constitutive material model which can be used for the design of power plant components. Particle hardening and internal back stresses are quantitatively and qualitatively described based on the combination of the results from hot tensile tests and creep tests, as well as microstructural investigations. The particle hardening arises from the precipitation of secondary phases such as Cr-rich M 23 C 6 -carbides and the γ’-phase. The material model is implemented in the finite-element software ABAQUS via user-subroutine CREEP and can predict <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> deformation.

In such cases it is necessary for these components to be repaired by welding, followed by a rectification process.

40|$|Abstract. Metal {{materials}} {{are subjected to}} innumerable time-dependent degradation mechanisms when operate in power, petrochemical and refinery plant. These {{materials are}} subjected to <b>multiaxial</b> stresses, <b>creep,</b> fatigue, corrosion and abrasion. As a result of service especially at high temperatures and high pressures, can lead to forming cracks, damages or failures. In situation of breakdown in such systems {{there is a need}} for weld repair on plant components and repair work can be expensive and time-consuming. Most weld repairs of low alloy steels require high-temperature post weld heat treatment (PWHT); but in certain repairs, however, this is not always possible. Expenses of the repair work could be reduced if the weld repairing is performed on site. Also, application of the nickel based filler metal can be alternative to performing PWHT. These repair welding procedures with Ni based filler metal could be categorized as cold repair welding. Purpose of presented investigation was to compare a repair welding technology with filler austenite material based on Ni and without application of the PWHT, with a classical repair welding procedure with preheating and PWHT and using a filler metal with chemical composition similar to parent metal. Properties comparison of the welded joints obtained by these two repair welding technologies was performed for the Cr-Mo steel (13 CrMo 4 - 5) by the metal arc welding procedure with covere...|$|R
40|$|A viscoelastic, {{compressible}} {{model is}} proposed to rationalize the recently reported response of human amnion in <b>multiaxial</b> relaxation and <b>creep</b> experiments. The theory includes two viscoelastic contributions {{responsible for the}} short- and long-term time- dependent response of the material. These two contributions {{can be related to}} physical processes: water flow through the tissue and dissipative characteristics of the collagen fibers, respectively. An accurate agreement of the model with the mean tension and kinematic response of amnion in uniaxial relaxation tests was achieved. By variation of a single linear factor that accounts for the variability among tissue samples, the model provides very sound predictions not only of the uniaxial relaxation but also of the uniaxial creep and strip-biaxial relaxation behavior of individual samples. This suggests that a wide range of viscoelastic behaviors due to patient-specific variations in tissue composition...|$|R

The previous creep analysis was formulated to be exactly consistent with the allowable stress basis, such that alternate design analysis methods and criteria could be rigorously compared. In the current work, {{the selection of the}} appropriate limits for elastic results is investigated, as discussed in previous literature, which is motivated by stress redistribution characteristics of the primary (and secondary) loading in a typical header. Next, use of isochronous stress-strain curves generated from the same consistent (Omega) creep model are used for analysis and compared to candidate strain limits. The analyses show that both elastic and isochronous analysis have potential for effective creep design in the context of current {{high temperature}} design modernization activities.

40|$|Alloy 617, a nickel‑based alloy, is {{a leading}} {{candidate}} for application in next‑generation nuclear plants (NGNPs). Creep, a thermally activated, time-dependent deformation process impacts the lifetime and failure of heat exchangers used at the very high operating temperatures and pressures of such plants. Current methods of testing creep are generally limited to bar specimens in uniaxial tension. In an attempt to correlate uniaxial to <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> behavior a method to test creep in a pressurized tube was developed. Test specimens were pressurized with argon up to 3. 5 MPa, and heated to 950 °C. Creep rates were measured as strain rates by tracking diametric changes with time.

40|$|The {{desirable}} {{properties of}} ceramics at high temperatures have generated {{interest in their}} use for structural applications such as in advanced turbine systems. Design lives for such systems can exceed 10, 000 hours. Such long life requirements necessitate subjecting the components to relatively low stresses. The combination of high temperatures and low stresses typically places failure for monolithic ceramics in the creep regime. The objective of this work is to present a design methodology for predicting the lifetimes of structural components subjected to <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> loading. This methodology utilizes commercially available finite element packages and {{takes into account the}} time varying creep stress distributions (stress relaxation). In this methodology, the creep life of a component is divided into short time steps, during which, the stress and strain distributions are assumed constant. The damage, D, is calculated for each time step based on a modified Monkman-Grant creep rupture criterion. For components subjected to predominantly tensile loading, failure is assumed to occur when the normalized accumulated damage at any point in the component is {{greater than or equal to}} unity...|$|E
40|$|Materials creep {{resistance}} is usually determined under uniaxial constant load condition {{while the state}} of stress in real components is multiaxial in general. How to correlate <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> behavior to uniaxial creep data is still an open issue. Most of the theories available in the literature are phenomenological in nature and limited to few classes of metals and stress triaxiality ranges. From the computational point of view, stress field relaxation depends on the creep model formulation. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} use a refined creep model capable to reproduce the effective state of stress in the material. In the present work, a mechanism based creep model proposed by Bonora and Esposito [1] was used to predict creep life of P 91 high chromium steel under multiaxial state of stress. This creep model is capable to reproduce all creep stages and was validated for different classes of metals and alloys. The performance of different reference stress definitions (i. e. the principal facet stress, skeletal stress and a new formulation) was investigated. Results were compared with available creep life data obtained on round notched samples at different temperatures...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{transferability}} of materials data and constitutive equations in the high temperature region, uniaxial and <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> tests were performed with tubes made of X 10 NiCrAlTi 32 20 (INCOLOY 800 H). The tubes were loaded {{by a combination of}} tension, internal pressure and torsion. The temperature was 950 °C. The life-time of the heat exchanger tubes under pure uniaxial tension was foung to be longer than the time to rupture of bar material made from the same parent heat. The heat exchanger tubes show a signigicant creep hardening in the primary creep range and a later onset of the secondary creep range. For the heat exchanger tubes under different multiaxial loading conditions different life times were measured, although in all cases the same deviatoric stress (v. Mises) was used. For the experiments presented in this paper these differences can be explained by constitutive equations. The deformation of the heat exchanger tubes under multiaxial loadings cannot be predicted exactly by the postulated mathematical model. In the experiments with combined loading conditions the tubes failed by leak formation and fracture respectively - a spontaneous failure was never found...|$|E

With advances in finite element (FE) methods, more complex models incorporating damage can be applied in the study of CCG where simple analytical solutions or approximate methods are no longer applicable. The possibility to accurately simulate CCG depends not only on the damage formulation but also on the creep model since stress relaxation, occurring in the near tip region, controls the resulting creep rate and, therefore, crack initiation and growth.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} a new <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> damage model developed by the authors to predict the failure time of components made of service aged 2. 25 %Cr- 1 %Mo, 0. 5 %Cr- 0. 5 %Mo- 0. 25 %V low alloy steels, titanium and nickel-based superalloys. The model accounts for the tertiary creep behaviour and assumes the creep damage is related to the internal energy absorbed by the material. The authors argue that the model is the most appropriate for characterizing gross creep damage from a macroscopic point of view because it takes into accounts both the multiaxial internal deformation and loading. The verification and application of the model are demonstrated by applying it to the Bridgman notched bars for which the experimental data are available. The predicted failure times by the model are compared with the experimental results and those obtained from the reference stress method. The results show that the proposed model is capable of predicting failure times of the components made of the above-mentioned materials with an accuracy of 2. 2 % or better. Also, it is shown that the model predicts the creep failure times of the components more accurately than the reference stress method...|$|E
40|$|Zirconium alloy tubing {{is used in}} {{pressurized}} water nuclear reactors {{in order to prevent}} fissile material from leaking into the coolant. It can be the first safety wall of nuclear fuel, and is submitted to complex thermomechanical loadings. In consequence, new Nb-modified alloys, such as the M 5 alloy, and fine numerical models are being developed to guarantee a better and longer mechanical integrity of these tubes. To identify the physical mechanisms that could be considered in such models, an experimental approach, combining creep tests with electron backscattered diffraction and Transmission electron microscopy investigations, was carried out.

With advances in finite element (FE) methods, more complex models can be applied in the study of CCG where simple analytical solutions or approximate methods are no longer applicable. Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) offer the possibility to account for the loss of load carrying capabilities in the material due to damage processes, the increase of the local effective stress and consequent increase of the creep rate. The possibility to accurately simulate CCG depends not only on the damage formulation but also on the creep model since stress relaxation, occurring in the near tip region, controls the resulting creep rate and, therefore, crack initiation and growth.

The microstructure of a base metal/weld metal transition {{in a thick}} section pipe was analysed by means of optical microscopy and hardness measurements. Special emphasis was given to three microstructural states: the base metal (BM), the weld metal (WM) and the intercritical heat affected zone material (IC-HAZ). A significant difference between these three microstructures was their subgrain size, which was measured in the transmission electron microscope and {{was found to be}} smallest for the weld metal and largest for the intercritical heat affected zone material. The uniaxial creep behaviour of the three material states was analysed and it was shown that the creep strength increased with decreasing subgrain size.

Thus the mechanical properties of solder interconnects were studied to ensure the reliability of electronic assemblies. Studies include deformation and failure associated with size effect, deformation mechanism map, and microstructural coarsening. Results show that tensile stress-strain behavior is size dependent. Small solder specimens do not follow bulk material properties when the cross-sectional area of the gage section is less than 0. 1 mm{sup 2 }. The effect of microstructural size is found to be minimal, based on two averaged Pb-rich phase sizes, 2 and 4 {micro}m. From <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> experiments at room temperature and 100 C, the activation energy and stress exponent are consistent with published values for Region-I creep behavior.

The Von Mises equivalent stress appears to work well for various loading modes. The coarsening phenomenon of eutectic solder is still not very clear. It requires a large number of observations to mitigate the extensive variability in both starting microstructure and response. From isothermal torsional fatigue at 10 {sup - 4 } and 10 {sup - 5 } s{sup - 1 }, there is no correlation between the initial phase size and the magnitude of accumulated strain experienced by the specimen.

40|$|A hybrid {{material}} design {{has been developed}} to improve creep performance in pressurized metallic pipes subjected to high temperatures. Metallic pipes were reinforced with various arrangements of external wires which have substantially greater creep resistance than the pipe material. This research was conducted to explore the field of reinforcement of piping for creep reduction, exploit the creep strength of refractory metals, and investigate structure-property relationships in architectured materials. Two basic wire reinforcement architectures were tested, simple helical windings and braided sleeves. By adjusting {{the architecture of the}} reinforcement, apparent tangential (hoop) and longitudinal stresses on the pipe are altered, thereby allowing <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> strains to be controlled. The utilization of a reinforcement layer in a hybrid layup, where it is not bonded or embedded in a matrix is a relatively unexplored field. Hybridization allows the most desirable properties to be extracted from each component and have them work together in parallel. The use of braided refractory reinforcement is also a particularly novel concept, with refractory materials for reinforcement purposes traditionally being utilized in particle, whisker and discontinuous fibre form. Rather than testing in a uniaxial stress state, the present approach to creep testing pressurized pipes at high temperature remains largely underutilized, and is especially relevant to industry applications where creep takes place in the complex, multiaxial stress state of a pressurized pipe. In a low-temperature reinforcement architecture optimization study of a brass-stainless steel system, designed for ease of fabrication and to negate oxidation issues, pipes were pressurized and creep rupture tested at 400 °C. Even in an unoptimized state, braided reinforcement was observed to out-perform a simple iv helical wrap by at least 22 %, giving a 10 -times life extension without rupture, and a reduction in creep rate in excess of 45 -times for reinforcement oriented at a 50 °. A simple analytical model from reinforced pressure vessel theory predicts a neutral angle (θN) of 54. 7 °, at which point the reinforcement is oriented to act proportionally to the applied pressure stresses. An empirical model of effective creep rate with varying reinforcement angle was derived in the present study, and used to find that a braid angle of approximately 54. 7 ± 1. 5 ° is optimal to minimize the effective <b>multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> rate of a hybrid pipe under internal pressure, reducing it {{to the point of being}} negligible. The braided reinforcement was observed to be constantly shifting towards the equilibrium point of θN, but only for initial angles below θN. This concept of braid reorientation is generally associated with rapid elastic deformation or static reinforcement of systems at room temperature, and the gradual shift towards θN facilitated by creep deformation has not been reported previously. A relationship for -θ (i. e. creep rate for a given reinforcement angle) was derived, including the reduction in as θ tends to θN. Findings of this optimization study were applied to a high temperature system which served as an acceleration of reformer furnace operating conditions: 253 MA pipes were reinforced with tungsten wire and creep rupture tested at 1030 - 1040 °C. Using braided reinforcement oriented at 52. 6 ± 1. 4 ° a life extension in excess of 700 x was observed, with no signs of bulk deformation after a 309 x life extension. These high temperature results were considered in light of the intended industry application, with a balance of life extension, weight reduction and increased operating temperature preferred over outright life extension for the reformer furnace application...|$|E

In addition, the material creep parameters used in that life prediction methodology, were based on uniaxial creep curves displaying primary and secondary creep behavior, with no tertiary regime. The objective of this paper is to present a creep life prediction methodology based on a modified form of the Kachanov-Rabotnov continuum damage mechanics (CDM) theory. In this theory, the uniaxial creep rate is described in terms of stress, temperature, time, and the current state of material damage. This scalar damage state parameter is basically an abstract measure of the current state of material damage due to creep deformation. The damage rate is assumed to vary with stress, temperature, time, and the current state of damage itself. <b>Multiaxial</b> <b>creep</b> and creep rupture formulations of the CDM approach are presented in this paper.

In the theoretical work the principles developed for modelling creep and failure in metals were employed and adapted where necessary to provide new models that describe the behaviour of ceramics under multiaxial stresses.
