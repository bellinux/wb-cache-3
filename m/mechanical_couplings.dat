50|$|The {{vision for}} joining pipe with bolted <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplings,</b> “Victaulic Pipe Joint” emerged in World War I. Its {{original}} purpose was designed mainly for military applications but quickly gained popularity in other {{commercial and industrial}} markets. The concept emerged when inventor Lieutenant Ernest Tribe, of the Royal Engineers, devised a special form of joint for use on pipes and cylinders containing gasses and chemicals under very high pressure. Tribe, in conjunction with Dr Henry Hele-Shaw, a noted English hydraulic engineer, had been engaged by the British Government during the war to advance trench warfare tactics.|$|E

These leaks come from <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplings</b> which contain rubber gaskets. Washington Gas Light claims {{that because the}} Cove Point gas has less hexane and other heavy hydrocarbons than does domestic natural gas, the Cove Point gas causes the gaskets to dry out and leak. Cove Point disputes these claims and argues that Washington Gas's arguments are flawed and the expansion will not cause additional leaks in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia suburbs as the area served by unblended LNG increases.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{particles}} falling under gravity in a weakly turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard gas flow is studied numerically. The particle Stokes number is varied between 0. 01 and 1 and their temperature is held fixed at {{the temperature of}} the cold plate, of the hot plate, or the mean between these values. Mechanical, thermal, and combined <b>mechanical</b> and thermal <b>couplings</b> between the particles and the fluid are studied separately. It is shown that the mechanical coupling plays a greater and greater role in the increase of the Nusselt number with increasing particle size. A rather unexpected result is an unusual kind of reverse one-way coupling, {{in the sense that the}} fluid is found to be strongly influenced by the particles, while the particles themselves appear to be little affected by the fluid, despite the relative smallness of the Stokes numbers. It is shown that this result derives from the very strong constraint on the fluid behavior imposed by the vanishing of the mean fluid vertical velocity over the cross sections of the cell demanded by continuity...|$|R
40|$|Kinesin motors {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} both experimentally and theoretically. However, the microscopic mechanism of the processive movement of kinesin is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a hand-over-hand model for the processivity of kinesin, {{which is based on}} chemical, <b>mechanical,</b> and electrical <b>couplings.</b> In the model the processive movement does not need to rely on the two heads' coordination in their ATP hydrolysis and mechanical cycles. Rather, the ATP hydrolyses at the two heads are independent. The much higher ATPase rate at the trailing head than the leading head makes the motor walk processively in a natural way, with one ATP being hydrolyzed per step. The model is consistent with the structural study of kinesin and the measured pathway of the kinesin ATPase. Using the model the estimated driving force of ~ 5. 8 pN is in agreements with the experimental results (5 ~ 7. 5 pN). The prediction of the moving time in one step (~ 10 microseconds) is also consistent with the measured values of 0 ~ 50 microseconds. The previous observation of substeps within the 8 -nm step is explained. The shapes of velocity-load (both positive and negative) curves show resemblance to previous experimental results.

50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of thread sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplings</b> made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} joining pipe with bolted <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplings</b> quickly gained {{popularity}} throughout World War II. The Victaulic coupling {{was used by}} Allied forces to accelerate the distribution of fuel and water to the troops. The coupling was invaluable for the troops because it decreased the difficulty of assembling and de-assembling pipe lines and allowed them to hasten distribution. The early installations of the Victaulic pipe joints included systems that needed flexibility; systems withstanding vibrations, shifting of soil, or other external influences. Victaulic fittings were very economical on space and were valuable in tunnels,ship work, and borings. The demand for dependable pipeline systems increased during World War II in direct correlation to the troops needing oil and petroleum. The earlier methods of distributing petroleum during war included shipping it overseas and dispersing by tank car, truck, or rail.|$|E
5000|$|The RZ67 name {{is adopted}} {{from the model}} name of the Mamiya RB67 (in which RB stands for [...] "Revolving Back"), which was first {{introduced}} in 1970, thus the RZ67 also takes backs which can be rotated 90 degrees to provide a horizontal or vertical composition. The orientation {{is shown in the}} viewfinder with black guides. The viewfinder also hosts LEDs informing {{of the state of the}} camera (flash ready, low battery, dark slide not removed, shutter not cocked). In addition to manual operation (photographer chooses aperture and shutter speed), the RZ67 is able to operate in AEF mode with an AE viewfinder (AE being an abbreviation for automatic exposure), which transmits exposure information directly to the body. In RBL compatibility mode, the RZ67 is able to use RB67 lenses. The biggest difference between RB67 and RZ67 is that the RB67 is completely mechanical. The RZ67 has also <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplings</b> between the parts, but the shutter is electronic, and parts are able to transmit exposure information with electronic couplings. In addition, the RZ67 has plastic exterior body, which makes it somewhat lighter.|$|E
40|$|Lamb-wave {{piezoelectric}} RF-MEMS resonators {{have demonstrated}} promising performance, such as low motional impedance and high Q-factor. Lamb-wave resonators {{are still in}} the perfectioning state and therefore there is a great demand for further understanding of various issues such as reducing the anchor-loss, spurious mode suppression using various designs and simulation techniques such as finite-element methods. AlN, ZnO and recently PZT thin-films are the prevalent piezoelectric materials utilized in the resonators. Of these, PZT has the highest electromechanical coupling-factor which is a big opportunity {{to reduce the size of}} the filters and keep the motional impedance low. PZT suffers from a high feed-through due to its high dielectric permittivity which, as a consequence, drastically reduces the stopband rejection. In this thesis, to overcome this problem, we propose a feed-through cancellation method in the presence of specific grounding resistances (non-zero grounding) at the input- and output-sides, which always exist and prevent perfect grounding. Particularly, these grounding resistances have been considered in the designs. Using the proposed technique, the stopband rejection of the resonator is improved by more than 20 dB. Two different bandpass filter configurations (i. e. mechanically coupled and differentially readout) are presented in this thesis. The mechanically-coupled filter consists of two mechanically-coupled resonators with identical designed wave-length. One resonator is used to actuate the whole coupled structure and the other one is used to pick up the signal. The mechanically-coupled filter is actuated using two differential input signals and on the other side, the output signal is also picked up using a differential readout. As both actuation and readout are done using a differential technique, the feed-through signals trough air and substrate are not eliminated. Therefore, the filter shows a low stopband rejection. To overcome this problem, a new concept of bandpass filter is proposed in this thesis called, differential readout filter. Two different filters at two different resonance frequencies around 380 MHz and 700 MHz are presented. This technique showed a considerable improvement in the performance of RF-MEMS filters compared to the existing Lamb wave filters. Conventional electromechanical filters are using <b>mechanical</b> and/or electrical <b>couplings,</b> however, this new technique is based on the phase change of two un-coupled resonators below and above their resonances. This technique resolves the design issue associated with high feed-through at high frequencies as well as exploiting piezoelectric materials with high-dielectric constant like PZT...|$|R
