Both cabins feature <b>mood</b> <b>lighting</b> and all seats are {{equipped}} with Panasonic Avionics' personal in-flight entertainment system running a customized touch-screen GUI called Red. In July 2010, the Red software had been upgraded to version 2.0 across the entire fleet. This update included new features such as an updated position mapping system powered by Google Maps, in-flight shopping, and open tab capabilities. The Red system was upgraded again in June 2015, introducing a new seatback touch screen service.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decade, Jetfire (now called Skyfire in Japan) {{received}} an upgrade {{into a new}} body-form, and received the Spark of Combination from Primus, allowing him to combine with other Autobots, most frequently the rookie trooper Ironhide, who he had to carefully train and walk through the combination process. Despite his external changes, however, Jetfire remained consistent in personality and outlook, always ready with a witty remark to keep the <b>mood</b> <b>light</b> even {{in the middle of}} a pitched battle. He is once again, the second-in-command of the Autobots.|$|R

5000|$|The intensity, direction, {{and quality}} of {{lighting}} can influence an audience’s understanding of characters, actions, themes and <b>mood.</b> <b>Light</b> (and shade) can emphasize texture, shape, distance, mood, time of day or night, season, glamour; it affects the way colors are rendered, {{both in terms of}} hue and depth, and can focus attention on particular elements of the composition. Highlights, for example, call attention to shapes and textures, while shadows often conceal things, creating a sense of mystery or fear. For this reason, lighting must be thoroughly planned in advance to ensure its desired effect on an audience. Cinematographers are a large part of this process, as they coordinate the camera and the lighting.|$|R

Craig and his wife decided to retire in 2011 and none of their children wanted to continue operating the restaurant. The business and the [...] building were listed for sale in February 2011. Country Bill's closed in September 2012 after 48 years of operation. The restaurant had low staff turnover and dedicated patrons, hundreds of whom visited during its final days. Country Bill's was also known for its Brat Pack era decor, including red clamshell booths, <b>mood</b> <b>lighting</b> supplied by electric candles, metallic wallpaper and wood paneling. Following closure, the building underwent interior and exterior renovation to make spaces available for new tenants.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Willamette Week, Ben Waterhouse {{asserted}} that the restaurant had changed little since its establishment. Waterhouse stated [...] "time travel" [...] was Country Bill's form of entertainment, noting its red vinyl booths, wood paneling and [...] "white-haired" [...] clientele. He recommended ordering beer or spirits (specifically Anchor Steam) as opposed to cocktails, which he found contained too much sugar. Mix magazine reviewed Country Bill's as one of [...] "five vintage restaurants that have {{stood the test of}} time". In his review, Michael Russell described CB's Lounge's red clamshell booths, electric candles and the servers [...] "who alternate between alarmingly fresh-faced and downright sassy". Russell recommended the hand-cut garlic French fries and deep fried cheesecake, which he described as [...] "country-fair gluttony incarnate". The Portland Mercury also described the restaurant's retro features such as the plush red booths, <b>mood</b> <b>lighting</b> and metallic wallpaper. The publication also noted the older waiting staff.|$|E

Browne plays his voice off the piano's restrained tone, soaring up from his own basically understated vocal in mid-verse and chorus. This underplaying of <b>mood</b> <b>lights</b> Jackson's simple but evocative images with a muted radiance that aurally captures the look of McCabe and Mrs. Miller. While the music sets the tone, Browne deftly tells the tale, his imagery charged with vivid suggestion. ... Much of the dramatic force of [...] "Jamaica" [...] derives from its gorgeous choruses.

5000|$|Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic called Word of Mouf a [...] "superstar {{affair that}} aims for mass appeal {{with a broad}} array of {{different}} styles" [...] and enjoyed [...] "witty puns and sly innuendoes" [...] displayed in songs such as [...] "Area Codes". [...] However, he felt that [...] "amid all of these various team-ups you do lose {{a little bit of the}} sincere, personal edge that had characterized much of Ludacris' debut." [...] Soren Baker of the Chicago Tribune also praised the album's comedic nature, commenting that [...] "Whether he's delivering a punchy one-liner, exaggerating his rhyme flow to a silly extreme or cleverly deploying pop culture references, Ludacris keeps the <b>mood</b> <b>light</b> and festive. Even his skits are funny enough that they could serve as the foundation for a top-tier comedy album." ...|$|R
2500|$|The 737 {{interior}} arrangement {{has changed in}} successive generations. The original 737 interior was restyled for the 737 Classic models using 757 designs, while 777 architecture {{was used for the}} debut of the Next Generation 737. Designed using Boeing's new cabin concepts, the latest Sky Interior features sculpted sidewalls and redesigned window housings, along with increased headroom and LED <b>mood</b> <b>lighting.</b> Larger pivot-bins similar to those on the 777 and 787 have more luggage space than prior designs. The Sky Interior is also designed to improve cabin noise levels by 2–4 dB. The first 737 equipped with the Boeing Sky Interior was delivered to Flydubai in late 2010. Continental Airlines, [...] Malaysia Airlines, and TUIFly have also received Sky Interior-equipped 737s.|$|E
2500|$|For the 747-8, Boeing {{proposed}} {{some changes}} to the interior layout of the aircraft. [...] The -8I's upper deck is lengthened compared to the 747-400. Most noticeable is the curved stairway to the upper deck and a more spacious main passenger entrance. The 747-8's main cabin uses an interior {{similar to that of}} the 787. Overhead bins are curved, and the center row is designed to look as though it is attached to the curved ceiling, rather than integrated into the ceiling's curve like on the 777. The windows are also of similar size to the type used on the 777, which are 8% larger than those on the current 747-400s. The 747-8 features a new solid-state light-emitting diode (LED) lighting system, which can create <b>mood</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pacific Premium Economy is in a {{dedicated}} cabin, which shares lavatories with the Business Premier cabin, {{available on the}} Boeing 777-200ER, Boeing 787-9, and some Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The class has the same <b>mood</b> <b>lighting,</b> dining and wine selection and in-seat power as the Business Premier cabin. The newly refurbished seats are wider with a 9-inch recline and extendable leg rests with a 2-4-2 configuration on the 777 variants, and a 2-3-2 configuration on the 787-9. Following positive reviews and high demand after its introduction, Air New Zealand re-launched its Pacific Premium cabin with added business class services, including priority check-in, priority baggage handling and the same baggage allowance as Business Premier (priority baggage handling and extra baggage allowance do not apply for passengers with connecting flights to other airlines).

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of smart LEDs, lighting based interior design is becoming popular. However, most of the smart LED-based lighting systems rely on expert-human intervention to create a desired atmosphere. For convenience, commercial lighting systems offer a number of options but their usability is fairly restricted. Therefore, an intuitive interface is required for novice users to generate the desired lighting environment. In this paper, we have developed a software, named MudGet, which automatically extracts the <b>light</b> <b>mood</b> from a digital image and controls the LED lamps to reproduce a desired lighting effect according to the extracted <b>light</b> <b>mood.</b> In our method, the <b>light</b> <b>mood</b> {{is regarded as a}} set of the representative colors of the digital image. The representative colors are extracted by utilizing K-means clustering algorithm. The dimming parameters are set for which each of the LED lamps create the lighting environment with the mood extracted by the software. To evaluate the feasibility of mood reproduction qualitatively, the degree of similarity between the <b>light</b> <b>mood</b> in the digital image and the reproduced result using LEDs is evaluated by a user study under a miniaturized experimental set. We observe that users can easily produce a desired atmosphere through the proposed MudGet software...|$|R
2500|$|Venus Flytrap (Tim Reid), the soulful, funky evening DJ {{runs his}} {{show with a}} smooth-talking persona and <b>mood</b> <b>lighting</b> in the studio. His real name, Gordon Sims, is almost never used, and he {{maintains}} an aura of mystery. In an early episode it is revealed Gordon Sims is a Vietnam veteran who is wanted for desertion from the US Army. In later episodes Venus's backstory is elaborated upon and it is revealed that after deserting the army he spent several years as a high-school teacher in New Orleans while working part-time as a radio personality. In {{spite of the fact}} that he is a night time DJ and Johnny Fever works the early morning shift, the two are often seen together and become fast friends as the series progresses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contemporary}} and retrospective reception towards Kileak: The DNA Imperative was mixed. The game {{was criticized for}} its gameplay, with the Official UK PlayStation Magazine (OPM UK) describing it as [...] "uninspired" [...] and [...] "shallow". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com found the game's control scheme limited {{compared to that of}} [...] and Perfect Dark. The level design was also criticized. OPM UK complained that two consecutive levels were identical apart from differences in their [...] "wallpaper, <b>mood</b> <b>lighting,</b> and layout". IGN similarly felt that the levels are [...] "all very homogeneous" [...] as they shared similar enemies and graphical detail. Tommy Glide of GamePro said the game controls well but relies on dull enemies who use cheap attacks. AllGame's Shawn Sackenheim found the collection of enemies unoriginal, although OPM UK noted that the enemies are [...] "suitably menacing".|$|E

As well as <b>mood</b> <b>lighting,</b> in colours such as red, and blue, located in the door sills, handles, and other nooks and crannies of the Evoque. The Evoque also has a push button start system, which will start the vehicle automatically, once the key fob is sensed. The cabin seats four, with optional heated seating, steering wheel, and windscreen wipers. There is also a 5–inch driver's information display, which displays information about the vehicle, and more. There are 12 interior colour choices available in a variety of wood and metal trims as well as three optional contrasting roof treatments.|$|E
