40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop an {{evidence-based}} approach to the post-marketing withdrawal of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> when harms are attributed to their use. Methods: Electronic and non-electronic searches were conducted to identify <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> withdrawn from the market because of adverse reactions. Data relating to the time periods between launch, first adverse reaction reports and withdrawals, the mechanism through which the adverse reactions occurred, and the countries of withdrawal were extracted. Standard criteria were used to document the levels of evidence used by drug regulators to make the withdrawal decisions; scatter plots and two-by-two tables used to explore the trends over time. A previously published algorithm {{was used to examine}} the justification for withdrawals. To examine the benefits and harms of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> before regulatory approval, searches were conducted on drug regulatory websites and scientific databases. The Cochrane criterion was used to examine the risk of bias, Review Manager Software for meta-analysis, and GRADE criterion to rate the quality of evidence. Results: Improvements in pharmacovigilance over the past six decades have resulted in quicker detection of harms caused by approved medicinal products; however, there have not been corresponding improvements in how quickly harmful products are withdrawn from the market following the reports of harms. Harmful drugs are significantly less likely to be withdrawn in low resource settings. The quality of evidence in drug trials for which regulatory approval decisions are based is on the whole, poor. There is a lack of consistency in the methods used by drug regulators to assess the harms of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> before granting <b>marketing</b> licences.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{the study}} was to draw a {{comprehensive}} picture of the pharmaceutical wholesale sector, outlining its socio-economic importance compared to different distribution systems such as short-line wholesaling, direct sales from manufacturers, Reduced Wholesale Arrangements (RWA) and Direct to Pharmacy (DTP) arrangements. Its role is considered from an economic, effectiveness and, most importantly, a public health viewpoint with qualitative and quantitative methods, focusing on France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. METHODS: First, data has been sourced from annual GIRP and IMS-Health statistics; second, a systematic literature research verified the empirical findings; third, an online-questionnaire was directed to pharmacies. Further data have been sourced from a questionnaire, addressing GIRP-full-member associations and wholesale companies (return rate 86 %). RESULTS: On a weighted average, pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers in the observed countries alone pre-finance € 10. 2 bn over a period of 41 days the entire medicine-market and secure the cash-flow of the social-insurers (Germany: € 2. 60 bn for 38 days; Italy: € 2. 27 bn for 68 days; the UK: € 1. 48 bn for 36 days; France: € 1. 28 bn for 22 days; Spain: € 969. 76 m for 27 days; the Netherlands: € 399. 09 m for 30 days on average). On average, pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers are bundling products of 18. 28 manufacturers per delivery. The process costs would increase by € 164, 922. 43 to € 171, 510. 06 per year, if there were no pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers. These additional costs would have to be paid by manufacturers, pharmacies and finally by patients. Regarding the satisfaction with different distribution models, the results of the online-questionnaire show that pharmacists in the observed countries are very satisfied with the distribution through their pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that pharmaceutical full-line wholesalers have an important and unique position in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Special functions like the pre-financing of the entire <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> <b>market,</b> or the guarantee of the continuous supply of all <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> verify these findings. </p...|$|R

Sometimes bioequivalence can be investigated with in vitro-studies, like dissolution test. The BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) -based biowaiver approach is useful to reduce in vivo bioequivalence studies, it may represent a “surrogate” for in vivo bioequivalence. This concept is applicable to immediate release and solid pharmaceutical products for oral administration and systemic action having the same pharmaceutical form. BCS-based biowaivers are applicable to substances with “high solubility” and “high permeability” (BCS-class I) like Enrofloxacin and Metronidazole, or “high solubility” and “low permeability” (BCS-class III) like Spiramycin. The objective of this research work was to develop two new products "comparable" and "alternative" respect to the products already on the market. In the first project, conventional release tablets of "Spiramycin" and “Metronidazole” were developed in two different doses, equivalent to a veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> on the <b>market.</b> In the second project, conventional release tablets of "Enrofloxacin" were developed in two different doses, equivalent to a veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> on the <b>market.</b> Bioequivalence studies were conducted using BCS-based biowaivers approach.

In practice, however, <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> are also frequently prescribed for treatment outside the registered therapeutic use, a practice that is referred to as "off-label use. " While off-label use of conventional medicines is permitted and has been very useful, the off-label use of GMO medicines is not covered in the European Union (EU) legislation or guidelines and falls under each member state's national environmental legislation. This implies that in the Netherlands and most other EU member states, an environmental permit will be required for any institution that uses the GMO medicine outside the registered application(s). In the Netherlands, this permit is identical to the permits required for the execution of clinical trials involving nonregistered GMOs. The application procedure for such permit is time-consuming. This process can therefore limit the therapeutic options for medical professionals. As a consequence, desired treatment regimens could be withheld for certain patient (groups).

The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010. The price regulation system and reimbursement with an efficient use and supply of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> could have positive effects on the management and reduction of public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In the paper <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> used in hospitals have not been analysed...|$|R
