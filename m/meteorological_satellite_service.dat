5000|$|In 1962, {{on leave}} from the university, Singer was named as the first {{director}} of <b>meteorological</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>services</b> for the National Weather Satellite Center, {{now part of the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and directed a program for using satellites to forecast the weather. He stayed there until 1964. He told Time magazine in 1969 that he enjoyed moving around. [...] "Each move gave me a completely new perspective," [...] he said. [...] "If I had sat still, I'd probably still be measuring cosmic rays, the subject of my thesis at Princeton. That's what happens to most scientists." [...] When he stepped down as director he received a Department of Commerce Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Federal Service.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With limited {{opportunities}} {{to open up}} new unen-cumbered bands to mobile wireless services, interest in enhancing methods for sharing of spectrum between services is high. For example, the band 1695 - 1710 MHz {{is expected to be}} made available to 3 GPP Long-Term Evolution cellular network up-links by sharing with incumbent <b>meteorological</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>services</b> already in the band. The LTE networks are to be operated in a manner that ensures no loss of incumbent capability by adhering to protection requirements such as a limit on the aggregate interference power at fixed incumbent earth station locations. In this paper, we consider this specific spectrum sharing scenario as motivation and formulate an optimization framework for power control and time-frequency resource scheduling on the LTE uplink with an aggregate interference constraint. We design and propose a novel algorithm inspired by numerical solution and analysis of the optimization problem. Using theory and simula-tion, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms more simplistic approaches, well approximates the optimal solution, and is of sufficient scope and complexity for practical implemen-tation, even in relatively large LTE networks. Algorithms of this kind are necessary for mobile wireless networks {{to make the most of}} constrained spectrum resources in shared bands. I...|$|R

40|$|EUMETSAT {{has been}} {{providing}} operational <b>meteorological</b> <b>satellite</b> data <b>services</b> to European and US (via NOAA) national weather centers since {{the launch of}} Metop-A in October 2006. The service is characterized by high availability requirements and low latency delivery, essential for the accuracy of numerical weather predictions. However, further improvements in the data delivery timeliness would clearly have benefits to accuracy and availability of short-term weather predictions. To this end, EUMETSAT, together with partners in NOAA, NASA and the US National Science Foundation embarked on a project to provide an Antarctic Data Acquisition (ADA) capability using the McMurdo Ground Station. Coupled with the existing downlink of global data at Svalbard in the Arctic this would reduce the latency by close to a factor of two, benefiting from downlinks near each pole. The challenge was to introduce this major improvement to a key system requirement on an already operational system, without impacting the availability or quality of existing services during the integration and testing of the ADA and after its introduction into the operational system. Touching almost every element of the system design and operation, including the satellite operation, the Svalbard satellite data management, the EUMETSA...|$|R

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the {{decisions}} of WARC- 79 are crucial to the future utility of applications evolving from research and development of space techniques. WARC- 79 provided the spectrum allocations and protection which will permit continued development of a broad range of space applications. Space research and earth-exploration <b>satellite</b> <b>services</b> are discussed, taking into account remote sensing, spectrum requirements, implications for designers and regulators, and space research and earth exploration <b>satellite</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Meteorological</b> <b>satellites</b> are considered along with search-and-rescue operations, standard frequency and time satellites, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the solar-power satellite. The WARC rejected a U. S. allocation proposal for the solar-power satellite on the basis that the proposal was premature because spectrum, biological, and ecological impacts have not yet been fully examined...|$|R
