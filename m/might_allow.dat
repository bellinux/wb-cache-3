5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it <b>might</b> <b>allow</b> long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was {{a major part of}} ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.|$|E
5|$|Because the Sprint was {{designed}} to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during {{the initial stages of}} the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which <b>might</b> <b>allow</b> the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer.|$|E

25|$|According to Nadia Abu El-Haj, {{the issues}} of origins are {{generally}} complicated by the difficulties of writing history via genome studies and the biases of emotional investments in different narratives, {{depending on whether the}} emphasis lies on direct descent or on conversion within Jewish history.

50|$|Other {{important}} factors may include the lengths of tracks {{limiting the number}} of rolling stock vehicles which can be placed along them. Some shunting puzzles allow certain types of rolling stock to navigate a particular section of track but not other types of rolling stock, for example a locomotive <b>might</b> not be <b>allowed</b> to pass below a low bridge whereas wagons are allowed, or a particularly heavy wagon <b>might</b> not be <b>allowed</b> across a weak bridge, or a particularly tall wagon <b>might</b> not be <b>allowed</b> to pass through a tunnel.|$|R

25|$|This <b>might</b> <b>allow</b> {{the running}} of steam {{services}} from York to Whitby again (or even Scarborough to Whitby, if the short lived curve towards Scarborough were reinstated too).

When Elmore was returned to service in 1916, its schedule was changed so that it now departed Portland every Wednesday night for Tillamook.|$|E
