25|$|Measurements {{of small}} {{variations}} in the natural abundances of deuterium, {{along with those of}} the stable heavy oxygen isotopes 17O and 18O, are of importance in hydrology, to trace the geographic origin of Earth's waters. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater (so-called <b>meteoric</b> <b>water)</b> are enriched {{as a function of the}} environmental temperature of the region in which the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to mean latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater (as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls predictably along a line called the global <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> line (GMWL). This plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified along with general information about the climate in which it originated. Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water processes, also differentially alter the ratios of heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often regionally distinctive ways. The ratio of concentration of 2H to 1H is usually indicated with a delta as δ2H and the geographic patterns of these values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotope are incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.|$|E

25|$|The {{possibility}} of using water isotope depletion with elevation to reconstruct paleoaltimetry was demonstrated {{as early as}} the late 1960s, when Caltech geochemist Samuel Epstein tried to collect rainwater at different elevations in a single storm. The δ18O and δD lapse rates vary within -1 to -5‰/km and -10 to -40‰/km respectively, but can vary with locations and seasons, and are not exactly linear with altitude. One of the first studies in stable isotope paleoaltimetry demonstrated a <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> δD signature of -90 to -139‰ in fluid inclusions in quartz and adularia in an epithermal gold-silver deposit in Nevada, and suggested the applicability of stable isotopes in reconstruction of ancient topography in the Great Basin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of hydrous silicate minerals have since then been used to reconstruct topographic histories in mountain ranges across the world, including the North American Cordillera, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the European Alps, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. Lab experiments with clay minerals have shown that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions are relatively resistant to alteration at moderate temperature (<100nbsp&°C), and can preserve the original <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> signal. One important effect of mountain ranges on rainfall stable isotopes is the rain shadow effect, in which an isotopic depletion happens in precipitation on the leeward side compared to the windward side. A change in the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation on the two sides of a mountain can be used to infer the magnitude of the rain shadow effect. In one such study, an isotope enrichment was observed in smectite {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-Miocene to late Pliocene, suggesting a decrease in elevation during this period. Another study found δD values around -140‰ in muscovite in the North America Cordillera during the early Eocene, which would suggest an elevation 1000m higher than today at the time. In addition to hydrous minerals, hydrogen isotopes in biomarkers such as leaf waxes have also been developed for paleoaltimetry studies. The δD lapse rate in leaf waxes (-21‰/km) falls in the range of <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> observations. As an example study, leaf wax δD data have been used to confirm hydrous mineral paleoaltimetry for the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada during the Eocene.|$|E
25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a temperature sensitivity of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring δD have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E

25|$|As f {{decreases}} progressively during condensation, {{the remaining}} vapor {{becomes more and}} more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The Rayleigh distillation process can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, all of which are associated with progressive moisture loss during transport. The Rayleigh distillation model {{can also be used to}} explain the strong correlation between δD and δ18O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> line (GMWL): δD=8δ18O+10 (later updated to δD=8.17±0.07 δ18O+11.27±0.65) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation during condensation. It should be noted that the intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the hydrological cycle both globally and locally.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and soil water. For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the <b>meteoric</b> <b>water</b> line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic composition of soil water is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic composition of soil water is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic composition of soil water is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of soil water and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E

The composition of the fumaroles indicates that most gases are of magmatic origin with little contribution from the atmosphere.

As the enriched waters attempt to achieve equilibrium they precipitate calcite, through the reaction of Ca+2 + 2HCO− ⇔ CO2↑ + H2O+ CaCO3↓.The mountains surrounding the Portneuf are characterized by thick Paleozoic limestone deposits rich in carbonates, and many springs do emerge along the reach associated with Lava Hot Springs.|$|R

Further studies by Bruce Smith and Samuel Epstein in 1970 confirmed the depletion of deuterium in organics compared to environmental water. Another duo in 1970, Schiegl and Vogel, analyzed the composition of hydrogen isotopes as water became biomass, as biomass became coal and oil, and as oil became natural gas.

40|$|There is {{renewing}} {{evidence that}} the Tropics might strongly influence climate dynamics on millennial time-scales. Part of this "tropical forcing " is related {{to changes in the}} water cycle that impacts atmospheric and oceanic processes on a broad scale. Past variations of the continental hydrology are poorly documented due to the few available records and the lack of quantitative data on climate parameters. The deuterium/hydrogen ratio (δD) of algal derived biomarkers captures the isotopic composition of <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters</b> (Huang et al., 2002; Sachse et al., 2004).

D/H and O 18 /O 16 ratios have been determined {{for a large}} variety of bulk samples and mineral separates from: Quaternary soils and clay-rich weathering zones; Tertiary, Cretaceous and Pennsylvanian kaolinite deposits; a number of montmorillonite occurrences (from bentonites, fossil soils, alteration of pillow lavas, etc.); Precambrian, Paleozoic and Cretaceous shales; and Pleistocene glacial lake clays. Most samples are from the western and southern United States, but analyses have also been obtained from Hawaii {{and other parts of}} North America. Laboratory experiments indicate that kaolinites do not suffer any significant amount of hydrogen isotopic exchange at room temperature when in contact with D enriched waters.

The [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] values of the hydroxides (e. g., gibbsite) are generally 10 to 20 % lighter and 15 to 20 % heavier, respectively, than local <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters.</b> The isotopic values of the hydroxides plot {{in the vicinity of the}} line [ [...] . ]. A kaolinite soil profile from Georgia and a montmorillonite profile from California, both formed on granitic rock types, were studied in detail. Other detailed sampling was done on a halloysite profile formed on basalt, on three poorly-developed profiles on Cretaceous shales, and a poorly-developed profile on a Precambrian shale. These studies indicate that igneous and sedimentary parent rock minerals do not undergo appreciable oxygen or hydrogen isotopic exchange with <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters</b> in the weathering environment. However, the clay minerals and hydroxides produced by the alteration of the parent rock are formed essentially in isotopic equilibrium with the local <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters.</b> The D/H and O 18 /O 16 ratios of most Pre-Quaternary kaolinites, bentonites, and shales are significantly higher than those of clay-rich Quaternary soils in the same geographic areas. The D/H ratios of Lower Paleozoic and Precambrian shales from eastern United States to Montana and British Columbia show no correlation with the D/H ratios of present-day <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters.</b> The D/H ratios of glacial lake clays, which were exposed to glacial melt waters highly depleted in deuterium are identical to the D/H ratios of Lower Paleozoic shales of the eastern United States from which they were largely derived. All these data suggest that the isotopic ratios of the Pre-Quaternary clay minerals are largely preserved. Because the isotopic values of ancient clay minerals seem to be commonly preserved, the D/H ratios of ancient kaolinites formed by weathering processes can be used to estimate the D/H ratios of ancient <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters.</b> Using the [ [...] . ] values of the Tertiary kaolinites and a [ [...] . ] a tentative contour map of the [ [...] . ] values of "mid-Tertiary" <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters</b> has been drawn. The distribution of the [ [...] . ] values of Tertiary <b>meteoric</b> <b>waters</b> are similar to the present-day distribution except that the contrast in [ [...] . ] values between coastal and high inland regions in the Tertiary was less extreme than the present contrast. The interpretation is that the distribution of land and the meteorological patterns in the Tertiary were somewhat similar to today but that the climate was generally warmer. Also it is possible that many present-day topographic barriers were absent or less important in the Tertiary. This is in agreement with climatic data suggested by paleobotanical evidence. The wide range of D/H and O 18 /O 16 ratios determined for relatively pure (> 80 %) kaolinites formed by the weathering process confirms that the kaolinite line derived by Savin and Epstein (1970 a) is essentially correct. However, the D/H and O 18 /O 16 ratios of montmorillonites formed as weathering products or in sedimentary environments display a much greater scatter than kaolinites, presumably as a result of (1) the greater range of chemical compositions of montmorillonites compared to kaolinites, (2) the greater range of the temperatures of formation of montmorillonites, and (3) the possibility that the D/H ratios determined for montmorillonite OH are contaminated during heating and outgassing procedures. Hence, the montmorillonite line derived by Savin and Epstein (1970 a) apparently does not apply to most montmorillonites in nature...|$|R
