50|$|Taking it as {{established}} {{that a state}} has constitutional power to pass laws giving rights and imposing liabilities for acts done upon the high seas {{when there were no}} such rights or liabilities before, what is there to hinder its doing so {{in the case of a}} <b>maritime</b> <b>tort?</b> Not the existence of an inconsistent law emanating from a superior source, that is, from the United States. There is no such law. The maritime law is not a corpus juris—it is a very limited body of customs and ordinances of the sea.|$|E

On board was $ 5000 in specie owned by a small group of Baltimore merchants. The Baltimore merchants brought a libel against Captain Almeida and requested an attachment in rem to force Captain Almeida to answer for the <b>maritime</b> <b>tort.</b> Although the attachment initially issued, the lower court restored Captain Almeida’s goods.

40|$|It {{is within}} the {{framework}} of the discipline called tort law that the rules of compensation for damages are to be found. The Swedish general tort law is subsidiary, which means that laws that in the light of the question at hand seam more adequate shall be applied instead of the ordinary tort law. Within the framework of what is colloquially called <b>maritime</b> <b>tort</b> law (sjöskaderätt), one may for example sort legal rules concerning compensation for damages occurred under transport, by escape of oil from ships or damages occurred by collision of ships. There are differences between the ordinary material law of torts and the material law of <b>maritime</b> <b>tort</b> law. Insofar one argues that legal, formal, coherency is the proper yardstick of legal legitimacy either the ordinary tort law or the marine tort law has to be wrong. Of course, one could argue that the correct yardstick is consequential coherence and that only the result matters independent of what kind of instrument (the joint and several- or the pro rata liability) that is used. Another argument would be that there are differences as well in theory as in practice, but that those differences are justified in the light of that the political motives may differ between those the systems of law. In other words: the political instruments are set to achieve different political goals...|$|E

40|$|This comment {{compares the}} Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding with the {{approaches}} other courts have taken regarding loss of society damages and the dependency rule for awarding such recovery in maritime wrongful death actions. This comment concludes that, although the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision was an empathetic attempt at developing {{the law of}} maritime damages, the holding 2 ̆ 7 s glaring conflict {{with the spirit of}} the maritime remedial statutory scheme is exemplary of a growing problem in maritime law. Specifically, as judges struggle to keep the rules of admiralty current with common law developments outside the maritime context, the separation of judge-made doctrine from Congressional policy widens within admiralty jurisdiction, thereby creating new and greater anomalies in admiralty uniformity, more uncertainty for admiralty practitioners, and unfair results for some <b>maritime</b> <b>tort</b> victims...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{intrinsically}} international character and very frequent cross-border implications, <b>maritime</b> <b>torts</b> typically involve {{private international law}} matters. Therefore, with regard to cases and issues falling {{outside the scope of}} application of the relevant uniform law Conventions the problem arises of determining the applicable law according to the conflict-of-law rules laid down - at EU law level - in the Rome II Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 864 / 2007), mostly based on territorial connecting factors. The implementation of such rules, however, is sometimes critical, in particular in presence of “external torts” (i. e., torts which produce damage either on several ships or outside a ship) occurring on the High Seas; with respect to these cases, some national legislations (e. g., the Dutch civil code) have introduced ad hoc rules providing for the application of the lex fori. In the light of the above, the present contribution assesses the opportunity to adopt the same solution {{on the occasion of the}} planned revision of the 1995 Italian legislation on private international law (Law No. 218 / 1995), concluding, however, that such integration “ab externo” of the Regulation is not ultimately required...|$|R
