50|$|Lesion {{studies show}} that when lesions are imposed to the medial frontal lobe, {{performance}} on mentalization tasks is reduced, similar to typical mind-blindness cases. Patients that experienced frontal lobe injuries due to severe head trauma showed signs of <b>mind</b> <b>blindness,</b> {{as a result of}} a lost ToM. However it is still debated whether the inactivation of the medial frontal lobe is involved in mind-blindness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{social and}} {{cognitive}} impairments seen in patients suffering from pervasive developmental disorders {{can be attributed}} due to <b>mind</b> <b>blindness.</b> Abnormal behaviour of children with autism include the lack of reciprocity. Severe cases in which mind-blindness manifests includes the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as {{not being able to}} make eye contact while in less severe cases the individual may attempt to interact with other people. Despite this severe form of autism that is characterised by social detachment, global asocial behaviours is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in autistic patients as a [...] "triad of deficits". The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' mind.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the condition associated with disease or injury of the brain in which ability to identify objects is impaired may in certain cases be regarded as a true failure of recognition. Such was the conclusion of Jackson (1876) when he reported a case of 'imperception', of Munk (1877) when he described 'mind blindness ' in dogs, of Lissauer (1890) when he distinguished between 'apperceptive ' and 'associative ' <b>mind</b> <b>blindness,</b> and of Freud (1891) when he proposed the term 'agnosia' for cases having defective 'object-concepts'. Al-though many authors of the present century (notabl...|$|E

50|$|In Winnipeg, Marchenko {{sometimes}} {{served at}} St Michael's Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on 110 Disraeli Street. Towards {{the end of}} his life, he became blind. His mind seemed to wander. Despite his wandering <b>mind,</b> and his <b>blindness,</b> he gave a sense under it all of someone blessed or enlightened. Perceptively, Maydanyk noted that, though we do not know why Marchenko left the Russian church to begin with, no matter how difficult life became for him outside of it, he never returned to its fold.|$|R
40|$|An {{argument}} from illusion {{assumes that the}} illusion occurring in perception is a reason to redefine the ordinary account of perception as a direct and immediate access to reality, therefore it suffice to refute a direct realism. Many theories of perception where arisen to address the problem, the most popular ones are: the sense-datum theory, the adverbial theory, the intentionalist theory and the mostrecent the disjunctivist theory. Recent work in psychology and philosophy of <b>mind</b> on change <b>blindness</b> and related phenomena elicit a new skepticism {{about the nature of}} perception which is called a grand illusion hypothesis. It seems that doubts engendered by this hypothesis goes even further than those of the {{argument from}} illusion, because it suggests that subjects have a radically false beliefs about what their perceptual experience is like. Iâ€™d like to consider the number of ways of understanding the hypothesis and evaluate them...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was further}} debate, and in March 1845 the Militia Ordinance 1845 {{was passed by}} the legislature, {{enabling}} the Governor to form a militia if and when required; training would be implemented only when the militia was needed. The ordinance required: Every man except as hereinafter excepted, between the ages of (18) years and (60) years, being a British subject, and not an aboriginal native, who shall reside within the colony, shall be liable to serve in such militia. ... Those exempted under clause 7 were [...] "Judges of the Supreme Court, all members of the Legislative Council, all clergymen, priests, ministers of religion, and catechists." [...] In addition under Clause 9 the Police Magistrate shall have power, after hearing such objections, to strike out of the said list the names of all persons who shall not be liable to serve as militiamen, and also of such as are afflicted by lunacy or unsoundness of <b>mind,</b> or deafness, <b>blindness,</b> lameness, or by any other disorder that may render them unfit for active service in any such militia ....|$|R
60|$|I {{suppress}} {{all that}} is in my <b>mind</b> about the <b>blindness</b> of those of our clergy who will shut their eyes to a thing which glares in such manifest day. If some wretches amongst an indigent and disorderly part of the populace raise a riot about tithes, there are of these gentlemen ready to cry {{out that this is}} an overt act of a treasonable conspiracy. Here the bulls, and the pardons, and the crusade, and the Pope, and the thunders of the Vatican are everywhere at work. There is a plot to bring in a foreign power to destroy the Church. Alas! it is not about popes, but about potatoes, that the minds of this unhappy people are agitated. It is not from the spirit of zeal, but the spirit of whiskey, that these wretches act. Is it, then, not conceived possible that a poor clown can be unwilling, after paying three pounds rent to a gentleman in a brown coat, to pay fourteen shillings to one in a black coat, for his acre of potatoes, and tumultuously to desire some modification of the charge, without being supposed to have no other motive than a frantic zeal for being thus double-taxed to another set of landholders and another set of priests? Have men no self-interest, no avarice, no repugnance to public imposts? Have they no sturdy and restive minds, no undisciplined habits? Is there nothing in the whole mob of irregular passions, which might precipitate some of the common people, in some places, to quarrel with a legal, because they feel it to be a burdensome imposition? According to these gentlemen, no offence can be committed by Papists but from zeal to their religion. To make room for the vices of Papists, they clear the house of all the vices of men. Some of the common people (not one, however, in ten thousand) commit disorders. Well! punish them as you do, and as you ought to punish them, for their violence against the just property of each individual clergyman, as each individual suffers. Support the injured rector, or the injured impropriator, in the enjoyment of the estate of which (whether on the best plan or not) the laws have put him in possession. Let the crime and the punishment stand upon their own bottom. But now we ought all of us, clergymen most particularly, to avoid assigning another cause of quarrel, in order to infuse a new source of bitterness into a dispute which personal feelings on both sides will of themselves make bitter enough, and thereby involve in it by religious descriptions men who have individually no share whatsoever in those irregular acts. Let us not make the malignant fictions of our own imaginations, heated with factious controversies, reasons for keeping men that are neither guilty nor justly suspected of crime in a servitude equally dishonorable and unsafe to religion and to the state. When men are constantly accused, but know themselves not to be guilty, they must naturally abhor their accusers. There is no character, when malignantly taken up and deliberately pursued, which more naturally excites indignation and abhorrence in mankind, especially in that part of mankind which suffers from it.|$|R
