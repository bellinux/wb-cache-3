5000|$|Pinus cembroides, {{also known}} as pinyon pine, Mexican pinyon, <b>Mexican</b> <b>nut</b> <b>pine,</b> and Mexican stone pine, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to western North America. It grows in areas {{with low levels of}} {{rainfall}} and its range extends southwards from Arizona, Texas and New Mexico in the United States into Mexico. It typically grows at altitudes between 1600 and 2400 m. It is a small pine growing to about 20 m with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm. The seeds are large and form part of the diet of the Mexican jay and Abert's squirrel. They are also collected for human consumption, being the most widely used pine nut in Mexico. This is a common pine with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a methodology for controlled pollination of Araucaria angustifolia, aiming at the genetic improvement of the species and increased yield of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> through management with supplemental pollination. A methodology of controlled pollination was developed in which several experiments were carried out in 2003 - 2005 period. The effects of the following parameters were evaluated: controlled pollination, amount of pollen applied per female strobilus, time of pollination, and development stage of the female strobilus during pollination on the number of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> yielded per <b>pine</b> cone. A single controlled pollination procedure results in low yield of fully filled <b>pine</b> <b>nuts,</b> and pollination at later development stages of the female strobilus results in high yields of fully filled <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> per <b>pine</b> cone. Controlled pollination in A. angustifolia proved effective for <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> production and its application in oriented breeding procedures will enable breeding that up until now was considered impossible in nature on account of the considerable distance between the parent plants. Controlled pollination performed twice in female strobili more than 30 mm in diameter does increase the yield of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> per <b>pine</b> cone...|$|R

40|$|Appetite suppressants {{may be one}} {{strategy}} {{in the fight against}} obesity. This study evaluated whether Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> free fatty acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) work as an appetite suppressant. Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA were evaluated in STC- 1 cell culture for their ability to increase cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) secretion vs. several other dietary fatty acids from Italian stone <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> fatty acids, oleic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and capric acid used as a control. At 50 μM concentration, Korean <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA produced the greatest amount of CCK- 8 release (493 pg/ml) relative to the other fatty acids and control (46 pg/ml). A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial including 18 overweight post-menopausal women was performed. Subjects received capsules with 3 g Korean <b>pine</b> (Pinus koraiensis) <b>nut</b> FFA, 3 g <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> TG or 3 g placebo (olive oil) in combination with a light breakfast. At 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes the gut hormones cholecystokinin (CCK- 8), glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), peptide YY (PYY) and ghrelin, and appetite sensations were measured. A wash-out period of one week separated each intervention day. CCK- 8 was higher 30 min after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA and 60 min after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> TG when compared to placebo (p < 0. 01). GLP- 1 was higher 60 min after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA compared to placebo (p < 0. 01). Over a period of 4 hours the total amount of plasma CCK- 8 was 60 % higher after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA and 22 % higher after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> TG than after placebo (p < 0. 01). For GLP- 1 this difference was 25 % after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA (P < 0. 05). Ghrelin and PYY levels were not different between groups. The appetite sensation "prospective food intake" was 36 % lower after <b>pine</b> <b>nut</b> FFA relative to placebo (P < 0. 05).

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> (Pinus spp.) are {{becoming}} more popular in New Zealand cuisine and so their availability has increased. They have a unique taste because they contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. They are {{an excellent source of}} dietary fatty acids, such as linoleic and oleic acids. <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are either locally-grown or imported and informal reports suggest that each cultivar has a very different taste because of the different patterns of fatty acids found in each of the cultivars. Five different cultivars of <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> were harvested from trees growing in Marlborough and the fatty acid profiles were compared to samples of imported <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> available in local supermarkets. Individual fatty acids in each sample of nuts were analysed using FastGLC methods and the fatty acids were identified by mass spectrometry. Local fresh <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> contained high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, oleic and linoleic acid. They also contained several Δ 5 -­olefinic fatty acids, taxoleic, pinolenic, coniferonic, eicosadienoic, sciadonic and eicosatrienoic which are characteristic of gymnosperms. The pattern of these Δ 5 -­olefinic fatty acids can be used to determine the botanical origin of the <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> and can assist in the identification of the country of origin. Conclusion: <b>Pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are generally assumed to be sourced from European stone pine (P. pinea), however, this analysis shows that imported <b>pine</b> <b>nuts</b> are not P. pinea.
