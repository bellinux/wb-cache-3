40|$|As {{soon as the}} ten {{new member}} {{countries}} have fulfilled the convergence criteria of Maastricht they can be accepted for accession to the European Monetary Union. By now, these countries pursue quite different <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> <b>strategies</b> {{in order to reach}} a high degree of monetary convergence, including different exchange rate systems. Since the new Eastern European countries are in a transformation process with partly difficult disinflation processes it is especially important to adopt the best strategy available. Therefore, information on the relative success of the different <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>strategies</b> seems important, for if certain strategies can be identified as more successful than others, it makes sense for the other countries to adopt them. In that way the overall monetary convergence process in the new EU member countries could be improved. In what follows, the different <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> are theoretically described. This is followed by a description of the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>strategies</b> as they have been applied during the 1990 s. In order to determine the relative success of these strategies the position of each country relative to the average of the ten new member countries is determined on the basis of five indicators: GDP growth, rate of inflation, current account balance, real effective exchange rate, and budget deficit. It turns out that the three Baltic States as well as Poland and the Czech Republic have so far been more successful than Slovenia, Slovakia and Hungary. Furthermore, a regime of either fixed or flexible exchange rate systems seems to be superior to any point on a continuum between this two "border points". [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Although the ECB {{does not}} {{consider}} itself to be an inflation-targeting central bank, after {{the inception of the}} euro in January 1999, the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) has been to maintain price stability within the Eurozone. The Governing Council of the ECB in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2%, “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%” and added that price stability ”was to be maintained over the medium term”. The Governing Council confirmed this definition in May 2003 following a thorough evaluation of the ECB's <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>strategy.</b> On that occasion, the Governing Council clarified that “in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”. Since then, the numerical target of 2% has become common for major developed economies, including the United States (since January 2012) and Japan (since January 2013).|$|E

50|$|In 2002, the Central Bank {{adopted a}} modern <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>strategy,</b> namely the “inflation {{targeting}} regime”. During {{the implementation of}} the implicit inflation targeting regime of the 2002-2005 period, the Bank tried to lay the basis for the regime by ensuring the necessary pre-conditions, strengthened its technical and institutional infrastructure, developed estimation models and expanded its data set. During this process, the Research Department was restructured as the Research and Monetary Policy Department and the Communications Department was set up to ensure effectiveness of communications policies. From 2005 onwards, the Monetary Policy Committee started to announce, in advance, its meeting dates as a yearly calendar, to increase predictability of policy decisions. The outcome of this entire process was the explicit inflation targeting regime that started to be implemented in 2006. Upon achieving some progress in the disinflation process, a two-stage monetary reform was launched in order to emphasize the Bank’s determination in its efforts, to enhance the credibility of the Turkish currency, and to eliminate various problems arising from high denomination. In the first stage, six zeros were removed from the Turkish lira, and banknotes of the New Turkish lira (YTL) and coins of the New kuruş (YKr) were put into circulation from 1 January 2005 onwards.On 1 January 2009, the second stage of the reform was launched by removing the prefix “New” used on the “New Turkish lira” and “New kuruş”, and Turkish lira banknotes and coins were put into circulation with new designs and sizes. As of today, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, as a credible institution, pursues its policy implementations with its qualified staff members and modern infrastructure within an ever-dynamic framework by keeping a close watch on global and domestic developments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a Diamond-type model of endogenous growth {{in which there}} are three assets: outside money, government bonds, and equity. Due to productivity shocks, the equity return is uncertain, and risk averse investors require a positive equity premium. Typically, there exist two steady states, but only one of them is stable, both in the forward perfect foresight dynamics and under adaptive expectations. Tight <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is harmful for growth in the stable steady state. These results hold under four different <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> <b>strategies</b> applied by the monetary authority. A monetary contraction increases the bond return, reduces the equity premium and thereby capital investment and growth. ...|$|R
