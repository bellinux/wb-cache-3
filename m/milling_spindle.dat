40|$|International audienceThe present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} milling tool vibration effects on chip morphology, cutting force and cut surface topology. The study concerns an orthogonal down-cut peripheral milling case for an aeronautic aluminium alloy A 2024 -T 351. A finite element based hybrid dynamic cutting model (HDC-model) is proposed {{to predict the}} chip morphology under dynamic cutting conditions. The latter is conceived with commercial software ABAQUS®/EXPLICIT and combines the stiffness of a high speed <b>milling</b> <b>spindle</b> system (tool, tool-holder and rotor) with the chip formation process. A qualitative parametric study with various stiffness and damping coefficient values for high speed <b>milling</b> <b>spindle</b> system has been performed. The results concerning chip morphology and cutting force are compared with the experimental ones, while the surface profiles are compared with those obtained by considering perfectly rigid spindle system. As expected, a less rigid un-damped milling system generates higher amplitude tool vibrations during milling. In this situation, the temperature rises at tool-workpiece interface, enhancing material softening. This softening promotes chip segmentation and increases waviness of the machined surface profile. The numerical {{results show that the}} higher values of cutting speed and uncut chip thickness are associated with higher vibration amplitudes...|$|E

5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some <b>mill</b> <b>spindles,</b> the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some <b>mill</b> <b>spindles</b> have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|R

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{are experiencing}} an increased use in many rotating machinery applications (e. g., compressors, <b>milling</b> <b>spindles,</b> flywheels, etc.) {{as an alternative}} to conventional mechanical bearings. Due to the non-contact nature of the magnetic bearings and rotor, AMBs have the unique ability to suspend loads with no friction, operate at higher speeds, and operate under environmental constraints that prohibit the use of lubrication. Furthermore, since AMBs can be actively controlled, they offer other potential advantages over conventional mechanical bearings, such as eliminating vibration through active damping, adjusting the stiffness of the suspending load, or providing an automatic rotor balancing capability.
