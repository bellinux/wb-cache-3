Men {{and women}} <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, as readers (lectors); or as altar servers.

5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second year in office. The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E

They must also have lived in the state for at least one year, and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months, assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long. No elected or appointed official of the United States government, including the military, <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> in the Senate, excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard. Similarly, no employees of the state government <b>may</b> <b>serve,</b> except for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers.|$|E
5|$|Article 4, Section 3, of {{the state}} {{constitution}} places several limitation on the size and composition of the General Assembly. The Senate can contain no more than fifty members, and the senators serve for term of four years. The House of Representatives can contain {{no more than one}} hundred members, and the representatives serve terms of two years. There is no limit to how many terms a state senator or representative <b>may</b> <b>serve.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E
5|$|Clicks {{are quick}} {{broadband}} burst pulses, used for sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ~35–50 milliseconds, {{and in general}} these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target.|$|E
5|$|Fecal {{lead content}} that is {{measured}} {{over the course}} of a few days may also be an accurate way to estimate the overall amount of childhood lead intake. This form of measurement <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> as a useful way to see the extent of oral lead exposure from all the diet and environmental sources of lead.|$|E

5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} {{multiplayer}} feature {{was a revelation}} and worth {{the cost of the}} game alone. Computer Games said it was innovative and <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} toxin. An example of this is an antitoxin on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid toxin counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> as an example here.|$|E

5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|The Lycaenidae have a {{false head}} {{consisting}} of eyespots and small tails (false antennae) to deflect {{attack from the}} more vital head region. These may also cause ambush predators such as spiders to approach from the wrong end, enabling the butterflies to detect attacks promptly. Many butterflies have eyespots on the wings; these too may deflect attacks, or <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> to attract mates.|$|E
5|$|Under the Constitution of Portugal {{adopted in}} 1976, {{in the wake}} of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the President is elected to a five-year term; there is no limit to the number of terms a {{president}} <b>may</b> <b>serve,</b> but a president who serves two consecutive terms may not serve again in the next five years after the second term finishes.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and <b>may</b> <b>serve</b> to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E
