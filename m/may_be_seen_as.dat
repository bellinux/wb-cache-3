5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and {{in the light of}} his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by superb fairywren {{males have}} been recorded. The 'sea horse flight', {{named for its}} seahorse-like undulations, is one such display. During this exaggerated flight, the male—with his neck extended and his head feathers erect—tilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and {{are associated with the}} Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E

Toby Helm wrote in The Observer in September 2016 that <b>May</b> <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> less right wing than Cameron, but she <b>is</b> also <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> quite right wing by Rebecca Glover in The Independent, especially on immigration.|$|R

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception {{as the time}} of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events {{due to their}} perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban {{was linked to the}} SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> automimicry.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change {{according to that}} alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It {{is not necessary to}} consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Scotland, Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in {{partnership}} with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, the Kirk. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. When she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley and King James VI was enthroned in her stead, he openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.|$|E

5|$|The {{rejection}} likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants were tired of the disputes with New York, and they were tired of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took the rejection in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens to see for themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.|$|E
50|$|Buchberger's {{algorithm}} for computing Gröbner bases is a {{very similar}} algorithm. Although developed independently, it <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the instantiation of Knuth-Bendix algorithm {{in the theory of}} polynomial rings.|$|R
50|$|Mathematically H <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{an average}} information, {{taken over the}} message space, because when a certain message occurs with {{probability}} pi, the information quantity −log(pi) will be obtained.|$|R
50|$|Yuav + verb <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{indicative}} of the irrealis mood: situations that are unfulfilled or unrealized. This includes hypothetical or non-occurring situations with past, present, or future time references.|$|R
5|$|The Chalukya era <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the {{beginning}} in the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India, making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions. This is seen clearly {{in the field of}} architecture. The Chalukyas spawned the Vesara style of architecture which includes elements of the northern nagara and southern dravida styles. During this period, the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local Dravidian vernaculars which were already popular. Dravidian languages maintain these influences even today. This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages. The Hindu legal system owes much to the Sanskrit work Mitakshara by Vijnaneshwara in the court of Western Chalukya King VikramadityaVI. Perhaps the greatest work in legal literature, Mitakshara is a commentary on Yajnavalkya and is a treatise on law based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of India. Englishman Henry Thomas Colebrooke later translated into English the section on inheritance, giving it currency in the British Indian court system. It was during the Western Chalukya rule that the Bhakti movement gained momentum in South India, in the form of Ramanujacharya and Basavanna, later spreading into northern India.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many {{significant differences between the}} two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in this area and no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
