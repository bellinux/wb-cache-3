5|$|There {{are three}} special cap power-ups appear {{in certain areas}} on many stages. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the <b>Metal</b> <b>Cap</b> makes him immune to most damage, allows him to {{withstand}} wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons {{can be used to}} reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.|$|E
25|$|Gold-leaf electroscopes are {{designed}} to detect static electricity. Charge placed on the <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> spreads to the stem and the gold leaf of the electroscope. Because they then have the same charge, the stem and leaf repel each other. This will cause the leaf to bend away from the stem.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple design method of a ceramic pressure-tight housing having an {{extended}} length of cylinder and <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> Ceramics have higher compressive strength and lower specific gravity than typical metals. Moreover, {{they are free}} from erosion by seawater. For that reason, we can produce light pressure-tight ceramic housings that have good durability for deep-water applications. The proposed ceramic housings have greater buoyancy than metal housings. We also propose a simpler design method of <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> We confirmed its validity through Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis and hydraulic pressure tests using small-sized ceramic housings with <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> Date of Conference: 10 - 14 June 201...|$|R

25|$|On 1 July 1969, dacron blue made a {{comeback}} to the uniform with a force-wide change away from khaki overnight, {{in part to}} coincide with Singapore's 150th anniversary {{since its founding in}} 1819. The new uniform comprises a dark blue peak cap, shirt, trousers, black belt, shoes and socks, and coded whistle lanyard in blue and white. 3 large and 4 small metal buttons, metal collar badges, and a <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> badge are affixed, and a black plastic name tag completes the uniform. Metallic ranks, if any, are fixed to the sleeve or on the shoulders for senior officers. The lanyard was changed to a metal chain in 1972, and in 1985, the material of the uniform was changed from 75% polyester 25% cotton to 100% polyester for ease of daily maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on the cap is above the cap's threshold frequency. The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.|$|E

25|$|Early {{students}} wore a mortarboard or trencher, {{although this}} had been discontinued by 1871. In 1876, a straw boater with ribbon of broad diagonal stripes {{of black and white}} was introduced. The black and white stripes led to the boys being nicknamed magpies. A <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> badge was being worn by 1883, and it was around this time that the black and gold colours were first associated with the college. Under the headmastership of R.H. Chambers (1881–1892) the chocolate and white colour scheme was introduced, along with differences in uniform between the junior and senior schools. Juniors wore a chocolate-coloured pillbox hat with a white Maltese cross on the front; seniors wore a chocolate-coloured cap with the coat of arms of Jersey in white. The tails on the heraldic leopards in this badge were so long that the boys were nicknamed College congers as a result. In 1893, black and gold replaced chocolate and white, and straw boaters were black and white with a ribbon of black-gold-black. The coat of arms of Jersey on the badge was depicted as black leopards on gold. These designs lasted until 1927, when chocolate and white made a return under headmaster A.H. Worrall in the form of caps with concentric rings of black, white and chocolate. At the same time, the four house colours appeared as backings to the badge on boys' caps according to their respective houses. Until the Second World War boarders had a maroon cap with blue ribbon. Under conditions of military occupation, clothing was scarce. In 1945 a navy blue cap was adopted as a temporary measure, and in 1947 a chocolate cap with radiating piping of black and white was chosen from a range of options; worn with a blazer of royal blue, gold and crimson. In 1952 black and gold made a definitive return: a black cap with radiating piping and a badge, both gold; a black blazer with gold badge on the pocket. Chocolate and white were retained as sports colours.|$|E

2500|$|The gun used metal {{stamping}} and pressing, spot welding and seam welding extensively in its construction, {{reducing the number}} of man-hours required to assemble a unit. Only the barrel, bolt and firing mechanism were precision machined. The receiver consisted of two sheet metal halves welded together to form a cylinder. At the front end was a knurled <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> which was used to retain the removable barrel. The cold-swaged, rifled barrel had 4 right-hand grooves. [...] M3 and M3A1 submachine guns could be fitted with an optional, detachable flash hider, though none saw any service in World War II. [...] A later production flash hider designated Hider, Flash M9 was produced in time to see service during the Korean War. [...] It proved popular in combat, as frequent night engagements emphasized the need to reduce flash signatures on small arms. [...] In Korea, U.S. soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were taught to look above the flash of their weapon during night firing, a tactic that sometimes prevented the detection of crawling enemy infiltrators and sappers.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a {{biological}} micro-electromechanical system and its application to the chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Actuated by an electromagnetic force, the micro cell exciter was designed to deliver a cyclic compressive load (CCL) with various magnitudes. Two major parts in the system are an actuator and a cartridge-type chamber. The former has a permanent magnet and coil, and the latter is equipped with 7 sample dishes and 7 <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> Mixed with a 2. 4 % alginate solution, the alginate/MSC layers were positioned in the sample dishes; the caps contained chondrogenic defined medium without transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b). Once powered, the actuator coil-derived electromagnetic force pulled the <b>metal</b> <b>caps</b> down, compressing the samples. The cyclic load was given at 1 -Hz frequency for 10 min twice a day. Samples in the dishes without a cap served as a control. The samples were analyzed at 3, 5, and 7 days after stimulation for cell viability, biochemical assays, histologic features, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression of the chondrogenic markers. Applied to the alginate/MSC layer, the CCL system enhanced the synthesis of cartilage-specific matrix proteins and the chondrogenic markers, such as aggrecan, type II collagen, and Sox 9. We found that the micromechanically exerted CCL by the cell exciter was very effective in enhancing the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, even without using exogenous TGF-b...|$|R
