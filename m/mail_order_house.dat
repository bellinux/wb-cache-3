Interact Electronics Inc was a privately held company that was funded by Hongiman, Miller, Swartz and Cohn...a lawyer firm out of Detroit. The President/Founder of Interact Electronics Inc was Ken Lochner, {{who was one of}} the original developers of the BASIC language based out of Dartmouth college. Ken had started Interact Electronics Inc after a successful startup known as ADP Cyphernetics, the original computer time share company in Ann Arbor, now known as ADP Network Services. Only a few thousand Interacts were sold before the company went bankrupt. Most were sold by the liquidator Protecto Enterprizes of Barrington, Illinois through <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> sales. The Interact Model One Home Computer debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1978 at a price of $499. The majority of sales were thru <b>Mail</b> <b>Order</b> <b>houses</b> and you could buy it off the shelf at Highland Appliance in the Detroit, MI area and Newman Computer Exchange in Ann Arbor.

50|$|The Garrison Church organ, which {{included}} a carillon, was built by the organ builder Joachim Wagner in 1731-32 and had 25 registers on 3 manuals with pedals. These were later increased to 42 registers by his colleague Carl Ludwig Gesell in 1862. The organ was further modernized by Wilhelm Sauer during extensive interior renovations carried out from 1897-1899. He re-used {{approximately half of the}} original historical organ pipes for the new late-romantic style organ, increased the number of registers to 46 and changed the mechanics to a pneumatic action system.The organ was unusually placed and stood over the Chancel on the second balcony. It had an imposing casing with richly carved ornamentation and sculptural details thought to be designed by the artist Johann Georg Glume (1679-1765). The prospect, or organ pipes, were arranged in three towers, each with six groups of pipes, the longest of which was 5 meters. Some of the pedal registers were housed in the middle tower for lack of space. Remarkable but suitable for a military church, the organ had chimes imitating trombones and kettledrums mounted on angels. A circling sun and a wing-beating eagle completed the decor.

[...] This highly esteemed guitar was marketed only in 1939, and featured the signature of Mr. Whitley on the headstock. 235 of these were made in mahogany, and 235 in rosewood. One of these instruments was the preferred guitar of American composer John Fahey, who recorded extensively on the instrument from 1969-1978. It was severely damaged in a domestic quarrel between Fahey and his girlfriend at the time. The remains of the guitar were collected by guitarist Peter Lang, who was an employee of Fahey's Takoma Records, and preserved for 23 years before being repaired by luthier Federico Sheppard, who later held the trademark for Recording King guitars.The Ray Whitley Recording King guitar was a favorite of B-17 pilots during the second World War, which may explain their rarity today.

Several of these book series garnered substantial critical acclaim unusual for a mass-market <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>house.</b> For example, the series Library of Photography of the early-1970s featured very high-quality duotone printing for its black-and-white reproductions in its original edition, and was of course able to draw on Life Magazine's vast archive of journalistic and art photographs from virtually every major photographer; Foods Of The World featured contributions by M.F.K. Fisher, James Beard, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne and many others; and The Good Cook series, edited by Richard Olney, featured contributions from Jeremiah Tower, Jane Grigson, Michel Lemonnier and many others. Other series of high regard covered nature and the sciences, {{as well as the}} history of world civilizations. The science books are interesting as ephemera of their time. The content of these series was more or less encyclopedic, providing the basics of the subjects in the way it might be done in a lecture aimed at the general public. There was also a series on contemporary life in various countries of the world. Some other series are much less highly regarded, especially the later output as the publisher moved away from soberly presented science and history towards sensationalism, pop-history, and DIY-themed books. The books, whatever their quality, are easy to find at low prices on the used-book market, due to their being published in the millions of copies.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} attitudes and actions of the small businessman in Saskatchewan, as represented by independent merchants and operators of retail service businesses. While many generalizations have been made about the petite bourgeoisie {{in the history of}} the Canadian prairies, little detailed research has been done. This thesis is an attempt at understanding the petit-bourgeois mentality of small businessmen in Saskatchewan and how that motivated their actions in the years between the first and second world wars. The principal sources for research on this topic were those trade journals still extant, the records of the Retail Merchants' Association in Saskatchewan, and records of boards of trade in the province. The 1920 s were a time of transition within the retail distribution industry. New technology, the introduction of corporate merchandising, and fluctuations in general economic conditions created considerable uncertainty for independent merchants. The severe conditions during the Depression in the 1930 s only exacerbated an already difficult situation. The effect of these developments was to weaken the traditional attitude of self-sufficiency among small businessmen. Initially they attempted internal reforms within their respective trades to resolve the problems they encountered. The encroachments of <b>mail</b> <b>order</b> <b>houses</b> and chain stores into the Saskatchewan market tended to undermine those efforts, so that by the early 1930 s independent merchants were preoccupied with exposing the "abuses" of big business. In the mid- and late-thirties they turned to demands for greater government control over business and the economy as a whole in order to ensure their independent livelihood. As economic conditions further deteriorated many small businessmen also took a more active part in the political and economic protests prevalent in western Canada at the time. The response of small businessmen in Saskatchewan to the challenges they faced in the inter-war period was in many ways typical of the petite bourgeoisie. Threatened by increased competition from corporate retailers, they were forced to abandom their traditional conservatism and to call for government intervention and regional economic reforms as part of their struggle against the big business interests...|$|R
