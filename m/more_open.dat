5|$|The American robin's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} woodland and <b>more</b> <b>open</b> farmland and urban areas. It becomes less common as a breeder in the southernmost {{part of the}} Deep South of the United States, and there prefers large shade trees on lawns. Its winter habitat is similar but includes <b>more</b> <b>open</b> areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{song thrush}} {{typically}} nests in forest with good undergrowth and nearby <b>more</b> <b>open</b> areas, and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks. It breeds {{up to the}} tree-line, reaching 2,200metres (7,250ft) in Switzerland. The island subspecies T. p. hebridensis breeds in <b>more</b> <b>open</b> country, including heathland, and in {{the east of the}} song thrush's Eurasian range, the nominate subspecies is restricted {{to the edge of the}} dense conifer forests.|$|E
5|$|Banksia baxteri resembles B.speciosa and co-occurs {{with it at}} {{the western}} edge of its range, but has shorter, wider leaves with larger lobes, shorter flower spikes and is a smaller, <b>more</b> <b>open</b> shrub.|$|E
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy and {{nutrients}} {{as a resource for}} rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes a <b>more</b> <b>open</b> sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and <b>more</b> <b>open</b> with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E

5|$|The Americans were <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to negotiating. A rift {{developed}} {{between them and}} the British who, Bauer writes, were worried about large-scale Jewish immigration to Palestine, then under British control. There was also concern about the effect of Jewish immigration to the UK or US.|$|E
5|$|The Cracidae {{are large}} birds, similar in general {{appearance}} to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas {{are found in}} <b>more</b> <b>open</b> scrubby habitats. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae {{probably}} arose as shade plants, {{with subsequent}} evolution to open areas including deciduous {{forest in the}} <b>more</b> <b>open</b> autumnal period. This {{was accompanied by a}} shift from rhizomes to bulbs, to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves.|$|E

5|$|The Raymonds {{modified}} {{the house to}} create a <b>more</b> <b>open</b> plan feel, separated by Japanese fusuma partitions and shōji screens. The rooms were filled with objects of art, including rugs designed by Noémi and crockery by the Mingei designer Minagawa Masu.|$|E
5|$|The chachalacas, guans and {{curassows}} are {{birds in}} the family Cracidae. These are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys.

They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colorful facial ornaments.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversity}} of characteristics complicates any {{description of the}} Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance, as some members emerged from shaded areas and adapted to a <b>more</b> <b>open</b> environment (see Evolution).|$|E

5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is considered}} sedentary {{and does not}} migrate, though its movements are not well known. Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria they are thought to move into <b>more</b> <b>open</b> areas outside the breeding season. Some populations may be locally nomadic, following availability of water.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of new media, pro-PAP views in {{mainstream}} media are countered by websites expressing the views of Internet users which have been omitted from newspapers and television, thus providing additional platforms for expression which are vital in inculcating a <b>more</b> <b>open</b> and democratic society.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Non-Aligned Movement, Yugoslavia was far <b>more</b> <b>opened</b> to the Western culture {{comparing}} to other socialist countries, and the western-influenced popular music was socially accepted and well covered in the media, which included numerous music magazines, radio and TV shows.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style to be much <b>more</b> <b>open</b> and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique {{with a lot of}} character.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessors, {{the game is}} played in the first person as series protagonist Gordon Freeman against transhuman troops, known as the Combine, and other hostile alien creatures. Levels are linear but add a <b>more</b> <b>open</b> environment, {{consisting}} of puzzles and first-person shooter game-play. Sequences involving vehicles are interspersed throughout the game, breaking up moments of combat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, <b>more</b> <b>open</b> docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.|$|E
