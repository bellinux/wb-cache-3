40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{industrial}} applications of structural adhesives is the quality assurance of <b>manufactured</b> <b>joints.</b> At present, {{for lack of a}} suitable nondestructive technique, production standards for adhesively-bonded aluminum joints are established on the basis of destructive tests and statistical inference. An experimental study was carried out to assess if lock-in thermography (LT) {{could be used as a}} tool for nondestructive evaluation of adhesively-bonded aluminum joints. Several samples were fabricated by varying the governing parameters such as nature of aluminum alloy, substrate thickness, surface treatment, adhesive type and bondline thickness. The effects of surface treatments on the loading capability of lap joints were evaluated through both destructive tensile tests and nondestructive evaluation with infrared LT. Tensile tests showed that the joint performance was not affected by the nature of the aluminum alloy but by the substrate thickness, the adhesive type and the bondline thickness. LT was capable of detecting imperfections such as scratches on substrates and foreign inclusions in the adhesive layer...|$|R
30|$|Assessing {{adhesion}} or {{strength of}} composites or adhesive joints in a non-destructive way is highly challenging. Therefore, instead of performing retrospective quality assurance, i.e. investigating <b>manufactured</b> <b>joints,</b> it is advantageous to safeguard performance {{and quality of}} each layer and each interface already during manufacture. This approach still is challenging, as it requires a systematic quantitative evaluation of threshold criteria, but appreciably it gets more and more feasible. We present approaches for an inline-capable and non-destructive quality assurance of steps in manufacturing processes used for tailoring the state of substrate surfaces. Benefits from applying techniques for inline surface analysis like Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) and Aerosol Wetting Test (AWT) will be detailed. The performed procedures contribute to a novel class of non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques, classified as Extended NDT (ENDT). The principle of ENDT methods {{is based on the}} detection of selected physico-chemical properties which are important for the anticipated performance of the functional interfaces in the products to be manufactured.|$|R

This paper deals with the experimental study of Ti 6 Al 4 V T-joints welded through LFW, with particular focus on the effectiveness of ultrasonic control in detecting and distinguishing welding defects within the joints. Aiming to this scope, joints with different properties were manufactured and tested: some were free from defects but with different metallurgy, and some had different types of defects. The results obtained proved that the ultrasonic control was an effective method to detect and identify defects in linear friction welded titanium joints, moreover it was possible to get information regarding the microstructure and in particular the extension of the different metallurgical zones induced by the welding process. © 2016, Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of adhesives in many structural applications in the transport industry {{and particularly in the}} aeronautic field is due to numerous advantages of bonded joints. However, still many researchers are working to enhance the mechanical properties and rheological performance of adhesives by using nanoadditives. In this study the effect of the addition of Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) with Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS) compounds, either Glycidyl Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes (GPOSS) or DodecaPhenyl Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes (DPHPOSS) to Tetraglycidyl Methylene Dianiline (TGMDA) epoxy formulation, was investigated. The formulations contain neither a tougher matrix such as elastomers nor other additives typically used to provide a closer match in the coefficient of thermal expansion in order to discriminate only the effect of the addition of the above-mentioned components. Bonded aluminium single lap joints were made using both untreated and Chromic Acid Anodisation (CAA) -treated aluminium alloy T 2024 adherends. The effects of the different chemical functionalities of POSS compounds, as well as the synergistic effect between the MWCNT and POSS combination on adhesion strength, were evaluated by viscosity measurement, tensile tests, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), single lap joint shear strength tests, and morphological investigation. The best performance in the Lap Shear Strength (LSS) of the <b>manufactured</b> <b>joints</b> has been found for treated adherends bonded with epoxy adhesive containing MWCNTs and GPOSS.

40|$|It {{is known}} that failure of {{adhesive}} joints can occur either in the bulk region of an adhesive layer (cohesive mode) or along an interface between the adhesive and an adherent (interfacial or adhesion mode). Properly <b>manufactured</b> adhesive <b>joints</b> fail in the cohesive mode, while after environmental degradation the failure mode becomes predominantly interfacial. Therefore we conclude that humid environments affect mostly the interfacial region of a joint. This indicates the importance of non-destructive assessment of interface properties. While methods of cohesive property evaluation have progressed significantly, much more effort is required to develop interface evaluation methods. A development of this type is undertaken in this work...|$|R

40|$|Linear Corrugating is {{a process}} for the {{manufacture}} of corrugated containers in which the flutes of the corrugated medium are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) of the several layers of paper used. Conversely, in the conventional corrugating process the flutes are oriented {{at right angles to}} the MD in the Cross Machine Direction (CD). Paper is stronger in MD than in CD. Therefore, boxes made using the Linear Corrugating process are significantly stronger-in the prime strength criteria, Box Compression Test (BCT) than boxes made conventionally. This means that using Linear Corrugating boxes can be manufactured to BCT equaling conventional boxes but containing 30 % less fiber. The corrugated container industry is {{a large part of the}} U. S. economy, producing over 40 million tons annually. For such a large industry, the potential savings of Linear Corrugating are enormous. The grant for this project covered three phases in the development of the Linear Corrugating process: (1) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes on commercial equipment to verify that boxes so manufactured would have enhanced BCT as proposed in the application; (2) Production and evaluation of corrugated boxes made on laboratory equipment using combined board from (1) above but having dual <b>manufactures</b> <b>joints</b> (glue joints). This box manufacturing method (Dual Joint) is proposed to overcome box perimeter limitations of the Linear Corrugating process; (3) Design, Construction, Operation and Evaluation of an engineering prototype machine to form flutes in corrugating medium in the MD of the paper. This operation is the central requirement of the Linear Corrugating process. Items I and II were successfully completed, showing predicted BCT increases from the Linear Corrugated boxes and significant strength improvement in the Dual Joint boxes.
