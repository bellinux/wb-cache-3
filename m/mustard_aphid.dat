Kaltenbach is a {{perpetual}} annual {{threat in the}} cultivation of rapeseed- mustard (Brassica spp.) crop in tropical and sub-tropical climate. Cultivated Brassica germplasm has failed so far to provide any source of resistance. Wild germplasm is a potential source of resistance against many threatening herbivores. On wild germplasm screening, we noted that the wild crucifer Rorippa indica (L.) Hiern confers resistance against L. erysimi. In the present study L. erysimi challenged transcriptome of R. indica was compared to un-infested R. indica sample to get a molecular insight about the aphid resistance mechanism and identify the candidate defense response genes.

30|$|Brassica juncea (Indian mustard) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops cultivated in India. More than three dozen insect pests are found to be associated with mustard crops in India, of which <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> (Lipaphis erysimi Kalt.) is the most dreaded. These pests are able to reduce the yield up to 96  % (Bakhetia and Sekhon 1989; Singh et al. 1982; Dutta et al. 2005 a) and oil content by 15 – 32  % (Kanrar et al. 2002; Verma and Singh 1987) even after good agricultural practices. Besides causing direct feeding injury these aphids vector many plant viruses (e.g., Turnip mosaic virus and Cauliflower mosaic virus) resulting in further yield loss (Moran and Thompson 2001; Moran et al. 2002) which accounts for approximately 40, 006 million of Indian rupees annually (Kular and Kumar 2011). Moreover, the use of unsustainable chemical pesticides by the farmers has increased which are hazardous to human health as well as to the ecosystem. Earlier studies in developing resistant/tolerant B. juncea lines against this particular aphid include production of hybrid lines of B. juncea with Brassica fruticulosa (Atri et al. 2012) and Brassica campestris (Goomber and Labana 1983), selection of vigorous lines from the wild type (Abraham and Bhatia 1994), as well as introducing potent insecticidal agents like proteases (Rahbe et al. 2003) and lectins (Dutta et al. 2005 a; Kanrar et al. 2002; Mondal et al. 2006) derived from distant plant families. There is no report of resistant/tolerant gene available in the wild germplasm till date. Moreover, in due course of time, a particular insecticidal agent may become ineffective against the pest due to acquired resistance or behavioural reorientation (Chen 2008), entailing the discovery of a new insecticidal agent. Previous study by Bandopadhyay et al. (2013) gave a first molecular insight into crucifer defense response against <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> L. erysimi. On wild germplasm screening, Rorippa indica (L.)

30|$|Host plant {{seems to}} have a direct {{influence}} on prey preference and prey suitability in ladybirds (Ferrer et al. 2008; Giorgi et al. 2009). Apart from nutrition, certain host plants provide an ecological refuge to the aphids by chemically protecting them from their natural enemies (Chaplin-Kramer et al. 2011). Toxic plant allelochemicals deteriorate the aphid quality and make them unsuitable for predators (Pratt 2008). However, continuous rearing of aphidophagous ladybirds on toxic prey for generations enables the offspring to easily thrive on the toxic prey than the nutritious ones (Rana et al. 2002). Mixing toxic aphids with nutritious ones perhaps compliments the nutrient-deficiency of the former and cumulatively enhances the fitness of ladybirds (Nedved and Salvucci 2008; Guroo et al. 2017). <b>Mustard</b> <b>aphid,</b> Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach), infesting Brassica campestris L. is known to decrease the fitness of certain ladybirds (Omkar and Mishra 2005), as it sequesters toxic allelochemicals from the host plant (Ahuja et al. 2010).|$|E

30|$|Rorippa indica, a wild crucifer, {{has been}} {{previously}} reported as the first identified plant in the germplasm of Brassicaceae known to be tolerant towards the <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> Lipaphis erysimi Kaltenbach. We herein report the full-length cloning, expression, purification and characterization of a novel R. indica defensin (RiD) and its efficacy against L. erysimi. Structural analysis through homology modeling of RiD showed longer α-helix and 3 rd β-sheet as compared to Brassica juncea defensin (BjD). Recombinant RiD and BjD was purified for studying its efficacy against L. erysimi. In the artificial diet based insect bioassay, the LC 50 value of RiD against L. erysimi {{was found to be}} 9.099  ±  0.621  µg/mL which is far lower than that of BjD (43.51  ±  0.526  µg/mL). This indicates the possibility of RiD having different interacting partner and having better efficacy against L. erysimi over BjD. In the transient localization studies, RiD signal peptide directed the RiD: yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein to the apoplastic regions which indicates that it might play a very important role in inhibiting nutrient uptake by aphids which follow mainly extracellular route to pierce through the cells. Hence, the present study has a significant implication for the future pest management program of B. juncea through the development of aphid tolerant transgenic plants.|$|E
30|$|To {{determine}} the insecticidal efficacy of RiD against L. erysimi, {{it is essential}} to calculate the LC 50 value of the protein against the target insect. Hence, artificial diet based bioassay was conducted and it was observed that RiD induced mortality in L. erysimi with LC 50 value of 9.099  ±  0.621  µg/mL. Similar bioassay conducted using BjD yielded LC 50 value of 43.51  ±  0.526  µg/mL, indicating that BjD is not at all effective against this aphid. The LC 50 value of RiD was also observed to be lower than that of other insecticidal agents such as Amorphophallus paeonifolius tuber agglutinin (AMTL) with LC 50 value of 13.47  ±  0.23  µg/mL (Mondal et al. 2012), Allium sativum leaf agglutinin (ASAL) with LC 50 value 20.7  ±  0.21  µg/mL (Banerjee et al. 2011), Colocasia esculenta tuber agglutinin (CEA) with LC 50 value of 11.87  ±  0.229  µg/mL (Roy et al. 2014) and proteases with LC 50 value of 22  µg/mL (Harrison and Bonning 2010). This indicates the suitability of RiD as an insecticidal agent over BjD and other previously reported agents against L. erysimi. Further studies in identifying any interacting partners from L. erysimi might provide a better insight into the mechanism of RiD.

The findings revealed that aphid commenced their attack 7 Weeks After Sowing (WAS) and reached {{to a maximum}} level at 14 WAS on October 25 (timely) sown cultivars. Whereas, on November 10 and 25 seeded cultivars, aphid incidence was initially recorded on 6 WAS and 4 WAS, which reached to a maximum at 13 and 11 WAS, respectively. The timely sown (October 25) cultivars escaped the aphid infestation and exhibited better growth due to stored moisture by plant and also minimum aphid load than late seeded (November, 10 and 25) cultivars. While calculating Mean Aphid Infestation Index (MAII), it remained below 1. 00 on Kranti, Maya, MYSL- 203, PCR- 7 and Pusa Agrani (Indian mustard); Pusa Swarnim (Kiran rai) and NDYS- 2, YST- 151 (yellow sarson) when cultivars seeded on October 25 and November 10. Therefore, these cultivars could safely be placed under highly resistant category. Among late sown rapeseed-mustard (November 25), no cultivars found as highly resistant, though, cultivars showing high tolerance during timely sowing become moderately resistant on account of their late (November 25) sowing. Interestingly, gobhi sarson and kiran rai showed relatively less damage due to their late flowering and different plant texture than other cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} of agroecosystems {{due to the}} presence of trace elements in commonly used agricultural materials is a serious issue. The most contaminated material is usually sewage sludge, and the sustainable use of this material within agriculture is a major concern. This study addresses a key issue in this respect, the fate of trace metals applied to soil in food chains. The work particularly addresses the transfer of Pb, which is an understudied element in this respect, and compares the transfer of Pb with two of the most labile metals, Cd and Zn. The transfer of these elements was determined from sludge-amended soils in a food chain consisting of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), the <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> (Lipaphis erysimi) and a predatory beetle (Coccinella septempunctata). The soil was amended with sludge at rates of 0, 5, 10 and 20 % (w/w). Results showed that Cd was readily transferred through the food chain until the predator trophic level. Zn was the most readily transferred element in the lower trophic levels, but transfer to aphids was effectively restricted by the plant regulating shoot concentration. Pb had the lowest level of transfer from soil to shoot and exhibited particular retention in the roots. Nevertheless, Pb concentrations were significantly increased by sludge amendment in aphids, and Pb was increasingly transferred to ladybirds as levels increased. The potential for Pb to cause secondary toxicity to organisms in higher trophic levels may have therefore been underestimated...|$|E

Body size was significantly positively correlated with duration of oviposition, fecundity and egg viability. When light individuals mated with heavy partners, copulation lasted longer between heavy males and light females (483. 00 ± 54. 73 min) than between light males and heavy females (378. 20 ± 83. 03 min). These results support the hypothesis that males determine the duration of copulation and that the reproductive success of large males is greater than that of small males. The longevity of heavy males was significantly shorter (37. 40 ± 1. 50 days) than that of light males (53. 10 ± 2. 84 days). This difference in the longevity of beetles of different sizes could contribute to the significant variation body size in H. variegata recorded both in the field and stock cultures, where light males outnumber heavy ones. Thus, although large males have a reproductive advantage over small males, other factors, such as reduced longevity, may constrain the evolution of even larger males...|$|E

The results demonstrated that 1 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylic acid (compound 2) and methyl 1 -phenyl-β-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (compound 13) represented the best potential compounds, with Sf 9 cells inhibition rates of 71. 55 % and 60. 21 % after 24 h treatment at concentrations of 50 – 200 mg/L, respectively. Both compounds 2 and 13 also showed strong insecticidal activity towards 4 th instar larvae of mosquitos with LC 50 values of 20. 82 mg/L and 23. 98 mg/L, and their LC 90 values were 88. 29 mg/L and 295. 13 mg/L, respectively. Furthermore, the LC 50 values of compounds 2 and 13 against mustard aphids were 53. 16 mg/L and 68. 05 mg/L, and their LC 90 values were 240. 10 mg/L and 418. 63 mg/L after 48 h treatment. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds was consistent with the insecticidal activity in vivo. The results indicated that the 1 - and 3 -positions of the β-carboline ring deserve further investigation to develop biorational insecticides based on the natural compound harmine as a lead compound...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the relative role of weather variables and accumulated heat units on <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt) population, field experiment {{was conducted at}} research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) during the rabi season (October-April) of 2006 - 07. The study revealed that throughout the ascending phase of the aphid population right up to its observed peak, the maximum temperature showed downward trend till peak aphid population reached. During the descending phase of the aphid population, weather parameters were {{not found to be}} congenial. The maximum temperature started increasing after 27 th January and later remained around 250 C. Initially when aphid population started building up, HTR ranged from 2 to 3. The population started increasing gradually from 2 nd week of December, reached peak population around last week of January in both of the varieties in 15 th October sowing. In 30 th October sowing aphid population started building up from 1 st week of January and reached peak population around 1 st week of February. It was observed that HTR as well as the aphid population increased, but as aphid population reached its peak the HTR values reduced. In both early (15 th October) and late sown (30 th October) crop the aphid population had a significant negative correlation with growing degree days (GDD), but positively correlated with humid thermal ratio (HTR). As the growth and development of insects mainly depends upon the accumulated amount of heat, GDD and HTR computation could be used for prediction of aphid population build up.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was conducted to}} study the biology of 11 -spotted beetle Coccinella undecimpunctata L. on <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> during the year 2006. The oviposition, fecundity, adult emergence, fertility percentage, sex ratio, longevity and mortality were studied in the laboratory on 10 separately reared pairs of beetles. The results indicated that average pre-copulation period was 4. 1 ± 1. 28 days post copulation period 3. 6 ± 1. 26 days, oviposition period, 37. 7 ± 6. 88 days and post oviposition period 4. 0 ± 1. 63 days. The mean fecundity was 593. 4 ± 86. 5 eggs, fertile eggs were 531. 80 ± 76. 16 with the fertility percentage of 89. 63 ± 3. 44. the incubation was 3. 1 ± 1. 19 and 3. 1 ± 0. 94 days while 1 st and 2 nd instar larva period was 3. 1 ± 1. 19 and 3. 1 ± 0. 87 days and for 3 rd and 4 th instar larvae averaged 3. 5 ± 1. 26 and 3. 3 ± 0. 94 days, respectively whereas the total larval period was 12. 9 ± 1. 28 days and pupal period 5. 6 ± 0. 96 days. The average number of pupae observed were 19. 9 ± 6. 69, while the male emergence was 7. 4 ± 2. 63 (38. 50 ± 13. 12 %) and the female emergence was 8. 9 ± 3. 66 (43. 48 ± 8. 24 %). The sex ratio (male: female) averaged 1 : 1. 25 ± 1 : 0. 45. thus the total male + female emergence was 81. 99 ± 13. 37 per beetle pair. The mortality recorded was 3. 7 ± 3. 43 beetles showing an averaged mortality of 17. 57 ± 14. 51 %. Longevity of the male was 36. 5 ± 4. 17 days and the female longevity of 46. 0 ± 9. 14 days. It was recorded that longevity period was significantly greater in case of female ladybird beetles as compared to their males. Adult emergence was greater in females of 11 -spotted beetles as compared to males and thus the sex ratio was higher in females as compared to males. The longevity was comparably higher in case of females than in male beetles...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} were conducted {{for three years}} on â€œINSECT PESTS OF CANOLA (BRASSICA SPP.) AND THEIR MANAGEMENTâ€�. The role of resistant varieties, impact of predators for the control of aphids, role of insecticides and plant washing with tap water were integrated with the objective to find {{the impact of these}} factors on aphid population in Brassica crop. Eight varieties of Brassica juncea (Raya), three Brassica campestris (Sarson) and nine of Brassica napus (Canola) were included in the study (Appendix 1. pag 52). The role of weather factors was also measured by processing the data into simple correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. The results are summarized as under: B. napus (var. Bubul- 98) was found susceptible variety as compare to B. campestris (var. Peeli Sarson). The varieties ranked in descending order during preliminary screening trial was Bubul- 98 > RBN- 3057 > RBN- 3255 > RBN- 03041 > Rain Bow > RBN- 03075 > Zafar- 2000 > Gobhi Sarson (DGL) > RBN- 03033 > Km- 158 > Poorbi Raya> RL- 18 > Khanpur Raya > KJ- 147 > RBJ- 02 - 19 > RBJ- 3031 > RBJ- 2050 > KJ- 151 > RBJ- 3041 > RBJ- 02 - 7 > Bhuri Sarson > Toria > and Peeli Sarson.. Second week of February provided a suitable environment for the propogation of aphid population (136. 47 per 10 cm inflorescence) followed by third week of February (134. 33 per 10 cm inflorescence). The results recorded during 2000 - 2001 crop season revealed significant difference among dates of observation between aphid species, among Brassica varieties and in their interaction. Lipaphis erysimi (Kalt) (<b>mustard</b> <b>aphid)</b> (Homoptera: Aphididae) was found dominant over Brevicoryne brassicae (Linn.) (Cabbage aphid) (Homoptera: Aphididae). Bubul 98 found to be a susceptible variety. Peeli Sarson and Toria (B. juncea) showed maximum population of Coccinella septempunctata (Linn.)

40|$|Canola (Brassica napus L.) is {{the second}} most {{important}} source of vegetable oil after soybean. Its oil is widely used in cooking and for making salads and margarines, while the meal is commonly used in animal feeds all around the world. Pakistan, being an agricultural country, is still essentially deficient in edible oil production. It is estimated that more than three fourths of the country’s vegeTable oil requirements are met through imports. Canola is one potential crop which can fulfill the country’s requirement for edible oil. Insect pests are a major yield limiting factor of this crop. Among the insect pests, aphids are considered the major pest. Three aphid species are known to infest the canola crop, the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.), the turnip aphid, Lipaphis erysimi Kalt, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (all are Hemiptera: Aphididae). Heavy aphids attack on canola seedlings can cause wilting of the cotyledons and yellowing of the leaves. Heavy infestations of aphids on pods and flowers lead to yield reductions. Normally aphids cause about 30 - 35 % yield losses on brassica plants but under uncontrolled situations the yield losses may exceed 70 %. Control of the pest relies exclusively on pesticides. The indiscriminate use of pesticides has resulted in the development of resistance and resurgence by pests together with associated environmental and health hazards. This situation urgently demands alternate bio-intensive control measures as the main components of an IPM program. The present study was conducted on sustainable management of aphids on canola grown under organic and conventional farming systems in Punjab, Pakistan. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop the most economical and effective management models by determining population distribution of aphids and their natural enemies, screening relatively tolerant crop genotypes, to identify sources of resistance, studying the biology of aphids and determining the efficacy of mechanical, biological and chemical practices for pest suppression. The results of these findings revealed that the cabbage aphids and <b>mustard</b> <b>aphid</b> were found in all four locations studied (Faisalabad, Bahawalpur, Khanpur and D. G. Khan) while the green peach aphid was recorded at two locations (Faisalabad and Khanpur). The genotypes ‘Cyclone’,‘Shiralee’ and Oscar were found to be susceptible with maximum population of aphids. The genotypes ‘Hyola- 401 ’ and ‘Rainbow’ were observed to be relatively resistant with lower populations of aphids. The results regarding the biochemical basis of resistance revealed that the availability of nitrogen increases susceptibility, and crop genotypes and farming systems with more nitrogen inputs suffered higher aphid populations. The different evaluated farming systems significantly affected the total life span of aphids, and maximum numbers of nymphs were produced on canola grown under fertilizer applications. All tested insecticides (Carbosulfan, Acetamaprid, Imidacloprid, Nitenpyram and Profenofos) were found to be effective against aphids and reduced population densities. Results revealed that treatments consisting of chrysoperla + coccinellid + blank water spray were highly effective against aphids on canola under both systems of farming. Predators performed well one week after release and their efficacy increased over time. A higher and noticeable yield was obtained under inorganic farming system where Chrysoperla carnea, coccinellids and blank water spray were integrated or blank water spray was applied. However, a higher CBR (10. 36 : 1) was attained under organic (farm yard manure application) where blank water spray was applied on the canola crop. Integration of C. carnea, coccinellids and blank water spray under organic farming system also produced a rationally higher CBR (4. 02 : 1). In conclusion, organic farming system (FYM application) with blank water spray or integration of C. carnea, coccinellids and blank water spray is better option and recommendation for aphid management in canola...|$|E
