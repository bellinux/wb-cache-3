25|$|The Asian golden cat {{is similar}} to the bay cat of Borneo in both {{appearance}} and behavior. Genetic studies revealed that the two species are closely related. The Asian golden cat is found in Sumatra and Malaysia, which separated from Borneo only about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. These observations led to the belief that the Borneo bay cat is an insular subspecies of the Asian golden cat. Genetic analysis has shown that the Asian golden cat, along with the bay cat and the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago, and that the Asian golden cat and bay cat diverged as long as four million years ago, suggesting that the bay cat was a different species long before the isolation of Borneo. Because of the evident close relationship with the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> it has recently been suggested that all three species should be grouped in the genus Pardofelis.|$|E
2500|$|The fauna of Sikkim {{include the}} snow leopard, musk deer, [...] Himalayan tahr, red panda, Himalayan marmot, Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, muntjac, common langur, Asian black bear, clouded leopard, <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> leopard cat, dhole, Tibetan wolf, hog badger, binturong, and Himalayan jungle cat. Among the animals more {{commonly}} found in the alpine zone are yaks, mainly reared for their milk, meat, and as a beast of burden.|$|E
2500|$|Snow leopards are {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} other big cats but, like them, exhibit a range of sizes, generally weighing between , with an occasional large male reaching [...] and small female of under [...] They have a relatively short body, measuring in length from the head {{to the base of}} the tail [...] However, the tail is quite long, at , with only the domestic-cat-sized <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> being relatively longer-tailed.

50|$|A few <b>marbled</b> <b>cats</b> {{have been}} bred in captivity, with {{gestation}} {{estimated to be}} 66 to 82 days. In the few recorded instances, two kittens were born in each litter, and weighed from 61 to 85 g. Their eyes open at around 12 days, and the kittens begin to take solid food at two months, around {{the time that they}} begin actively climbing. Marbled cats reach sexual maturity at 21 or 22 months of age, and have lived for up to 12 years in captivity.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} few {{targeted}} studies of small felids in Sumatra {{and there is little}} information on their ecology. As a result there are no specific management plans for the species on Sumatra. We examined data from a long-term camera trapping effort, and used Maximum Entropy Modeling to assess the habitat use and distribution of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi), Asiatic golden cats (Pardofelis temminckii), leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), and <b>marbled</b> <b>cats</b> (Pardofelis marmorata) in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Over a period of 34, 166 trap nights there were low photo rates (photo events/ 100 trap nights) for all species; 0. 30 for golden cats, 0. 15 for clouded leopards, 0. 10 for <b>marbled</b> <b>cats,</b> and 0. 08 for leopard cats. There is overlap in the predicted distributions of clouded leopards, golden <b>cats,</b> and <b>marbled</b> cats; indicating areas of high conservation importance for these species within the park. The predicted distribution of leopard cats was discrete from the other species which is important to consider in the development of conservation strategies. This study provides important documentation of small felid distribution in Sumatra, information for the development of management strategies within the park, and a basis upon which to develop future research for the species...|$|R
50|$|In May 2000, {{a female}} <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> was trapped along an animal trail in a hill {{evergreen}} bamboo mixed forest in Thailand's Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary. This first-ever radio-tracked <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> had an overall home range of 5.8 km2 at {{an elevation of}} 1000 to 1200 m and was active primarily during nocturnal and crepuscular time periods.|$|E
50|$|Forest {{canopies}} probably {{provide the}} <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> {{with much of}} its prey: birds, squirrels and other rodents, and reptiles. In the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, a <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> was observed in a dense forest patch in an area also used by siamang. In Thailand, one individual has been observed in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary preying on a Phayre's leaf monkey.|$|E

50|$|The park {{is managed}} under several {{conservation}} management units {{such as the}} Core Zone, the Buffer Zone, and the Economic Zone. The park {{is known for its}} rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the tigers, elephants, Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden and capped langurs and pygmy hog, one-horned rhinoceros, Asiatic buffalo, swamp deer, barking deers, leopards, clouded leopards, <b>marbled</b> <b>cats,</b> sloth bears, hoolock gibbons, wild boar, gharials, crocodiles, and river dolphins. Reptiles consist of pythons, common Indian crocodile, common wolf snake, cat snake and many other species. Birds listed include hornbills, common crane, common redshank, Eurasian woodcock, spotted eagles, black-throated diver, little grebe, different types of herons, black ibis, Eurasian sparrowhawk, spot-bellied eagle-owl and several others. The park is home for 22 endangered mammal species. Fish species identified are: katli, jurraha, chenga, telliah, labeo and mahaseer. Conservation measures have been undertaken to prevent poaching, overfishing, encroachments, and many other related issues. These measures are meant to minimise human interference in the fragile core zone, creation of a data base and carry out research on animal and plant populations for better conservation of the ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|The word pardofelis is {{composed}} of the Latin words pardus pard, and felis cat in allusion to the spots of the type species, the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pardofelis {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the Russian explorer and naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as generic name comprising a single felid species occurring in tropical Asia, the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> Pardofelis marmorata.The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of Pardofelis in 1917 as comprising not only the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> but also the Borneo bay cat Pardofelis badia, because of similarities {{in the shape of}} their skulls. In 1939, he described Pardofelis marmorata on the basis of skins and skulls which originated in Java, Sumatra, Darjeeling and Sikkim.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> (Pardofelis marmorata) {{is a small}} {{wild cat}} of South and Southeast Asia, where it is {{suspected}} to occur over a large range. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|The park {{provides}} {{habitat for}} 53 mammal species, including the endangered Sumatran tiger, Sumatran elephant, Malayan tapir, agile gibbon and siamang, {{as well as}} the vulnerable Sunda clouded leopard, <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> flat-headed cat, sun bear and southern pig-tailed macaque.|$|E
5000|$|Pardofelis is a genus {{of the cat}} family Felidae. This genus {{is defined}} as {{including}} one species native to Southeast Asia: the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat.</b> [...] Two other species, formerly classified to this genus, now belong to the genus Catopuma.|$|E
50|$|Indiscriminate snaring is {{prevalent}} {{throughout much}} of its range, and likely poses a major threat. It is valued for its skin, meat, and bones, but infrequently observed in the illegal Asian wildlife trade.During a survey in the Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh, a <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> was encountered that {{had been killed by}} a local hunter for a festival celebrated by the indigenous Apatani community in March and April every year. The dead cat was used in a ceremony, and its blood was sacrificed to the deity for goodwill of their family and for ensuring a good harvest, protection from wildlife, disease and pest. Deforestation is a further threat to the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{area has}} {{a high level of}} biodiversity, and a number of {{endangered}} species including tiger, leopard, clouded leopard, Asian golden cat, <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> civet, gaur, Sambar deer, white-cheeked gibbon, sun bear, black bear, Asian elephant, dhole, hornbill and three species of otter.|$|E
50|$|The {{two species}} diverged {{from one another}} 4.9-5.3 million years ago, long before Borneo {{separated}} from the neighboring islands. Their closest living relative is the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> from which the common ancestor of the Catopuma genus diverged around 9.4 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|The bay cat's {{classification}} as Catopuma {{was widely}} recognized until 2006. Because of the evident close {{relationship of the}} bay cat and the Asian golden cat with the <b>marbled</b> <b>cat,</b> all three species were suggested in 2006 to be grouped in the genus Pardofelis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>cat</b> {{was once}} {{considered}} {{to belong to}} the pantherine lineage of cats. Genetic analysis has shown it to be closely related to the Asian golden cat and the bay cat, all of which diverged from other felids about 9.4 million years ago.|$|E
