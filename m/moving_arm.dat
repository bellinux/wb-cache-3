40|$|It is not {{yet clear}} how the {{temporal}} structure of a voluntary action is coded allowing coordinated bimanual responses. This study focuses on the adaptation to and compensation for a force profile presented to one stationary arm which is proportional to the velocity of the other <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> We hypothesised that subjects would exhibit predictive coordinative responses which would co-vary with the state of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> Our null hypothesis is that they develop a time-dependent template of forces appropriate to compensate for the imposed perturbation. Subjects were trained to make 500 ¬†ms duration reaching movements with their dominant right arm to a visual target. A force generated with a robotic arm that was proportional to the velocity of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> and perpendicular to movement direction acted on their stationary left hand, either {{at the same time as}} the movement or delayed by 250 or 500 ¬†ms. Subjects rapidly learnt to minimise the final end-point error. In the delay conditions, the left hand moved in advance of the onset of the perturbing force. In test conditions with faster or slower movement of the right hand, the predictive actions of the left hand co-varied with movement speed. Compensation for movement-related forces appeared to be predictive but not based on an accurate force profile that was equal and opposite to the imposed perturbation...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the compliance of peripheral artery changes with arm movement. This study aimed to quantify the bilateral difference in radial artery pulse morphology with one-side arm movement. Twenty-four healthy subjects were recruited. Radial artery pulses were synchronously recorded from both arms, with one arm (left or right) at five different positions (90 ¬∞, 45 ¬∞, 0 ¬∞, ‚àí 45 ¬∞ and ‚àí 90 ¬∞) and the other arm at horizontal level (0 ¬∞) as reference. Two types of indices of arterial pulse morphology were derived from the normalized arterial pulse signals: the waveform width corresponding to the 50 %, 60 % and 70 % pulse amplitude (W 50, W 60, W 70) and the total area of normalized pulse waveform (Apulse). No matter whether the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> was left or right arm, when compared with the other side reference arm, all the waveform widths decreased with arm moving from 90 ¬∞, 45 ¬∞, 0 ¬∞, ‚àí 45 ¬∞, and ‚àí 90 ¬∞. The bilateral difference of W 50, W 60 and W 70 with the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> (either left or right) at 90 ¬∞, 45 ¬∞ were significantly positive (both p < 0. 01) and significantly negative at ‚àí 90 ¬∞ (both p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, no matter whether the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> is left or right, Apulse decreased with arm moving from 90 ¬∞, 45 ¬∞, 0 ¬∞, ‚àí 45 ¬∞, and ‚àí 90 ¬∞. The bilateral difference of Apulse with the left <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> were significantly positive at 45 ¬∞, 90 ¬∞ (both p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, the bilateral difference of Apulse from the moving right arm was significantly positive at 90 ¬∞ and significantly negative at ‚àí 45 ¬∞ and ‚àí 90 ¬∞ (all p < 0. 05). In summary, this study quantified the bilateral arterial pulse morphology between arteries with different compliances induced by a simple arm positioning procedure...|$|E

40|$|A well-coordinated {{pattern of}} eye and hand {{movements}} {{can be observed}} during goal-directed arm movements. Typically, a saccadic eye movement precedes the arm movement, and its occurrence is temporally correlated with {{the start of the}} arm movement. Furthermore, the coupling of gaze and aiming movements is also observable after pointing initiation. It has recently been observed that saccades cannot be directed to new target stimuli, away from a pointing target stimulus. Saccades directed to targets presented during the final phase of a pointing movement were delayed until after pointing movement offset ("gaze anchoring"). The present study investigated whether ocular gaze is anchored to a pointing target during the entire pointing movement. In experiment 1, new targets were presented at various times during the duration of a pointing movement, triggered by the kinematics arm moment itself (movement onset, peak acceleration/velocity/deceleration, and offset). Subjects had to make a saccade to the new target as fast as possible while maintaining the pointing movement to the initial target. Saccadic latencies were increased by an amount of time that approximately equaled the remaining pointing time after saccadic target presentation, with the majority of saccades executed after pointing movement offset. The nature of the signal driving gaze stabilization during pointing was investigated in experiment 2. In previous experiments where ocular gaze was anchored to a pointing target, subjects could always see their <b>moving</b> <b>arm,</b> thus it was unknown whether a visual image of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm,</b> an afferent (proprioceptive) signal or an efferent (motor control related) signal produced gaze anchoring. In experiment 2 subjects had to point with or without vision of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> to test whether a visual signal is used to anchor gaze to a pointing target. Results indicate that gaze anchoring was also observed without vision of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> The findings support the existence of a mechanism enforcing ocular gaze anchoring during the entire duration of a pointing movement. Moreover, such a mechanism uses an internally generated, or proprioceptive, nonvisual signal. Possible neural substrates underlying these processes are discussed, as well as the role of selective attention...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the difficulty {{that patients with}} Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) have in performing fast movements, we used H 215 O PET to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) associated with performance of a simple predictive visuomanual tracking task at three different velocities. Tracking movements in PD patients (versus tracking with the eyes alone) were associated with a general underactivation of the areas normally activated by the task (sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the <b>moving</b> <b>arm,</b> bilateral dorsal premotor cortices, and ipsilateral cerebellum). Presupplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA) ipsilateral to the <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> had greater than normal movement-related activa-tions. Increasing movement velocity led to increased rCBF in multiple premotor and parietal cortical areas and basal ganglia in the patients {{as opposed to the}} few cerebral locations that are normally velocity-related. The functional correlates of PD bradykinesia are: (1) impaired recruitment of cortical and subcortical systems that normally regulate kinematic parameters of movement such as velocity; and (2) increased recruitment of multiple premotor areas including both regions specialized for visuomotor control (ventral premotor and parietal cortices) and some that are not (pre-SMA). The overactivation of cortical regions observed in patients may be functional correlates of compensatory mechanisms and/or impaired suppression as a facet of the primary pathophysiology of PD. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|International audienceThe {{reflection}} of a moving hand in a mirror positioned in the sagittal plane can create an illusion of symmetrical, bimanual movement. This illusion is implicitly presumed to be of visual origin. However, muscle proprioceptive afferents of the arm reflected in the mirror might also affect the perceived position and movement of the other arm. We characterized the relative contributions of visual and proprioceptive cues by performing two experiments. In Experiment 1, we sought to establish whether kinaesthetic illusions induced using the mirror paradigm would survive marked visual impoverishment (obtained by covering between 0 % and 100 % of the mirror in 16 % steps). We found that the mirror illusion was only significantly influenced when the visual degradation was 84 % or more. In Experiment 2, we masked the muscle proprioceptive afferents of the arm reflected in the mirror by co-vibrating antagonistic muscles. We found that masking the proprioceptive afferents reduced the velocity of the illusory displacement of the other arm. These results confirm that the mirror illusion is not a purely visual illusion but emerges {{from a combination of}} congruent signals from the two arms, i. e. visual afferents from the virtually <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> and proprioceptive afferents from the contralateral, <b>moving</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} study {{we found that the}} initial direction of slow, goal-directed arm movements deviates consistently {{from the direction of the}} actual straight line between the starting position and the target position. We now investigate whether these deviations are caused by imperfections or peculiarities in the processing of vision-related spatial information, such as retinal information, and eye-and head-position information. This could lead to incorrect localiza-tion of the target relative to the starting position. Subjects were seated in front of a horizontal surface and had to move their arm slowly and accurately in the direction of target positions. We varied the amount of vision-related spatial information. In experiment 1, subjects were presented with visual targets and could see their <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> In experiment 2, the subjects were again presented with visual targets, but now they could not see their <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> In experiment 3, the subjects were blindfolded and had to move their arm towards tactile targets. In all three experiments we found comparable consistent deviations in the initial movement direction. We also instructed congenitally and early-blind subjects to move their arm towards tactile targets. Their performance showed deviations congruous with those found in the sighted subjects, and possibly somewhat larger. We conclude that the deviations in the initial movement direction of slow, goal-directed arm movements are not primarily visually based. The deviations are generated after all spatial information has been integrated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we aimed to explore the {{predictive}} link between visual stimuli moving towards {{the body and the}} tactile consequences that follow. More specifically, we tested if information derived from an approaching visual stimulus in the region directly surrounding the body (the peripersonal space) could be used to make judgments about the location and time of impending tactile contact. We used <b>moving</b> <b>arm</b> stimuli, displayed on a computer screen, which appeared to travel either towards the face (middle of the left/right cheek) or slightly a 000354596900036 way from the subject's face. This stimulus was followed by tactile stimulation of the left/right cheek. The time lag between the visual stimulus and tactile stimulation was also manipulated to simulate tactile contact at a time that was either consistent or inconsistent with the speed of the approaching hand. Reaction time information indicated that faster responses were produced when the arm moved towards the hemispace in which the tactile stimulation was delivered and was insensitive to whether the arm was moving towards the cheek or slightly away from the cheek. Furthermore, response times were fastest when the tactile stimulation arrived at the moment that was consistent with the speed of the <b>moving</b> <b>arm.</b> The effects disappeared when the arm appeared to be retracting from the subject's face. These results suggest the existence of a predictive mechanism that exploits the visual information derived from objects moving towards the body for making judgments about the time and location of impending tactile contact...|$|E
