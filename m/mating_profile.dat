40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how fast mating behaviour evolves in insects is rather poor {{due to a lack}} of comparative studies among insect groups for which phylogenetic relationships are known. Here, we present a detailed study of the mating behaviour of 27 species of Sepsidae (Diptera) for which a well-resolved and supported phylogeny is available. We demonstrate that mating behaviour is extremely diverse in sepsids with each species having its own <b>mating</b> <b>profile.</b> We define 32 behavioural characters and document them with video clips. Based on sister species comparisons, we provide several examples where mating behaviour evolves faster than all sexually dimorphic morphological traits. Mapping the behaviours onto the molecular tree reveals much homoplasy, comparable to that observed for third positions of mitochondrial protein-encoding genes. A partitioned Bremer support (PBS) analysis reveals conflict between the molecular and behavioural data, but behavioural characters have higher PBS values per parsimony-informative character than DNA sequence characters...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device and {{a process for}} the conveyance of material, in particular wire- or bar-shaped welding filler material, of different diameters or cross-sectional measurements having one or several permanently integrated feed rollers, i. e. without changing rollers. Said device {{is characterized by the}} fact that the profiles of a drive and an associated counterpressure roller are matched to each other in such a way that the frictional connection is not only ensured with large cross-sectional measurements (e. g. large diameters) of the material to be fed, but also for small cross-sectional measurements (e. g. small wire thicknesses) by the intermeshing of the profiles of the two rollers. This is achieved, for example, by a V groove and a trapezoidal <b>mating</b> <b>profile.</b> The main advantages are the guidance function exerted simultaneously with the feed function, the comparably low deformation op the conveyed material and the adjustable feed velocity which is almost indepedent of the cross-sectional measurements (e. g. wire diameters) of the material as a result of the suitable design of the roller diameter and the roller profiles...|$|E

The peculiarity of the hub mechanical response according to which, under {{the effect of a}} uniform pressure applied to the hub bore, the bore axial profile moves radially without any distortion, is exploited to simplify the determination of the <b>mating</b> <b>profiles</b> that return a uniform pressure. In particular, the hub radial deflection may be computed with a simple plane model, whereas only the shaft radial deflection requires a more complex analysis in cylindrical coordinates. Explicit approximate expressions are reported for the shapes to be conferred to the <b>mating</b> <b>profiles</b> to achieve a uniform pressure.

40|$|Grounded in Self Determination Theory (Deci and Ryan 1985 a; 2000), {{the purpose}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the unintentional and pernicious effects of sexual imagery in advertising on life aspirations, situational motivation for consumption, satisfaction with basic needs, state self-esteem and body image (dis) satisfaction while accounting for the mediating effects of the individual differences variables: contingent self-esteem, general causality orientations and sexual liberalism. Results from two laboratory experiments test the hypotheses. Data were collected via a series of quasi-experiments utilizing a 2 x 4 full factorial design; gender served as a 2 -level quasi-experimental variable and nudity as a 3 -level experimental variable (nude, semi-nude, clothed) with a product-only condition as the control condition. The experimental stimuli comprised 16 advertisements utilizing products relevant to sexual imagery (Vodka, Whiskey, Wrist watches, Jeans and Perfumes). Before exposure to the experimental stimuli, participants were asked to complete the individual differences questionnaires, and after exposure to the experimental stimuli, participants were asked to complete the questionnaire comprising the outcome variables and basic demographic information. The results provide counter-intuitive information about the function of sexual imagery across increasing levels of nudity and across genders. The original hypotheses about the directionality of effects hold only partially. Individuals exhibit mixed results regarding the effects in aspirations (study 1 and study 2), the situational motivation for consumption is not found to differ across conditions (study 1 and 2), state self-esteem and body image (dis) satisfaction show indications compensatory mechanisms but only for study 1. In study 2 sexual imagery impacts the satisfaction with basic needs. Females are more pre-occupied with image, meaningful relationships and health (study 1 and study 2) while men are more preoccupied with fame (study 1). Females also exhibit lower state self-esteem (study 1) and lower body satisfaction (study 1). Taken together the results indicate that the negative effects of sexual imagery can be offset by conscious image processing, autonomous self-determination and other defensive strategies. Finally, differences between advertising conditions of nudity may be susceptible to arousal and <b>mating</b> <b>profile</b> effects...|$|E

40|$|Corn starch's {{ability to}} bind and carry a yerba mate extract with strong {{antioxidant}} properties was explored in this paper. The starch was treated by high hydrostatic pressure {{to increase its}} loading capacity and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the high pressure treatment altered the shape of starch granules and changed their surface appearance. High pressure caused partial granule gelatinization as determined by calorimetric measurements, also increasing the granule specific surface area, as quantified by nitrogen adsorption. This increase in surface {{was due to the}} generation of pores, which favored the adsorption of the yerba mate hydrosoluble polyphenols. The yerba mate polyphenol concentration in the starch carriers was determined by HPLC-MS and its antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH radical and photochemiluminiscense (PCL) methods. Treated starches incorporated a higher amount of yerba mate polyphenols, however, native starch could be an appropriate antioxidant carrier as well.

40|$|A {{model of}} the rotor {{interaction}} in twin screw compressors is developed, and implemented via a computer simulation. Geometric parameters of the rotors are used to develop a kinematic analysis of the rotor motion, and to compute the loads associated with the compression process. The main objectives are to provide the ability to predict backlash type rotor vibrations (chatter) and compute the bearing forces. ^ The rotor surfaces are defined by the 2 -dimensional rotor profiles and the helix angle associated with each rotor. This geometry is used to identify the kinematic constraints which apply to the rotor motion based on gear theory. The nature of the contact between the rotors and the resulting force transmission is investigated. The rotor profiles are designed to obey the laws of conjugacy. This fact {{is used in the}} development of an iterative procedure for generating <b>mating</b> rotor <b>profiles.</b> ^ The forces and moments due to gas compression are computed using vector calculus principles to integrate the chamber pressure over the rotor surfaces. The 3 -dimensional surface of each rotor is mapped to a 2 -dimensional region and the pressure integrated over the region. The general method is presented, with the details for a specific compressor configuration given. Of primary interest is the accurate computation of the moment load, due to compression, about the axis of rotation for each rotor. Through these computations, it is demonstrated that the moment load induced on the female is approximately 10...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mating {{decreases}} female receptivity and terminates sex pheromone {{production in}} moths. Although significant {{progress has been}} made in elucidating the mating-regulated inactivation of pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) secretion, little is known about the mating induced gene expression profiles in pheromone glands (PGs). In this study, the associated genes involved in Bombyx mori mating were identified through digital gene expression (DGE) profiling and subsequent RNA interference (RNAi) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the mating-regulated gene expression in PGs. Results: Eight DGE libraries were constructed from the PGs of mated and virgin females: 1 h mating (M 1) /virgin (V 1) PGs, 3 h mating (M 3) /virgin (V 3) PGs, 24 h mating (M 24) /virgin (V 24) PGs and 48 h mating (M 48) /virgin (V 48) PGs (M 48 and V 48).

Application of the JH mimics, methoprene to the newly-emerged virgin females leaded to the significant reduction of sex pheromone production.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to perform a multinational survey of patients' colonization by metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae, including their molecular characterization. Methods: Patients in 18 hospital units across Europe and Israel (n = 17945) were screened between mid- 2008 and mid- 2011. MBL-producing isolates were typed by PFGE and MLST. MBL genes were amplified and sequenced within their integrons. Plasmids with MBL genes were analysed by nuclease S 1 plus hybridization <b>profiling,</b> <b>mating</b> and transformation assays, and by PCR-based replicon typing. Results: Ninety-one patients in nine centres (six countries), including 62 patients in two Greek ICUs, carried 94 non-duplicate MBL-producing organisms. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from Greece dominated (n = 57) and belonged mainly to ST 147, ST 36 and ST 383. All but one of the isolates expressed VIM- 1 -type MBLs. Isolates of Greek origins produced five enzymes, including new VIM- 39, encoded by class 1 integrons of four types. In-e 541 -like elements prevailed, comprising six variants located on IncR, IncFII(K), IncR+FIIK, IncR+A/C or non-typeable plasmids. The other group were new In 4873 and In 4863, being the first In 416 -like elements identified in Greece, which were present on IncA/C or non-typeable plasmids.

40|$|Communication plays a {{key role}} in {{coordinating}} all social interactions in an individual’s life, but is particularly crucial for coordinating reproduction. Although chemical (olfactory) signals are ubiquitous in sexual communication in mammals, a disproportionate reliance on laboratory-based studies using a limited range of species, along with several logistical and methodological limitations, limit our broader understanding of their functions in reproduction and as sexually selected traits. I addressed these shortcomings by using an integrated, multidisciplinary approach, combining organic chemical analyses, physiology, genetics and behaviour, to investigate chemical signals, reproduction and sexual selection in a terrestrial, egg-laying mammal (monotreme), the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus). Although the monotreme and therian lines have been evolutionarily separate for over 150 million years, echidna scent gland secretions from the spur and cloaca showed a typical mammalian pattern in terms of high chemical diversity and complexity. I identified a large number of compounds of varying volatility, molecular weight, functional groups and aromaticity, suggesting a high reliance on olfactory communication. Similarities with other vertebrates can indicate evolutionary convergence on optimal chemicals as signals, although several obscure and even novel compounds were also identified. Consistent with other seasonal breeders, echidna chemical profiles varied between sexes and during the <b>mating</b> season. <b>Profiles</b> also differed between individuals, suggesting they could contain genetic information, although microsatellite markers were inadequate to confirm this hypothesis. Changes in male spur secretions during the mating season coincided with maximum annual plasma testosterone concentrations and could be sexually selected, functioning in mate choice or intra-sexual competition. Males were attracted to female scent, confirming male response to sex-specific scent differences is an important driver of echidna mating behaviour. Consequently, chemical sensory traits that influence the ability to locate mates seem to be favoured by natural and sexual selection. Behavioural responses to chemical signals can be complicated by sexual conflict, although this has rarely been investigated in mammals. Male echidnas locate and mate with hibernating females; however females showed no changes in chemical profiles during hibernation. These results suggest that females do not ‘actively’ signal to males while hibernating, but intense male-male competition for access to females has probably driven earlier male readiness to breed, even before females might otherwise emerge from hibernation and signal to males. In females, chemical cues and reproductive physiology were not closely linked, as females showed continued mating activity during pregnancy and no detectable changes in chemical profiles at the time of fertilization or during pregnancy. Therefore, female reproductive status appears undisclosed to males, and multi-male mating may function to confuse paternity and reduce infanticide risk. These results suggest chemical signals are used differently by males and females to increase their reproductive success, often at the expense of the other sex, resulting in an evolutionary ‘arms race’ between signalers and receivers. Overall, a complex interplay between chemical signals, behaviour, environmental and selective pressures is responsible for the mating behaviour observed in Tasmanian echidnas. My work highlights the benefit of using a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach based on a free-living, ‘non-model’ mammalian species, representing a significant step towatrds understanding the influences of selective pressures, including selection and conflict, on animal communication...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation of high-energy {{electrons}} (EEP) {{into the}} polar middle atmosphere {{is a potential}} source of signif- icant production of odd nitrogen, which {{may play a role}} in stratospheric ozone destruction and in perturbing large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. High-speed streams of so- lar wind (HSS) are a major source of energization and pre- cipitation of electrons from the Earth’s radiation belts, but it remains to be determined whether these electrons make a significant contribution to the odd-nitrogen budget in the middle atmosphere when compared to production by solar protons or by lower-energy (auroral) electrons at higher al- titudes, with subsequent downward transport. Satellite ob- servations of EEP are available, but their accuracy is not well established. Studies of the ionization of the atmosphere in response to EEP, in terms of cosmic-noise absorption (CNA), have indicated an unexplained seasonal variation in HSS-related effects and have suggested possible order-of- magnitude underestimates of the EEP fluxes by the satellite observations in some circumstances. Here we use a model of ionization by EEP coupled with an ion chemistry model to show that published average EEP fluxes, during HSS events, from satellite measurements (Meredith et al., 2011), are fully consistent with the published average CNA response (Ka- vanagh et al., 2012). The seasonal variation of CNA response can be explained by ion chemistry with no need for any sea- sonal variation in EEP. Average EEP fluxes are used to esti- <b>mate</b> production rate <b>profiles</b> of nitric oxide between 60 and 100 km heights over Antarctica for a series of unusually well separated HSS events in austral winter 2010. These are com- pared to observations of changes in nitric oxide during the events, made by the sub-millimetre microwave radiometer on the Odin spacecraft. The observations show strong increases of nitric oxide amounts between 75 and 90 km heights, at all latitudes poleward of 60 ◦ S, about 10 days after the arrival of the HSS. These are of the same order of magnitude but gen- erally larger than would be expected from direct production by HSS-associated EEP, indicating that downward transport likely contributes in addition to direct production...|$|R
40|$|Genotype-by-environment {{interactions}} (G x Es) describe {{genetic variation}} for phenotypic plasticity, {{such that the}} relative performance of genotypes varies across environments. These interactions have been studied {{in the context of}} natural selection for decades, but research interest in the evolutionary consequences of G x Es in sexual traits is more recent. Theory suggests that G x Es in sexual traits could be of fundamental importance to the operation of sexual selection across heterogeneous environments, but empirical research lags behind the theory. In this thesis, I review the current literature on the role of G x Es in sexual selection and identify areas for further research. Using cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in the fruit fly Drosophila simulans as a model system for sexual selection, I examine G x Es in trait expression and quantify the effect of these G x Es in terms of sexual signal reliability and the coevolution of male and female sexual traits. 	To do so, I use a combination of quantitative genetics and laboratory environmental manipulations. First, I demonstrate that male CHC profile is subject to sexual selection through female mate choice and find some variation in patterns of mate choice across diets and temperatures (Chapter 3). Next, I identify G x Es in male and female CHC expression across diets and temperatures, although G x Es in male CHC profile across temperatures are weak (Chapter 4). I find that G x Es in male CHC expression can cause sexual signal unreliability, as predicted by theory, since male CHCs do not reliably signal heritable aspects of male attractiveness across diets and temperatures (Chapter 5). I also find G x Es in some aspects of female mate choice across temperatures (Chapter 6). In spite of the evidence for signal unreliability and variation in female mate choice across environments, I show that the overall outcome of mate choice is unaffected by G x Es, such that the same male genotypes are attractive across diets and temperatures (Chapters 5 and 6). From my results, it seems likely that females assess male attractiveness based on multiple male sexual signals, so that whilst male CHCs influence <b>mate</b> choice, CHC <b>profile</b> does not necessarily correlate well with overall male attractiveness. I discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of sexual traits and the genetic covariance between male and female sexual traits across environments. The research in this thesis highlights the importance of multivariate studies of sexual selection across environments for a more complete understanding of the evolution of sexual traits. ES...|$|R
