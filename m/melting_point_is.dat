5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus {{it may be a}} liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> known so poorly, having been variously been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values very close to the caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E

50|$|The {{elements}} {{become less}} reactive and have higher <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> as the atomic number increases. The higher <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> caused by stronger London dispersion forces resulting from more electrons.|$|R
5|$|Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, {{diamagnetic}} metal, {{though most}} common commercial grades {{of the metal}} have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C) and boiling points (907°C). The <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often {{not considered to be}} transition metals {{like the rest of the}} d-block metals are.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
25|$|The unburnable solid {{remains of}} a {{combustible}} material left after a fire is called clinker if its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and ash if its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> above the flame temperature.|$|E
40|$|<b>Melting</b> <b>point</b> finds {{applications}} in chemical identification, purification {{and in the}} calculation {{of a number of}} other physicochemical properties such as vapor pressure and aqueous solubility. Despite the availability of enormous amounts of experimental data, no generally applicable methods have been developed to estimate the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of a compound from its chemical structure. A quick estimation of <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> can <b>be</b> a useful tool in the design of new chemical entities. In this dissertation, a simple means of estimating the <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> for a large variety of pharmaceutically and environmentally relevant organic compounds <b>is</b> developed. <b>Melting</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> predicted from the separate calculation of the enthalpy and entropy of melting directly from the chemical structure. The entropy of melting is calculated using a semi-empirical equation based on only two non-additive molecular parameters. This equation is validated and refined using a large collection of experimental entropy of melting values. The enthalpy of melting is calculated by additive group contributions. <b>Melting</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> estimated from the ratio of the enthalpy of melting and the entropy of melting. All of the methods and group contributions developed in this study are compatible with the UPPER (Unified Physical Property Estimating Relationships) scheme. The predicted <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> <b>are</b> compared to experimental <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> for over 2200 organic compounds collected from the literature. The average absolute error in <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> prediction <b>is</b> 30. 1 Â°. This is a very reasonable estimate considering the size and diversity of the dataset used in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} interatomic potential and the thermal properties, including the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and the thermal expansion, by using molecular dynamics simulations. Tantalum, which had a high <b>melting</b> <b>point,</b> <b>was</b> used as the test material.

25|$|If the pouring {{temperature}} {{is too high}} or a sand of low <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> used then the sand can fuse to the casting. When this happens {{the surface of the}} casting produced has a brittle, glassy appearance.|$|E
25|$|For fission reactors, {{the fuel}} (typically based on uranium) is usually {{based on the}} metal oxide; the oxides are used rather than the metals {{themselves}} because the oxide <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> much {{higher than that of}} the metal and because it cannot burn, being already in the oxidized state.|$|E

The log (base 10) of the vapor pressure of solid zirconium tetrachloride (from 710 to 741K) is given by the equation log10(P) = −3427/T + 9.088.

25|$|Molten {{aluminium}} oxide near the melting temperature is roughly 2/3 tetrahedral (i.e. 2/3 of the Al {{are surrounded by}} 4 oxygen neighbors), and 1/3 5-coordinated, very little (<5%) octahedral Al-O is present. Around 80% of the oxygen atoms are shared among three or more Al-O polyhedra, {{and the majority of}} inter-polyhedral connections are corner-sharing, with the remaining 10–20% being edge-sharing. The breakdown of octahedra upon melting is accompanied by a relatively large volume increase (~20%), the density of the liquid close to its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> 2.93 g/cm3.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} grind {{telescope}} optics into an accurate shape, a highly versatile material {{must be used}} such as glass. The amateur casting process is usually done through a temperature controlled glass fusing kiln, in which layers or chunks of glass (usually plate or borosilicate glass) are stacked on top of or around each other within a round mold specified to aperture size. After the <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> reached, the glass fuses together and then the annealing process begins. Proper annealing procedures ensure that internal stresses are relieved within the glass, which reduces risk of failure for the newly cast blank.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} {{example of}} a wax tablet book are the servitude records which the hospital of Austria's oldest city, Enns, established in 1500. Ten wooden plates, sized 375 x 207mm and arranged in a 90mm stack, are each divided into two halves along their long axis. The annual payables due are written on parchment or paper glued to the left sides. Payables received were recorded for deduction (and subsequently erased) on the respective right sides, which are covered with brownish-black writing wax. The material is based on beeswax, and contains 5-10% plant oils and carbon pigments; its <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> about 65°C.

40|$|A dataset {{consisting}} of structures and aqueous solubility and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> data for 51 salt {{forms of the}} phenylethylamine base methylephedrine is presented. Analysis showed correlation between solubility and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and between <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of the salt and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> of the parent acid, but no correlation of salt solubility with solubility of the parent acid. Identification of associations was aided by examining chemically sensible subgroups of the dataset, and this approach highlighted significantly different relationships between solubility and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> for these subgroups. Thus, for example, the expected negative correlation between solubility and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> found for 24 anhydrous benzoate salts, but a positive correlation observed for 8 halide salts.

25|$|The <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> <b>is</b> {{sensitive}} to extremely large changes in pressure, but generally this sensitivity is {{orders of magnitude}} less than that for the boiling point, because the solid-liquid transition represents only a small change in volume. If, as observed in most cases, a substance is more dense in the solid than in the liquid state, the melting point will increase with increases in pressure. Otherwise the reverse behavior occurs. Notably, {{this is the case}} of water, as illustrated graphically to the right, but also of Si, Ge, Ga, Bi. With extremely large changes in pressure, substantial changes to the melting point are observed. For example, the melting point of silicon at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) is 1415°C, but at pressures in excess of 10 GPa it decreases to 1000°C.|$|E
