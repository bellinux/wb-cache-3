They were developed by the English Court of Chancery and other courts that administer equity jurisdiction, including the law of trusts.

According to Grice (1975), people should obey those maxims {{in order to}} have an effective communication without any miscommunication. In fact, people sometimes flout the maxims.

Therefore, in this study, the writer is interested in analyzing the type <b>of</b> flouted <b>maxims</b> in Titanic, the reasons <b>of</b> the flouting <b>maxims,</b> and the consequences <b>of</b> the flouting <b>maxims.</b> The writer chose Titanic because it has good effects and visuals, and it also provides excellent commentary on the issue of a dramatic story as well as good appreciation by the audience.

The fact is that although maxims were flouted, misunderstanding hardly ever took place. In majority 94. 64 % of the communication could still run smoothly even though maxims were flouted.

In the application of the features, the male main character in Cinderella Man mostly uses report talk compared to other features.
