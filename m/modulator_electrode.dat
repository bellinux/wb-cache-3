40|$|Acoustooptic and {{electrooptic}} waveguide modulators {{have been}} fabricated in n-/n+-CdTe waveguides, where the n- guide layers were produced by high-energy proton bombardment. The acoustooptic modulators utilize 27 MHz Rayleigh {{surface acoustic waves}} generated by 2. 5 mm long interdigital electrode transducers.

40|$|A novel glucose sensing concept {{based on}} the {{localized}} change or "modulation" in pH within a symmetric gold gold junction electrode is proposed. A paired gold gold junction electrode (average gap size ca. 500 nm) is prepared by simultaneous bipotentiostatic electrodeposition of gold onto two closely spaced platinum disk electrodes. For glucose detection in neutral aqueous solution, {{the potential of the}} "pH-modulator" electrode is set to - 1. 5 V vs saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) to locally increase the pH, and simultaneously, either cyclic voltammetry or square wave voltammetry experiments are conducted at the sensor electrode. A considerable improvement in the sensor electrode response is observed when a normal pulse voltammetry sequence is applied to the <b>modulator</b> <b>electrode</b> (to generate "hydroxide pulses") and the glucose sensor electrode is operated with fixed bias at + 0. 5 V vs SCE (to eliminate capacitive charging currents). Preliminary data suggest good linearity for the glucose response in the medically relevant 1 - 10 mM concentration range (corresponding to 0. 18 - 1. 8 g L- 1).

40|$|Photonic links {{have been}} {{proposed}} to transport radio frequency (RF) signals over optical fiber. External optical modulation is commonly used in high performance RF-photonic links. The practical use of optical fiber to transport RF signals is still limited due to high RF signal loss. In {{order to reduce the}} RF signal loss, highly efficient modulators are needed. For many applications, modulators with broad bandwidths are required. However, there are applications that require only a narrow bandwidth. For these narrow-band applications, the modulation efficiency can be improved through the resonant enhancement technique at the expense of reduced bandwidth. The aim of this thesis is to investigate highly efficient Mach-Zehnder optical modulators (MZMs) on Lithium Niobate (LiNbO 3) with resonant enhancement techniques for narrow-band RF-photonic applications. This work focuses in particular on analyzing the factors that affect the modulation efficiency through resonant enhancement so that the <b>modulator</b> <b>electrode</b> structure can be optimized for maximum modulation efficiency. A parameter study {{of the effects of the}} electrode characteristics on the modulation efficiency of resonantly enhanced modulators (RE-MZM) is provided. From this study, optimum design objectives are identified. Numerical optimization is employed to explore the design trade-offs so that optimal configurations can be found. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the performance of optimal RE-MZMs with respect to the variations of fabrication conditions. The results of these investigations indicate that the RE-MZM with a large electrode gap is the optimal design since it provides high modulation efficiency although the inherent switching voltage is high, and is the most tolerant to the fabrication fluctuations. A highly efficient RE-MZM on X-cut LiNbO 3 is practically demonstrated with the resonant enhancement factor of 5 dB when comparing to the unenhanced modulator with the same electrode structure and effective switching voltage of 2 V at 1. 8 GHz. The performance of the RF-photonic link using the fabr icated RE-MZM is evaluated. Optimization of RE-MZMs for operating at millimeter-wave frequencies is also reported. Factors that limit the modulation efficiency of an RE-MZM at millimeter-wave frequencies are identified. Novel resonant structures that can overcome these limitations are proposed. Preliminary designs indicate that greatly improved modulation efficiency could be expected...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} limited speed and high power {{dissipation}} copper wires {{can no longer}} {{meet the demands of}} future high speed computing devices. While many different approaches are being tried to overcome the challenge, the one based on a high-speed optical link looks promising. By using photons to transfer information one is able to eliminate the bottlenecks associated with electronic based interconnects. Where optical alternatives usually suffer from high costs and a cost effective approach that is also capable of high volume production is required. In this regard, silicon photonics offers a solution due to its CMOS compatibility. Over the last decade remarkable {{progress has been made in}} the field of silicon photonics where photodetectors, optical sources (lasers) and modulators have been the focus of the study. The electro-optic modulator, which converts electrical signal into optical signal, is a fundamental building block of silicon photonics. Designers have previously concentrated more on optimizing the optical design of the modulator but the modulator’s bandwidth can significantly improve if its electrode design is optimized. The aim of the project was to optimize the <b>modulator</b> <b>electrode</b> to maximize the bandwidth performance of the electrode. Each element of the electrode has been studied separately. These include bends, tapers and two different dimensions of the coplanar line. Simulation results of square bend, mitred bend, round bend, exponential taper, Klopfenstein taper, triangular taper and two different dimensions of the coplanar line losses are presented. The fabrication process, analysis of aluminium surface morphology and etching techniques are discussed. As a result, characterization of different types of bends, tapers and electrodes are shown where discontinuities like bends and tapers reveal insignificant added loss between 0 GHz and 67 GHz. The final characterized electrode for a 0. 5 mm long modulator has a 3 dB point above 67 GHz whereas previous designs were limited to 42. 8 GHz. Since velocity mismatch between optical and electrical signals also limits the modulator’s performance, an effective technique to slow the electrical signal to match its velocity to that of the optical signal for slow wave modulators has successfully been demonstrated with the potential to achieve very high slowing down factors. The slow wave structure for electrode consisted of silicon dioxide and floating metal strips. The characterised slow wave modulator with slow wave electrode confirms a slowing down factor of 2. Not only will the slow wave structure slow down the electrical signal to reduce the mismatch with optical signal velocity, it will also reduce the substrate loss. This shows the potential of slow wave modulator bandwidth to double if optimized further...|$|E

40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{potassium}} tantalate niobate (KTN) were prepared {{by means of}} pulsed excimer-laser deposition and investigated {{with a number of}} analytical techniques including electrical and electro-optical measurements. For applications in longitudinal electro-optic (EO) <b>modulators,</b> a second <b>electrode</b> is required between substrate and EO layer. Suitable epitaxial electrodes, which also permit epitaxial growth of KTN, were identified and prepared. The resulting layered samples were not only of good epitaxial and optical quality, but also exhibited maxima of the Pockels effect at the expected temperatures. It was, however, found that the linear and the quadratic EO effects became saturated at fields above 600 kV/m. The maximum EO phase shift is thus limited to roughly pi / 100 for KTN films in the thickness range around 1 mu m; the saturation is caused by the ferroelectric hysteresis of KTN. Consequently, relatively thick films are necessary for most applications, which in turn requires significant improvements in the stability and homogeneity of the deposition process and limits the resolution achievable with EO spatial light modulators...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{interface}} technologies with implantable microelectrode arrays hold {{great promise}} for treating neural injuries or disorders. On neural electrode surfaces, conducting polymers can be electropolymerization with negatively charged molecules incorporated. When the polymer is reduced with negative current, dopant molecules are {{released from the}} polymer. This feature can be utilized to deliver neural transmitters and <b>modulators</b> from the <b>electrodes</b> to alter neural network activity. Previously, release of CNQX (6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione), an AMPA (2 -amino- 3 -(5 -methyl- 3 -oxo- 1, 2 - oxazol- 4 -yl) propanoic acid) receptor antagonist in hippocampal neuron culture effectively suppressed local neural activity in a transient manner. In this study, we further advance this technology by characterizing the drug loading and release capacity from microelectrodes, expanding the range of candidate dopants, and demonstrating in vivo effectiveness in rat somatosensory (S 1) barrel cortex. Firstly, to quantify the concentration of released drug, fluorescent model molecule was used and quantitatively assessed in a real time imaging system. Stimulation amplitude was varied to {{determine the amount of}} released drug from microelectrodes. Secondly, only negatively charged drugs have been effectively released in the past. In this study, zwitterionic transmitter γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) was successfully delivered with the technique, greatly expanding the applicable range for the technique. Finally, we used evoked response from barrel cortex to evaluate the release of DNQX (6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione), an analog of CNQX. The neural activity of barrel cortex reliably represents sensory stimuli from whiskers, hence provides an excellent in vivo network model for evaluating our neurochemical release system. Neural activity from multi-whisker stimulation was immediately and locally suppressed by released DNQX for one to six seconds, demonstrating the high spatial-temporal resolution of the technique. Furthermore, weaker activities were nearly abolished by released DNQX whilst stronger activities were less influenced, because the strong over-saturated neural input can only be partially antagonized. The system demonstrates successful modulation of neural network activity in a highly controllable manner. With the ease of being incorporated in existing neural implants without increasing the volume or complexity, this technology may find use {{in a wide range of}} neuroscience studies and potentially therapeutic devices...|$|R
