Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the current methods employed to conserve vorticity in numerical calculations is undertaken. Osher’s flux for the artificial compressibility equations is derived, implemented and validated in Cranfield University’s second order finite volume compressible flow solver MERLIN. Characteristic Decomposition is applied as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> vorticity conservation in both the compressible and artificial compressibility MERLIN solvers. The performance <b>of</b> this <b>method</b> for vorticity conservation in both these solvers is assessed. Following {{a discussion of the}} issues associated with application of limiter functions on unstructured grids three modified versions <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>Characteristic</b> Decomposition are proposed and tested in both the compressible and incompressible solvers. It is concluded that the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>Characteristic</b> Decomposition is an effective method for improving vorticity conservation and compares favourably in terms of increased computational cost to vorticity conservation through grid refinement.
