40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the impacts of a Severn Barrage on the hydro-environment of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model with a recently developed Barrage module (EFDC_B). Details are given of a barrage module being implemented into the EFDC model to represent the various hydraulic structures, such as turbines and sluice gates, as deployed along the barrage line. Several cases, both with and without the barrage, have been simulated to investigate the potential changes on the peak <b>water</b> levels, <b>minimum</b> <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> and peak tidal currents arising from a barrage. The impacts of a barrage on the salinity concentration distribution have also been simulated in both 2 D and 3 D modes. The predicted results showed that the maximum water levels could be significantly reduced, especially downstream of the barrage and for much of the region in the Severn Estuary and that the <b>minimum</b> <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> would be changed so much that there would be 80. 5 km 2 loss of intertidal habitats due to the sitting of a barrage across the estuary. Likewise, the peak tidal currents would be considerably reduced, and by as much as a half {{in the middle of the}} main channel. The predicted salinity concentrations results indicated that at high water, the salinity concentrations would be reduced by 1 – 2 ppt downstream and upstream of the barrage and salinity concentrations in the region near Beachley would be reduced by up to 5 ppt, and that at low water, salinity concentrations would be reduced by 0. 5 – 1 ppt in the middle of the Bristol Channel and by typically 0. 5 ppt and 1 ppt downstream and upstream of the barrage, respectively. The predicted results also indicated that salinity concentrations downstream and upstream of the barrage would be under a stable state with slight oscillations all the time due to the effects of the barrage. A comparison between the salinity concentration distributions predicted by the 2 D and 3 D models indicated that the two models produced similar salinity distributions, especially in the Severn Estuary and in the region between the middle of the Bristol Channel and the seaward open boundary...|$|R

In this study, processes {{that cause the}} growth and migration of shoals on ebb-tidal deltas are identified. Moreover, {{the effect of the}} incident wave energy and the tidal prism of an inlet on the migration speed of these shoals is investigated. For this, a numerical morphodynamic model with an idealized geometric setup is employed. The model computes the bed level evolution due to local erosion and deposition of sand driven by tides and waves. Analysis of model results shows that shoals grow when there is a local imbalance between the bathymetry and the wave conditions, which in this study was imposed by manually breaching the ebb-tidal delta or by adding storms to the wave forcing. There are thresholds for shoal formation that depend on the distribution of the sand and the incident wave energy. Wave refraction over the shoals leads to focusing of wave energy and increased wave energy dissipation around the location of the local <b>minimum</b> <b>water</b> <b>depth.</b> This generates residual currents over the shoal and increased skin friction toward the local <b>minimum</b> <b>water</b> <b>depth,</b> which together create a sand transport pattern that induces the growth and migration of the shoal.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of site-specific land drainage system designs is usually disregarded by landowners {{in favour of}} locally established ‘standard practice’ land drainage designs. This {{is due to a}} number of factors such as a limited understanding of soil–water interactions, lack of facilities for the measurement of soil’s physical or hydrological parameters and perceived time wastage and high costs. Hence {{there is a need for}} a site-specific drainage system design methodology that does not rely on inaccessible, time-consuming and/or expensive measurements of soil physical or hydrological properties. This requires a standardised process for deciphering the drainage characteristics of a given soil in the field. As an initial step, a new visual soil assessment method, referred to as visual drainage assessment (VDA), is presented whereby an approximation of the permeability of specific soil horizons is made using seven indicators (water seepage, pan layers, texture, porosity, consistence, stone content and root development) to provide a basis for the design of a site-specific drainage system. Across six poorly drained sites (1. 3 ha to 2. 6 ha in size) in south-west Ireland a VDA-based design was compared with (i) an ideal design (utilising soil physical measurements to elucidate soil hydraulic parameters) and (ii) a standard design (0. 8 m deep drains at a 15 m spacing) by model estimate of water table control and rainfall recharge/drain discharge capacity. The VDA method, unlike standard design equivalents, provided a good approximation of an ideal (from measured hydrological properties) design and prescribed an equivalent land drainage system in the field. Mean modelled rainfall recharge/drain discharge capacity for the VDA (13. 3 mm/day) and ideal (12. 0 mm/day) designs were significantly higher (P < 0. 001, s. e. 1. 42 mm/day) than for the standard designs (0. 5 mm/day), when assuming a design <b>minimum</b> <b>water</b> table <b>depth</b> of 0. 45 m. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on hydro-acoustic and {{geophysical}} observations, {{this paper}} presents an analysis of geomorphological and geological settings of gas methane occurrence on the NW shelf and upper continental slope, in the Sorokin trough and on the Kerch-Taman offshore, in the Black Sea. Gases are associated with seeps, mud volcanoes and gas hydrates. Evidence is given for the thermogenic nature of methane. The gas methane is of mostly abiogenic origin. Small gas releases may be produced by the decomposition of Quaternary organic material near the sea floor through the action of bacteria or biodegradation of redeposited thermogenic hydrocarbons. The origin of carbonate formations is related to degassing sedimentary layers. There is a possible role for deep faults in transporting gas to the sea floor. The gas hydrate stability zone in the Black Sea lies at <b>minimum</b> <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> of 600 – 650 m with its thickness up to 500 m.

A simple technique to determine <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and object detection is described in this paper. In this project it is employed sensors like ultrasonic transducer. A mechanical part in the device is introduced which is a salient part for the project to measure the <b>water</b> <b>depth.</b> Ultrasonic transducers are connected in this part. Angle is measured through this mechanical part therefore it can conveniently determine <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and object. This technique has provided a useful tool to more accurately to identify the <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and object. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate the noble methodology for measuring <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and object detection using Ultrasonic sounds to provide efficient and effective way. This paper provides researchers a good understanding of Ultrasonic signal and its characteristics to measure the <b>depth</b> of the <b>water</b> and object detection...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether the <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> (above soil) and soil type would have any influence on the multispectral reflectances of paddy rice, and their calculated vegetation index values. The results showed that, when vegetation cover was low (below 600 grams of dry biomass per square meter), the near infrared (NIR) reflectances decreased very little with <b>water</b> <b>depth.</b> The same was true for red reflectances, but to a lesser degree. Overall the changes were not significant at 0. 05 level of significance when the <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> was increased from 2. 5 centimeters to 10 centimeters. When the vegetation cover became higher most NIR and red reflectances did not show a significant decrease with the increase of the <b>water</b> <b>depth,</b> and sometimes they even increased slightly up to a <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> of 6. 4 cm. Nevertheless both rice cover and <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> as well as soils {{played an important role in}} the reflectance pattern in red and NIR bands. Some index values increased and some decreased depending on <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and rice cover. Statistical analysis of the data showed that rice multispectral responses were mainly controlled by vegetation and minimally influenced by soil and <b>water</b> <b>depths...</b>|$|R

Sora nesting sites occurred in shallower water than random sites in western New York. Average <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> reported at nest sites range from [...] for 4 sora nests in Colorado to nearly [...] for sora nests in western New York. In areas of deep water, soras typically wade on mats of floating vegetation.|$|R
