5|$|Leeds {{struggled}} in the 1961–62 season, as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton his playing squad {{was filled with}} journeymen pros; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who would all spend many years with Revie at Leeds. He developed a youth policy at the club, notable graduates {{of which would be}} Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter, Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney. He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs but <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> put in extra effort to make the youngsters feel happy at Leeds, and in one instance drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner's girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her. Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management.|$|E

25|$|Nelson {{always took}} care in public to define himself first and {{foremost}} as an American, with no conflicted loyalty to his birth country. But in the background he had supported Norway in various ways, and notably in inviting Norwegian officers to observe and learn from American tactics in Cuba. He had been planning a trip to Norway for some time, but <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would visit Sweden and Denmark, emphasizing his Scandinavian-American background.|$|E
25|$|Milligan blamed his {{breakdown}} and {{the collapse}} of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. The BBC however <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was surrounded by accomplished radio comedy writers—Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton—so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts written in a very convincing Milliganesque style.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E

25|$|The mood {{within the}} BCCI {{was one of}} gloom and doom as members fumed and fretted over the murky state of affairs that has made Indian cricket an object of global ridicule. Even though a {{majority}} of members wanted Srinivasan out and had the numbers to do so, they were rendered powerless by a technicality. The Tamil Nadu strongman had all but <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> will be elected unopposed as his rivals didn't have a proposer and seconder from South Zone for their candidate. Under BCCI rules, a contender for the top post must have the endorsement {{of at least two}} units from the zone whose turn it is to elect the president.|$|E
25|$|Believing Epenow's fabrication, Gorges {{commissioned}} a voyage to Martha's Vineyard in 1614 under Captain Nicholas Hobson, accompanied by Epenow as a guide, translator, and pilot, {{together with his}} fellow captives Assacomet and Wanape. Wanape died soon after arriving in the New World. Upon arriving to Epenow's native island, the ship was peacefully greeted by a company of Wampanoags, including some of Epenow's brothers and cousins, whom Epenow quickly and quietly conspired with. Captain Hobson entertained the visitors to his ship, and invited them to return the next morning with trade goods. Not trusting Epenow, Hobson <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was accompanied at all times by three guards, and clothed him with long garments that could be easily grabbed.|$|E

The original character design for Pickles the Drummer, one of the series' main characters, bore {{a striking resemblance to}} Townsend. The series' co-creator Brendon Small acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. [...] "We <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> didn't look like Devin Townsend. We gave him the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn't look like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Duvall was {{the only}} American actor {{nominated}} for the Best Actor Oscar; his competition were Britons Michael Caine (who had co-starred with Duvall in the 1976 The Eagle Has Landed), Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. During an interview before the Oscar ceremony, Duvall offended some Britons by complaining about [...] "the Limey syndrome," [...] claiming [...] "the attitude {{with a lot of}} people in Hollywood is that what they do in England is somehow better than what we do here." [...] Duvall, who was presented with the Oscar by country music star Dolly Parton, said of winning the award, [...] "It was a nice feeling, knowing I was the home-crowd favorite." [...] In a New York Times profile of Duvall that appeared six years after Tender Mercies release, Nan C. Robertson wrote that despite four previous Academy Award nominations, [...] "it was not until he won as Best Actor in 1983 ... that moviegoers woke up in droves to this great natural resource. The reason was that they rarely recognized Mr. Duvall from one part to another, so effortlessly did he vanish into each celluloid persona." [...] Foote, who was so certain he would not win the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for To Kill a Mockingbird he had not attended the 1963 ceremony, <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was present to collect his award for Best Original Screenplay. The critical success of the film allowed Foote to exercise considerable control over his future film projects, including final veto power over major decisions; when such power was denied, Foote would simply refuse to do the film.|$|E
500|$|Revie {{was made}} player-manager at Leeds United in March 1961 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Jack Taylor, who left after Leeds found themselves struggling in the Second Division. He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth, but Bournemouth were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to instead appoint Revie as manager. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Less than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season whilst Leeds's championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000. He immediately began to institute radical changes such as ensuring the players stayed at higher quality hotels. He instilled a [...] "family atmosphere" [...] at Elland Road, making sure to {{take an interest in}} the lives of everyone at the club from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no [...] "big egos" [...] at the club. He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was fully informed as to what they were up to off the pitch, even {{going so far as to}} tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites.|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

500|$|Now {{wanting a}} [...] "bigger and stronger-looking" [...] Jason, {{one that was}} also [...] "more {{athletic}} and powerful", Steve Miner hired former British trapeze artist Richard Brooker. After a simple conversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to the country, Brooker believed that [...] "playing a psychopathic killer" [...] {{was the best way}} into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear Jason's now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, [...] "It felt great with the mask on. It just felt like I really was Jason because I didn't have anything to wear before that." [...] For The Final Chapter, Joseph Zito brought his own spin to the character, one that required a [...] "real hardcore stuntman"; Ted White was hired to perform the role. White, who only took the job for the money, did [...] "get into the Jason psychology" [...] when he arrived on the set. White {{went so far as to}} not speak to any of the other actors for long stretches. As filming continued, White's experience was not pleasant, and in one instance, he went to battle for co-star Judie Aronson, who played Samantha, when the director kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased with his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the credits. As with Friday the 13th Part 2, there was confusion over who performed the role in A New Beginning, partly because Jason is not the literal antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to return, Dick Wieand was cast. Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film's actual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked scenes. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his time in his trailer. By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> [...] "really got into the character".|$|E

[...] Upon finding him, she brought the body back to Saltillo and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was {{properly}} buried. [...] After the battle she purchased Lincoln's horse at auction, beating a $75 bid with a $200 offer, and made arrangements for the horse to be sent to the captain's family.|$|E
2500|$|Butcher's Dozen (1988) is {{the second}} of four novels by Max Allan Collins fictionalizing Ness's tenure as Cleveland's Public Safety Director. [...] Changing some names, and {{reordering}} some events for dramatic purposes, it concludes that, although Ness was unable to actually name the killer (a fictionalized version of Sweeney) publicly, he did identify him and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{was no longer a}} danger to the public. [...] The novel was expanded from a short story, [...] "The Strawberry Teardrop" [...] (1984), in which the main character is Collins's private eye hero, Nate Heller, and Ness plays a supporting role.|$|E

With the resulting stress, from which Dickens would never fully recover, he came up two and a half pages short for the sixteenth serial, published in August 1865. Dickens acknowledged this close brush with death, that nearly cut short the composition of Our Mutual Friend, in the novel's postscript: ...|$|E
2500|$|Justine (Thérèse) and Juliette {{were the}} daughters of Monsieur de Bertole. [...] Bertole was a widower banker who {{fell in love with}} another man's lover. [...] The man, Monsieur de Noirseuil, in the {{interest}} of revenge, pretended to be his friend, and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> became bankrupt and eventually poisoned him, leaving the girls orphans. [...] Juliette and Justine lived in a nunnery, where the abbess of the nunnery corrupted Juliette (and attempted to corrupt Justine too). [...] However, Justine was sweet and virtuous. [...] When the abbess found out about Bertole's death she threw both girls out. [...] Juliette's story is told in another book, and Justine continues on in pursuit of virtue, beginning from becoming a maid in the house of the usurer Harpin, which is where her troubles begin anew.|$|E
2500|$|Besides being {{involved}} {{in the early days of}} English ballet, Lopokova appeared on the stage in London and Cambridge from 1928, and was broadcast on the BBC as a presenter and in a number of acting roles; she read [...] "The Red Shoes" [...] over the BBC in 1935 (and a few years later reprised it for BBC television). She lived with Keynes in London, Cambridge and Sussex. [...] "Lopokova was [...] partner in founding the Cambridge Arts Theatre, and in advising him on the constitution for the Arts Council; with his financial input she became a moving spirit in the Camargo Society, which led to the creation of a national ballet company." [...] After her husband's collapse from an attack of angina in 1937, Lopokova devoted herself increasingly to taking care of his health. She supervised his diet and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had enough rest; [...] "without her constant attention and her joie de vivre, Keynes might not have made it to Bretton Woods." ...|$|E
