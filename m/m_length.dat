5|$|Despite its {{architectural}} prominence, {{very little}} is known of the church's history and its precise architecture. Most of {{the information on the}} church's original appearance is derived from the epigram in honour of Juliana and her family, which was inscribed in pieces {{in various parts of the}} church. The epigram claims that the church was laid out as a replica of the ancient Jewish Temple with the precise proportions given in the Bible for the Temple of Solomon, and using the royal cubit as a unit of measure, as in its model. Richard Martin Harrison, the site's chief excavator, has reconstructed the church as a roughly square basilica, ca. 52 m long on the sides, with a central nave and two side aisles, fronted by a narthex and preceded by a large atrium of 26 <b>m</b> <b>length.</b> To the north of the atrium, remains of another building have been identified as either the church's baptistery or Juliana's palace. An oval substructure in the building's center indicates the position of the ambon, while strong foundations throughout the building indicate, according to Harrison, the presence of a dome, bringing the estimated height of the building to over 30 m. The area of the altar was not sufficiently excavated, and its shape remains unknown. The possible presence of a dome, although not universally accepted, is of major importance, since it would mean that it was St. Polyeuctus, and not Justinian's churches (Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hagia Sophia), which first combined the traditional basilica with a dome. From the epigram, we know that the interior featured two storeys with colonnades and galleries. Based on the epigram and the substructures, Harrison also posited the existence of a pair of two-storey exedrae, composed of three niches with a pier in between, on the northern and southern sides of the ambo. The spaces around the domed western bay would have been covered with barrel or cross-vaults.|$|E

2500|$|Foreign {{bodies are}} common in animals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. [...] Dogs will readily eat toys, bones, and any object that either has food on it or retains the odor of food. [...] Unlike humans, dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due {{to their ability to}} swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus. [...] Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the pyloric sphincter, and in the jejunum. [...] Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction include vomiting, abdominal pain, and depression due to dehydration. [...] Peritonitis results if either the stomach or intestine has ruptured. [...] Foreign bodies in the stomach can sometimes be removed by endoscopic retrieval or if necessary by gastrotomy. [...] Very often a simple Instrument to remove foreign bodies without operation endoscopy is the Hartmann Alligator Forceps. The instrument is manufactored from 8cm to 1 <b>m</b> <b>length.</b> Foreign bodies in the jejunum are removed by enterotomy.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of the dipole antenna is the rabbit ears or bunny ears television antenna, found atop broadcast television receivers. [...] It is used to receive the VHF terrestrial television bands, consisting in the US of 52 to 88nbsp&MHz (band I) and 174 to 216nbsp&MHz (band III), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m. [...] Since this frequency range is much wider than a single fixed dipole antenna can cover, it is made with several degrees of adjustment. [...] It is constructed of two telescoping rods that can be extended out to about 1 <b>m</b> <b>length</b> (approximately one quarter wavelength at 52nbsp&MHz). [...] Instead of being fixed in opposing directions, these elements can be adjusted at an angle in a [...] "V" [...] shape. [...] The reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels {{at the top of the}} band, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd harmonic. [...] In this mode the direction of maximum gain is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles.|$|E
