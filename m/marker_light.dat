25|$|This scheme, on {{the face}} of it, was a fairly {{standard}} colour light system, with each stop signal (which could show red or green) having an attendant repeater signal (showing red, yellow or green – the red used only for when the two stop signals on either side were also red). What made the scheme unusual was the provision of an automatic 'calling on' facility. The stop signals had an additional signal head ('marker light') that featured a red aspect plus a miniature yellow aspect. This <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was mounted part way up the post. On repeater signals, the <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was offset to the left-hand side of the post to indicate that the 'stop and proceed' rule applied. Junction stop signals were provided with two main signal heads, one mounted higher than the other. Splitting distant signals had three main heads, the centre one mounted higher than the other two.|$|E
25|$|When a train {{stopped at}} a red stop signal, its {{presence}} on the track started a time delay relay. At {{the conclusion of the}} time delay, the red <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was extinguished and replaced by the miniature yellow (the upper red aspect remained lit). The train stop also lowered. The calling on aspect authorised the driver to proceed, but to be prepared to stop short of another train.|$|E
25|$|Route {{destinations}} {{and service}} patterns were indicated to riders {{by means of}} steel signs placed in holders {{along the side of}} the cars, near the doors. These signs could be physically removed and changed when a train was assigned to a different service pattern. Marker lights at the front and rear of each car also indicated the routes to crews en route, as well as astute riders who came to recognize their trains' <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> patterns over time.|$|E
50|$|Two {{headlights}} {{are mounted}} {{at the top}} of the car in the centre on driver's cab ends. There are no <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> at the front; however, there are red <b>marker</b> <b>lights</b> for the rear located on the upper corners.|$|R

25|$|The {{first five}} units were fitted with carbody pressurisation, as fitted {{to many other}} Australian National {{locomotives}} for operation in the dusty outback areas they operated in. Differences in the subsequent units included the fitting of double blade windscreen wipers, lowering of the multiple-unit jumper receptacle, and {{the changing of the}} <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> orientation from vertical to horizontal. Recent years have seen many of the class fitted with on line refuelling, and working from Melbourne to Perth on the SCT Logistics service.|$|E
2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex socket bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E
50|$|Originally, a {{permanently}} illuminated white <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> {{was positioned}} beneath the main colour light head {{in lieu of}} the red <b>marker</b> <b>light.</b> The caution turnout indication was a single yellow in the main head over three white lights at an angle of 45 degrees. The red <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> was introduced from 1965. The majority of early single light colour light signals had either been replaced or retrofitted with red marker lights, by 2000.|$|E

50|$|A {{middle marker}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as an outer marker. It is normally positioned 0.5 to 0.8 nmi km before the runway threshold. When the aircraft is above the middle marker, the receiver's amber middle <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> starts blinking, and a repeating pattern of audible morse code-like dot-dashes at a frequency of 1,300 Hz in the headset. This alerts the pilot that the CAT I missed approach point (typically 200 ft above the ground level on the glideslope) has been passed and should have already initiated the missed approach if one of several visual cues has not been spotted.|$|E

Australian second-generation Festivas have U.S. side <b>marker</b> <b>light</b> cut-outs {{on each side of the}} vehicle (driver-side and passenger-side) at the front and rear. Instead of housing orange reflectors/lights at the front sides and red reflectors/lights at the rear sides, there are non-lit orange reflectors at all four locations. These redundant reflectors, coupled with the orange side indicator repeater (which is not required in the U.S., and was not included on the Aspire) make for a unique side profile.|$|E
