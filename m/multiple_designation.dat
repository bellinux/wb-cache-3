40|$|This paper {{examines}} how governments in Asia {{are changing the}} way they regulate their domestic airline industries in response to rapid growth in demand. Typically, the national carrier {{has been responsible for}} fostering air travel, often in situations where surface transport systems are poorly developed. Air transport has been an integral part of national development policies and the national carrier has been given a degree of protection to allow it to subsidise services the government deems to be necessary. As governments allow new private sector airlines to introduce much needed capacity into the system, the regulatory system is placed under severe strain. Many of the Asian countries that have implemented a more liberal approach to airline competition have been forced to allow the new private sector airlines to operate international services, at least on a regional basis. In many cases the belief has been that higher yields in international markets will help to cross-subsidise domestic services. However, increasing integration of domestic and international airline markets has posed difficulties for regulators in more developed markets and it is unlikely that this approach is sustainable. At the same time, the pressure for <b>multiple</b> <b>designation</b> and the growth of regional, cross-border airline services is complementing pressure at the multilateral level to liberalise international aviation regulations within the Asia-Pacific region. airlines Asia regulation privatisation new entrants <b>multiple</b> <b>designation</b> regional blocs...|$|E
40|$|Member Countries of the Andean Community (ANCOM) have {{established}} a supranational legal regime applicable to intra and extra-subregional air transport activities: the Andean Subregional Air Transport Integration system. This regime was established by Decisions 297 and 320 and {{was based on the}} Colombia-Venezuela Bilateral Air Transport Agreement. It revolutionizes the status quo regarding air transport. The new regime adopts the principles of <b>multiple</b> <b>designation</b> of air carriers, free determination of frequencies and capacities for scheduled air services performed with the Subregion, and complete liberalization for non-scheduled air services. It creates an "Andean subregional market" and promotes the establishment of a "common" position for negotiating intra and extra-regional fifth freedom. Member Countries have been unresponsive in updating their bilateral agreements vis-a-vis the regime set by Decisions 297 and 320. This situation makes the application and healthy development of the Andean Subregional Air Transport Integration process difficult. In order to avoid these difficulties, Member Countries shall apply the supranational principles contained in Decisions 297 and 320 and update their bilateral agreements.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Ecosystem Service (ES) concept into practice might be a challenging task as it has {{to take into account}} previous "traditional" policies and approaches that have evaluated nature and biodiversity differently. Among them the Habitat (92 / 43 /EC) and Bird Directives (79 / 409 /EC), the Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC), and the Noise Directive (2002 / 49 /EC) have led to the evaluation/designation of areas in Europe with different criteria. In this study our goal was to understand how the ES capacity of an area is related to its designation and if areas with <b>multiple</b> <b>designations</b> have higher capacity in providing ES. We selected four catchments in Greece with a great variety of characteristics covering over 25 % of the national territory. Inside the catchments we assessed the ES capacity (following the methodology of Burkhard et al. 2009) of areas designated as Natura 2000 sites, Quiet areas and Wetlands or Water bodies and found those areas that have <b>multiple</b> <b>designations.</b> Data were analyzed by GLM to reveal differences regarding the ES capacity among the different types of areas. We also investigated by PCA synergies and trade-offs among different kinds of ES and tested for correlations among landscape properties, such as elevation, aspect and slope and the ES potential. Our results show that areas with different types or <b>multiple</b> <b>designations</b> have a different capacity in providing ES. Areas of one designation type (Protected or Quiet Areas) had in general intermediate scores in most ES but scores were higher compared to areas with no designation, which displayed stronger capacity in provisioning services. Among Protected Areas and Quiet Areas the latter scored better in general. Areas that combined both designation types (Protected and Quiet Areas) showed the highest capacity in 13 out of 29 ES, that were mostly linked with natural and forest ecosystems. We found significant synergies among most regulating, supporting and cultural ES which in turn display trade-offs with provisioning services. The different ES are spatially related and display strong correlation with landscape properties, such as elevation and slope. We suggest that the designation status of an area can be used as an alternative tool for environmental policy, indicating the capacity for ES provision. <b>Multiple</b> <b>designations</b> of areas can be used as proxies for locating ES "hotspots". This integration of "traditional" evaluation and designation and the "newer" ES concept forms a time- and cost-effective way to be adopted by stakeholders and policy-makers in order to start complying with new standards and demands for nature conservation and environmental management...|$|R

50|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{designation}} of several routes in the Interstate Highway System through Utah, the Utah State Legislature made several changes to the Utah State Route system. The bulk of these changes were not visible to the public, but were to unsigned legislative designations only. The primary effect was designating route numbers 1 through 5 for future corridors of the Interstate Highways in Utah. There were also changes made to a few unsigned highways serving state parks and institutions. Several other routes were truncated or re-assigned or split into <b>multiple</b> <b>designations</b> to allow the Interstate Highway corridors to have a single route number assigned. As {{very little of the}} Interstate Highway System had been constructed in Utah by 1962, these changes were primarily to support future construction. There were a number of cases where the legislative change enacted in 1962 would not be built and signed until years later. Few of the changes made in 1962 are still valid today. As construction of the Interstate Highway system proceeded, additional changes were made. The legislature made a larger change in route designations in 1977, eliminating unsigned legislative and concurrences in the process.|$|R

It remains even today {{the most extensive}} dictionary of the Yiddish language, containing approximately 90,000 single-word entries and 8,000 idioms (because of <b>multiple</b> <b>designations</b> it amounts to nearly 175,000 entries). The dictionary was meant to ‘store’ the Yiddish language, which {{was in danger of}} extinction after the Holocaust. Peter Mark Roget’s English thesaurus served as an example; nonetheless, Stutchkoff reduced Roget’s 1000 onomastic categories to 650. The dictionary received critical acclaim and 2000 copies were sold within the first year of its publication alone. It does not project purist language views; instead it includes 1500 Americanisms, 3000 Germanisms, 1000 Slavisms, 500 vulgarisms, 700 funny expressions, and 700 archaisms, dialectal words, slang words and Sovietisms. This inclusion of modern lexicon distinguished Stutchkoff’s dictionary from other publications put out by the Institute for Jewish Research YIVO (Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut). Stutchkoff’s decision to include those terms went against the advice of his publisher, Max Weinreich. However, some reviewers – among others Isaac Bashevis Singer – criticised the fact that Weinreich had designated certain terms as “not recommended”, while others regretted that the Oytser included many artificial terms invented by the YIVO that were not in use in other circles.|$|R

Many highway maintenance agencies assign some form of number to all highways, bridges, and other features they maintain for tracking and inventory purposes.

There are several instances where a route has officially been given a name by government agencies, and is signed with that name, but the route is also assigned a number by the highway maintenance agencies as to fit in their maintenance and inventory systems.
