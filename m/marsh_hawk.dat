60|$|The {{sun sets}} on some retired meadow, where no house is visible, {{with all the}} glory and splendor that it lavishes on cities, and perchance as it has never set before--where there is but a solitary <b>marsh</b> <b>hawk</b> to have his wings gilded by it, or only a {{musquash}} looks out from his cabin, {{and there is some}} little black-veined brook {{in the midst of the}} marsh, just beginning to meander, winding slowly round a decaying stump. We walked in so pure and bright a light, gilding the withered grass and leaves, so softly and serenely bright, I thought I had never bathed in such a golden flood, without a ripple or a murmur to it. The west side of every wood and rising ground gleamed like the boundary of Elysium, and the sun on our backs seemed like a gentle herdsman driving us home at evening.|$|E

5|$|Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is among the}} most important; one study found that 97.5% of {{vertebrate}} remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats.

60|$|Now that is {{just the}} way with a lot of people. The more they have and the less they have to worry about, the more discontented they become, and at last they are {{positively}} unhappy. There was little Danny Meadow Mouse, living out on the Green Meadows; he was happy all the livelong day, and yet he had no safe castle like the dear Old Briar-patch where he could always be safe. Every minute of every day Danny had to keep his eyes wide open and his wits working their very quickest, for any minute he was likely to be in danger. Old Man Coyote or Reddy Fox or Granny Fox or Digger the Badger or Mr. Blacksnake was likely to come creeping through the grass any time, and they are always hungry for a fat Meadow Mouse. And as if that weren't worry enough, Danny had to watch the sky, too, for Old Whitetail the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Hawk,</b> or his cousin Redtail, or Blacky the Crow, each of whom would be glad of a Meadow Mouse dinner. Yet in spite of all this, Danny was happy and never once lost his appetite.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{had seen}} a very strange thing. It was strange to Peter, anyway. It gave him {{something}} to think about, and this, I am sure you will agree, was a most excellent thing, for it {{kept him out of}} mischief for a while. He had been over to the Smiling Pool for a call on Jerry Muskrat and had just started back for the dear Old Briar-patch when he chanced to look over {{in the direction of the}} Big River. Coming straight towards him, but high in the air, was a big bird, a bird with broad wings. Peter didn't have to look twice to know that it was a member of the Hawk family. At first he thought it was Redtail. Then he caught a flash of white, and he thought it was Whitetail the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Hawk,</b> in spite of the fact that it didn't fly like him. Peter didn't stop to think of that. It was enough for him that a member of the Hawk family was headed that way, and he didn't care a twitch of his funny little tail which member it was. He felt that the stomach of one was quite as undesirable a place for Peter Rabbit as the stomach of another, and he had no intention of filling any if he could help it.|$|E
60|$|The first sparrow of spring! The year {{beginning}} with younger hope than ever!

What {{at such a time}} are histories, chronologies, traditions, and all written revelations? The brooks sing carols and glees to the spring. The <b>marsh</b> <b>hawk,</b> sailing low over the meadow, is already seeking the first slimy life that awakes. The sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells, and the ice dissolves apace in the ponds. The grass flames up on the hillsides like a spring fire--"et primitus oritur herba imbribus primoribus evocata"--as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet the returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its flame;--the symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon, streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but anon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year's hay with the fresh life below. It grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground. It is almost identical with that, for in the growing days of June, when the rills are dry, the grass-blades are their channels, and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply. So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity.|$|E

50|$|The round-tailed muskrat is a semiaquatic and nocturnal species {{native to}} the southeastern United States. Limited sexual {{dimorphism}} is seen among round-tailed muskrats, with female adults weighing an average of 262 grams and male adults measuring at a slightly heavier average of 279 grams. The round-tailed muskrat feeds on emergent aquatic grasses, including aquatic plant stems, seeds, and roots, to sustain its herbivorous lifestyle. The most prominent predators of the round-tailed muskrat are <b>marsh</b> <b>hawks</b> and barn owls, but most predation occurred when the round-tailed muskrats were found outside their normal territory, having been displaced by floods. The pelage of a newborn round-tailed muskrat varies from gray to ash-gray. Adults have a brown pelage with pale fur on the belly. This change in coat color {{is the result of}} a juvenile molt (between 7 and 30 days post partum) and a subadult molt (between 35 and 50 days post partum). Molting in round-tailed muskrats has been observed throughout the year, but is more prevalent during the autumn.|$|R

60|$|It {{was smaller}} than the other lagoons I have {{described}} and much shallower, so that the big birds, such as the stork, wood-ibis, crested screamer, and the great blue ibis, called vanduria, and the roseate spoonbill, could wade almost all over it without wetting their feathers. It {{was one of those}} lakes which appear to be drying up, and was pretty well covered with a growth of camalote plant, mixed with reed, sedge, and bulrush patches. It was the only water in our part of the country where the large water-snail was found, and the snails had brought the bird that feeds on them--the large social <b>marsh</b> <b>hawk,</b> a slate-coloured bird resembling a buzzard in its size and manner of flight. But being exclusively a feeder on snails, it lives in peace and harmony with the other bird inhabitants of the marsh. There was always a colony of forty or fifty of these big hawks to be seen at this spot. A still more interesting bird was the jacana, as it is spelt in books, but pronounced ya-sa-NA by the Indians of Paraguay, a quaint rail-like bird supposed {{to be related to the}} plover family: black and maroon-red in colour, the wing-quills a shining greenish yellow, it has enormously long toes, spurs on its wings, and yellow wattles on its face.

40|$|Nests of American Bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus), <b>marsh</b> <b>hawks</b> (Circus cyaneus), and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) {{are usually}} found in wetland habitats. Although large marshes {{containing}} dense stands of bulrushes (Scirpus), cattails (Typha), or other wetland vegetation are favored nesting cover, these birds {{have also been}} reported to nest in stands of tall, dense shrubs and grasses on the upland (Bent 1961, 1963; Palmer 1962; Sealy 1967; Stewart 1975). During 1968 - 74, we regularly found upland nests of these three species while conducting duck nesting studies in planted fields of undisturbed grass-legume cover in the Dakotas (Duebbert and Lokemoen 1976). Our findings on nest densities, hatching success, site characteristics, clutch sizes, and other ecological factors are presented in this paper. A bib (1975) indicated that the three species discussed in the present paper, in all or {{a significant part of}} their range, currently exhibit potentially dangerous, apparently non-cyclical population declines. Our general observations in North Dakota over the past 20 years also suggest an alarming decrease in populations of these birds during the breeding season. We believe that these population declines may be correlated with the widespread destruction or degradation of essential nesting habitats as agriculture has become increasingly more intensive...|$|R

40|$|During the 1979 {{breeding}} season four pairs of northern harriers, or <b>marsh</b> <b>hawks</b> (Circus cyaneus) and four pairs of short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) were studied in Cache Valley, Utah. The study was concerned solely with diurnal resource utilization, {{and did not}} examine the owls 2 ̆ 7 nocturnal activities. The home range of each harrier pair overlapped substantially with that of an owl pair. Percent habitat overlap for hawk-owl pairs varied from 39 percent to 72 percent. Observations were made to determine if differences existed in their utilization of habitat and food resources, or in their daily and seasonal activity patterns. Both species utilized mainly wet old field and pasture habitat types for their hunting efforts. In general wet old fields were utilized more than expected based on their availability, while pasture, bare ground, and harvested field habitats were used less than expected. Pairs of hawks and owls sharing common habitats generally showed differences in preferred hunting habitats. An analysis of variance showed that hawks and owls were making strikes in different habitat types {{and to some extent}} {{in different parts of the}} habitat. Harriers and owls nested in different habitat types. Breeding seasons of the two species overlapped almost totally, but interspecific differences were detected in time-activity budgets. Overall, the owls were more sedentary than the hawks. Both species spent approximately 10 percent of the day in hunting-related activites, but timing of hunting varied from pair to pair. Overlapping pairs generally differed in their daily distribution of hunting time. The analysis of variance showed that there was a significant difference in the timing of strikes made by harriers and owls. Both species were feeding primarily on small mammals in the study area, and food resources were probably not a limiting factor for either population. Though northern harriers and short-eared owls appear to have a high degree of niche overlap, this study showed that where eight individual pairs of the two species came into contact they differed in time-activity budgets and habitat utilization. Coexistence between these two species may be enhanced by the fact that they both feed on an abundant prey resource. By subtle habitat and time budget preferences, reinforced through interspecific aggression, they can avoid competition...|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{species can}} positively, neutrally, or {{negatively}} affect {{the provision of}} ecosystem services. The direction and magnitude of this effect can {{be a function of}} the invaders' density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (- 0. 40 ± 0. 19 m yr- 1 vs. - 0. 31 ± 0. 10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy <b>marsh</b> of Kitty <b>Hawk</b> Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0. 19 ± 0. 05 m yr- 1 vs. 0. 12 ± 0. 07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23. 23 ± 2. 0 kg C m- 3 vs. 22. 81 ± 3. 8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36. 63 ± 10. 22 kg C m- 3) than those with medium (13. 99 ± 1. 23 kg C m- 3) or high density (21. 61 ± 4. 53 kg C m- 3), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system. Moreover, the conceptual framework of this study can broadly inform an ecosystem services-based approach to invasive species management...|$|R
