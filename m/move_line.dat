5000|$|Gunpey (グンペイ), often {{written as}} [...] "Gun Pey" [...] or [...] "GunPey", {{is a series}} of {{handheld}} puzzle games released by Bandai. It was originally released for the WonderSwan, and has been ported to WonderSwan Color, Playstation, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. The game was named as a tribute to the developer of the game, Gunpei Yokoi. He is known for developing several handheld consoles such as Nintendos Game Boy, Virtual Boy, and Bandais Wonderswan system. In the series, players <b>move</b> <b>line</b> fragments vertically in a grid {{in order to make a}} single branching line connect horizontally from one end to the other. The objective of the game differs by what game mode players choose.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method to classify the binary document into scalar type or vector type. Any image can be basically classified into 1. Vector image 2. Scalar Image. Vector images are represented as display file containing {{set of drawing}} primitive commands (like <b>move,</b> <b>line,</b> curve, rectangle, circle etc) along with related parameters (like coordinates, angle, radius etc.). Scalar images are represented as pixel information ex. Bitmap. Thus memory required to store vector image is very less than of scalar image. Vector image is best to represent text since letters of text are generally formed by set of primitive drawing commands. If the vector image portions of a binary document are identified, then it can be represented as display file by the display file Generating-programs. Remaining portion of the file i. e. scalar portion can be compressed and kept/sent separately. Initially the binary document images are segmented using Constrained Run Length Algorithm (CRLA) which splits the entire binary image into labeled segment blocks. Next step is to calculate the features for each block according to the block size and data transition (zero-to-one / one-to-zero). Next, the block – features are fed into input layer of Feed Forward Neural Network(FFNN) and it is trained using back propagation method to train the network to classify content of each block into scalar or vector type. Hidden layer and neurons in hidden layer can be developed using constructive approach. FFNN training can be improved using momentum, learning rate and bias if necessary...|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written on the {{organizational}} power of metaphor in discourse, eg on metaphor ‘chains’ and ‘clusters’ of linguistic metaphor in discourse (Koller 2003, Cameron & Stelma 2004, Semino 2008) {{and the role of}} extended and systematic metaphor in organizing long stretches of language, even whole texts (Cameron et al 2009, Cameron & Maslen 2010, Deignan et al 2013, Semino et al 2013). However, at times, this work belies the intricacies of how a single metaphoric idea can impact on a text. The focus of this paper is a UK media article derived from a HM Treasury press release on alleviating poverty. The language of the article draws heavily on orientational (spatial) metaphors, particularly metaphors of movement around GOOD IS UP. Although GOOD IS UP can be considered a single metaphoric idea, the picture the reader builds up as they <b>move</b> <b>line</b> by line through this text is complex and multifaceted. I take the idea of “building up a picture” literally in order to investigate the schema of motion relating to GOOD IS UP. To do this, fifteen informants (Masters students at a London university), tutored in Cognitive Metaphor Theory, were asked to read the article and underline words and expressions they felt related to GOOD IS UP. The text was then read back to the informant with emphasis given to the words they had underlined, while they drew a pictorial representation of the article based on the meanings of these words, integrating their drawings into a single picture as they went along. I present examples of the drawings the informants produced. I propose that using Metaphor-led Discourse Analysis to produce visual material in this way offers useful insights into how metaphor contributes to meaning making at text level. It shows how a metaphoric idea, such as GOOD IS UP, provides the text producer with a rich and versatile meaning-making resource for constructing text; and gives a ‘mind-map’ of how certain aspects of a media text are decoded by the text receiver. It also offers a partial representation of the elusive, intermediate ‘deverbalized’ stage of translation (Lederer 1987), where the sense of the source text is held in the mind before it is transferred to the target language.
