40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure involving solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry {{has been developed}} for the determination of nine high-intensity sweeteners authorised in the EU; acesulfame-K (ACS-K), aspartame (ASP), alitame (ALI), cyclamate (CYC), dulcin (DUL), neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC), neotame (NEO), saccharin (SAC) and sucralose (SCL) {{in a variety of}} food samples (i. e. beverages, dairy and fish products). After extraction with a buffer composed of formic acid and N,N-diisopropylethylamine at pH  4. 5 in ultrasonic bath, extracts were cleaned up using Strata-X 33  μm Polymeric SPE column. The analytes were separated in gradient elution mode on C 18 column and detected by mass spectrometer working with an electrospray source in negative ion mode. To confirm that analytical method is suitable for its intended use, several validation parameters, such as linearity, limits of detection and quantification, trueness and repeatibilty were evaluated. Calibration curves were linear within a studied range of concentrations (r 2 [*]≥[*] 0. 999) for six investigated sweeteners (CYC, ASP, ALI, DUL, NHDC, NEO). Three compounds (ACS-K, SAC, SCL) gave non-linear response in the investigated concentration range. The method detection limits (corresponding to signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 3) were below 0. 25  μg mL− 1 (μg g− 1), whereas the method quantitation limits (corresponding to S/N ratio of 10) were below 2. 5  μg mL− 1 (μg g− 1). The recoveries at the tested concentrations (50 %, 100 % and 125 % of <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>dose)</b> for all sweeteners were in the range of 84. 2 [*]÷[*] 106. 7 %, with relative standard deviations < 10 % regardless of the type of sample matrix (i. e. beverage, yoghurt, fish product) and the spiking level. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of the nine sweeteners in drinks, yoghurts and fish products. The procedure described here is simple, accurate and precise and is suitable for routine quality control analysis of foodstuffs...|$|E
40|$|A {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis (CZE) method, optimised chemometrically, {{underwent a}} complete in-house validation protocol for the qualification and quantification of sucralose in various foodstuffs. Separation from matrix components was obtained in a dinitrobenzoic acid (3 mM) / sodium hydroxide (20 mM) background electrolyte with a pH of 12. 1, a potential of 0. 11 kV cm- 1 and {{a temperature of}} 22 °C. Detection was achieved at 238 nm by indirect UV. Screening, optimisation and robustness testing were all carried out {{with the aid of}} experimental design. Using standard addition calibration, the CZE method has been applied to still, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, yoghurts and hard boiled candy. The method allows the detection of sucralose at > 30 mg kg- 1, with a linearity range of 50 ¿ 500 mg kg- 1, making it suitable for implementation of the recently amended ¿Sweeteners for use in Foodstuffs¿ Directive [1], which set <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>doses</b> of sucralose for many foodstuffs, most ranging from 200 mg kg- 1 to 450 mg kg- 1.

40|$|Aberration-corrected {{scanning}} {{transmission electron microscopes}} (STEMs) can now produce electron probes {{as small}} as 1 {angstrom} at 60 keV. This level of performance allows individual light atoms to be imaged in various novel materials including graphene, monolayer boron nitride, and carbon nanotubes. Operation at 60 keV avoids direct knock-on damage in such materials, but some radiation damage often remains, and limits the <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> electron <b>dose.</b> Elemental identification by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is then usefully supplemented by annular dark-field (ADF) imaging, for which the signal is much larger and the spatial resolution significantly better. Because of its strong dependence on the atomic number Z, ADF {{can be used to}} identify the chemical type of individual atoms, both heavy and light. We review the instrumental requirements for atomic resolution imaging at 60 keV and lower energies, and we illustrate the kinds of studies that have now become possible by ADF images of graphene, monolayer BN, and single-wall carbon nanotubes, and by ADF images and EEL spectra of carbon nanotubes containing nanopods filled with single atoms of Er.
