5|$|One of the {{enduring}} {{symbols of the}} landing of the Pilgrims is Plymouth Rock, a large granodiorite boulder that was near their landing site at Plymouth. However, none of the contemporary accounts of the actual landing <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing. The Pilgrims chose the site for their landing, not for the rock, but for a small brook nearby that {{was a source of}} fresh water and fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication. There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> direct identification problematic. While Pozdniakov {{has not been able to}} assign any phonetic values with any certainty, statistical results do place constraints on which values are possible.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six claims are discounted as no Axis losses are recorded. Other research dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn {{attention to the fact that}} 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy all records in the first week of May 1945. This <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E

25|$|The Five Magical Materials {{are used}} to forge {{artifacts}} and weapons. Each material {{is associated with a}} type of Exalted, as well as one of the castes of Alchemical Exalted, who are partially constructed from that material.

This resonance <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> item that is both constructed from one of the magical materials and attuned to an Exalt's anima preternaturally deft and sure in that Exalt's hands. It also gives the Exalt access to the powers of any hearthstone mounted on the item.|$|E
25|$|There {{were once}} a king and queen, rulers of an unnamed city, who had three daughters of {{conspicuous}} beauty. The youngest and most beautiful was Psyche, whose admirers, neglecting the proper worship of the love goddess Venus, instead prayed and made offerings to her. It was rumored {{that she was the}} second coming of Venus, or the daughter of Venus from an unseemly union between the goddess and a mortal. Venus is offended, and commissions Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid instead scratches himself with his own dart, which <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> living thing {{fall in love with the}} first thing it sees. As soon as Cupid scratches himself he falls deeply in love with Psyche and disobeys his mother's order to make Psyche fall in love with something hideous.|$|E

25|$|The Inuit {{languages}} are a fairly closely linked set of languages {{which can be}} broken up using a number of different criteria. Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Igloolik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme {{is not the only one}} used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.|$|E
25|$|A District Court or Magistrate's Court may, {{within ten}} {{days from the}} time of any judgment, {{sentence}} or order passed or made, state a case on any question of law arising in the proceedings for the High Court's consideration any question of law arising in the proceedings either with or without a written application from a party to the proceedings. A subordinate court may refuse to state a case for the High Court if it is of the opinion that the application for it is frivolous, except if the application is made by the Public Prosecutor. If a subordinate court refuses to state a case, an applicant may apply to the High Court for an order to compel the subordinate court to do so. The High Court hears and determines the questions of law arising on cases stated, then either affirms, amends or reverses the subordinate court's decision on the matter, or <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> other order that it sees fit.|$|E
25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. Estragon awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> attempt to move.|$|E

25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) {{and have an}} antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E
