5|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} large mammals {{is found in}} the three National Parks, which are designated conservation areas. Akagera contains typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants, while Volcanoes is home to an estimated one-third of the worldwide <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> population. Nyungwe Forest boasts thirteen primate species including chimpanzees and Ruwenzori colobus arboreal monkeys; the Ruwenzori colobus move in groups of up to 400 individuals, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa. Rwanda's population of lions was destroyed {{in the aftermath of the}} genocide of 1994, as national parks were turned into camps for displaced people and remaining animals were poisoned by cattle herders. In June 2015, two South African parks donated seven lions to Akagera National Park, reestablishing a lion population in Rwanda. The lions were held initially in a fenced off area of the park, and then collared and released into the wild a month later.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{service sector}} {{suffered}} during the late-2000s recession as bank lending, foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; the gorillas attract thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern gorilla}} is more darkly {{coloured}} than the western gorilla, with the <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> being the darkest of all. The <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{also has the}} thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forests are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> are an {{endangered}} species, {{with an estimated}} total population of about 650 individuals. There are no <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> in captivity.

25|$|George Schaller {{began his}} 20-month {{observation}} of the mountain gorillas in 1959, subsequently publishing two books: The <b>Mountain</b> <b>Gorilla</b> and The Year of the Gorilla. Little was known {{about the life of}} the <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> before his research, which described its social organization, life history, and ecology. Following Schaller, Dian Fossey began what would become an 18-year study in 1967. Fossey made new observations, completed the first accurate census, and established active conservation practices, such as anti-poaching patrols. The Digit Fund, which Dian Fossey started, continued her work and was later renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. The Fund's Karisoke Research Center monitors and protects the mountain gorillas of the Virungas. Close monitoring and research of the Bwindi mountain gorillas began in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|With {{a similar}} genetic makeup to humans and an immune {{system that has}} not evolved to cope with human disease, this poses a serious {{conservation}} threat.

40|$|Abstract A {{survey in}} 1994 {{examined}} intestinal helminths and bacterial flora of <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Ugan-da. Parasites and bacteria were identified to genus in the feces of {{two groups of}} tourist-habituated and one group of non-tourist-habituated <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Eggs were identified as those of an anoplocephalid cestode, and nematode eggs representative of the genera: Trichuris, Ascaris, Oesophagostomum, Strongyloides, and Tricho-strongylus. This is the first report of Ascaris lumbrico-ides-like eggs in <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Fecal samples (n= 76) from all groups contained helminth eggs, with strongyle eggs and anoplocephalid eggs being the most common. Salmonella and Campylobacter were found in both gorilla groups. Regular long-term non-invasive fecal monitoring of the populations of <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> {{is essential for the}} prevention and identification of po-tential health threats by intestinal parasites and bacteria in this highly endangered subspecies...|$|R

25|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{is highly}} social, {{and lives in}} {{relatively}} stable, cohesive groups held together by long-term bonds between adult males and females. Relationships among females are relatively weak. These groups are nonterritorial; the silverback generally defends his group rather than his territory. In the Virunga mountain gorillas, {{the average length of}} tenure for a dominant silverback is 4.7 years.|$|E
25|$|Conservation {{efforts have}} led to an {{increase}} in overall population of the <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Virungas and at Bwindi. The overall population is now believed to be at least 880 individuals. Three more â€“ infants who suffered a traumatic poaching experience, injuries from snares, and/or losing their mothers in brutal killings â€“ are currently in care of the Senkwekwe Centre orphanage in the DR of Congo.|$|E
25|$|Disease: Despite the {{protection}} garnered from being located in national parks, the <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> {{is also at}} risk from people of a more well-meaning nature. Groups subjected to regular visits from tourists and locals are at a continued risk of disease cross-transmission (Lilly et al., 2002) â€“ this is in spite of attempts to enforce a rule that humans and gorillas be separated by a distance of 7 metres at all times to prevent this.|$|E
40|$|Minerals are {{critical}} to an individualâ€™s health and fitness, and yet {{little is known about}} mineral nutrition and requirements in free-ranging primates. We estimated the mineral content of foods consumed by <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda. <b>Mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> acquire the majority of their minerals from herbaceous leaves, which constitute the bulk of their diet. However, less commonly eaten foods were sometimes found to be higher in specific minerals, suggesting their potential importance. A principal component analysis demonstrated little correlation among minerals in food items, which further suggests that <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> might increase dietary diversity to obtain a full complement of minerals in their diet. Future work is needed to examine the bioavailability of minerals to <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> in order to better understand their intake in relation to estimated needs and the consequences of suboptimal mineral balance in gorilla foods...|$|R

25|$|Females may {{fight for}} social access to males and a male may intervene. Male gorillas have weak social bonds, {{particularly}} in multiple-male groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong competition for mates. Males in all-male groups, though, {{tend to have}} friendly interactions and socialise through play, grooming, and staying together, and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interactions. Severe aggression is rare in stable groups, but when two <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> groups meet, the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death, using their canines to cause deep, gaping injuries.|$|E

25|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> (Gorilla beringei beringei) {{is one of}} the two {{subspecies}} of {{the eastern}} gorilla. There are two populations. One is found in the Virunga volcanic mountains of Central Africa, within three National Parks: Mgahinga, in south-west Uganda; Volcanoes, in north-west Rwanda; and Virunga in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. The other is found in Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Some primatologists consider the Bwindi population in Uganda may be a separate subspecies, though no description has been finalized. As of September 2016, the estimated number of mountain gorillas remaining is about 880.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> are {{descendants}} of ancestral monkeys and apes found in Africa and Arabia during {{the start of}} the Oligocene epoch (34-24 million years ago). The fossil record provides evidence of the hominoid primates (apes) found in east Africa about 22â€“32 million years ago. The fossil record of the area where <b>mountain</b> <b>gorillas</b> live is particularly poor and so its evolutionary history is not clear.|$|R
25|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> is diurnal, {{most active}} between 6:00a.m. and 6:00p.m. Many of these hours are spent eating, as large {{quantities}} of food are needed to sustain its massive bulk. It forages in early morning, rests during the late morning and around midday, and in the afternoon it forages again before resting at night. Each gorilla builds a nest from surrounding vegetation to sleep in, constructing a new one every evening. Only infants sleep in the same nest as their mothers. They leave their sleeping sites when the sun rises at around 6 am, except when it is cold and overcast; then they often stay longer in their nests.|$|E
25|$|Rwandan coffee {{began to}} gain {{importance}} after international taste tests pronounced {{it among the}} best in the world, and the U.S. responded with a contribution of 8 million dollars. Rwanda now earns some revenue from coffee and tea export, although it has been difficult to compete with larger coffee-producing countries. The main source of revenue, however, is tourism, mainly <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla</b> visitation. Their other parks, Nyungwe Forest (one of the last high-altitude tropical forests in the world) and Akagera National Park (a safari game park) have also become popular on the tourism circuit. The lakeside resorts of Gisenyi and Kibuye are also gaining ground.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of gorillas {{are the other}} two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has. Until recently, gorillas {{were considered to be}} a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the <b>mountain</b> <b>gorilla.</b> There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other.|$|E
