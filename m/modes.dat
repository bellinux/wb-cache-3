5|$|DotA {{offers a}} variety of game <b>modes,</b> {{selected}} by the game host {{at the beginning of the}} match. The game <b>modes</b> dictate the difficulty of the scenario, as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game <b>modes</b> can be combined, allowing more flexible options.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or {{standard}} format intended for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 <b>modes</b> of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); <b>modes</b> have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented <b>modes,</b> and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented <b>modes.</b> <b>Modes</b> are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E
5|$|Messiaen used <b>modes</b> {{he called}} <b>modes</b> of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these <b>modes</b> from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the <b>modes</b> avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E

5|$|Burnout 3 {{supports}} split-screen multiplayer {{and online}} multiplayer. Five different game <b>modes</b> {{can be played}} online in the game. Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some <b>modes</b> is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three <b>modes</b> are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player <b>modes</b> where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double Impact is about competing with each other. Party Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and their scores are compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch {{into any of the}} game's <b>modes,</b> add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game <b>modes</b> without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive <b>modes</b> from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Lichtenstein {{reproduced}} masterpieces by Cézanne, Mondrian and Picasso before embarking on the Brushstroke series in 1965. The Brushstrokes were contemporaneous with abstract painting {{that no longer}} emphasized the gestural aspect, with non-demonstrative <b>modes</b> carrying the day. Lichtenstein was identified with some such <b>modes</b> by critics and found himself linked to both Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland. Brushstrokes was the first element of the Brushstrokes series.|$|E
5|$|In various {{applications}} to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms {{the foundation for}} the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental <b>modes</b> of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental <b>modes</b> of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental <b>modes</b> of vibration of the violin string.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{difficulty}} {{levels in the}} game.

5|$|The game {{features}} two distinctive <b>modes</b> of play - {{a single}} player campaign and multiplayer matches. In both <b>modes,</b> players {{are put into}} a first-person perspective from within the cockpit of a starfighter and have full control over their craft, but the only visible part is the interface - the head-up display (HUD) - which can be customised with different colours and by what information is displayed. Outside of these <b>modes,</b> the main menu {{of the game is}} designed around the interior of a ship's quarterdeck, with various elements (mostly doors) leading to different options, such as starting a new game, configuring the game, reviewing the crafts featured in the game and various story elements, and replaying completed single player missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} several two-player <b>modes.</b> Players may race on foot through new (or altered) levels, have shoot-'em-up battles in mechs, hunt for Master Emerald shards or race in go-karts. A few {{characters}} are playable in these <b>modes,</b> {{but not in}} the main game; Tikal and Chaos from the original Sonic Adventure are playable in the treasure-hunting game, as are Amy Rose and Metal Sonic in the foot-racing levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} hosts {{a maximum}} of 16 players. The game features three standard game <b>modes</b> along with <b>modes</b> exclusive to each system: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Sabotage (exclusive to Xbox and PC), The Hunt (exclusive to PC, PS2 and GameCube), and Power-Up (exclusive to PC and PS2). Depending on the platform, players in online and offline <b>modes</b> (against bots) range from 4 to 16. The GameCube version {{does not have any}} online <b>modes,</b> while the PC version excludes the multi-screen <b>modes</b> but includes a map editor. There are 13 maps on Deathmatch plus one additional on Team Deathmatch, while 5 on Capture the Flag and 3 on Sabotage. The player can choose from among 10 different character appearances, but 99 more are available in unofficial skin packs for PC players, the most recent being 2.0. Four additional animal skins (shark, duck, bat, dog, seagull) may be downloaded. As their bodies are not realistically proportioned, new or inexperienced players may face difficulty in distinguishing the skin's exact body. Cheating in both multiplayer and singleplayer is possible, as the software does not include any anti-cheat protection.|$|E
5000|$|Imbalance: {{differences}} between the two wires in a pair can cause coupling between the common <b>mode</b> and the differential <b>mode.</b> Differential to common <b>mode</b> conversion produces common <b>mode</b> currents that can cause external interference and can produce common <b>mode</b> signals in other pairs. Common <b>mode</b> to differential <b>mode</b> conversion can produce differential <b>mode</b> signals from common <b>mode</b> interference from other pairs or external sources. Imbalance can be caused by asymmetry between the two conductors of the pair from each other and in relationship to other wires and the shield. Some sources of asymmetry are differences in conductor diameter and insulation thickness. In telephone jargon, the common <b>mode</b> is called longitudinal and the differential <b>mode</b> is called metallic.|$|R
