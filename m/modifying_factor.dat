40|$|Abstract: Demonstration of the {{feasibility}} of economic extraction is not required before Exploration Results or Mineral Resources are reported. However, the use of <b>Modifying</b> <b>Factors</b> is fundamental in demonstrating feasibility and thus in converting a Mineral Resource to a Mineral Reserves. Understanding the application of theses <b>Modifying</b> <b>Factors</b> is important to ensure the correct declaration of a Mineral Reserve. Failure to properly investigate all relevant <b>Modifying</b> <b>Factors</b> {{can lead to the}} incorrect conversion of Mineral Resources to Reserves, adding unnecessary risk to a project or even leading to premature closure of a mine. The importance of correctly applying <b>Modifying</b> <b>Factors</b> to Mineral Resources is discussed and examples provided to demonstrate the negative outcomes when <b>Modifying</b> <b>Factors</b> are incorrectly applied. Traditionally, mining engineers have looked to the more conventional Modifying Factors; such as mining, metallurgical, legal, and economic factors. However, other factors, for example, governmental, social and labour, environmental, and infrastructure factors, previously thought by some engineers to be less significant, are now recognized as key factors. The paper discusses the application of <b>Modifying</b> <b>Factors</b> and their importance in establishing {{the feasibility}} of a mining project...|$|R

Using Legendre transform, dual theory and variable change technique, we derive the explicit solutions for the power and exponential utility functions in two different periods (before and after retirement). Each solution contains a <b>modified</b> <b>factor</b> which reflects an investor's decision to hedge the volatility risk. In order to investigate the influence of the <b>modified</b> <b>factor</b> on the optimal strategy, we analyze the property of the <b>modified</b> <b>factor.</b> The results show that the dynamic behavior of the <b>modified</b> <b>factor</b> for the power utility mainly depends on the time and the investor's risk aversion coefficient, whereas it only depends on the time in the exponential case.

50|$|Caffeine {{has been}} shown to have an {{impairing}} effect on females (but not males) in a word-list test of short-term memory. One prevailing theory which aims to explain this sex difference identifies estrogen levels in the body as an important factor relating to caffeine’s effect on memory performance As a result, the female menstrual cycle (which influences overall estrogen levels in the body) {{may play a role in}} modifying the effect of caffeine on memory. Following this theory, researchers tested females within the first 5 days of their menstrual cycle and found that caffeine had a facilitative effect on female performance on a short-term memory test. A particular finding in this study relating to male memory performance revealed that at a lower dose, caffeine had an impairing effect; but at higher doses, no impairment was shown. It is also interesting to note that differing speeds of testing (words delivered slowly or quickly) in males served as a <b>modifying</b> <b>factor</b> on the effect of caffeine: higher doses aided in recall with faster presentation of words, and lower doses aided in recall with slower presentation of words. These findings are only based on a small set of data collected from selective studies on this topic, so further research in this area would be needed to gain a more clear understanding of caffeine's differing effects on male and female short-term memory.|$|E
