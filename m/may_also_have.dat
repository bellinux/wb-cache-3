5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of sleep {{is not fully}} understood, but there is evidence it allows for metabolic waste {{to be removed from}} the brain, and may permit repair. It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a cognitive function, weakening unnecessary connections.|$|E

5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is a device that provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E

5|$|Although Charles II's anti-French Parliament {{had forced}} England to {{withdraw}} from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning from, the great Marshal Turenne. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of Sinsheim in June 1674, and Enzheim in October; he <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been present at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.|$|E
5|$|Americans exact {{movements}} {{from this}} time through early 1917 are unclear. She {{may have been in}} the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including American, was requisitioned by the , which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.|$|E
5|$|An't for is not {{may have}} {{developed}} independently from its use for am not and are not. Isn't was sometimes written as in't or en't, {{which could have}} changed into an't. An't for is not <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> filled a gap {{as an extension of}} the already-used conjugations for to be not. Jonathan Swift used an't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella (1710–13): It an't my fault, 'tis Patrick's fault; pray now don't blame Presto.|$|E
50|$|This {{military}} futuwa {{was also}} practiced by Javans, mercenary soldiers of 10th and 11th centuries in Khurasan, Persia (although they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> non-Muslim soldiers amongst them). Apparently {{it may have}} been a model for janissaries.|$|R
50|$|During his tenure, the Bristol Old Vic company {{doubled in}} size and {{undertook}} a number of foreign tours. In the early 1970s, May supervised architect Peter Moro's redesign of the Theatre Royal, the Bristol Old Vic's home. This involved replacing the entrance and adding a 150-seat studio space. <b>May</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the Theatre Royal's eighteenth-century raked stage replaced by a flat scenic stage.|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} is commonly found worldwide. In Indonesia, {{the prevalence of}} H. pylori {{infection is}} 22. 1 %. The bacteria are responsible for gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> a role in functional dyspepsia. Diagnostic approach consists of noninvasive and invasive examinations. One of the invasive strategy is upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy and gastric mucosa biopsy...|$|R
5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
