40|$|International audienceNew {{high-quality}} multibeam and high-resolution seismic data reveal new {{observations on}} sedimenttransfer and distribution and margin morphometrics in the uppermost slope of Northeastern LittleBahama Bank between 20 and 300 m water depth. The echofacies/backscatter facies show an alongslopesediment distribution forming successive strips. The {{upper part of}} the uppermost slope corresponds tothe alternation of several submerged coral terraces and escarpments that could be related to LateQuaternary sea-level variations. The terraces could either be related to periods of stagnating sea-level orslow-down in sea-level change and therefore increased erosion by waves, or periods of accelerated sealevelrise since the Last Glacial Maximum. Terraces could therefore be related to coral construction anddrowing. The medium part corresponds to the <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpment,</b> a steep cemented area. The lowerpart of the uppermost slope shows a discontinuous Holocene sediment wedge with varying thicknessbetween 0 and 35 m. It is separated from the upper part by a zone of well-cemented seafloor associatedwith the <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpment.</b> Passing cold fronts result in sediment export caused by density cascading. The associated sediment fall-out and convective sedimentation can generate density currents that formthis wedge and eventually flow through linear structures on the upper slope. The survey reveals thepresence of recently active channels that extend over the entire uppermost slope and interrupt thewedge. The channels connect shallow tidal channels to submarine valleys connected to the proximal partof canyons. They directly feed the canyons with platform-derived sediment forming low-densityturbidity currents and could supply the deepest part of the system with coarse-grained sedimentdirectly exported from the carbonate platform...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMost shields of the {{tropical}} belt show extended lateritic landform relicts, which result fromconjugated chemical weathering and mechanical erosion processes over the Cenozoic. After DeccanTraps extrusion ca. 65 m. y. ago, Peninsular India has been shaped by successive periods of lateriticweathering and erosion {{on both sides of}} the Western Ghats escarpment (WGE), which separates acoastal lowland from a highland plateau. The weathering periods are documented from 40 Ar/ 39 Ardating of K-Mn oxides (cryptomelane, Kx Mn 8 -xIV MnxIII O 16, nH 2 O) formed in Mn ore deposits and Fe-Mn lateritic weathering profiles, which are developed from Archean supracrustal rocks and exposedon stepped remnants of paleolandsurfaces on either side of the escarpment. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar agesobtained document three major weathering periods [1], ca. 53 - 45 Ma both in the highland and thelowland, ca. 37 - 24 Ma only in the highland [2], and ca. 24 - 19 Ma only in the lowland [3]. These ages’series document evolving geomorphic and climatic patterns on either side of the WGE over theCenozoic. The intense lateritic weathering at 53 - 45 Ma and 37 - 24 Ma reflect the Early Eocene optimum and theonset of Asian monsoon regimes, when the peninsula drifted across the equatorial belt. Synchronousearly Eocene weathering {{on both sides of the}} WGE and the preservation of laterites as old as 47 Maon its piedmont attests to the stabilization of this <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpment</b> before that time, and furtherdocuments a slow denudation of the lowland since then [3]. The ages series also indicate that thehighland landsurfaces were mostly dissected after ca. 24 Ma, while little incision affected thelowland after ca. 19 Ma. Finally, the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages document a divergent erosion and weatheringhistory on either side of the escarpment suggesting a dual climatic regime across this topographicbarrier after the Eocene climatic optimum.

40|$|International audienceRich in paleolandforms, the {{northern}} Brazilian “Nordeste” offers unique opportunities to reconstruct its history by morphostratigraphic methods, to obtain reliable timings {{and rates of}} morphotectonic evolution as well as depths of denudation, and to constrain available models of passive margins. Its relief reflects a complex geological history in which the most significant events are the Early Cretaceous rifting, followed by unequal post-rift subsidence, transform oceanic opening (Aptian-Albian), and formation of the margin, with differentiated evolution of compartments inherited from rifting and break-up patterns. On the basis of morphostructural data and of published stratigraphic and thermochronometric results, we propose a reconstruction of its evolution, illustrated {{by a series of}} sketch block-diagrammes, and an evaluation of the uplift and erosion values and rates. Through an analysis of the roles of tectono-eustatic controls and morphotectonic-climatic couplings, it offers new insights on the influence of superposed structural legacies in the geomorphic development and lateral variations of <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpments.</b> From our observations, northeastern Brazil appears as an ideal place for calibrating results of low temperature thermochronometry and for developing new conceptual models of morphotectonic evolution of passive margins and marginal scarps...|$|R
40|$|The {{minority}} Tonga Community of the Great Zambezi River Basin (Basilwizi) in Binga District of north-western Zimbabwe {{suffer a}} double tragedy which threatens their livelihoods. First they were forcibly {{removed from the}} resource-rich flood plain of the Zambezi River to the dry, <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpments</b> of the same river to facilitate {{the construction of the}} Kariba Dam in the late 1950 s. The same community is now suffering from the vicissitudes of climate change and variability which have rendered their environment even drier and less productive. In spite of this, and with little outside assistance, this subsistence, semi-pastoral community seems determined to prevail. This study assesses the relationship between climate change and environmental change in the context of Tonga minority rural community development. Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect qualitative data from Tonga elders and other key informants in the district. Direct observations were used to identify in-situ environmental changes and coping strategies used to ameliorate the effects of climate change and variability. Results show that although the Tonga community is getting some assistance from NGOs and Central Government, the assistance is not sustainable partly because it doesnâ€™t incorporate Tonga traditional knowledge systems which have been the bedrock of Tonga Community resilience for generations. This study posits that for meaningful climate-compatible development to take place in Binga, a community derived development â€˜basket of prioritiesâ€™ identified be used as a basis for sustainable community development. An IDIL-PECF model is thus suggested to help the Tonga community cope with climate change impacts more sustainably...|$|R
40|$|Previously unreported stratigraphic-structural {{features}} {{have been}} identified during a geological mapping project (1 : 10. 000 scale) in the southernmost part of the Amelia-Narni Range (Central Apennines, Italy). The study area exhibits a Meso-Cenozoic succession of the Umbria-Marche-Sabina type, with a Jurassic structural high at Mt. Cosce, flanked {{to the west and}} north by basins. While the footwall-block top condensed deposits are not preserved due to tectonics and modern erosion, the <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpments</b> are observed locally. These are marked by the onlap of basin-fill deposits, by sparse pockets of fossiliferous condensed deposits unconformably resting on the Early Jurassic substrate (Calcare Massiccio) (epiescarpment deposits), and by a peculiar diagenetic feature (silicification) at the contacts between the shallow water Calcare Massiccio Fm. and the silica-rich basinal lithologies. The silicification process also affects the huge C. Massiccio olistoliths (up to 1 km longer axis; Mt. Mandrione) embedded in the basinal successions flanking the structural high. The main stratigraphic feature discovered in this area is a sedimentary breccia (Mt. Cosce Breccia) resting through an angular unconformity on the footwall-block C. Massiccio. The breccia is a chaotic deposit with clasts of C. Massiccio, of Jurassic basinal formations and of condensed pelagites, also with white pebbly mudstones bearing calpionellids and radiolarians (Maiolica Fm.). The lack of lithoclasts younger than the earliest Cretaceous, the absence of calpionellids, and the presence of Hedbergella sp. in the matrix all suggest an Hauterivian-Barremian age for the deposit. Field relationships and geometries suggest that the breccia is a syntectonic deposit, marking an Early Cretaceous rejuvenation of the western margin of the Jurassic Mt. Cosce High. During the Miocene shortening, the Mt. Cosce horst-block was dissected by the Narni Thrust, becoming a part of its hangingwall, while the N-dipping Jurassic paleoescarpment acted as NE-striking lateral ramp. The NE-dipping forelimb of the thrust overrides an overturned footwall syncline with a thin Jurassic basinal succession (Configni-Vasciano). Our cross-sections suggest a modest shortening (few 100 ’s of metres), unlike previous interpretations (layer-cake models) where larger displacements were implied. The C. Massiccio olistoliths could locally develop shear contacts with the embedding units, due to the contrasting mechanical behavior of the two lithologies when subjected to folding. Last, Pliocene extensional faults apparently exploited the strikes of the rotated pre-orogenic margins...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for an extensional {{phase in}} the Early Cretaceous was {{detected}} in the western sector of Central Apennines during a geological mapping project (1 : 10, 000 scale) in the Narni Ridge, at Mt Cosce (~ 100 km N of Rome). A pelagic succession of the Umbria-Marche-Sabina type overlies shallow-water carbonates (Calcare Massiccio Fm., Hettangian). Jurassic sedimentation was controlled by the local architecture of the W-Tethyan rift, which dismembered the vast Calcare Massiccio platform. While tectonic subsidence forced the drowning of hangingwall-block carbonate factories around the Hettangian/Sinemurian boundary, followed by deeper marine sedimentation, benthic carbonate production survived on horsts until the early Pliensbachian, when they became sites of condensed pelagic deposition. From the Pliensbachian to Early Cretaceous, basin-fill deposits onlapped and eventually buried the inactive <b>marginal</b> <b>escarpments</b> of structural highs. A Jurassic structural high corresponds to Mt. Cosce. While its top and condensed succession are not exposed due to orogenic deformation and modern erosion, its margins are locally preserved, marked by the angular unconformity with basinal units and the diagenetic modification (silicification) of the C. Massiccio. One arresting feature at Mt. Cosce is a sedimentary breccia (Mt. Cosce Breccia), forming sparse to laterally continuous outcrops, which rests unconformably on the horst-block C. Massiccio. The polygenic breccia is chaotic, and displays: I) heterometric clasts made of rocks not younger than the Early Cretaceous, set in a greenish matrix; II) white pebbly mudstones, with radiolarian- and calpionellid-rich (Maiolica Fm.) elements. The lithoclasts were clearly fed locally, and represent formations from the C. Massiccio to the Jurassic basinal succession, as well as various Jurassic condensed facies. The youngest age detected within clasts, the absence of calpionellids and the occurrence of Hedbergella sp. in the matrix, suggest an Hauterivian-Barremian age for the breccia. The unconformity and breccia indicate in our interpretation an episode of reactivation of an Early Jurassic fault, and exhumation of a paleoescarpment tract that had been buried by {{the lower part of}} the Maiolica Fm. (with calpionellids). A purely gravitative cause must be ruled out based on the geometries and composition of the breccia: several clasts represent pre-Cretaceous units, like Middle/Late Jurassic radiolarian cherts. Their presence can only be explained by inferring that they found themselves topographically uplifted with respect to the Cretaceous basin. In our interpretation the clasts were fed from the exhumed vestiges of the Middle/Late Jurassic onlap wedge, including the peritidal substrate and the former epi-escarpment deposits (condensed facies), as a product of escarpment rejuvenation, erosion, and displacement along an Early Cretaceous fault. A non-tectonic interpretation would imply deep (100 ’s of m) erosion down to the Jurassic part of the basin-fill sequence along submarine canyons, for which no evidence whatsoever exists in the area. While the breccia now occupies the eastern slopes of Mt. Cosce, undoing the Neogene thrusting-related deformation (Mt. Cosce is part of the hangingwall anticline of the Narni Thrust) indicates it must in fact document a former W-facing margin as the Mesozoic paleoescarpment was rotated due to folding. Last, Quaternary extensional faults further dissected the folded and thrusted rocks embedding the Jurassic rift...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A new {{perspective}} on the geology of the FalklandlMalvinas Plateau (South Atlantic) is derived from a detailed synthesis of 14, 000 km of mainly unpublished single-channel and multichannel seismic data, aided by red~-haul descrip~ons and DSDP data. The Plateau is a foundered co~plex of continental blocks that were differentiaUy rifted during {{the opening of the}} South Atlantic in the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. Up to 7 km of synrift, transitional, and hemipelagic sediments have been deposited since the Middle Jurassic, largely under the control of a northern marginal fracture ridge. Three major structural lineations outline basement geometry. They are: 1. a NE-SW tectonic trend marking {{the eastern edge of the}} Plateau; 2. the Falkland <b>Escarpment</b> <b>marginal</b> fracture ridge to the north and nearby grabens that are parallel or subparallel to the approximately E-W Falkland Fracture Zone; and 3. the western edge of the Maurice Ewing Bank running NW-SE that is related to extensive rifting and volcanic activity in the central Falkland Basin. The complicated geometries of these structural trends are related to triple-Junction tectonics when the South American, African, and Antarctic blocks moved apart in the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous. We estimate that the Plateau had been lengthened by at least 400 km in an east-west direction, before the initiation of drift at about anomaly MlO time. From the acoustic stratigraphy we have defined four widespread depositional sequences. Three of these have been sampled by DSD...|$|R
