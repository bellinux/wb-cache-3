Among the technologies under consideration for these concepts are advanced proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), alternative fuels and fuel processing, and fuel storage. A multidisciplinary effort is underway at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop and evaluate concepts for revolutionary, nontraditional fuel cell power and propulsion systems for aircraft applications. As part of this effort, system studies are being conducted to identify concepts with high payoff potential and associated technology areas for further development. To support this effort, a suite of component models was developed to estimate the mass, volume, and performance for a given system architecture. These models include a hydrogen-air PEM fuel cell; an SOFC; balance-of-plant components (compressor, humidifier, separator, and heat exchangers); compressed gas, cryogenic, and liquid fuel storage tanks; and gas turbine/generator models for hybrid system applications.

40|$|There {{are several}} medical {{conditions}} that require intravenous (IV) fluids. Limitations of <b>mass,</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>storage</b> space, shelf-life, transportation, and local resources can restrict {{the availability of}} such important fluids. These limitations are expected in long-duration space exploration missions and in remote or austere environments on Earth. Current IV fluid production requires large factory-based processes. Easy, portable, on-site production of IV fluids can eliminate these limitations. Based on experience gained in developing a device for spaceflight, a ground-use device was developed. This design uses regular drinking water that is pumped through two filters to produce, in minutes, sterile, ultrapure water that meets the stringent quality standards of the United States Pharmacopeia for Water for Injection (Total Bacteria, Conductivity, Endotoxins, Total Organic Carbon).

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} a {{conceptual}} model of sediment sources, erosion, and transport processes {{was developed and}} sediment-transport studies were conducted in the upper Yuba River watershed located in northern California. Field observations of sediment production due to <b>mass</b> wasting, channel <b>storage</b> <b>volumes,</b> and {{the relative importance of}} sediment sources, erosion, and transport processes were used to develop the conceptual model. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to spatially distribute hillslope erosion potential and channel storage throughout the study area. The GIS-based hillslope erosion-potential model illustrates that landscapes with low potential evapotranspiration, sparse vegetation, steep slopes, erodible geology and soils, and high road densities display the greatest hillslope erosion potential. Although mass wasting was observed to be the dominant hillslope erosion process, fluvial erosion of stored sediment is the primary contributor to the annual sediment yield based on model assumptions and field observations. Sediment-transport studies included development of suspended-sediment and bed-load rating relations and estimates of annual sediment discharge at two gaging stations, from October 1 to September 30 of water years (WY) 2001, 2002, and 2003. Seasonal suspended-sediment rating curves were developed using a group-average method and non-linear least-squares regression of measured data; whereas bed-load rating curves were estimated using an empirical bed-load transport model. Due to its larger drainage area, higher streamflow, and absence of man-made structure...|$|R
40|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of {{internet}} data center {{is one of}} the classical time series. It is very valuable to predict the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of a data center for the business value. However, the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series from a data center is always “dirty,” which contains the noise, missing data, and outliers, so it is necessary to extract the main trend of <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series for the future prediction processing. In this paper, we propose an irregular sampling estimation method to extract the main trend of the time series, in which the Kalman filter is used to remove the “dirty” data; then the cubic spline interpolation and average method are used to reconstruct the main trend.

40|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>storage</b> {{systems for}} {{computers}} are {{the solution to}} economic <b>storage</b> of vast <b>volumes</b> of data. These systems evolved from the traditional tape libraries manned by operating personnel and the automation of the storage and retrieval function has led to significant improvement in performance. But in contrast to traditional computer systems, little {{work has been done}} to characterize performance in terms of the design parameters. The design and performance analysis of <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> systems is complicated due to several reasons. A major reason for the complexity is the time lags that may occur in retrieving parts of the information meant for the same query. The usual queuing models used for analyzing disk performance are not directly applicable, because there is greater scope for working in parallel in <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> systems such as robotic libraries, which help mitigate these shortcomings. In this note, robotic libraries are modeled as queueing systems and explicit results related to performance are obtained. The physical model corresponds to a <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> system, where the information is stored in cassettes, which are retrieved by robots to be read using one or two read heads. The results pertain to the effect of file splitting on cassettes, and optimal configuration and control of robots that perform the retrieval and storage functions...|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} {{presents an}} assessment of the feasibility of energy <b>storage</b> via refrigerant <b>mass</b> <b>storage</b> within an absorption cycle heat pump with simulated time dependent generator heat input. The system consists of <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> with the condenser and absorber of the conventional absorption cycle heat pump to store liquid refrigerant, weak and strong solutions during the generation period, which are required for the heat pump operation during the generation off period. A time dependent <b>mass</b> and energy <b>storage</b> analysis based on mass and energy balance equations for various components of the heat pump system has been carried out to evaluate energy storage concentration and storage efficiency for combined and separate storage schemes for the weak and strong solutions. Two possible performance modes, viz constant pumping ratio or the constant flow of the strong solution from the absorber to the generator have been analysed: the latter is preferable over the former from a practical point of view. Numerical computer simulation has been made for a typical winter day in Melbourne (Australia) with the desired heating load specified. It is found that the concept of refrigerant storage within the absorption cycle heat pump is technically feasible for efficient space heating. The energy storage concentration in the condenser store is slighly higher while that in absorber store is slightly lower for the separate storage mode as compared to the combined storage. However, the combined storage has an advantage of less <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> and hence is more cost effective than separate storage and the disadvantage of limited system operation due to the decrease of solution concentrations...|$|R
