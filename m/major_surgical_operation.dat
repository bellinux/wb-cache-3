40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} select the most {{appropriate}} donor and minimize psychological and physical complications in the kidney donors, it is of high importance to prepare the donor meticulously. The essential respective items are reviewed in this study. Materials and Methods: The available published literature and papers presented in Medline from 1983 to 2003 were reviewed. Results: One the sources of sources of kidney donation is the live donor which is mostly used in Iran. Similarly, due to long waiting lists of kidney recipients, live donor kidney transplantation have been increasingly used in developed countries. Consequently, several aspects of this issue have been considered and specific recom-mendations have been discussed; anatomy of the donor's kidney, age, ABO blood group, viral infections, weight, HLA type compatibility, psychological status, and dis-eases such as diabetes, ADPKD, and Alport syndrome should be evaluated in donation candidates.

This review considers the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of neuromuscular blockade that may be altered in the elderly. Compartment distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs may vary due to age-related changes in physiology, altering the duration of action with a need for reduced dosage (eg, aminosteroids). Other drugs (atracurium, cisatracurium) have more reliable duration of action and should perhaps be considered for use in the elderly. The range of interpatient variability that neuromuscular blocking drugs may exhibit is then considered and drugs with a narrower range, such as cisatracurium, may produce more predictable, and inherently safer, outcomes. Ultimately, appropriate neuromuscular monitoring should be used to guide the administration of muscle relaxants so that the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade postoperatively can be minimized. The reliability of various monitoring is considered. This paper concludes with a review of the various reversal agents, namely, anticholinesterase drugs and sugammadex, and the alterations in dosing of these that should be considered for the elderly patient.

The 5 -year survival rate was 36 % (39 / 107) for those with open lesions, 60 % (30 / 50) for those with closed ones, and 18 % (10 / 56) for those with lesions which could not be classified (not known) but which were probably nearly all open. The extent of handicap among these survivors was assessed by means of criteria described by Lorber; among those with open lesions (including 'not known') 84 % (41 / 49) were severely handicapped, 10 % (4 / 49) were moderately handicapped, and only 6 % (3 / 49) had no handicap; among those with closed lesions, 37 % (11 / 30) were severely handicapped, 33 % (10 / 30) were moderately handicapped, and the remaining 30 % (9 / 30) were not handicapped. Closed head lesions (encephalocele or occipital meningocele) were more often associated with severe handicap (6 / 8; 75 %) than were closed spinal lesions (5 / 22; 23 %). The children with open lesions who survived for at least 5 years spent, on average, at least 6 months in hospital during the first 5 years of their life and had, on average, at least 6 <b>major</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b> In comparison, those with closed lesions spent one-third less time in hospital, and had fewer than half as many operations.

The study reported herewith was undertaken for the following purposes. First, it was desired to ascertain {{whether or not there is}} any correlation among the various tests themselves. Second, it was decided to determine whether any of these tests can be used to predict thrombophlebitis in patients. Finally, the incidence and duration of hypercoagu-lability in the postoperative state was studied, as well as the incidence of hypercoagulability in con-gestive heart failure. Incident to doing these stud-ies, observations were made on the effect of vari-ation of tube size and temperature upon the clot-ting time of blood in the Lee-White test. Further, in doing the heparin tolerance test, blood was withdrawn almost simultaneously from the vein into which the heparin was injected and from a vein of the opposite arm.

40|$|Donor right {{hepatectomy}} for adult-to-adult live donor liver transplantation (ALDLT) is a <b>major</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operation</b> for {{the benefit}} of the recipient. Justification of procedure mandates knowledge of the possible physical and psychological negative effects on the donor. We prospectively and longitudinally quantified donor quality of life using generic and condition-specific questionnaires up to 1 year. The generic questionnaires were the Karnofsky Performance Status scale and the Chinese (Hong Kong) version of the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Survey, which measures 8 health concepts: 4 physical components and 4 mental components. Within 1 year, 30 consecutive donors were included. These 11 male and 19 female donors (36. 7 % and 63. 3 %, respectively) had a median age of 35 years (range, 21 - 56 years). There was no donor mortality or major complications. Donor quality-of-life worsening was most significant in the first 3 postoperative months, particularly among the physical components. The physical and mental components returned to the previous levels in 6 to 12 months'time, though the Karnofsky performance scores were slightly lower at 1 year (P = 0. 011). Twenty-six (86. 7 %) donors declared that they would donate again if there were such a need and it were technically possible. It was noticed that older donors were more likely to express unwillingness to donate again.

Physical function was assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index when measuring the pain with VAS. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a 4 -grade scale. Follow-ups were made 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Results: 15 patients were treated at one or two levels. The mean patient age was 43. 1 &# 177; 9. 2 years.

In March 1952 it was decided that the Social Security Hospital in Poznań in Garbary Street would be transformed into one intended for oncological medical services. By the end of 1953 three wards (surgery, gynaecology and general) with a total of 100 beds were set up. Dr Stefan Skowroński was appointed the first head of the Centre (1953 – 1975), followed by Professor Cezary Ramlau (1975 – 1989), Dr. Alexander Górny (1989 – 1995) and since 1995 Associate Professor Julian Malicki. In March 1975 {{as a consequence of the}} administrative reform in Poland the additional aim of the Centre was to integrate and develop oncological medical services over the whole region comprising the following voyevodships: Poznań, Kalisz, Konin, Leszno and Piła. In the 1980 s the oncological hospital was again rebuilt and the number of beds enlarged to 250. In 2000 construction on a new section of the hospital was started to be completed by 2005. Over its whole past history Cancer Centre in Poznań in conjunction with the regional health services, hospitals of the Medical University and other hospitals, has been carrying out teaching at the graduate and postgraduate level as well as doing research in addition to treatment and diagnosis of cancer diseases. At present at the Poznań Cancer Centre with its 7 hospital wards such as Oncological Surgery I and II, General Radiotherapy I and II, Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy and Gynaecological Oncology as well as Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, a total of 11. 000 patients are treated, 120. 000 patients are seen in consulting rooms, 4. 000 patients are treated by radiation, 3. 500 <b>major</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> and 1. 600 one-day smaller surgeries are performed annually...|$|R

The patient had previously received two <b>major</b> abdominal <b>surgical</b> <b>operations,</b> and had an unfortunate marital history. She developed symptoms of a distressing ”infestation by numerous tiny worms”, creping on the skin everywhere in the body. Creeping worms were also felt in the abdomen and she stated that her abdominal distension was due to an infestation of worms. She felt itching on the skin by worm-bite. She became irritable, sleepless, and at last she attempted suicide from her depressive mood. Beside the chief complaint concerning her skin, she also had a bizarre cenesthetic hypocondriacal symptoms in her abdomen. She stated that the suture ligature of the intestine from her previous operation had been cut off by the injection of sedatives to subside her irratability, and therefore ingested foods were accumulating in her abdomen, causing distressing abdominal distension. These symptoms persisted and resisted pharmacotherapy. This case is thought to be a chronic tactile hallucinosis, combined with ”cenesthopathia”. The problem of nosology was discussed, including latent syphilis infection, late schizophrenia, presenile depression, chronic organic cerebral disease, and neurotic state...|$|R
