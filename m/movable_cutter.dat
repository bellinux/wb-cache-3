40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to design the {{sampling}} method for collection of phytophilous macroinvertebrates associated with submersed parts of hard emergent littoral vegetation in still waters, which will join technical sampler unpretentiousness, sampling simplicity and maximal quantitative accuracy. For these purposes, we developed a modified GerkingÂ´s frame box sampler with <b>movable</b> <b>cutter</b> for sampling of animals in the littoral macrophyte beds and a new type of core sampler for collection of animals inhabiting the root zone of emergent plant beds. Both sampling devices are suitable for studies targeted on macroinvertebrates monitoring. The comparative sampling using frame box sampler and benthos handnet was performed in the littoral of three carp ponds. The sampling procedure utilizing the frame sampler was more labour demanding however it enabled significantly (P < 0. 05) more efficient collection of slowly moving or sedentary animals...|$|E

Processing tool blade tines arranged in a staggered structure. The tool is {{a gap in the}} working conditions. Install the tool in the tool axis rotation is strip knives. Friction surface of the tool can be used strip surface design class. Rotating shaft mounted knives role is to bring people powder particles processing zones. After extrusion and promote the formation of frustration legitimate work. Friction surface knives biggest advantage is the use of a long time. Fixed on a movable carriage mounted flat-screen multi-tooth cutter blade. Fixedly mounted on a <b>movable</b> tool holder. <b>Cutter</b> with carbide knife block. Knives replaceable assembly structure can be used. Mobile holder for the tool replacement and gap adjustment...|$|R
