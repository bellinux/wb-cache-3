Tensiomyography assesses muscle mechanical response based on radial muscle belly displacement induced by the single electrical stimulus. It is most commonly performed using TMG S1 system.

50|$|Cantilever {{enhanced}} photoacoustic spectroscopy {{enables the}} detection of small amount of trace gases which is vital in many applications. Photoacoustic spectroscopy {{is one of the}} most sensitive optical detection schemes. It is based on detecting a gas specific acoustic wave generated that originates from the absorption of light in the medium. The sensitivity of the traditional membrane microphones is limited by electrical noise and the nonlinearity of the displacement of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> at high optical power levels. Conventional membrane microphones can be replaced with optically measured micromechanical cantilevers to enhance sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{resonance}} technology enables measurement {{within a}} small cavity, the sensors therefore {{tend to be}} typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor.</b> For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity {{and the fact that}} it does not require re-calibrating once installed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technology}} for a pedometer includes a <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> and software to count steps. Early forms used a mechanical switch to detect steps {{together with a}} simple counter. If one shakes these devices, one hears a lead ball sliding back and forth, or a pendulum striking stops as it swings. Today advanced step counters rely on MEMS inertial sensors and sophisticated software to detect steps. These MEMS sensors have either 1-, 2- or 3-axis detection of acceleration. The use of MEMS inertial sensors permits more accurate detection of steps and fewer false positives. The software technology used to interpret {{the output of the}} inertial sensor and [...] "make sense of accurate steps" [...] varies widely. The problem is {{compounded by the fact that}} in modern day-to-day life, such step-counters are expected to count accurately on locations where users frequently carry their devices (attached to the belt, shirt/pants pocket, hand bag, backpack).|$|E
5000|$|The Ladybird is {{a roughly}} {{hemispherical}} robot which is 40 cm wide, 25 cm tall and 60 cm long. It has a metal baseplate {{on which the}} electronics lie, which are enclosed by a red shell with black spots. This shell was originally varnished papier-mâché, but due to deterioration, the Ladybird now has a plastic shell mimicking the original one. The black spots themselves are buttons, {{and the top of}} the shell also has a small sliding vane. The robot has two red [...] "eyes" [...] (which can light up but can't see), three photosensors (which can detect light) and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> in the front to detect collisions with obstacles. It also contains an electromechanical buzzer to give audible feedback. Due to the technical difficulties of the time, Muszka couldn't include a battery, and so the Ladybird gets the required electricity (220 V alternating current from the mains) using an umbilical power cable. The machine has three rubber wheels, two fixed wheels in front which are driven by automobile windscreen wiper motors, and a free-rotating caster wheel at the back. By design, the Ladybird is incapable of going in reverse.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the optical ring {{resonator}} and how it [...] "filters" [...] certain wavelengths of light passing through, it is possible to create high-order optical filters by cascading many optical ring resonators in series. This would allow for [...] "small size, low losses, and integrability into existing optical networks." [...] Additionally, since the resonance wavelengths can be changed by simply increasing or decreasing the radius of each ring, the filters can be considered tunable. This basic property can be used to create a sort of <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor.</b> If an optical fiber experiences mechanical strain, the dimensions of the fiber will be altered, thus resulting in a change in the resonant wavelength of light emitted. This can be used to monitor fibers or waveguides for changes in their dimensions.The tuning process can be effected also by a change of refractive index using various means including thermo-optic, electro-optic [...] or all-optical [...] effects. Electro-optic and all-optical tuning is faster than thermal and mechanical means, and hence find various applications including in optical communication. Optical modulators with a high-Q microring are reported to yield outstandingly small power of modulation at a speed of > 50 Gbit/s at cost of a tuning power to match wavelength of the light source. A ring modulator placed in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity was reported to eliminate the tuning power by automatic matching of the laser wavelength with that of the ring modulator while maintaining high-speed ultralow-power modulation of a Si microring modulator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A year of {{data from}} sonic {{anemometer}} and <b>mechanical</b> wind <b>sensors</b> was analyzed and compared at a low-wind site. Results indicate that 15 -minute average and peak 1 -second wind speeds (u) from the sonic agree well with data de-rived from a co-located cup anemometer {{over a wide range}} of speeds. Wind direction data derived from the sonic also agree closely with those from a wind vane except for very low wind speeds. Values of standard deviation of longitudinal wind speed (u) and wind direction fluctuations () from the sonic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensors</b> agree well for times with u> 2 ms- 1 but show significant differences with lower u values. The most significant differences are associated with the stan-dard deviation of vertical wind fluctuations (w) : the co-located vertical propeller anemometer yields values increasingly less than those measured by the sonic anemometer as u decreases from 2. 5 approaching 0 ms- 1. The combination of u over-estimation and under-estimation of w from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensors</b> at low wind speeds causes considerable under-estimation of the standard deviation of vertical wind angle fluctuations (), an indicator of vertical dispersion. Calcula-tions of from sonic anemometer measurements are typically 5 ° to 10 ° greater than from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensors</b> when the <b>mechanical</b> instruments indicate that < 5 ° or so. The errors with the propeller anemometer, cup anemometer and wind vane, caused by their inability to respond to higher frequency (smaller scale) turbulent fluctuations, can therefore lead to large (factors of 2 to 10 or more) errors in both the vertical and horizontal dispersion during stable conditions with light winds. The sonic anemometer clearly provides more accurate and reliable wind data than the <b>mechanical</b> wind <b>sensor</b> with u < 2. 5 m...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{industrial}} {{requirements for}} the control of an induction machine without a <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor</b> continue to be of interest, {{as evidenced by the}} most recent publications. The focus is on improvements of control without a <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensor.</b> A new method for the implementation of a sensorless indirect stator-fluxoriented control (ISFOC) of a single-phase induction motor (SPIM) drive is proposed in this paper. The proposed method of rotor speed estimation is based only on the measurement of the main and auxiliary windings stator currents and that of a reference q-axis current generated by the control algorithm. The error of the measured q-axis current from its reference value feeds the proportional plus integral controller, the output of which is the estimated slip angular frequency. Experimental results for sensorless ISFOC speed control of a SPIM drive are presented and analyzed using a dSPACE system with DS 1104 controller board based on the digital signal processor TMS 320 F 240. Digital simulation and experimental results are presented to show the improvement in performance of the proposed sensorless algorithm.
