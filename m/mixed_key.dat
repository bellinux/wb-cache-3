Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb {{the invention of the}} whiskey sour—not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valparaíso, Chile.|$|E
50|$|The term 'hybridity' {{originates}} with agriculture but {{has recently}} become very significant to Cultural Studies. Originating from the Latin hybrida, a hybrid is simply {{anything that is}} <b>mixed.</b> <b>Key</b> thinkers {{in the development of}} Hybridity Theory (HT) include Homi K. Bhabha, Stuart Hall, Gayatri Spivak, and Paul Gilroy. For Nederveen Pieterse, the concept of hybridity serves as a hermeneutical tool for interpreting the cultural dimensions of globalization. While most assessments of globalization are confined to a narrow time frame (modernity), Nederveen Pieterse considers globalization in broader anthropological terms. In this sense, he argues that globalization “belongs to a deep dynamic in which shifting civilizational centers are but the front stage of history” with ongoing intercultural traffic forming the backdrop. While globalization is often dismissed as mere westernization, Nederveen Pieterse points out that from an evolutionary perspective, such analysis is historically shallow:The evolutionary backdrop of our common origins in Africa confirms that humanity is a hybrid species. The species' subsequent “clustering” in different regions of the world has not precluded large-scale contact and population movements across and between continents (Gamble 1993). This mixed heritage is confirmed by the “cultures” identified by archaeologists which in Paleolithic and Neolithic times sprawl widely and do not coincide with the boundaries of much later times.|$|E
40|$|We propose, as a {{testable}} hypothesis, a basin-scale {{approach for}} interpreting {{the abundance of}} in situ produced cosmogenic isotopes, an approach which considers explicitly both the isotope and sediment flux through a drainage basin. Unlike most existing models, which are appropriate for evaluating in situ produced cosmogenic isotope abundance at discrete points on Earth’s surface, our model is designed for interpreting isotope abundance in sediment. Because sediment {{is a mixture of}} materials, in favourable cases derived from throughout a drainage basin, we suggest that measured isotope abundances may reflect spatially averaged rates of erosion. We investigate the assumptions and behaviour of our model and conclude that it could provide geomorphologists with a relatively simple means by which to constrain the rate of landscape evolution if a basin is in isotopic steady state and if sampled sediments are well <b>mixed.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS Keywords: denudation rate; erosion; hillslope; modelling; cosmogenic isotopes; sediment budge...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a class ordinal regression models {{in which the}} link function has scale parameters that may be estimated along with the regression parameters. One motivation {{is to provide a}} plausible model for group level categorical responses. In this case a natural class of scaled link functions is obtained by treating the group level responses as threshold averages of possible correlated latent individual level variables. We find scaled link functions also arise naturally in other circumstances. Our methodology is illustrated through environmental risk assessment data where (correlated) individual level responses and group level responses are <b>mixed.</b> <b>Key</b> words and phrases: Ordinal regression, Aggregated observations, Marginal modeling approach, Generalized likelihood inference. 1 Introduction Data in which the individual responses are ordinal are frequently modeled by a generalized linear model of the form Pr(Y i sjx i) = ae H(fi T x i Γ ff s); if s = 1; 2; : : :; [...] ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of internet, transfer of data reliably and securely {{has become one}} of the challenges. In this paper we have introduced a novel visual cryptographic technique. This method is applicable for both Bitmap Color and Grayscale images. This method uses the concept of Residual Number System (RNS) based on Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for share creation and share stacking of a given image. First, Secret image is hidden in cover image to get stego-image; a pixel (8 bit) of a Stego-image is taken and added with an eight bit key to get a cipher pixel. The algorithm used is additive mod 255. The key is generated using a pseudo random number generator and <b>Mixed</b> <b>Key</b> Generation technique. After encryption the cipher pixel is mapped into a Residue Number System of ‘n ’ Shares. These ‘n ’ Shares are stored or transmitted to the destination. The proposed approach like any other visual cryptographic approach is very secure, efficient, reliable, fast and easy to implement. Lastly, performance analysis of this visual cryptographic technique is done with respect to Histograms...|$|E
40|$|In-sample and out-of-sample Granger {{causality}} {{tests are}} applied {{to determine whether the}} real trade-weighted agricultural exchange rate helps predict monthly real prices and export sales of wheat, corn, and soybeans. An ARIMA model, alternative univariate and bivariate autoregressive models, and a restricted bivariate autoregressive model based on Hsiao's procedure are specified for each variable. Results of the causality tests are shown to be sensitive to specification choice. Forecasting performance of the models is compared and out-of-sample Granger causality is determined using univariate and bivariate models with the best (lowest mean-square forecast error) forecasting accuracy. These tests provide evidence supportive of Granger causality from the exchange rate to export sales, while the evidence on causality from the exchange rate to prices is <b>mixed.</b> <b>Key</b> words: exchange rates, Granger causality, lag length selection criteria, out-of-sample causality tests. The importance of macroeconomic-agricul-tural linkages has been evaluated empirically in recent work by, among others, Batten and Belongia (1984, 1986); Chambers and Just; and Orden (1986). While these studies employ di-verse econometric models, each supports the view that some macroeconomic variables (in particular, exchange rates) are significant de-terminants of agricultural prices and export volumes. However, a disturbing aspect of these models is their poor forecasting performance. In a recent study, Bessler and Babula explored the relationships among the Federal Reserve Board's real trade-weighted exchange rate and cash prices, export sales, and shipments of wheat from a forecasting perspective explic...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} argued that females with {{attractive}} partners should produce more sons because these sons will inherit their father’s attractiveness. Numerous field and laboratory studies have addressed this hypothesis, with inconsistent results, {{but there is}} surprisingly little theoretical work on the topic. Here, we present an extensive investigation {{of the link between}} male attractive-ness and offspring sex ratios, using evolutionary, individual-based computer simulations. In situations where sexual selection leads to the stable exaggeration of a costly male trait and a costly female preference, we find that females with attractive partners produce more sons than females with unattractive partners. This same qualitative pattern is seen {{for a wide range of}} different models, with discrete or continuous variation in the male trait, under Fisherian or good-genes sexual selection and for abrupt or gradual sex ratio adjustment. However, in all simulations, it takes a huge number of generations to evolve, sug-gesting that selection acting on sex ratio adjustment is weak. Our models ignore many potential costs and constraints associated with manipulation, which implies that selection may be weaker still in natural populations. These results may explain why published evidence for sex ratio bias in relation to male attractiveness is <b>mixed.</b> <b>Key</b> words: attractiveness, Fisherian runaway, good genes, handicap principle, individual-based simulation, sex allocation, sex ratio, sexual selection, Trivers–Willard hypothesis.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} quality of {{reporting}} in observational studies in dermatology. Data Sources: Five dermatology journals-the Archives of Dermatology, the British Journal of Dermatology, the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, and Acta Dermato-Venereologica. Study Selection: Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies published as original articles during the period January 2005 through December 2007. Studies were identified with a literature search of PubMed combining the journal title and the term epidemiological studies (free text) and by hand searching {{all of the issues}} of each journal to identify relevant articles. Data Extraction: All articles were extracted by 2 reviewers independently using standardized checklists based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations. Data Synthesis: The number and proportion of reported STROBE items were analyzed for each article. The proportion of studies with good reporting for each item was also assessed. Results: A total of 138 articles were included and analyzed. Reporting quality was very <b>mixed.</b> <b>Key</b> areas that were infrequently reported included sample size calculations (n = 10 [7 %]), missing data (n = 8 [6 %]), losses to follow-up (n = 17 [12 %]), and statistical methods (n = 19 [14 %]). Only 13 studies (9 %) explained the role of funders in the research. The quality of reporting was similar across study designs for "critical" questions with the exception of reporting of participant details, which was better reported in cohort studies (96 %) compared with cross-sectional (80 %) and case-control (70 %) studies. Conclusions: It is difficult to judge {{the quality of}} dermatological research unless it is reported well. This study has identified a clear need {{to improve the quality of}} reporting of observational studies in dermatology. We recommend that dermatology journals adopt the STROBE criteria...|$|E
