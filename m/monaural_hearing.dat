50|$|Action {{potentials}} {{originate in}} the hair cells of the cochlea and propagate to the brainstem; both the timing of these action potentials and the signal they transmit provide information to the SOC about the orientation of sound in space. The processing and propagation of action potentials is rapid, and therefore, information {{about the timing of}} the sounds that were heard, which is crucial to binaural processing, is conserved. Each eardrum moves in one dimension, and the auditory brain analyzes and compares the movements of both eardrums in order to synthesize auditory objects. This integration of information from both ears is the essence of binaural fusion.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades there has been an {{increasing}} interest in how the auditory system extracts information from dynamically varying sounds, sounds whose amplitude and/or frequency vary over time. The importance of such information has been clearly demonstrated in speech perception, sound localization, and in many basic aspects of <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing.</b> This chapter reviews recent experimental and theoretical findings that provide insights into the basic mechanisms involved in temporal processing, specifically those in-volved in monaural envelope processing. One area of interest is the possibility that the auditory system is “tuned ” for envelope periodicity, i. e., that there are filters selectively tuned to the modulation frequency of amplitude modulation (AM). A powerful and provocative theoretical account has recently been pro-posed based on this notion. New psychophysical data relevant to this issue are discussed and a psychophysically-oriented approach for analyzing physiological data on envelope processing is presented. The second area to be considered is the role of timing information, “phase locking”, in <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing.</b> Several contemporary models have proposed that fine-structure timing information in the auditory nerve is fundamental in auditory coding. We present psychophysical data on octave phase effects that can be explained qualitatively by a simple model that does not involve the use of fine-structure information.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation research is to investigate noise reduction methods for binaural hearing aids based on array and statistical signal processing and inspired by a human auditory model. In digital hearing aids, wide dynamic range compression (WDRC) is the most successful technique to deal with <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> losses. This WDRC processing is usually performed after a monaural noise reduction algorithm. When hearing losses are present in both ears, i. e., a binaural hearing loss, independent <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> aids have been shown not to be comfortable for most users, preferring a processing that involves synchronization between both hearing devices. In addition, psycho-acoustical studies have identified that under hostile environments, e. g., babble noise at very low SNR conditions, users prefer to use linear amplification rather than WDRC. In this sense, the noise reduction algorithm becomes {{an important component of}} a digital hearing aid to provide improvement in speech intelligibility and user comfort. Including a wireless link between both hearing aids offers new ways to implement more efficient methods to reduce the background noise and coordinate processing for the two ears. This approach, called binaural hearing aid, has been recently introduced in some commercial products but using very simple processing strategies. This research analyzes the existing binaural noise-reduction techniques, proposes novel perceptually-inspired methods based on blind source separation (BSS) and multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), and identifies different strategies for the real-time implementation of these methods. The proposed methods perform efficient spatial filtering, improve SNR and speech intelligibility, minimize block processing artifacts, and can be implemented in low-power architectures.

40|$|The {{effect of}} head-induced {{interaural}} time delay (ITD) and interaural level differences (ILD) on binaural speech intelligibility in noise was studied for listeners with symmetrical and asymmetrical sensorineural hearing losses. The material, recorded with a KEMAR manikin in an anechoic room, consisted of speech, presented {{from the front}} (0 °), and noise, presented at azimuths of 0 °, 30 °, and 90 °. Derived noise signals, containing either only ITD or only ILD, were generated using à computer. For both groups of subjects, speech-reception thresholds (SRT) for sentences in noise were determined as a function of: (1) noise azimuth, (2) binaural cue; and (3) an interaural difference in overall presentation level, simulating the effect of à <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> aid. Comparison of the mean results with corresponding data obtained previously from normal-hearing listeners shows that the hearing impaired have a 2. 5 dB higher SRT in noise when both speech and noise are presented from the front, and 2. 6 - 5. 1 dB less binaural gain when the noise azimuth is changed from 0 ° to 90 °. The gain due to ILD varies among the hearing-impaired listeners between O dB and normal values of 7 dB or more. It depends on the high-frequency hearing loss at the side presented with the most favorable signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The gain due to ITD is nearly normal for the symmetrically impaired (4. 2 dB, compared with 4. 7 dB for the normal hearing), but only 2. 5 dB {{in the case of}} asymmetrical impairment. When ITD is introduced in noise already containing ILD, the resulting gain is 2 - 2. 5 dB for all groups. The only marked effect of the interaural difference in overall presentation level is a reduction of the gain due to ILD when the level at the ear with the better S/N ratio is decreased. This implies that an optimal <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> aid (with a moderate gain) will hardly interfere with unmasking through ITD, while it may increase the gain due to ILD by preventing or diminishing threshold effects...|$|E

For real-world stereo audio signals of various types, our experiments indicate that SPE reliably estimates their spatial information rate. Therefore, "SPE plus PE" gives lower bitrate bounds for communicating multichannel audio signals with transparent quality. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sentence {{and text}} {{comprehension}} {{is known to}} be difficult for orally-trained individuals with hearing impairment. This study explored the comprehension of several syntactic structures that are especially difficult for them, and may lead to considerable comprehension difficulties. Ten structures derived by Wh-movement were tested, some of {{them for the first time}} in hearing-impairment: 5 types of relative-clauses, 3 types of Wh-questions, and 2 types of topicalized structures, compared with 2 types of simple sentences. Experiment 1 tested subject and object-relatives using a sentence-picture matching task. Experiment 2 tested subject-questions and object-questions using a picture-selection task. Experiment 3 tested subject- and object-relatives using comprehension questions. Experiment 4 tested subjectand object-relatives and topicalized sentences using a reading-and-paraphrasing task. The participants were 24 orally-trained Palestinian-Arabic-speaking individuals, 21 of them had mild-to-profound binaural hearing loss, and 3 had <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> loss. The participants with binaural hearing impairment, who were not sufficiently exposed to language input during the first year of life, failed to understand object-relatives, object-questions, and topicalization in SV and VS orders in both Palestinian-Arabic and Standard-Arabic. In some tasks they even had difficulty understanding subject-relatives and subject-questions. The monaurally hearing-impaired performed similarly to the controls on all tasks...|$|E
40|$|Seven <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> aid {{users and}} four {{binaural}} hearing aid users (10 to 50 years old) were administered a hearing evaluation with earphones. Measures recorded were pure tone average (PTA), {{speech reception threshold}} (SRT), and speech discrimination scores. These results were compared {{with the results of}} an evaluation conducted one or more years previously. A t test was applied to the mean score differences from initial test to retest of the aided ears versus the unaided ears to determine the stability of speech discrimination in the unaided ear of persons with a bilateral loss of hearing sensitivity. PTA and SRT decreased minimally from initial test to retest indicating good threshold stability. Speech discrimination mean scores decreased, with a larger decrease observed for the unaided ears than the aided ears of monaural and binaural subjects. However, the larger decrease was not statistically significant. Therefore the data indicated that an ear which is not stimulated by amplification, with a hearing loss of sensitivity of 50 dB HL to 80 dB HL, does not have a significant decrease of speech discrimination as compared to an aided ear with a similar loss of hearing sensitivity.

40|$|International audiencePsychoacoustic {{experimentation}} {{shows that}} formant frequency shifts can {{give rise to}} more significant changes in phonetic vowel timber than differences in overall level, bandwidth, spectral tilt, and formant amplitudes. Carlson & Granström's perceptual and computational findings suggest that, in addition to spectral representations, the human ear uses temporal information on formant periodicities ('Dominant Frequencies') in building vowel timber percepts. The availability of such temporal coding in the cat's auditory nerve fibers has been demonstrated in numerous physiological investigations undertaken during recent decades. In this paper we explore, and provide further support for, the Dominant Frequency hypothesis using KONVERT, a computational auditory model. KONVERT provides auditory excitation patterns for vowels by performing a critical-band analysis. It simulates phase locking in auditory neurons and outputs DF histograms. The modeling supports the assumption that listeners judge among vowels on the basis formant frequency differences as determined primarily by a time-based analysis. However, when instructed to judge among vowels, they can also use spectral differences such as formant bandwidth, formant amplitudes and spectral tilt. Although there has been considerable debate among psychoacousticians about the functional role of phase locking in <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing,</b> the present research suggests that detailed temporal information may nonetheless {{play a significant role}} in speech perceptio...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} horizontal directional {{hearing in}} patients with acquired severe unilateral conductive hearing loss (UCHL). All patients (n[*]=[*] 12) had been fitted with a bone conduction device (BCD) to restore bilateral hearing. The patients were tested in the unaided (monaural) and aided (binaural) hearing condition. Five listeners without hearing loss were tested as a control group while listening with a monaural plug and earmuff, or with both ears (binaural). We randomly varied stimulus presentation levels to assess whether listeners relied on the acoustic head-shadow effect (HSE) for horizontal (azimuth) localization. Moreover, to prevent sound localization {{on the basis of}} monaural spectral shape cues from head and pinna, subjects were exposed to narrow band (1 / 3 octave) noises. We demonstrate that the BCD significantly improved sound localization in 8 / 12 of the UCHL patients. Interestingly, under <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> (BCD off), we observed fairly good unaided azimuth localization performance in 4 / 12 of the patients. Our multiple regression analysis shows that all patients relied on the ambiguous HSE for localization. In contrast, acutely plugged control listeners did not employ the HSE. Our data confirm and further extend results of recent studies on the use of sound localization cues in chronic and acute monaural listening...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} human {{listeners}} to segregate two sound sources was examined by conducting an experiment when the sources are concurrently presented from different directions in the median plane. A high-pass filtered pink noise was utilized as a sound stimulus in a free-field condition and presented {{as either a}} pair of incoherent sound sources or a single-source. Subjects responded whether they perceived sound from one or two directions. Listening tests were conducted with different directions and separation angles of sound sources. These tests consisted of two sessions: a monaural session when only the right ear was made audible, and a binaural session when both ears were audible. The {{results indicated that the}} percentage of responding "two directions" for pairwise stimuli exceeded 50 % above 33. 75 deg. separation angle and reached above 70 % at 67. 5 deg. separation for both sessions. However, the perceived separation showed weak correlation to the degree of separation although it increased in the binaural session. The ability to discriminate pairwise stimuli to each of two corresponding sound sources showed high statistical significance. The difference between a <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> and binaural hearing was not statistically significant for the segregation of sound sources in the median plane...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Hearing loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} in the elderly population. Besides compromising oral communication, it directly affects social relations and prevents elderly patients from living actively in society, possibly leading to the onset of depression or other conditions. Objective To analyze the effects of unilateral adaptation of hearing aids on symptoms of depression and the social activity constraints of elderly subjects with hearing impairment. Methods The sample consisted of elderly subjects with hearing loss who did not use hearing aids. Data were collected in two phases. Initially, all participants underwent an audiological assessment and answered the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly (summarized version) and the Geriatric Depression Scale. All subjects participated in the selection and hearing aid adaptation processes and became <b>monaural</b> <b>hearing</b> aid users. After 30 days of hearing aid use, they were assessed with the same instruments. The results of the questionnaires before and after hearing aid adaptation were compared. Results The sample consisted of 13 individuals, between 60 and 90 years old (mean 72. 85 [*]±[*] 11. 05 years). Data analysis showed that there was significant improvement in social activity constraints (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and in symptoms of depression (p[*]=[*] 0. 031). Conclusion Results show that, in the sample studied, unilateral hearing aid adaptation reduced social activity constraints and depression symptoms...|$|E
