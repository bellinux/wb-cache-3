40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{involvement}} is a known complication of scrub typhus {{which range from}} mild meningitis to frank meninigoencephalitis. Aims and objectives: To study the clinical feature, laboratory parameters and response to treatment of scrub typhus meningitis/meningoencephalitis. Methods and Materials: This is a hospital based prospective observational study from North Eastern India. Diagnosis was based on clinical features and positive serological test (Weil's Felix test and IgM antibody card test). Results: 13 patients of scrub typhus with features of meningitis/meningoencephalitis were included. The mean duration of fever before presentation was 5. 61 ± 3. 08 days and 4 (30. 76 %) patients had eschar. Altered sensorium, headache, seizure and <b>meningeal</b> <b>sign</b> were present in 13 (100 %), 13 (100 %), 6 (46. 15 %) and 10 (76. 92 %) patients respectively. Mean CSF protein, glucose and Adenosine deaminase was 152. 16 ± 16. 88 mg/dl, 55. 23 ± 21. 7 mg/dl, and 16. 98 ± 7. 37 U/L respectively. Mean total count of CSF leukocyte and lymphocyte percentage was 46. 07 ± 131 cell/cumm and 98. 66 ± 3. 09 % respectively. Tablet doxycycline with or without injection azithromycin was used and that shows good response 15. 38 % of patients died {{and all of them}} had multi organ dysfunction. Conclusion: Meningoencephalitis is a common manifestation of scrub typhus and diagnosis requires high degree of clinical suspicion which if diagnosed early and specific treatment started, patients usually recover completely with few complications...|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} the laboratorycards of 200 analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) performed to evaluate acute alterations of consciousness in adult patients attended in a neurological emergency room. 61 % were men; {{the mean age}} was 46 years. The most common clinical data were infective and neurologic. The CSF was abnormal in 149 (74. 5 %) patients and the most common syndromes were: compressive (21 %), hemorrhagic (11. 5 %), "viral" (8. 5 %), septic (7. 5 %), moderate hyperglycorrachia (6. 5 %), hydroelectrolytic disturbances (5. 5 %). There were some statistically significant correlations between CSF syndromes and clinical data: septic syndrome and fever and <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs,</b> hemorrhagic syndrome and headache and <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs,</b> CSF hydroelectrolytic disturbance syndrome and seizures, severe hyperproteinorrachia and headache, fever, <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> and vomiting, moderate hyperproteinorrachia and age over 65 and male sex. We classified the abnormal results in two groups: 1 - sufficient for an immediate clinical decision; 2 - nonspecific. The former group was found in 27. 5 % of the patients and in 36. 9 % of the abnormal CSF results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since delayed {{diagnosis}} and treatment of bacterial meningitis worsens patient prognosis, clinicians have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture or to start empiric antibiotic treatment in patients suspected of having meningitis. OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision rule, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices and clinical characteristics, to determine whether empiric antibiotic treatment should be started in children with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> DESIGN: Multivariable logistic regression analysis of retrospectively collected data. Bacterial meningitis was defined as a CSF leukocyte count of more than 5 / micro L with positive bacterial culture findings from CSF or blood specimens. SETTING: Pediatric emergency department of a pediatric university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 227 children (aged 1 month to 15 years) with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The diagnostic value of adding early obtainable CSF indices to clinical characteristics to predict bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Independent predictors of bacterial meningitis from early obtainable CSF indices were the CSF polymorphonuclear leukocyte count and the CSF-blood glucose ratio. The diagnostic value (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of this CSF model was 0. 93. Application of the model together with clinical characteristics could predict early the absence of bacterial meningitis in 69 (30 %) of the 227 patients so that empiric antibiotic treatment could be safely withheld. CONCLUSION: A diagnostic decision rule that uses clinical characteristics at admission, the CSF polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and the CSF-blood glucose ratio is a useful tool for deciding whether to start empiric antibiotics in children with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{incidence}} and prognosis of acute neurologic complications in 281 children under 13 {{years of age}} with a diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis. All the patients were examined daily by {{the same group of}} neurologists, using a standardized neurological examination. Patients with signs of encephalic lesions, unsatisfactory response to antibiotics or decreased level of consciousness were submitted to brain computer tomography. The overall lethality rate was 20. 3 % and cases whose causative agent was identified presented a higher lethality rate (23. 7 %) than those in which the agent was not found. The most important neurological abnormalities were <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> (88. 3 %) followed by decreased consciousness (47. 7 %), irritability (35. 2 %), seizures (22. 4 %), fontanel bulging (20. 6 %) and cranial nerve palsy (14. 2 %). Seizures, cranial nerve palsy and the absence of <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> were related to higher rates of lethality. Diminished consciousness, seizures, subdural effusion, abscess and hydrocephalus were the most important complications, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{designed}} {{a model of}} diagnostic and therapeutic interventions applied in children with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> Using this model, we determined in a cost-utility analysis the consequences for society of different diagnostic strategies in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. METHODS: Data were used from 360 children (0. 1 - 15 years) visiting the pediatric emergency department of the Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands (1988 - 98) with <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> Model inputs included probabilities of meningitis and adverse outcome, QALYs for years lived with long-term sequelae, and costs of tests and treatments. Mean outcome measures were costs and effects of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in children suspected of bacterial meningitis, key determinants of the model outcomes, and evaluation of alternative diagnostic strategies and two vaccination programs in an analysis. RESULTS: The population comprised 99 children with bacterial meningitis (adverse outcome in 10), 36 with serious other bacterial infections, and 225 with self-limiting diseases. Key determinants were the risk of bacterial meningitis or sequelae, costs of treatment, and long-term morbidity. Minimizing lumbar punctures and empirical treatments using a diagnostic decision rule, without missing a single case of meningitis, was a dominant strategy to actual practice. Vaccination strategies of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis resulted in our model in incremental cost-utility ratios of 401, 965 Euro dollar ([symbol: see text]) /QALY and [symbol: see text] 22, 635 /QALY, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Cryptococcal {{infection}} {{is a common}} opportunistic infection among severely immunosuppressed HIV patients and is associated with high mortality. Positive cryptococcal antigenemia is an independent predictor of cryptococcal meningitis and death in patients with severe immunosuppression. We evaluated the prevalence and factors associated with cryptococcal antigenemia among patients with CD 4 counts of 100 cells/mm 3 or less in Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Screening of a targeted group of HIV patients may enable early detection of cryptococcal infection and intervention before initiating antiretroviral therapy. Factors associated with cryptococcal antigenemia may be used subsequently in resource-limited settings in screening for cryptococcal infection, and this data may also inform policy for HIV care. Methods In this cross-sectional study, HIV-infected patients aged 18 years and older with CD 4 counts of up to 100 cells/mm 3 were enrolled between December 2009 and March 2010. Data on socio-demographics, physical examinations and laboratory tests were collected. Factors associated with cryptococcal antigenemia were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results We enrolled 367 participants and the median CD 4 count was 23 (IQR 9 - 51) cells/mm 3. Sixty-nine (19 %) of the 367 participants had cryptococcal antigenemia. Twenty-four patients (6. 5 %) had cryptococcal meningitis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis and three had isolated cryptococcal antigenemia. Factors associated with cryptococcal antigenemia included: low body mass index of 15. 4 kg/m 2 or less (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 0. 5; 95 % CI 0. 3 - 1. 0), a CD 4 + T cell count of less than 50 cells/mm 3 (AOR = 2. 7; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 6. 1), neck pain (AOR = 2. 3; 95 % CI 1. 2 - 4. 6), recent diagnosis of HIV infection (AOR = 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 6), and <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> (AOR = 7. 9; 95 % CI 2. 9 - 22. 1). However, at sub-analysis of asymptomatic patients, absence of neck pain (AOR = 0. 5), photophobia (AOR = 0. 5) and <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> (AOR = 0. 1) were protective against cryptococcal infection. Conclusions Cryptococcal antigenemia is common among severely immunosuppressed HIV patients in Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Independent predictors of positive serum cryptococcal antigenemia were CD 4 + T cell counts of less than 50 cells/mm, low body mass index, neck pain, <b>signs</b> of <b>meningeal</b> irritation, and a recent diagnosis of HIV infection.

40|$|Background: Optimal {{use of the}} {{clinical}} examination aids physicians in identifying patients at risk for meningitis. The low specificity of the <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> {{may be due to}} the presence of cervical arthritis and spondylosis. One of the most sensitive maneuvers in the diagnosis of meningitis is jolt accentuation of headache. Patients and methods: A descriptive research was performed on suspected acute meningitis patients. The patients were evaluated for presence of <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> before lumbar puncture. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood-ratio-positive (LR+), and likelihood-ratio-negative (LR-) were determined. A p-value of < 0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: Totally, 14 patients were evaluated. Neck stiffness, Kernig, Brudzinski and jolt accentuation sign were positive in 78. 6 %, 14. 3 %, 14. 3 %, and 64. 3 % of patients, respectively. The prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+, and LR- of neck stiffness in comparison with pleocytosis was 50 %, 100 %, 57 %, 70 %, 100 %, 2. 33, and 0, respectively. The prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR+, and LR- of jolt accentuation sign in comparison with neck stiffness was 78. 5 %, 82 %, 60 %, 100 %, 60 %, 0, and 0. 18, respectively, however, when jolt accentuation sign was compared with pleocytosis these parameters were 50 %, 100 %, 71. 5 %, 78 %, 100 %, 1, and 0, respectively. Conclusion: When evaluating suspected cases of meningitis with limitations for neck stiffness examination, we can alternatively evaluate jolt accentuation sign. The LR- of 0. 18 for jolt accentuation sign when compared with neck stiffness revealed that jolt accentuation sign is an appropriate maneuvers in the diagnosis of meningitis...|$|R

Brain biopsy was ultimately performed and suggested infection with Aspergillus species and associated parenchymal infarction. The patient was treated with voriconazole with subsequent significant clinical improvement...|$|R
40|$|Figure 2. Chest x-ray showing {{bilateral}} alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in {{the right}} lung and bilateral pleural effusion. Note the marked widening of the mediastinum. A 45 -year-old male farmer was admitted with a 5 -day history of fever, retrosternal chest pain, and mental obtundation. He lived in the highlands of Peru and had {{been in contact with}} the skin and viscera of deceased cattle for unknown reasons 8 days before initiation of symptoms. The physical examination showed fever, shock, a painless ulcerative skin lesion on the right hand (Figure 1), and <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs.</b> The chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusion, diffuse alveolar infiltrates, and a widened mediastinum (Figure 2). Bacillus anthracis was isolated from an ulcer sample and from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which disclosed hemorrhagic features. Human anthrax results from direct inoculation through the skin, ingestion...|$|R
40|$|Headache is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in emergency departments, but {{only a small percentage}} of patients have a serious disease. Nevertheless, some forms of headache, such as "warning headaches", need special attention. By far the most common symptom associated with aneurysmal minor bleed (warning leak) is a sudden headache that is considered to be a warning symptom of impending aneurysmal rupture. In the presence of sudden severe headache with or without <b>meningeal</b> <b>signs</b> or nausea, subarachnoid hemorrhage should always be considered. Recognition of these warning headaches probably offers the best opportunity of reducing the otherwise serious mortality and morbidity of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This report describes 7 non-consecutive patients presenting warning headaches before major aneurysm rupture. Based on our experience and a review of the literature, we recommend a management algorithm for patients presenting with sudden severe headache...|$|R
