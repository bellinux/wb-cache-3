5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include <b>mevastatin</b> from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

50|$|Biosynthesis of <b>mevastatin</b> is {{primarily}} accomplished via a type 1 PKS pathway it proceeds in the PKS pathway {{as seen in}} figure 1 until it reaches a hexaketide state where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cyclization. After cyclization it continues via the PKS pathway to a nonaketide after which it is released and undergoes oxidation and dehydration. It is presumed that the oxidations are preformed by a polypeptide {{that is similar to}} cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, which is encoded by mlcC within the <b>mevastatin</b> gene. Lastly the biosynthesis is completed by the PKS facilitating the addition of a diketide sidechain and a methylation by SAM. Figure 1 shows <b>mevastatin</b> in its acid form {{but it can also be}} in the more commonly seen lactone form.

50|$|Penicillium citrinum is an anamorph, {{mesophilic}} fungus {{species of}} the genus of Penicillium which produces tanzawaic acid A-D, ACC, <b>Mevastatin,</b> Quinocitrinine A, Quinocitrinine B, and nephrotoxic citrinin. Penicillium citrinum is often found on moldy citrus fruits and occasionally it occurs in tropical spices and cereals. This Penicillium species also causes mortality for the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus.Because of its mesophilic character, Penicillium citrinum occurs worldwide. The first statin (<b>Mevastatin)</b> was 1970 isolated from this species.|$|E
50|$|This {{implies that}} {{lovastatin}} {{is a unique}} compound synthesized by A. terreus and that <b>mevastatin</b> is not an intermediate in its formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mevastatin</b> {{has since}} been derivatized to the {{compound}} pravastatin, which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease.|$|E

50|$|Sustained {{elevations}} {{of cholesterol}} {{in the blood}} {{increase the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. <b>Mevastatin</b> acts to lowers hepatic production of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway via the mevalonic acid pathway. When hepatic cholesterol levels are decreased it causes an increased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduces cholesterol levels in the circulation. It has also been shown that <b>mevastatin</b> upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.|$|E

Roy Vagelos, chief scientist and later CEO of Merck & Co, was interested, and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975.

50|$|By 1976, Akira Endo had {{isolated}} the first inhibitor, <b>mevastatin,</b> from the fungus Penicillium citrinium {{while working at}} Daiichi Sankyo in Japan. In 1979, Hoffman and colleagues isolated lovastatin from a strain of the fungus Aspergillus terreus. While developing and researching lovastatin, Merck scientists synthetically derived a more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor from a fermentation product of A. terreus, which was designated MK-733 (later to be named simvastatin).|$|E

50|$|In 1971, Akira Endo, a Japanese {{biochemist}} {{working for}} the pharmaceutical company Sankyo, began {{the search for a}} cholesterol-lowering drug. Research had already shown cholesterol is mostly manufactured by the body in the liver, using the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Endo and his team reasoned that certain microorganisms may produce inhibitors of the enzyme to defend themselves against other organisms, as mevalonate is a precursor of many substances required by organisms for the maintenance of their cell walls (ergosterol) or cytoskeleton (isoprenoids). The first agent they identified was <b>mevastatin</b> (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum.|$|E
50|$|This fungus is most {{important}} because of its use, {{in the form of}} red yeast rice, in the production of certain fermented foods in China. However, discoveries of cholesterol-lowering statins produced by the mold has prompted research into its possible medical uses. It produces a number of statins. The naturally occurring lovastatins and analogs are called monacolins K, L, J, and also occur in their hydroxyl acid forms along with dehydroxymonacolin and compactin (<b>mevastatin).</b> The prescription drug lovastatin, identical to monacolin K, is the principal statin produced by M. purpureus. Only the open-ring (hydroxy acid) form is pharmacologically active.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s the Japanese {{microbiologist}} Akira Endo {{first discovered}} natural products {{with a powerful}} inhibitory effect on HMGR in a fermentation broth of Penicillium citrinum, during his search for antimicrobial agents.

40|$|Abstract. Collagen type II (Col II) {{is among}} the {{proposed}} candidate autoantigens initiaiting rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Statins {{have been shown to}} have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. Mechanisms of statin effects upon the autoantigen-induced T lymphocyte activation in RA patients are still unknown. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of <b>mevastatin</b> upon Col II- and anti-CD 3 -induced (PBMC) activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from RA patients. PBMC from active RA patients (DAS 28 – 6. 6 ± 0. 64) were stimulated with antibodies specific for either anti-CD 3 or anti-Col II. The cultured cells were treated with <b>mevastatin</b> at different concentrations. Mevalonic acid, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp) were added to cultures. <b>Mevastatin</b> at concentration of 10 μM caused significant reduction of Col II-induced PBMC proliferation and of IFNγ production. These <b>mevastatin</b> effects were partially reversible by addition of mevalonic acid, GGpp, and Fpp. <b>Mevastatin</b> did not influence the anti-CD 3 induced PBMC activation.

Simultaneous estimation of <b>mevastatin</b> and citrinin was carried out by high performance thin layer chromatography. Glycerol and peptone were shown to be the best carbon and nitrogen source for <b>mevastatin</b> production by P. citrinum. Under optimized culture medium containing glycerol 10. 94 g. l - 1, peptone 8. 32 g. l - 1, CaCl 2 0. 53 g. l - 1, MgSO 4 0. 52 g. l - 1 and KH 2 PO 4 0. 049 g. l - 1 resulted in a maximal <b>mevastatin</b> production of 522. 5 mg. l - 1 Growth inhibited effect of citrinin on actinomycetes was. measured in terms of colony forming unit (CFU). There is a decrease in CFU of Actinomadura madura and Actinomadura livida with the increase in citrinin concentration.

40|$|The {{expression}} of monocyte adhesion molecules, such as VCAM- 1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1) and E-selectin, {{on the surface}} of the endothelium is an important step in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. We hypothesized that the inhibition of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase in endothelial cells could influence the {{expression of}} VCAM- 1 and E-selectin. Using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, we found that <b>mevastatin</b> (0. 1 - 1 microM) significantly reduced the expression of VCAM- 1 protein in cells activated by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) for 7 h. In contrast, TNF-alpha-induced E-selectin protein expression was augmented after <b>mevastatin</b> treatment. <b>Mevastatin</b> inhibited the mRNA expression of both VCAM- 1 and E-selectin in TNF-alpha-stimulated endothelial cells. The activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B, which is known to regulate the transcription of VCAM- 1 and E-selectin, was significantly reduced after incubation with <b>mevastatin.</b> Analysis of the time-dependent variation in the TNF-alpha-induced expression of E-selectin, and estimation of the rate of surface disappearance of E-selectin together with measurement of the amounts of E-selectin molecules secreted, indicated that <b>mevastatin</b> inhibited the surface removal of E-selectin. This is compatible with the observed increase in E-selectin expression after statin treatment. All observed effects of <b>mevastatin</b> were reversed by mevalonate, the product of the HMG-CoA reductase reaction. In conclusion, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in endothelial cells attenuates VCAM- 1 expression, but increases E-selectin expression, after cytokine induction. These diverse effects are associated with changes in the transcriptional regulation of the two adhesion molecule genes and modulation of the surface removal of E-selectin...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{examine the}} {{therapeutic}} efficacy of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) in rabbit osteoarthritis (OA) in vitro and in vivo. MethodsIn {{the presence or}} absence of <b>mevastatin,</b> rabbit chondrocytes and synoviocytes were incubated with Interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), and analyzed by biochemical methods. Thirty-two mature rabbits that underwent bilateral anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT) received six consecutive weekly intra-articular injections of <b>mevastatin</b> at three different concentrations or a control solution. All animals were sacrificed 6 weeks after ACLT, and the knee joints were assessed by morphological, histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical methods. ResultsMevastatin inhibited IL- 1 β stimulation of gene expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and matrix-metalloproteinases 3 (MMP- 3), in synoviocytes but not chondrocytes. The levels of MCP- 1 and MMP- 3 productions in synoviocytes were significantly reduced by statin-treatment. In rabbit with OA, intra-articular injection of <b>mevastatin</b> significantly reduced cartilage degradation, as assessed by morphological and histological examinations. Synovial tissues of knees treated with <b>mevastatin</b> showed less severe inflammatory responses with reduced thickness of synovial cell lining and less infiltration of subsynovial CD 68 +monocyte lineage cells compared to untreated control knees. Relative mRNA expressions of MCP- 1, IL- 1 β, MMP- 3, and MMP- 13 were reduced in synovial tissues, but not articular cartilage, of knees treated with <b>mevastatin</b> compared with untreated control knees. ConclusionDuring the development of experimental OA, intra-articular administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) reduces inflammatory cell infiltration and matrix-degrading enzyme expression, thus limiting cartilage degradation...|$|E
