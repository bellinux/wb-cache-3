5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and <b>mainland</b> emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the <b>mainland</b> emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the <b>mainland.</b> Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian <b>mainland</b> around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from the <b>mainland</b> taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the <b>mainland</b> emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and <b>mainland</b> emu. Hence, <b>mainland</b> emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E

5|$|M. c. ashbyi, {{described}} by Mathews in 1912, is found on Kangaroo Island, {{and has been}} separated from the <b>mainland</b> subspecies for around 9000 years.

Females from Kangaroo Island are more uniformly grey in plumage than <b>mainland</b> birds.|$|E

5|$|The King Island emu and the <b>mainland</b> emu show few {{morphological}} differences {{other than}} their significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter {{than those of the}} <b>mainland</b> emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the <b>mainland</b> emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the <b>mainland</b> emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the <b>mainland</b> emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile <b>mainland</b> emus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mainland</b> is {{the largest}} island of Orkney. Both of Orkney's burghs, Kirkwall and Stromness, are on this island, {{which is also the}} heart of Orkney's {{transportation}} system, with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world. The island is more densely populated (75% of Orkney's population) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland. The <b>Mainland</b> is split into areas called East and West <b>Mainland.</b> These areas are determined by whether they lie East or West of Kirkwall. The bulk of the <b>mainland</b> lies West of Kirkwall, with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall.|$|E

5|$|There are few {{morphological}} {{differences that}} distinguish the extinct insular emus from the <b>mainland</b> emu besides their size, but all three taxa were most often considered distinct species. A 2011 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, which was extracted from five subfossil King Island emu bones, showed that its genetic variation fell within {{that of the}} extant <b>mainland</b> emus. It was therefore interpreted as conspecific with the emus of the Australian <b>mainland,</b> and was reclassified as a subspecies of Dromaiusnovaehollandiae, D. n. ater. Other animals present on King Island are also considered as subspecies of their <b>mainland</b> or Tasmanian counterparts rather than distinct species. The authors suggested that further studies using different methods {{might be able to}} find features that distinguish the taxa. In its 2013 edition, The Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World emended the trinomial name of the King Island emu to D. n. minor, based on Spencer's D. minor, on the ground that Vieillot's D. ater was originally meant for the <b>mainland</b> emu. This rationale was accepted by the IOC World Bird List, which used D. n. minor thereafter.|$|E
