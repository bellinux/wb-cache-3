40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, {{microprogramming}} has evolved to be a standard mechanism for implementing the complex standard instruction set of a computer. With {{the advent of the}} writable control store, the number of microprogrammable computers has steadily increased and subsequently, there has been a significant growth of interest in user microprogramming. Despite the steadily increasing rate of interest, the <b>microprogramming</b> <b>environment</b> remains very much the way it was {{in the early years of}} the art. This project surveys the problems associated with the current environment for user microprogramming. One appropriate solution to the problem would be to provide a higher level of programming through higher level language support. With this approach in mind, the main objective of this research is to propose a language that can be used efficiently for microprogramming on the Data General Eclipse S/ 130. Considerable effort has been expended on this area of research in the past few years and a study is made of the current state of the design and implementation of high level microprogramming languages. The final phase of the project involved the consideration of aspects of compiler construction for such a high level language, particularly the problems of efficient microcode generation...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{complexity}} of integrated circuits has made simulation, through software-based simulators, very time consuming. The declining cost of hardware {{and a massive}} amount of computing time required to simulate logic networks have made the use of hardware simulators very attractive;This dissertation describes the architecture of a specialized, highly parallel, and programmable hardware accelerator for logic simulation. It is designed with commercially available chips in a <b>microprogrammed</b> <b>environment.</b> Any future changes can be accommodated by a change in microcode. High speed is achieved by exploiting parallelism, both in the logic network and the hardware of the processing unit. A standard bus is used for communication between the processing unit and the host computer. A 2 ̆ 2 thick 2 ̆ 2, nonstandard bus is used for communication of data within the processing unit {{at a very high}} speed. By using two buses, intermediate simulation results could be sent to the host computer in parallel with the simulation of devices. Devices are simulated in a pipelined fashion. Reliability is increased by providing error detection and correction capability for memories and buses, and by providing built-in hardware for diagnostics in a computer-aided environment. Evaluation programs of new devices can be loaded in the processing unit through the host computer. Event driven simulation with arbitrary delays and signal values have been used. Devices are divided into various categories to utilize system resources efficiently. Any device, simple or functional, can be simulated...|$|R
