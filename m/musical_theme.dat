5|$|Through Swayamvaram, Gopalakrishnan {{became the}} first Indian {{director}} to use sound as a leitmotif (a recurring <b>musical</b> <b>theme).</b> The film provided a new experience to Indian cinema-goers, as it used ample amounts of natural sounds with a minimalistic background score.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteen}} {{tracks on}} Wonderwall Music range from {{just over a}} minute in length to five-and-a-half minutes. On some pressings of the 1968 LP, various pieces lacked mastering rills between them; with these selections instead presented as medleys, the number of distinct album tracks was reduced to twelve. On many of the Indian selections, instruments such as sitar, surbahar and harmonium provide a drone-like backing, over which Harrison's chosen instrument plays the main <b>musical</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E

Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, GameTrailers {{dedicated}} {{an episode}} of its Pop Fiction series to examining Jackson's involvement with the game. Roger Hector, who previously stated that Jackson's involvement in the game was dropped due to the sexual abuse allegations, stated that any similarities to Jackson's music in Sonic 3 was not intentional on Sega's part. However, an anonymous source involved in the game's development reaffirmed Buxer's statements and said Jackson was involved before the scandals came to light in August 1993, and that his contributions remained in the game with Jackson choosing to remain uncredited. The source specified that the <b>musical</b> <b>theme</b> for Carnival Night Zone {{was one of the}} pieces Jackson contributed to.|$|E
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Solaris {{features}} Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude {{is the central}} <b>musical</b> <b>theme</b> of Solaris. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach's music featuring Artemyev's composition atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at story's end.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog {{was created}} by the newly formed Sonic Team, a 15-member Sega {{subsidiary}} formed to create a character that could compete with Nintendo's Mario. The game's level design was handled by Hirokazu Yasuhara, and the <b>musical</b> <b>theme</b> was composed by Masato Nakamura from the Japanese band Dreams Come True. In designing Green Hill, Yasuhara was inspired by the U.S. state of California, while the game's color scheme in general was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki. While the original game was a 2D side-scroller, Green Hill was remade in full 3D as a secret level in the 2001 game Sonic Adventure 2; the player unlocks it after collecting all 180 of the emblems found by completing the game's many objectives. The 2011 game Sonic Generations, a title that revisits past entries in the Sonic series, features both 2D ("Classic") and 3D ("Modern") versions of Green Hill, as well as of numerous other Sonic levels. A reinterpretation of the level appears in the 2017 title Sonic Mania. Green Hill Zone reappears in Sonic Forces, having partially turned to desert due to resource depletion by Eggman's industries.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Ocarina of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time, although IGN was disappointed that the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of Ocarina of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released in Europe or Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive to register the product. The original <b>musical</b> <b>theme</b> for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E
