40|$|AbstractIn many cases, <b>powder</b> <b>metallurgical</b> {{components}} are heat treated {{in order to}} improve the component behavior. An established heat treatment technique for wrought materials is case-hardening. But up to now, this procedure is not applied for <b>powder</b> <b>metallurgical</b> components, since the existing porous microstructure avoids adjusting a defined carbon depth profile. As a consequence a carbonization of the core and a full hardening can occur, leading to a disadvantageous phase and residual stress distribution. However, a new approach for case hardening of <b>powder</b> <b>metallurgical</b> components is to perform a surface densification prior to the heat treatment. In this study this approach is realized by using a deep rolling process. In order to verify the functionality of the process chain, the surface integrity was analyzed after each processing step using X-ray diffraction measurements and materialographic methods. There is clear evidence that the open porous structure could be transferred into a surface densified graded porous layer. As a consequence the carburization is dominated by solid state diffusion enabling to adjust a defined carbon depth profile leading to a martensitic surface layer and compressive residual stresses in the near surface zone. Subsequent fatigue strength experiments for sintered samples as well as for additional densified or densified plus case-hardened specimens were performed in order to demonstrate the enhanced mechanical properties.
