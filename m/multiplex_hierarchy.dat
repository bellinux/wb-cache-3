50|$|Digital Signal Designation is the {{classification}} of digital bit rates in the digital <b>multiplex</b> <b>hierarchy</b> used in transport of signals from one location to another in telecommunications.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunications, {{a digital}} <b>multiplex</b> <b>{{hierarchy}}</b> is a hierarchy consisting of an ordered repetition of tandem digital multiplexers that produce signals of successively higher data rates {{at each level}} of the hierarchy.|$|E
50|$|The signal {{transmitted}} on a T1 line, {{referred to}} as the DS1 signal, consists of serial bits transmitted at the rate of 1.544 Mbps. The type of line code used is called Alternate Mark Inversion (AMI). Digital Signal Designation is the classification of digital bit rates in the digital <b>multiplex</b> <b>hierarchy</b> used in transport of telephone signals from one location to another. DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit, transmitted over a digital circuit called T1. T1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|E
50|$|In {{the design}} of digital <b>multiplex</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> care must be {{exercised}} to ensure interoperability of the multiplexers used in the hierarchy.|$|R
5000|$|Digital <b>multiplexing</b> <b>hierarchies</b> may be {{implemented}} in many different configurations depending on; (a) the number of channels desired, (b) the signaling system to be used, and (c) the bit rate allowed by the communications media.|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} {{dedicated}} to the research into 1. 3 Gbit/s signal transmission via glass fiber sections of at least 35 km wave lengths of 1300 nm, bit error rates 140 Mbit/s) were multiplexed and applied as transducers between the different input signals and the optical transmisson system. Complex CMOS-ASICs were developed. The ATM multiplexer/demultiplexer processes synchronous and asynchronous signals with permissible single bit rates within 280 Mbit/s per input signal. Since ATM permits arbitrary input bit rates which must not necessarily comply with the existing <b>multiplexing</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> the system is extremely flexible and can easily be adapted to future requirements (e. g. standardization of new bit rates for HDTV, DPCM). The system components were combined without difficulties, and the project was completed successfully. (orig.)

50|$|Digital Signal 0 (DS0) {{is a basic}} digital {{signaling}} rate of 64 kilobits per second (kbit/s), corresponding to the capacity of one analog voice-frequency-equivalent channel. The DS0 rate, and its equivalents E0 and T0, {{form the basis for}} the digital <b>multiplex</b> transmission <b>hierarchy</b> in telecommunications systems used in North America, Europe, Japan, {{and the rest of the}} world, for both the early plesiochronous systems such as T-carrier and for modern synchronous systems such as SDH/SONET.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s DWDM emerged {{to allow for}} even higher {{transmission}} capacity (in the terabit per second region). This technology is also named optical transport network (OTN), where a set of <b>multiplex</b> and encapsulation <b>hierarchies</b> is standardized.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its {{fundamental}} role {{in carrying}} a single phone call, the DS0 rate {{forms the basis}} for the digital <b>multiplex</b> transmission <b>hierarchy</b> in telecommunications systems used in North America. To limit the number of wires required between two involved in exchanging voice calls, a system was built in which multiple DS0s are multiplexed together on higher capacity circuits. In this system, twenty-four (24) DS0s are multiplexed into a DS1 signal. Twenty-eight (28) DS1s are multiplexed into a DS3. When carried over copper wire, this is the well-known T-carrier system, with T1 and T3 corresponding to DS1 and DS3, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Increasing traffic volumes in the Internet put strict {{requirements}} to the architectureof optical core networks. The exploding number of Internet users, andmassive increase in Internet content consumption forces carriers to constantlyupgrade and transform their core networks {{in order to}} cope with the trafficgrowth. The choice of both physical components and transport protocols inthe core network is crucial in order to provide satisfactorily performance. Data traffic in the core network consists {{of a wide variety of}} protocols. OTN is a digital wrapper technology, responsible for encapsulating existingframes of data, regardless of native protocol, and adding additional overheadfor addressing, OAM and error control. The wrapped signal is thentransported directly over wavelengths in the optical transport network. Thecommon OTN wrapper overhead makes it possible to monitor and controlthe signals, regardless of the protocol type being transported. OTN is standardized by the ITU through a series of recommendations,the two most important being ITU-T G. 709 - "Interfaces for the OpticalTransport Network", and ITU-T G. 872 - "Architecture of the Optical TransportNetwork". OTN uses a flexible TDM hierarchy in order to provide highwavelength utilization. The TDM hierarchy makes it possible to performswitching at various sub-wavelength bit rates in network nodes. An introduction to OTN and an overview of recent progress in OTNstandardization is given in the thesis. An OTN switch which utilizes theflexible <b>multiplexing</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of OTN is proposed, and its characteristics istested in a network scenario, comparing it to the packet switched alternative. Simulation results reveal that OTN switching doesn t provide any performancebenefits compared to packet switching in the core network. OTNswitches do however provide bypass of intermediate IP routers, reducing therequirements for router processing power in each network node. This reducesoverall cost, and improves network scalability. An automatically reconfigurable OTN switch which rearranges link subcapacitiesbased on differences in output buffer queue lengths is also proposedand simulated in the thesis. Simulation results show that the reconfigurableOTN switch has better performance than both pure packet switching andregular OTN switching in the network scenario...|$|R
