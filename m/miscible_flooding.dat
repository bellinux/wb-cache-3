50|$|Gas {{injection}} or <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> {{is presently}} the most-commonly used approach in enhanced oil recovery. <b>Miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> {{is a general}} term for injection processes that introduce miscible gases into the reservoir. A miscible displacement process maintains reservoir pressure and improves oil displacement because the interfacial tension between oil and water is reduced. This refers to removing the interface between the two interacting fluids. This allows for total displacement efficiency.Gases used include CO2, natural gas or nitrogen. The fluid most commonly used for miscible displacement is carbon dioxide because it reduces the oil viscosity and is less expensive than liquefied petroleum gas. Oil displacement by carbon dioxide injection relies on the phase behavior of the mixtures of that gas and the crude, which are strongly dependent on reservoir temperature, pressure and crude oil composition.|$|E
30|$|The CO 2 –oil {{relative}} permeability curves obtained in slim tubes and natural core in different core lengths showed core length {{is another important}} factor to achieve <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> other than pressure, temperature and oil composition. Both CO 2 –oil {{relative permeability}} curves in 101 -cm length slim tube and 74 -cm length long composite cores depicted near <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> features, while CO 2 –oil relative permeability curves in 1, 528 -cm length slim tube depicted <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> features in CO 2 flooding test above MMP.|$|E
30|$|Experimental results {{demonstrated}} that the early gas breakthrough and inadequate contacting time in conventional core segment led to weak mass transfer and phase transition between CO 2 and oil, and this is reason why current relative permeability curves failed to predict <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> performance. Therefore, long composite core is recommended to implement CO 2 and oil relative permeability under miscible or near <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|E

50|$|For {{conventional}} heavy oil, {{the industry}} is exploring new zones in undrilled portions of the basin to find remaining undiscovered pools, or to apply EOR schemes such as water floods, thermal projects, and <b>miscible</b> <b>floods</b> such as the Vapour Extraction Process (VAPEX) technology. Only 15 percent of heavy oil is currently being recovered, leaving a large volume for future recovery.|$|R
30|$|Core {{flooding}} system which operates under reservoir conditions with miscible gas module XRFS- 150 {{was used in}} this project. The system is configured for liquid/liquid displacements under unsteady state or steady state conditions and with the addition of the CO 2 delivery system allows <b>miscible</b> <b>flood</b> experiments to be performed. The system is rated to 10, 000  psig confining pressure and 9, 000  psig pore pressure at 300  °F temperature.|$|R
30|$|However, {{implementing}} CO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> {{process in}} several meters long composite cores under HTHP is very difficult.

40|$|AbstractCO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> {{is one of}} main {{technologies}} in both the secondary and tertiary floods for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). In addition, {{it is also an}} important alternative for a geological CO 2 storage. In the recent twenty years, the fundamental research for visualized CO 2 -EOR has been launched by using mainly the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

30|$|The {{injection}} of fuel-generated CO 2 into oil reservoirs {{will lead to}} two benefits in both enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and the reduction in atmospheric emission of CO 2. To get an insight into CO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> performance in oil reservoirs, a multi-compositional non-isothermal CO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> mathematical model is developed. The convection and diffusion of CO 2 -hydrocarbon mixtures in multiphase fluids in reservoirs, mass transfer between CO 2 and crude, and formation damages caused by asphaltene precipitation are fully considered in the model. The governing equations are discretized in space using the integral finite difference method. The Newton-Raphson iterative technique was used to solve the nonlinear equation systems of mass and energy conservation. A numerical simulator, in which regular grids and irregular grids are optional, was developed for predicting CO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> processes. Two examples of one-dimensional (1 D) regular and three-dimensional (3 D) rectangle and polygonal grids are designed to demonstrate {{the functions of the}} simulator. Experimental data validate the developed simulator by comparison with ID simulation results. The applications of the simulator indicate that it is feasible for predicting CO 2 flooding in oil reservoirs for EOR.|$|E

30|$|Miscible {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{flooding}} {{has been recognized}} as a promising approach to enhance the recovery of oil reservoirs. However, depending on the injection strategy and rock/fluid characteristics, efficiency of the <b>miscible</b> CO 2 <b>flooding</b> varies from reservoir to reservoir. Although, many studies {{have been carried out}} to evaluate the performance of the <b>miscible</b> CO 2 <b>flooding,</b> a specific strategy which can be strictly followed for a hydrocarbon reservoir has not been established yet. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess one of Pakistan’s oil reservoirs for <b>miscible</b> CO 2 <b>flooding</b> by applying a modified screening criterion and numerical modeling. As such, the most recent miscible CO 2 screening criteria were modified, and a numerical modeling was applied on the prospective reservoir. Based on the results obtained, South oil reservoir (S 3) is chosen for a detailed assessment of <b>miscible</b> CO 2 <b>flooding.</b> It was also found that implementation of CO 2 water-alternating gas (CO 2 -WAG) injection at early stages of production can increase the production life of the reservoir.|$|R
30|$|Relative {{permeability}} curves {{are crucial}} parameters for reservoir engineer and reservoir commercial simulator to predict reservoir performance throughout {{the life of}} a reservoir, but meet difficulties in laboratory to obtain reliable data under miscible conditions {{due to the lack of}} proper testing and formulation methods. Up to now, most relative permeability curves are measured in short core segments by core flooding, which can hardly display <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> features for early gas breakthrough and insufficient contacting time between CO 2 and oil. In addition, the commonly used analytical and semi-analytical data processing methods are not suitable for <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> for ignoring the mechanism of vaporizing and dissolving mechanism. In this study, slim tubes (101 and 1, 528  cm in length) and long composite cores (74.46  cm in length) instead of conventional core segments were used to acquire reliable experimental data of CO 2 flooding under miscible or near miscible condition. Then, using improved empirical Corey model which assumes shape defining factor bog is a function of displacement pressure P combined with history-matching method to calculate relative permeability curves under near miscible and miscible conditions. Results indicated core length is another important parameter to simulate <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> other than pressure, temperature and oil composition, and using long composite cores and improved data processing method more reliable data can be obtained compared with conventional measured method. It is found residual oil saturation in short slim tube is 16.25  % higher than that of long slim tube and CO 2 relative permeability is lower in short slim tube/core segment than in long slime tube/long composite cores.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, {{there is}} no proper way of {{measuring}} CO 2 –oil relative permeability curves under miscible condition due to the slow development of dynamic miscibility. In CO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> process, miscible displacement between oil and CO 2 {{is caused by the}} extraction of light and inter-medium hydrocarbons into CO 2 and dissolution of CO 2 into oil (Okuno and Xu 2013; Wang and Pope 2001). CO 2 and oil are not miscible with each other during their first contact but will become miscible at CO 2 front gradually after multiple contact process. Component mass transfer between the CO 2 phase and the oil phase will generate a miscible zone, and distances are required for the development of dynamic miscibility (Shtepani 2007). It is concluded by some researchers (Omole and Osoba 1989; Ekundayo and Ghedan 2013) that core lengths in range of 0.5 to 6  m might well be below the minimum length required for the development of dynamic miscibility. Therefore, for better performance and accuracy of recovery process under <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding,</b> it is recommended to measure relative permeability curves with long composite cores. Unfortunately, most current relative permeability curves were obtained in conventional core segments which can hardly simulate real <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> process (Shtepani 2007; Prieditis and Brugman 1993; Ren et al. 2011). In general, conventional core segments are 3 to 7  cm in length, and short core segment frequently led to early CO 2 breakthrough and inadequate time for vaporizing before it enriched enough to get miscible with reservoir oil (Ekundayo and Ghedan 2013). Therefore, direct application of relative permeability curves generated from conventional core segments may induce significant errors in predicting reservoir performance in miscible condition.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} {{oil recovery}} by miscible CO 2 flooding from modified sandstone and chalk rocks. Calcite mineral surface is modified with stearic acid (SA) and asphaltene, and the silicate mineral surfaces are modified with N,N-dimethyldodecylamine (NN-DMDA) and asphaltene. The stability of adsorbed polar components in presence of SO 4 2 - and Mg 2 + ions is also investigated. Recovery from sandstone cores is consistently {{lower than that}} from chalk cores saturated with the same oil and flooded with CO 2 at all <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> conditions. This {{may be due to}} the larger permeability contrasts in sandstone cores, which promote the fingering phenomenon. Miscible CO 2 flooding for chalk and sandstone cores with distilled water, as initial water saturation, shows also lower oil recovery than cores saturated with different ions. At higher <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> conditions, higher oil recovery is obtained. However, presence of light components (such as C 1 or C 3) in oil reduced the recovery. Oil recovery in presence of methane (C 1) is lower than that in presence of methane and propane (C 1 /C 3). A ternary diagram was constructed in order to understand the CO 2 flooding mechanism(s) at the different flooding conditions and in presence of light components. The side effect of the flooding with CO 2 is the probability for asphaltene deposition. An approach based on solubility parameter in the liquid, is used to assess the risk for asphaltene deposition during CO 2 <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding.</b> The light components (C 1 /C 3) and higher flooding conditions enhanced the risk for asphaltene instability. It is also shown higher amount of asphaltene deposition in chalk cores than that in sandstone cores at similar miscibility conditions...|$|E
30|$|Fluid {{characteristics}} are generally black-oil or compositional PVT properties {{obtained in the}} laboratory by standardized procedures (Rogers and Grigg 2000). Very accurate determination of fluid properties can be obtained with current techniques. However, rock-fluid interactions such as adhesion, spreading and wettability affect the displacement in the reservoir. In reservoir simulators, rock-fluid interactions are generally lumped into one parameter—relative permeability. The relative permeability is the connecting link between the phase behavior and transport properties of the system. Relative permeability is an important petrophysical parameter, {{as well as a}} critical input parameter in predictive simulation of <b>miscible</b> <b>floods.</b> Relative permeability data are generally measured in the laboratory by standardized procedures with actual reservoir fluids and cores and at reservoir conditions (Rogers and Grigg 2000).|$|R
40|$|Use of {{miscible}} solvents in improved-oil-recovery processes requires {{knowledge of}} how the solvent will behave over all mixing ratios of oil and solvent.

30|$|The {{results of}} this section claim that {{determination}} of salinity threshold range is severely crucial before implementation of low-salinity water injection in field scale since the wrong prediction of this parameter leads to an inaccurate estimation of oil recovery at large reservoir scale. These results also assert that wider salinity threshold ranges have certainly more benefits than narrower salinity threshold ranges. Whereas it is notable that low-salinity water flooding in a real reservoir takes more time to affect the reservoir performance. Although the oil recovery improvement during LSW flooding is lower than other methods such as <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding,</b> ASP flooding, etc., it is considered {{as one of the}} most economical EOR methods.|$|E
30|$|After more {{reliable}} experimental data have gained, we need proper interpretation method to get representative relative permeability curves. In general, {{there are two}} types of components to determine relative permeability curves: endpoints and shape factors (Eydinov et al. 2007).

Up to now, the proper formulation of relative permeability curves under <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> is mostly based on empirical Corey model (Lee and Seinfeld 1987; Yang and Watson 1991).

Using a black oil numerical simulator, four injection techniques namely continuous, simultaneous water and gas (SWAG), water alternate gas (WAG) and hybrid WAG; were simulated on the reservoir. From the results of the simulations, the respective optimum injection modes for this case study reservoir were established. Comparing all the various optimum CO 2 injection modes, SWAG injection with a CO 2 injection rate of 15, 000 Mscf/d and a SWAG ratio of 1 : 1 is the most efficient recovery method for the reservoir. This is because it yields the highest recovery factor of 54. 8 % OOIP, a water cut that is below the limit of 0. 9 and a relatively low CO 2 breakthrough...|$|R
30|$|Obviously, {{with new}} data {{processing}} method and long composite cores, the relative permeability curves for CO 2 flooding obtained {{in this paper}} are more reliable. Firstly, combined with improved Corey model and history-matching method effects of capillary pressure and vaporizing mechanism can be incorporated in relative permeability curves. Secondly, short core segment failed to simulate mass transfer mechanism due to early gas breakthrough and more oil remained in pores. Thirdly, longer contacting time between CO 2 and oil strengthens the vaporizing and dissolution mechanism which helps to decrease oil viscosity and IFT. However, it is should be noticed, long composite cores and new data processing method in this paper improved CO 2 –oil relative permeability curves obtained in laboratory, {{but it is still}} failed to simulate the fully <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding</b> in natural cores.|$|E
30|$|Improved oil {{recovery}} processes using gas, {{is also known}} as capillary number increasing processes. This method is called <b>miscible</b> <b>flooding.</b> Gas drive is the use of energy that arises from the expansion of gas in a reservoir to drive the oil out to a well bore. There are two types of gas drives, namely condensing gas drives {{in which there is a}} mass transfer of intermediate hydrocarbon from the solvent to crude, and vaporizing gas drives in which mass transfer occurs from the crude to the solvent. CO 2, nitrogen and flue gas fall into this category. These methods are based on the principles of increasing capillary number, which means reducing the interfacial tension between the water and oil thus lowering the mobility ratio (Lake and Walsh 2008).|$|E

This is consistent with the results in slim tubes. In addition, it can be found in Fig.  4, oil recovery is affected by relative permeability shape factors and deviation of simulated oil recovery was occurred at the middle and late stage of core flooding.|$|E
40|$|The current {{project is}} a {{systematic}} research effort aimed at quantifying relationships between process mechanisms {{that can lead to}} improved recovery from gas injection processes performed in heterogeneous Class 1 and Class 2 reservoirs.

In effect, the high permeability zones are used to deliver fluid by crossflow to zones that would otherwise be flooded only very slowly. Thus, the research effort is divided into five areas: development of miscibility in multicomponent systems; design estimates for nearly miscible displacements; design of <b>miscible</b> <b>floods</b> for fractured reservoirs; compositional flow visualization experiments and simulation of near-miscible flow in heterogeneous systems.

40|$|Compositional {{displacements}} in porous media {{occur when}} there is mass transfer between multiple fluids. A good example of such flows is gas injection to an oil reservoir for enhanced oil recovery. Injected gas can be miscible with oil at first contact or at multiple contacts or can stay nearly immiscible with oil. This depends on how reservoir pressure compares with so-called minimum miscibility pressure. Miscible gas injections often achieve high microscopic recovery and occur compositionally, creating zones of varying interfacial tension between oil and gas along the mixing zone. However, the macroscopic efficiency of gas injection at reservoir scale remains much lower, being controlled by gravity segregation, viscous fingering and reservoir heterogeneity. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the combined effects of driving forces on non-equilibrium compositional displacements in dual- and triple-permeability porous mediums. Glass-bead packs of different uniform sizes were used to construct a quasi 2 -D porous media. An analog ternary fluid system (isooctane, isopropanol and brine) was adapted to allow controlling interfacial tension between the phases at ambient laboratory conditions. Recovery of phases, compositional analysis, pressure drop and snapshots of saturation distributions during each experiment are reported in this thesis. Experimental observations were interpreted by black-oil numerical simulations. This thesis reveals that heterogeneity has more pronounced effect on recovery under immiscible conditions than miscible conditions. This is caused mainly by capillary forces dominating the flow in immiscible conditions. In <b>miscible</b> <b>floods,</b> viscous and gravity forces govern the flow. This affects recovery moderately although the patterns of displacement fronts are changed significantly. Several recent numerical studies have suggested that, in gravity drainage projects, multi-contact displacements may yield higher recovery than first-contact <b>miscible</b> <b>floods.</b> Relevant experimental results reported in this thesis confirm this observation. Force-balance scaling criteria (i. e., capillary, gravity and Bond numbers) are used to diagnose flow regimes during displacements. Laboratory results demonstrate that these criteria successfully describe low- and high-rate immiscible, low-rate multi-contact miscible and high-rate miscible displacements. Experimental results also suggest that, in miscible displacements, flow profiles follow the patterns depending on the mobility ratio and critical rate, {{as reported in the}} literature...|$|R
