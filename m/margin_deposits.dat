40|$|Modern {{seafloor}} {{and shallow}} subsurface studies offer a high-resolution view into the morphology, architecture, {{and evolution of}} submarine channels. In addition to architecture derived from seismic data, lithologic and age calibration are needed to constrain the evolution of submarine channels and {{the properties of the}} flows that sculpt them. Near-seafloor seismic and core data from the western Niger Delta slope allow for the quantification of lateral and vertical changes in facies, bed thickness, and grain size in a well-constrained channel system. The dataset consists of a 3 D seismic volume, high-resolution 2 D seismic profiles, 21 sediment cores, and more than 500 grain-size analyses. Core and seismic data reveal that the channel axis consists of thick-bedded, amalgamated, coarse-grained sands. Channel <b>margin</b> <b>deposits</b> are thin-bedded and heterolithic, and show a pronounced decrease in bed thickness and grain size with increasing distance above and away from the channel thalweg. <b>Margin</b> <b>deposits</b> exist in â€˜scallopsâ€™ that correspond to bends of an older, more sinuous channel. While individual scallops are disconnected from each other, beds can be correlated over hundreds of meters between cores within the same scallop. Multiple core transects across the channel demonstrate a rapid decrease in bed thickness and deposition rate (calculated from radiocarbon ages) with increasing height above channel thalweg. Grain size distributions obtained with a laser particle-size analyzer also show a strong fining with height above thalweg. These trends reflect the stratification of grain size and sediment concentration in channelized turbidity currents. Simple theoretical concentration and grain-size profiles match the observed trends, providing constraints for numerical and rule-based modeling approaches. Although facies models for submarine channels often assume quasi-horizontal fill with rapid lateral facies changes, this dataset suggests that there is a significant difference in elevation between coeval axis and <b>margin</b> <b>deposits.</b> The relationships between grain size, bed thickness, and height above channel thalweg can be used to estimate location of deposition relative {{to the base of the}} time-equivalent geomorphic channel when only limited data (e. g., core or outcrop) is available...|$|E

40|$|<b>Margin</b> <b>deposits,</b> {{which serve}} as {{collateral}} {{to protect the}} clearinghouse, are typically the most important tool for risk management. The authors develop a model that explains how creating a futures clearinghouse may allow traders simultaneously to reduce both the risk of default and {{the total amount of}} margin that members post. Optimal margin levels are determined by the need to balance the deadweight costs of default against the opportunity cost of holding additional margin. Both costs are a consequence of market participants'imperfect access to capital markets. The simultaneous reduction in default risk and in the opportunity cost of <b>margin</b> <b>deposits</b> is possible because the creation of the clearinghouse facilitates multilateral netting. The authors characterize the conditions under which multilateral netting will dominate bilateral netting. They also show that it is credible for the clearinghouse to expel members who default, further reducing the risk of default. Finally, they show that it may (but need not) be optimal for the clearinghouse to monitor the financial condition of its members. If monitoring occurs, it will reduce the amount of margin required, but need not affect the probability of default. The empirical tests run by the authors indicate that the opportunity cost of margin {{plays an important role in}} determining margin. The relationship between volatility and margins indicates that participants face an upward-sloping opportunity cost for margin, which appears to more than offset the effects that monitoring and expulsion would be expected to have on margin setting.
