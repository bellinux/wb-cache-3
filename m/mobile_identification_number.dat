50|$|A {{mobile station}} ID (MSID) {{is a number}} that is {{associated}} with the home service provider and the wireless phone number. This is reprogrammed when the user changes home service providers.

The MIN is a number that uniquely identifies a mobile phone working under TIA standards for cellular and PCS technologies. (e.g. EIA/TIA-553 analog, IS-136 TDMA, IS-95 or IS-2000 CDMA). It can also be called the MSID (Mobile Station ID) or IMSI_S (Short IMSI).|$|E

50|$|Definition: The <b>mobile</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> (MIN) is {{a number}} that {{is derived from the}} 10-digit {{directory}} telephone number assigned to a mobile station. The rules for deriving the MIN from the 10-digit telephone number are given in the IS-95 standard. MIN1 is the first or least significant 24 binary digits of the MIN. MIN2 is {{the second part of the}} MIN containing the 10 most significant binary digits. MIN1, and the ESN, along with other digital input, are used during the authentication process. The MIN is used to identify a mobile station.|$|E
50|$|Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mobile {{telephone}} cloning involves {{gaining access to}} the device's embedded file system /nvm/num directory via specialized software or placing a modified EEPROM into the target {{mobile telephone}}, allowing the Electronic serial number (ESN) and/or Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) of the mobile phone to be changed. The ESN or MEID is typically transmitted to the cellular company's Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO) in order to authenticate a device onto the mobile network. Modifying these, {{as well as the}} phone's Preferred Roaming List (PRL) and the <b>mobile</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number,</b> or MIN, can pave the way for fraudulent calls, as the target telephone is now a clone of the telephone from which the original ESN and MIN data were obtained.|$|E

This remote control of appliances is possible through Embedded Systems. The use of “Embedded System in Communication” has given rise to many interesting applications that ensures comfort and safety to human life. The main aim of the project will be to design a SMS driven automatic display toolkit which can replace the currently used programmable electronic display. It is proposed to design receive cum display toolkit which can be programmed from an authorized mobile phone. The message to be displayed is sent through a SMS from an authorized transmitter. The toolkit receives the SMS, validates the sending <b>Mobile</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> (MIN) and displays the desired information after necessary code conversion. The system is made efficient by using ‘clone’ SIMs of same MIN in a geographical area so that the same SMS can be received by number of display boards in a locality using techniques of time division multiple access. Started of as an instantaneous News display unit, we have improved upon it and tried {{to take advantage of the}} computing capabilities of microcontroller. We envision a toolkit that will not only display message but also can be used to do some mechanical work...|$|E

The length of the MNC depends on the value of the MCC, and it is recommended that the length is uniform within a MCC area.

40|$|Smartphones {{have become}} nearly ubiquitous, en-abling users to access communication, payment, banking, entertainment, social networking, and other {{services}} previously available only on desk-top computers anytime, anywhere. However, this con-venience comes with considerable security and privacy risks. Smartphones contain intimate details of our lives: who we talk to and spend time with, where we go, and, in-creasingly, how we spend our money. With a stolen phone, an attacker can acquire much of the owner’s personal and financial data—not only what the device itself contains but also what is accessible through the Internet. Unfortunately, smartphones are still mostly secured with authen-tication mechanisms that predate <b>mobile</b> devices—namely, personal <b>identification</b> <b>numbers,</b> which orig-inated {{with the development of}} au-tomatic teller machines in the late 1960 s, and passwords, which were in use long before computer systems. However, typing a PIN or password on a small handheld device, espe-cially if you’re walking or engaged in another activity, is more cumber-some than doing so on a stationary, relatively larger ATM keypad or computer keyboard. The first attempt to adapt user authentication to the smartphone’s small form factor came in 2008, when An-droid introduced its optional pattern lock system, which requires users to swipe a finger across a particular se-quence of dots to unlock the device, as Figure 1 shows. De-spite being more error- prone and slower than traditional PIN/password entry, many users prefer pattern lock due to its playfulness and ease of use. 1 On the downside, th...|$|R
