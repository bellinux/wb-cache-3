5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and <b>most</b> <b>research</b> has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>research</b> {{has focused}} on thrips species that feed on {{economically}} significant crops. Some species are predatory, {{but most of them}} feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a varied}} {{group of animals}} from taxonomic, {{morphological}} and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through {{the first half of}} the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. <b>Most</b> <b>research</b> conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as <b>most</b> <b>research</b> is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E
5|$|In Research Infosource's Decade in Review, McMaster was {{designated}} as the top Canadian performer in university research income growth from 1999 to 2009 in the medical doctoral category and as the second-top performer in research intensity growth for the same period. With a total sponsored research income of $324.624 million in 2015, McMaster has the eighth largest sponsored research income in the country. In the same year, Research Infosource ranked McMaster as the second <b>most</b> <b>research</b> intensive university {{in the country with}} an average research income of C$358,300 per full-time faculty member, the second highest average in the country. Its research activities exceed those of universities twice its size.

5|$|On 1 January 1945 {{he became}} Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a {{position}} he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school {{at a time when}} Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and <b>most</b> <b>research</b> students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947–48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV betatron was converted an 18 MeV electron synchrotron in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to scrounge funding and components from various sources. Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
