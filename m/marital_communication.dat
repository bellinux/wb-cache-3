2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that the negative impact of infidelity on a relationship depends on how involved partners are in their infidelity relationship, and researchers maintain that infidelity itself does not cause divorce but the overall level of relationship satisfaction, motives for infidelity, level of conflict, and attitudes held about infidelity do (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). In fact, Schneider, et al. (1999) reported that even though 60 percent of their participants initially threatened to leave their primary relationship, a threat to leave due to infidelity did not actually predict the eventual outcome (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the marital {{adjustment}} of older adult couples with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and couples who have experienced neither. Participants were 64 couples in which at least one of the spouses was over 55 years of age, including 19 breast cancer couples, 20 prostate cancer couples, 25 couples who had experienced neither of these cancers. Most participants were young-old, Protestant, Caucasians from a high socioeconomic class. The breast cancer and prostate cancer participants had completed treatment an average of 39. 5 months prior to participation. The methodology was a mail survey. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Marital Satisfaction Questionnaire for Older Adults (MSQFOP) (Haynes et al., 1992), Primary Communication Inventory (PCI) (Navran, 1967), Miller Social Intimacy Scale (MSIS) (Miller & Lefcourt, 1982), and the Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS) (Hudson et al., 1981). There were no differences in the amount of discordance between the couples groups' level of <b>marital</b> satisfaction, <b>communication,</b> intimacy, and sexual satisfaction. In addition, there were no differences in the level of <b>marital</b> satisfaction, <b>communication,</b> intimacy, and sexual satisfaction between the participant groups. There was a significantly greater correlation between the prostate cancer couples' scores on the ISS than the correlation between the breast cancer couples' scores and the scores of the couples who had not experienced breast cancer or prostate cancer. The level of <b>marital</b> satisfaction, <b>communication,</b> intimacy, and sexual satisfaction reported was similar to that of the normative samples. There was no difference between the marital adjustment of the cancer couples and older couples who had experienced neither type of cancer. These results are good news for breast and prostate cancer survivors, and professionals. Older adults may be better able to incorporate the experience of cancer into their lives or are better prepared for chronic illness through anticipatory socialization. The high degree of agreement between the prostate cancer spouses on the ISS may be related to the sexual dysfunction that frequently accompanies treatment for this cancer.

40|$|The way couples {{communicate}} during conflict discussions {{has been}} found to be a reliable predictor of marital satisfaction. However, in previous research there has been little experimental control over the selection of topics. The present study examined, in a sample of 15 newlywed couples, whether affective displays during the discussion of a sexual and a nonsexual conflict topic differentially predict current <b>marital</b> satisfaction. <b>Communication</b> behaviors were coded using an adaptation of the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), resulting in composite “negative behavior” and “positive behavior” categories. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Negative behaviors displayed during the nonsexual conflict discussions were not significantly related to concurrent self-reported relationship satisfaction. In contrast, for wives, negative behaviors displayed during the discussion of a sexual problem were significantly related to lower levels of relationship satisfaction. For both the sexual and nonsexual conflict discussions, positive behaviors were positively associated with relationship satisfaction, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.

The aim of this study was (a) fo assess the role of marital discord in the overall outcome of a program training parents in behavioral techniques (behavioral parent training) and (b) to assess the effects of an adjunctive treatment (partner support training [PST]) on outcome. The latter treatment focused on <b>marital</b> conflict, <b>communication,</b> and problem soiving. Twenty-four families with a child diagnosed as oppositional or conduct disordered were assigned to either a marital-discord group (n = 12) or a no-marital-discord group (n = 12). Families within each group were then randomly assigned to either child management training (CMT) alone or CMT with PST. Measures of child deviance, parenting behavior, and marital satisfaction were collected at pre- and posttraining and at a 6 -month foilow-up. Results indicated a significant interaction between marital discord and treat-ment type on most measures at follow-up but hOt at posttraining. Although PST added little to the maintenance of change for the nondiscordant group, it produced significant gains over those who received CMT only for the discordant group. Further results highlighting the interaction of marital and treatment variables are discussed. Considerable research has indicated that marital discord and child behavior problems, particularly conduct disorders in boys, covary in clinical samples and, to a lesser extent, in the general population (Emery, 1982).
