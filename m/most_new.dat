5|$|At {{the start}} of the 17th century, {{possibly}} around 1600, a new hall was built in stone to replace the older timber-framed one; it was positioned to the south, replacing the earlier 15th-century extension. The new hall was slightly anachronistic, having only one floor, unlike <b>most</b> <b>new</b> halls from this period which had two storeys. The old hall was then probably adapted for use as a service area.|$|E
5|$|General Motors do Brasil {{announced}} that it will import from five to ten Volts to Brazil during the first semester of 2011 as part of a demonstration and also to lobby the federal government to enact financial incentives for green cars.

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>New</b> Zealand place-names {{are derived}} from Māori and British sources. Both groups used names to commemorate notable people, events, places from their homeland, and their ships, or to {{describe}} the surrounding area. The Māori {{did not have a}} collective name for New Zealand before European arrival, but post-colonisation the name Aotearoa (commonly translated as 'long white cloud') was used to refer to the whole country. Dutch cartographers named the islands Nova Zeelandia and British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>new</b> {{cars were}} sold through {{automobile}} dealerships in the 1950s, but Crosley automobiles {{were still on}} sale at any number of appliance or department stores, and Allstate (a rebadged Henry J) could be ordered at any Sears and Roebuck in 1952 and 1953. By mid-decade, these outlets had vanished and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because <b>most</b> <b>new</b> genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E

5|$|Pinafore {{opened in}} New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) {{and ran for}} the rest of December. After a {{reasonably}} strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since <b>most</b> <b>New</b> Yorkers had already seen local productions of Pinafore. This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, The Pirates of Penzance, which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pinafore alongside Pirates.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipal}} government has permitted denser development around the stations, where it wants <b>most</b> <b>new</b> housing and commercial property to be built. Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers. Many of the stations are in primarily residential areas, and the projects have met resistance from residents who {{fear that the}} character of their neighborhoods will be altered.|$|E

It is fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, containing two elevators for disabled access. Additionally, the station contains air conditioning and is waterproofed, a feature only found in newer stations.

5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike <b>most</b> <b>New</b> Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population {{wanted to be part of}} a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, <b>most</b> <b>new</b> bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.|$|E

General Motors announced that the new Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the United States market in December 2010, would be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. General Motors do Brasil announced that it will import from five to ten Volts to Brazil during the first semester of 2011 {{as part of a}} demonstration and also to lobby the federal government to enact financial incentives for green cars.

5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, {{where it would}} connect with <b>most</b> <b>New</b> Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would offer New Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. If opened, the extension would take the New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time. The plan would replace the Access to the Region's Core (ARC) tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010.|$|E

5|$|In September 1914, Lord Kitchener {{announced}} that he was looking for volunteers and regular NCOs to provide officers for the expanding army. Most of the volunteers came from the middle class, with the largest group from commercial and clerical occupations (27%), followed by teachers and students (18%) and professional men (15%). In March 1915, it was discovered that 12,290 men serving in the ranks had been members of a university or public school Officers' Training Corps (OTC). Most applied for and were granted commissions, while others who did not apply were also commissioned. Direct commissioning largely ceased early in 1916, from then <b>most</b> <b>new</b> officers had served in the ranks first, even if in a unit of potential officers.|$|E
5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from <b>most</b> <b>New</b> Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E

Others, such as the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer {{implement the}} standard using mini-HDMI (type C) ports. All iPad models have a special A/V adapter that converts Apple's data line to a standard HDMI (Type A) port. Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of outputting over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle is available which adds HDMI compatibility. Most of the Chinese-made tablets running Android OS provide HDMI output using a mini-HDMI (type C) port. <b>Most</b> <b>new</b> laptops and desktops now have built in HDMI as well.|$|E
