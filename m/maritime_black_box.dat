Instead of a single <b>black</b> <b>box,</b> we consider categories of <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> and their morphisms. This makes new classes of <b>black</b> <b>box</b> problems accessible. For example, we can enrich <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups by actions of outer automorphisms. As an example of application of this technique, we construct Frobenius maps on <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups of untwisted Lie type in odd characteristic (Sec-tion 6) and inverse-transpose automorphisms on <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups encrypting (P) SLn(Fq). One {{of the advantages of}} our approach is that it allows us to work in <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups over finite fields of big characteristic. Another advantage is explanatory power of our methods; as an example, we explain Kantor’s and Kassabov’s construction of an involution in <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups encrypting SL 2 (2 n).

What is a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group? A <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group X is a device or an algorithm (`oracle' or `black box') which produces (nearly) uniformly distributed independent random elements from some finite group X. These elements are encoded as 0 [...] 1 strings of uniform length; given strings representing x, y # X, the <b>black</b> <b>box</b> can compute strings representing xy and x - 1, and decide whether x = y in time bounded from above by a constant. In this setting, one is usually interested in finding probabilistic algorithms which allow us to determine, with probability of error #, the isomorphism type of X in time O(|#| (log|X|) c). We say in this situation that our algorithm is run in Monte Carlo polynomial time. A critical discussion of this concept can be found in [6], while [7] contains a detailed survey of the subject. See also the forthcoming book by Seress [38]. In this paper we discuss a (still rather rudimentary) structural approach to the theory of <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group. We briefly survey methods for constructing <b>black</b> <b>box</b> oracles for subgroups and factor groups of <b>black</b> <b>box</b> groups, and then show how one can construct <b>black</b> <b>box</b> oracles for centralisers of involutions. They are used in the algorithm for finding the p-core of a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> group of characteristic p...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{intelligent}} transport systems have been applied to vehicle cloud environments. Such technology is especially useful for the systematic management of road traffic. Moreover, automobiles are increasingly equipped with a <b>black</b> <b>box</b> for accident prevention and preservation of evidence. Vehicle <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> have become mandatory because <b>black</b> <b>box</b> images and voice data have served as forensic evidence in courts. However, the data from <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> can be forged or modified by man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and message hijacking. In this paper, we propose a vehicle cloud computing-based <b>black</b> <b>box</b> service model that can provide integrity for <b>black</b> <b>box</b> data through digital signatures in vehicle cloud computing (VCC) environments.

40|$|We {{show that}} quantum theory allows for transformations of <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> that cannot be {{realized}} by inserting the input <b>black</b> <b>boxes</b> within a circuit in a predefined causal order.

The quantum version of this transformation - the quantum switch - produces an output circuit where the order of the connections is controlled by a quantum bit, which becomes entangled with the circuit structure. Simulating these transformations in a circuit with fixed causal structure requires either postselection or an extra query to the input <b>black</b> <b>boxes.</b> © 2013 American Physical Society.
