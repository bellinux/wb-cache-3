50|$|There exist {{different}} types of PAPR units for different working environments. Regardless of type, a PAPR consists of (1) some kind of headgear (mask or hood), (2) a powered (<b>motor-driven)</b> <b>fan</b> which forces incoming air through (3) a filter (or multiple filters) for delivery to the user for breathing, and (4) a battery or other power source. The mask may be hard and tight-fitting or flexible and loose-fitting. (The former affords {{a higher level of}} protection, but is less comfortable.) The fan, filter, and power-pack may be carried around freely by the user, often secured by a belt around the waist. Alternatively, with certain units, the air is fed to the user via lengthy tubing while the fans and filters are remotely mounted.|$|E
40|$|Here let us {{describe}} the trends in heatsinks focusing on those for personal computers. At first, the heat generation rate itself of CPUs {{was small and}} hence the heat density was low necessitating no heatsinks, and conventionally the heat was dissipated into the printed circuit board, {{taking advantage of the}} CPU package made of plastics, through the socket. Then, as CPUs upgraded in integration scale and the design rule for circuit patterns improved in preciseness together with the increasing clock frequency, the heat generation rate continued to upsurge. Consequently, a need for cool-ing using heatsinks arose, and heatsinks based on extru-sions and die-castings were employed for desktop PCs. Later on, as the heat generation rate of CPUs increased higher, these blower-less air-cooling devices were found to be insufficient, so that forced air-cooling using a <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fan</b> was introduced, and this cooling method continues to be used up until now experiencing many improvements 2), 3). On the other hand, with respect to notebook PCs, the heat was at first diffused over the entire casing using its aluminum sheet metal to be naturally dissipated into the air. In the meantime, in 1993, heatpipe was combined with the casing to improve the heat-diffusing perfor-mance, and further, <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fan</b> was introduced thus achieving performance improvements year by year. As it is now some CPUs generate a heat rate of more than 100 W, and those developed for notebook PCs in excess of 30 W. Moreover, the heat generation rate of other devices such as GPU now exceeds 10 W, producing a tendency toward increased temperature within the casing. As described above, the heatsinks of today are used in many crucial places where extremely high performance is required. Accordingly, it is essential for heatsinks to maxi-mize the fin efficiency by adopting heatpipes that outper- 1...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{improvements}} {{from the point of}} view of the staff was the new ventilation system. At Petone, ventilation was a rather primitive affair, relying on windows and roof vents, as well as circular stoves placed at strategic locations around the buildings. This had replaced an earlier and even more basic system of steam pipes around the machines. At Hutt, a far more effective system was installed by Messrs. A. & T. Burt, which involved a series of pipes throughout the buildings through which, with the aid of <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fans,</b> cool air from outside or warm air from steam boilers could be circulated.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{much less}} {{complexity}} are {{the types of}} RC jet aircraft that actually use an electric <b>motor-driven</b> ducted <b>fan</b> instead to power the aircraft. So called [...] "EDF" [...] models can be of much smaller size, and only need the same electronic speed contoller and rechargeable battery technology as propeller-driven RC electric powered aircraft use.|$|R
40|$|The future looks bright, light, and green, {{especially}} where aircraft are concerned. The division of NASA s Fundamental Aeronautics Program called the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project is aiming to reach new heights by 2025 - 2035, improving {{the efficiency and}} environmental impact of air travel by developing new capabilities for cleaner, quieter, and more fuel efficient aircraft. One of the many ways NASA plans to reach its aviation goals is by combining new aircraft configurations with an advanced turboelectric distributed propulsion (TeDP) system. Jeff Trudell, an engineer at Glenn Research Center, says, "The TeDP system consists of gas turbines generating electricity to power {{a large number of}} distributed <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fans</b> embedded into the airframe. " The combined effect increases the effective bypass ratio and reduces drag to meet future goals. "While room temperature components may help reduce emissions and noise in a TeDP system, cryogenic superconducting electric motors and generators are essential to reduce fuel burn," says Trudell. Superconductors provide significantly higher current densities and smaller and lighter designs than room temperature equivalents. Superconductors are also able to conduct direct current without resistance (loss of energy) below a critical temperature and applied field. Unfortunately, alternating current (AC) losses represent the major part of the heat load and depend on the frequency of the current and applied field. A refrigeration system is necessary to remove the losses and its weight increases with decreasing temperature. In 2001, a material called magnesium diboride (MgB 2) was discovered to be superconducting. The challenge, however, has been learning to manufacture MgB 2 inexpensively and in long lengths to wind into large coils while meeting the application requirements...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to growing aviation demands {{and concerns about}} the environment and energy usage, a team at NASA proposed and examined a revolutionary aeropropulsion concept, a turboelectric distributed propulsion system, which employs multiple electric motor-driven propulsors that are distributed on a large transport vehicle. The power to drive these electric propulsors is generated by separately located gas-turbine-driven electric generators on the airframe. This arrangement {{enables the use of}} many small-distributed propulsors, allowing a very high effective bypass ratio, while retaining the superior efficiency of large core engines, which are physically separated but connected to the propulsors through electric power lines. Because of the physical separation of propulsors from power generating devices, a new class of vehicles with unprecedented performance employing such revolutionary propulsion system is possible in vehicle design. One such vehicle currently being investigated by NASA is called the "N 3 -X" that uses a hybrid-wing-body for an airframe and superconducting generators, motors, and transmission lines for its propulsion system. On the N 3 -X these new degrees of design freedom are used (1) to place two large turboshaft engines driving generators in freestream conditions to minimize total pressure losses and (2) to embed a broad continuous array of 14 <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fans</b> on the upper surface of the aircraft near the trailing edge of the hybrid-wing-body airframe to maximize propulsive efficiency by ingesting thick airframe boundary layer flow. Through a system analysis in engine cycle and weight estimation, it was determined that the N 3 -X would be able to achieve a reduction of 70 % or 72 % (depending on the cooling system) in energy usage relative to the reference aircraft, a Boeing 777 - 200 LR. Since the high-power electric system is used in its propulsion system, a study of the electric power distribution system was performed to identify critical dynamic and safety issues. This paper presents some of the features and issues associated with the turboelectric distributed propulsion system and summarizes the recent study results, including the high electric power distribution, in the analysis of the N 3 -X vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Meeting NASA's N+ 3 goals {{requires}} {{a fundamental shift}} in approach to aircraft and engine design. Material and design improvements allow higher pressure and higher temperature core engines which improve the thermal efficiency. Propulsive efficiency, {{the other half of}} the overall efficiency equation, however, is largely determined by the fan pressure ratio (FPR). Lower FPR increases propulsive efficiency, but also dramatically reduces fan shaft speed through the combination of larger diameter fans and reduced fan tip speed limits. The result is that below an FPR of 1. 5 the maximum fan shaft speed makes direct drive turbines problematic. However, it is the low pressure ratio fans that allow the improvement in propulsive efficiency which, along with improvements in thermal efficiency in the core, contributes strongly to meeting the N+ 3 goals for fuel burn reduction. The lower fan exhaust velocities resulting from lower FPRs are also key to meeting the aircraft noise goals. Adding a gear box to the standard turbofan engine allows acceptable turbine speeds to be maintained. However, development of a 50, 000 + hp gearbox required by fans in a large twin engine transport aircraft presents an extreme technical challenge, therefore another approach is needed. This paper presents a propulsion system which transmits power from the turbine to the fan electrically rather than mechanically. Recent and anticipated advances in high temperature superconducting generators, motors, and power lines offer the possibility that such devices can be used to transmit turbine power in aircraft without an excessive weight penalty. Moving to such a power transmission system does more than provide better matching between fan and turbine shaft speeds. The relative ease with which electrical power can be distributed throughout the aircraft opens up numerous other possibilities for new aircraft and propulsion configurations and modes of operation. This paper discusses a number of these new possibilities. The Boeing N 2 hybrid-wing-body (HWB) is used as a baseline aircraft for this study. The two pylon mounted conventional turbofans are replaced by two wing-tip mounted turboshaft engines, each driving a superconducting generator. Both generators feed a common electrical bus which distributes power to an array of superconducting <b>motor-driven</b> <b>fans</b> in a continuous nacelle centered along the trailing edge of the upper surface of the wing-body. A key finding was that traditional inlet performance methodology has to be modified when most of the air entering the inlet is boundary layer air. A very thorough and detailed propulsion/airframe integration (PAI) analysis is required at the very beginning of the design process since embedded engine inlet performance must be based on conditions at the inlet lip rather than freestream conditions. Examination of a range of fan pressure ratios yielded a minimum Thrust-specific-fuel-consumption (TSFC) at the aerodynamic design point of the vehicle (31, 000 ft /Mach 0. 8) between 1. 3 and 1. 35 FPR. We deduced that this was due to the higher pressure losses prior to the fan inlet as well as higher losses in the 2 -D inlets and nozzles. This FPR is likely to be higher than the FPR that yields a minimum TSFC in a pylon mounted engine. ...|$|R
40|$|At most {{industrial}} facilities, motor loads {{associated with}} pumps and fans are the dominant electric energy users. As plant loads and consequent system functions change, the optimal operating conditions for these components change. In response, modifications to system operations are often made {{with only one}} consideration in mind - keeping the system on line. At the Y- 12 plant in Oak Ridge, a fluid system energy efficiency improvement methodology is being developed to facilitate the systematic review and modification of system design and operations to increase operational efficiency. Since {{the bulk of the}} changes are associated with reducing the numbers and/or loads of <b>motor-driven</b> pumps or <b>fans,</b> there are direct benefits in reduced electrical generation and consequent waste heat production and air emissions. This paper will discuss the types of inefficiencies that tend to evolve as system functional requirements change and equipment ages, describe some of the fundamental parameters that are useful in identifying these inefficiencies, provide examples of design and operating changes being made, and detail the resultant savings in energy...|$|R
