Although gynaecological and psychological inspections as well as citologic and genetic tests on biological specimens were carried out, no blood or urine samples were collected for toxicological analyses. A month later we were requested from the victim to analyse her hair in an attempt to identify the sedative drug(s) involved. Barbiturates were for the first time detected in hair matrix...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{patients}} with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were studied. As a control group we used 6 surgical patients who underwent <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operation</b> (inguinal hernia). For both groups the same sample collection and analysis was used. The presence of leuktorienes (LTs) B 4 and C 4 and of their isomers 11 -trans LTC 4 and delta 6 -trans- 12 -epi LTB 4 was determined in arterial, mixed venous blood and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The samples, analysed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), showed a similar chromatographic picture among ARDS patients, while the control group showed no detectable amounts of LTs in BAL or blood. The distribution of these arachidonic acid metabolites in mixed venous blood, arterial blood and BAL seems to suggest pulmonary metabolism and/or inactivation. It is suggested that these mediators act as humoral factors in pathogenesis of the ARDS...|$|E

50|$|The {{hemostatic}} {{efficacy of}} desmopressin, an analog of vasopressin, was first discovered in Italy in 1977 by Mannucci and colleagues. This substance, when administered intravenously or intranasally, elevates factor VIII levels transiently, {{and was found}} to be useful in treating minor bleeding episodes or in preventing postoperative hemorrhage when given prior to <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> in patients with mild to moderate hemophilia or some types of von Willebrand disease. Lusher introduced the hemostatic use of desmopressin to the United States. After first trying it on herself and her colleagues, and documenting the rise of factor VIII levels, she proceeded to use it in patients with hemophilia and von Willebrand disease, and reported its efficacy. Desmopressin was finally approved for use in hemophilia and von Willebrand disease by the FDA in 1984.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of dexmedetomidine on shivering during spinal anesthesia. METHODS: Sixty patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, aged 18 - 50 years), scheduled for elective <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> under spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine, were enrolled. They were administered saline (group C, n = 30) or dexmedetomidine (group D, n = 30). Motor block was assessed using a Modified Bromage Scale. The presence of shivering was assessed by a blinded observer after the completion of subarachnoid drug injection. RESULTS: Hypothermia was observed in 21 patients (70 %) in group D and in 20 patients (66. 7 %) in group C (p = 0. 781). Three patients (10 %) in group D and 17 patients (56. 7 %) in group C experienced shivering (p = 0. 001). The intensity of shivering was lower in group D than in group C (p = 0. 001). Time from baseline to onset of shivering was 10 (5 - 15) min in group D and 15 (5 - 45) min in group C (p = 0. 207). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine infusion in the perioperative period significantly reduced shivering associated with spinal anesthesia during <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> procedures without any major adverse effect during the perioperative period. Therefore, we conclude that dexmedetomidine infusion is an effective drug for preventing shivering and providing sedation in patients during spinal anesthesia...|$|R
50|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that {{insertion}} and use of the standard tracheal tube is easy, providing a clear airway in the majority of cases. Comparative studies indicate that the standard laryngeal tube is generally as effective as the laryngeal mask airway, while some studies indicate that the Pro-seal laryngeal mask may be more effective than the standard laryngeal tube under controlled ventilation conditions in general anaesthesia.The indications and contraindications for use of the laryngeal tube {{are similar to those of}} the laryngeal mask airway and include the use in general anaesthesia for <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b> Several studies describe the usefulness of the device in securing a difficult airway, even in cases where insertion of the laryngeal mask had failed. The double-lumen laryngeal tube-Suction II, with the possibility of placing a gastric tube, has been found to have distinct advantages over the standard laryngeal tube and has been recommended as a first-line device to secure the airway in emergency situations when direct laryngoscopy fails in neonates and infants. The laryngeal tube is also recommended for medical personnel not experienced in tracheal intubation, and as a rescue device when intubation has failed in adults. According to the manufacturer the use of Laryngeal tubes is contraindicated in people with an intact gag reflex, known oesophageal disease, and people who have ingested caustic substances.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the concentration of serotonin (5 -HT) and related metabolites in human blood and CSF have been studies. Plasma tryptophan (TP), 5 -HT, 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA), and indoleacetic acid (IAA), whole-blood 5 -HT, and CSF TP, 5 -HT, 5 -HIAA, IAA, homovanillic acid, and 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylethylene glycol were determined in 35 unmedicated outpatients who underwent <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> and had no history of psychiatric or neurological illnesses. Significant correlations {{were found between the}} serotoninergic parameters analyzed in blood and CSF. Plasma free 5 -HT correlated significantly with CSF 5 -HT (r= 0. 411, p < 0. 02), and plasma 5 -HIAA correlated with the CSF 5 -HIAA/ 5 -HT ratio (r= 0. 508, p < 0. 004). The concentration of 5 -HIAA in CSF correlated with the plasma 5 -HIAA/ 5 -HT ratio (r= 0. 405, p < 0. 026) (which can be taken as an index of monoamine oxidase type A activity in peripheral tissues) and with the platelet 5 -HT/plasma 5 -HT ratio (r= 0. 375, p < 0. 05). The concentrations of IAA in CSF and plasma were strongly correlated (r= 0. 899, p < 0. 001). The significance of these results and their relationship to the use of “in vivo”measures of 5 -HT and related metabolites in plasma and platelets as an index of serotoninergic function in affective disorders are discussed.

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesGuillain–Barré Syndrome {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of acute {{polyneuropathy}} in adults. Recently, the occurrence of Guillain–Barré Syndrome after major and <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> has been increasingly debated. In Guillain–Barré syndrome, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and dysautonomy are generally observed after maximal motor deficit. Case reportA 44 -year-old male patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. After the development of a severe headache, nausea, diplopia, and attacks of hypertension in the early postoperative period, a computer tomography of the brain was normal. Laboratory tests revealed hyponatremia linked to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, the patient's fluids were restricted, and furosemide and 3 % NaCl treatment was initiated. On the second day postoperative, the patient developed numbness moving upward from the hands and feet, loss of strength, difficulty swallowing and respiratory distress. Guillain–Barré syndrome was suspected, and the patient was moved to intensive care. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed 320 mg/dL protein, and acute motor-sensorial axonal neuropathy was identified by electromyelography. Guillain–Barré syndrome was diagnosed, and intravenous immune globulin treatment (0. 4 g/kg/day, 5 days) was initiated. After 10 days in the intensive care unit, at which the respiratory, hemodynamic, neurologic and laboratory results returned to normal, the patient was transferred to the neurology service. ConclusionsOur case report indicates that although syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and autonomic dysfunction are rarely the initial characteristics of Guillain–Barré syndrome, the possibility of postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion should be kept in mind. The presence of secondary hyponatremia in this type of clinical presentation may delay diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Using G. 29. 505 the {{incidence}} of excitatory phenomena occurring after premedication with atropine and opiate was insignificantly different from that after atropine alone, whereas after hyoscine it was three times as high. Respiratory disturbances were signifi-cantly less frequent when an opiate was used with atropine than after atropine or hyoscine alone. G. 29. 505 was compared with nitrous oxide and oxygen for use in minor procedures. It did not prolong the time required, but {{was followed by a}} much higher incidence of brief but troublesome restlessness. Vein damage was much more frequent than after methohexitone or thiopentone. Previous papers in this series have confirmed the findings of Continental workers that 2 -methoxyl- 4 -allylphenoxyacetic acid—N, N-diethylamide (G. 29. 505) is an intravenous anaesthetic of con-siderable interest. Unfortunately, the advantages which this drug possesses over the rapidly acting barbiturates are more than outweighed by the high incidence of venous damage following its use. In this paper the relationship is examined between {{the incidence}} of side effects accompany-ing the induction of anaesthesia with G. 29. 505, and the drugs used in premedication. A further study has been carried out to compare its useful-ness as the sole anaesthetic for the performance of <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations</b> in outpatients with that of the commonly used inhalation technique of nitrous oxide and oxygen, with or without volatile supplements (trichloroethylene or halothane) as required. The results of a close examination, by three different observers, of damage to veins consequent on the use of various preparations and concentra-tions of G. 29. 505 are reported, and these are com-pared with the vein damage observed after the use of thiopentone and methohexitone...|$|R
40|$|The colonoscopic {{examination}} is no only {{a diagnostic}} method, {{but also a}} therapeutic method applied in gastroenterology. The colonoscopic examination is performed by the flexible endoscope {{and it is possible}} to examine the whole mucous membrane of the large intestine and to perform here also <b>minor</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>operations.</b> The necessity for the colonoscopic examination is as perfect as possible defecation of intestines, however, also this depends on the sufficient knowledge of the patient of the examination performance and preparation. This examination is quite stressing and strenuous for the patients. The target of the thesis was to find out the difference in knowledge of clients indicated for colonoscopy within hospitalization and clients coming as outpatients. 2 hypotheses were postulated: Hypothesis 1 : The scope of information of dietary measures before colonoscopy provided to hospitalized clients is different than the scope of information provided to ambulatory clients". The hypothesis 2 : The scope of information about the procedure of the examination before the colonoscopy provided to hospitalized clients is different than the scope of information provided to ambulatory clients". The method of questioning - technology of a questionnaire was applied to the collection of data. The questionnaire was completely anonymous and was determined for patients indicated to colonoscopic examination. The questionnaire included 22 closed and half-closed questions. 130 questionnaires were distributed in the gastro-enterologic ward in the Hospital of České Budějovice a. s. After returning the questionnaires and elimination of the incompletely filled in and empty questionnaires, the examined group consisted of 106 respondents, thereof 53 were ambulatory respondents and 53 hospitalized respondents. The target of the thesis was achieved. It followed from the results that both hypotheses were confirmed, there is really a certain difference in knowledge before the colonoscopic examination between the ambulatory and hospitalized respondents. In both hypotheses, the ambulatory respondents were informed better. This bachelor´s thesis points out the importance of giving the information to the patients and of co-operation between the patient, nurse and physician. To improve the knowledge of patients indicated for colonoscopy I created the draft of a leaflet, summarizing information the patient should know before this examination. The results of this thesis will be provided to the head and management of gastro-enterologic ward of the Hospital České Budějovice a. s.
