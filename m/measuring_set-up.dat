Despite the existence of many extensive programmes, there are few results concerning actual effects, at the hillside scale, of rehabilitation practices.

The measures included, on the basis of ecological features and human uses, live-hedges, stone bunds and improved cropping practices. The hydrological survey, based upon the paired watershed technique, gives evidence of land conservation, rather than land restoration, due to these developments. The efficiency of the hedges is mainly due to the favourable planting conditions. The proposed cropping practices were adopted by farmers to varying degrees, and field monitoring showed no actual effect on average crop production. To improve the cost/benefit ratio, the scientific staff should have emphasized, for the attention of the farmers, the necessary linkage between fertility restoration and runoff control.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} a new experimental procedure for calibrating the permeability measuring 1 -D flow set-up used routinely by the composites processing community using the liquid composite molding {{processes such as}} RTM and VARTM. A reference porous medium consisting of a bank of parallel cylindrical holes is created in an aluminum plate whose theoretical permeability is computed using the Hagen–Poiseuille flow equation and whose numerical permeability is estimated using Fluent. It is observed that the deviation of the experimentally measured permeability from the theoretical {{as well as the}} numerical permeabilities increases with the flow rate for an injection set-up using a gear pump as well as a piston-cylinder pump. The cause of permeability deviation is traced to opening of a small gap above the rigid reference porous medium due to high pressures at higher flow rates. However no such deviation is observed while measuring the permeability of a fiber mat at different flow rates. So the proposed reference porous medium can calibrate a conventional 1 -D flow based permeability <b>measuring</b> <b>set-ups</b> at low flow rates; the accuracy thus obtained can be extended to higher flow rates as well if permeability of a fiber mat can be shown to remain constant with the flow rate...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{large-scale}} {{development of}} carbon geological storage requires the safety demonstration of this technology. The European Directive on the geological storage {{of carbon dioxide}} specifies the safety strategy to be adopted. Notably, a corrective measure plan is {{required in order to}} mitigate the potential "significant irregularities". In this paper, we describe one measure that could be applied in case of an unexpected abnormal behavior of the gas plume (e. g. leakage of CO 2). The objective is to trap the mobile gaseous CO 2 as quickly as possible; among all the trapping mechanisms occurring after CO 2 injection, capillarity trapping is the fastest and we then focused on its enhancement and improvement. The intervention strategy consists in injecting brine through the former CO 2 injection well in order to accelerate the wetting of the CO 2 plume. We run simulations through a 1 D-axisymetric model in order to evaluate the efficiency of such a measure; the results are sensitive towards brine injection rates and other site-specific key parameters but, in any case, the <b>measure</b> <b>set-up</b> leads to a rapid immobilization of the gaseous CO 2 in comparison with a simple relaxation. The consequences of the pressure build-up in terms of hydraulic and mechanic risks are not critical in the base case simulation conditions and thus do not compromise the applicability of the corrective measure...|$|R

It requires wide band ultra-low noise amplifiers, analogy filters, optimization of {{signal to noise ratio}} of sensors and the application of noise elimination methods. The analyses of noise sources in sensors and preamplifiers are given. They are thermal noise, polarization noise and low frequency 1 /f noise. <b>Measuring</b> <b>set-up</b> background noise suppression also involving the electromagnetic shielding allows us to detect signals in the range of 1 to 100 nV.

AE and EME signals show different behaviour in the first interval of about 20 μs, just after the crack creation. For the first stage of crack creation, the frequency spectrum of EME signal is given by the eigen vibrations of crack walls, by the internal friction and the sample electrical conductivity. We observed that the crack opening and crack wall vibration create the high frequency signal in the frequency band up to 10 MHz. These signals were observed in the first time interval of about 20 μs.

Present ultrasonic non-destructive testing methods are very sophistic, {{but they have}} some limitations for practice use. For example, it is an impossibility integral testing procedure, time demanding or practically infeasible testing of solids with inhomogenous materials or with complicate forms. In such examples {{it is possible to}} utilize measuration of non-linear effects of wave propagation and creation of higher harmonic signals in the vicinity of defects. This paper describes <b>measuring</b> <b>set-up</b> method for non-linear effects determination. First, the short summary and comparison of various methods of nonlinear ultrasound spectroscopy is shown. It was chosen the CV method with one pure harmonic exciting signal and with evaluating of 2 nd and 3 rd harmonic element as a quantity of nonlinearity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Radial flow {{experiment}} {{is often used}} to measure the permeability of fibrous porous media by the composites processing community. However, very little work has been done to calibrate the radial flow set-up with media of known permeability. This article presents a new method for calibrating the permeability <b>measuring</b> <b>set-ups</b> based on radial flows. A reference medium in the form of two concentric annular slits is created for the radial flow mold whose permeability is estimated analytically and numerically. It is observed that the experimentally measured permeability deviates from the theoretical and numerical permeabilities with an increase in the flow rate for an injection setup using a gear pump as well as a piston-cylinder pump. The deviation can be attributed to two possible reasons: one is the leakage between the calibration device and mold plate surfaces because of a slight mold deformation at higher flow rates, the other one is the increase in the gap clearance of the reference medium because of the higher gap pressures at higher flow rates. No such deviation is observed while measuring the permeability of a fiber mat at different flow rates. Hence, the proposed reference medium can calibrate a conventional radial flow-based permeability measuring setups at low flow rates; the accuracy thus obtained can be extended to higher flow rates as well if permeability of a fiber mat can be shown to remain constant with the flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Background: Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) {{can be used}} as biomarkers in exhaled air. VOC profiles can be detected by an array of nanosensors of an electronic nose. These profiles can be analysed using bioinformatics. It is, however, not known whether different devices of the same model measure identically and to which extent different set-ups and the humidity of the inhaled air influence the VOC profile. Methods: Three different <b>measuring</b> <b>set-ups</b> were designed and three healthy control subjects were measured with each of them, using four devices of the same model (Cyranose 320 ™, Smiths Detection). The exhaled air was collected in a plastic bag. Either ambient air was used as reference (set-up Leipzig), or the reference air was humidified (100 % relative humidity) (set-up Marburg and set-up Munich). In the set-up Marburg the subjects inhaled standardised medical air (Aer medicinalis Linde, AGA AB) out of a compressed air bottle through a demand valve; this air (after humidification) was also used as reference. In the set-up Leipzig the subjects inhaled VOC-filtered ambient air, in the set-up Munich unfiltered room air. The data were evaluated using either the real-time data or the changes in resistance as calculated by the device. Results: The results were clearly dependent on the set-up. Apparently, humidification of the reference air could reduce the variance between devices, but this result was also dependent on the evaluation method used. When comparing the three subjects, the set-ups Munich and Marburg mapped these in a similar way, whereas not only the signals but also the variance of the set-up Leipzig were larger. Conclusion: Measuring VOCs with an electronic nose has not yet been standardised and the set-up significantly affects the results. As other researchers use further methods, it is currently not possible to draw generally accepted conclusions. More systematic tests are required to find the most sensitive and reliable but still feasible set-up so that comparability is improved...|$|R

In this study, we <b>measured</b> <b>set-up</b> deviations and evaluated different MVCT protocols for brain and head and neck (H&N) cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The daily set-up errors of 75 H&N cancer patients immobilized with 5 -point fixation thermoplastic masks and 30 brain cancer patients immobilized with 3 -point fixation thermoplastic masks were detected by matching the MVCT with the treatment planning CT images. This co-registration procedure was accomplished automatically by the system's software (automatic deviations), then corrected manually by the radiation therapists (total deviations). Systematic and random errors were analyzed on a patient and a population basis. Moreover, 2 MVCT protocols were retrospectively evaluated; MVCTs were either acquired during the first five fractions (FFFs) or on alternate week (ALT). Systematic deviations were calculated based upon prior "MVCT" fractions and applied during the "non-MVCT" fractions. The resulting residual deviations were then analyzed. RESULTS: The total systematic (and random) deviations reached 1. 7 mm (1. 4 mm), 1. 6 mm (1. 5 mm), 1. 5 mm (1. 5 mm) and 0. 6 degrees (0. 6 degrees) for H&N cancer patients and reached 1. 6 mm (0. 9 mm), 1. 7 mm (1. 1 mm), 1. 1 mm (0. 8 mm) and 0. 9 degrees (0. 6 degrees) for brain cancer patients in the m-l, c-c, a-p and roll directions, respectively. A t-test detected small but {{statistically significant differences between}} the automatic and total deviations. Both MVCT protocols gave rise to similar residual deviations. However, for H&N cancer patients the ALT protocol resulted in smaller residual deviations and CTV-PTV margins, particularly in the a-p direction. CONCLUSION: The total systematic and random deviations were comparable to the previously published data. No clinical difference exists between the automatic and total deviations. Both MVCT protocols were similar. But, for H&N cancer patients, the ALT protocol gave rise to smaller residual deviations and therefore is the correct formula to adopt {{in order to reduce the}} frequency of pre-treatment MVCTs...|$|R
