5000|$|J.A. Topf and Sons (J.A. Topf & Söhne) was an {{engineering}} company, founded in 1878 in Erfurt, Germany by Johannes Andreas Topf (1816-1891). It made heating systems and brewing and <b>malting</b> <b>equipment,</b> and later, silos, chimneys, incinerators for burning municipal waste, and crematoria. During World War I it made weapons shells, limbers (carts for carrying artillery) {{and other military}} vehicles. In World War II it also made weapons shells and aircraft parts for the Luftwaffe. [...] It is now infamous as the largest of 12 companies that designed and built crematoria ovens for concentration camps and extermination camps during the Holocaust, planned and {{carried out by the}} Nazi regime from 1935 to 1945. The company not only made crematoria ovens, it also made ventilation systems for the gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau.|$|E
50|$|The Obolon Corporation {{has its own}} malting plant able {{to produce}} 120,000 tonnes of malt per year. The <b>malting</b> plant uses <b>equipment</b> from the German company Schmidt-Seeger. Obolon uses the malt in its own {{products}} and exports it.|$|R
50|$|On 1 March 1946 {{the firm}} was given a large {{contract}} for <b>malting</b> and brewing <b>equipment</b> by the reparations department of the Soviet miltary, however a few days later, four engineers of the firm were arrested. These were Kurt Prüfer, Fritz Sander (1876-1946), Karl Schultze (1900-died after 1955) and Gustav Braun (1889-1958). Braun, also a qualified engineer, was the factory's production manager.|$|R

The goal {{of our research}} was to develop brewery products made of domestically grown millet (Alföldi 1) and buckwheat (Oberon) {{that are similar to}} traditional beer of barley malt regarding taste, aroma, consistency, colour, foam stability and alcohol content. On a micromalting <b>equipment</b> <b>malts</b> were made of buckwheat and millet. Beer was produced on pilot plant scale (50 l) with decoction process (mashing program with rests at 50 °C, 65 °C and 72 °C) and was supplemented with a highly heat-stable bacterial α-amylase, a fungal α-amylase and β-glucanase. Malts were evaluated by congress mashing (extract content, extract difference, pH, and colour); wort and final beer analyses were performed as well (pH, extract, iodine test, FAN, colour, bitterness, alcohol and extract content). Finally, sensory characterization was carried out. Difficulties with lautering were encountered during the brewing process with buckwheat. The analytical results indicated that the buckwheat and millet beer had different values compared with a typical barley beer with regard to pH, FAN, fermentability, and total alcohol. The extracts of the buckwheat and millet wort were lower, resulting in a final attenuation of 61. 5 % and 73. 2 %. In laboratory experiments optimal temperature of β-amylase found in domestically grown buckwheat (64 °C) and millet (62 °C) was determined by detecting maltose production with HPLC. Data was used to set the rest temperature of the enzyme during mashing. Inhibiting effect of certain substances on proteolytic enzymes was investigated by measuring the extract, FAN, and soluble nitrogen contents. Inhibition was detected in case of both raw materials, although to a different extent. Inhibition is influenced by tannins and polyphenols found in the grain (Chethan et al., 2008) ...|$|R
