5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away. The nanny was discharged after her <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> the children was discovered.|$|E

The increasing number of newly independent African nations after World War II, coupled with the ongoing <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> the indigenous population, encouraged the growth of nationalist sentiments within Mozambique.|$|E

Results indicated that guilt attribution, distrust, need of reparations, religion, and perception of apology relate to forgiving past racial offenses. In addition the more individuals experience racism related events, the less likely they forgive the past <b>mistreatments</b> <b>of</b> African Americans.

5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> their horses, most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York.

5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|Changeling is a 2008 American mystery thriller film directed, co-produced {{and scored}} by Clint Eastwood and written by J.

The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop Murders in Mira Loma, California. The film stars Angelina Jolie as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this {{to the police and}} city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother, and then confined to a psychiatric ward.|$|E

5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1925, Houphouët {{began his}} career as a doctor's aide at a {{hospital}} in Abidjan, where he founded an association of indigenous medical personnel. This undertaking proved short-lived as the colonial administration viewed it unsympathetically, considering it a trade union. As a consequence, they decided to move Houphouët to a lesser hospital in Guiglo on 27 April 1927. After he proved his considerable talents, however, he was promoted on 17 September 1929 to a post in Abengourou, which until then had been reserved for Europeans. At Abengourou, Houphouët witnessed the <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> indigenous cocoa farmers by the colonists.|$|E

The wounds he received from the bombing were directly responsible for the heart attack that killed him.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{concerns}} {{the occurrence of}} various forms <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment</b> by staff and fellow students experienced by students in the Faculty of Medicine and the other four faculties of the University of Oulu, Finland. Methods A questionnaire with 51 questions on various forms of physical and psychological mistreatment was distributed to 665 students (451 females) after lectures or examinations and filled in and returned. The results were analysed by gender and faculty. The differences between the males and females were assessed statistically using a test for the equality of two proportions. An exact two-sided P value was calculated using a mid-P approach to Fisher's exact test (the null hypothesis being {{that there is no}} difference between the two proportions). Results About half of the students answering the questionnaire had experienced some form <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment</b> by staff during their university studies, most commonly humiliation and contempt (40 %), negative or disparaging remarks (34 %), yelling and shouting (23 %), sexual harassment and other forms <b>of</b> gender-based <b>mistreatment</b> (17 %) and tasks assigned as punishment (13 %). The students in the Faculty of Medicine reported every form <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment</b> more commonly than those in the Faculties of Humanities, Education, Science and Technology. Experiences <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment</b> varied, but clear messages regarding its patterns were to be found in each faculty. Female students reported more instances <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment</b> than males and were more disturbed by them. Professors, lecturers and other staff in particular mistreated female students more than they mistreated males. About half of the respondents reported some form <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment</b> by their fellow students. Conclusion Students in the Faculty of Medicine reported the greatest amount <b>of</b> <b>mistreatment.</b> If a faculty mistreats its students, its success in the main tasks of universities, research, teaching and learning, will be threatened. The results challenge university teachers, especially in faculties of medicine, to evaluate their ability to create a safe environment conducive to learning. </p...|$|R

Bottsworth, however, became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, and they terminated their relationship in January 1885.

5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's <b>mistreatment</b> <b>of</b> her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
