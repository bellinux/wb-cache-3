5|$|This <b>multi-storied</b> ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff {{dwelling}} in Mesa Verde, {{is located in}} the largest alcove {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.|$|E
25|$|Taos Pueblo's most {{prominent}} architectural feature is a <b>multi-storied</b> residential complex of reddish-brown adobe, built {{on either side}} of the Rio Pueblo. The Pueblo's website states it was probably built between 1000 and 1450.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Red Army re-entered Riga on 13 October 1944. In the {{following}} years the massive influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel, and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. Microdistricts of the large <b>multi-storied</b> housing blocks were built to house immigrant workers. By 1989, the percentage of Latvians in Riga had fallen to 36.5%.|$|E
25|$|For {{those who}} prefer to enjoy nature {{from the comfort of}} a chair, the city's public library is nestled in a serene and scenic {{location}} at the edge of Old Mill Park where visitors may relax indoors near the wood-burning fireplace and view the redwood forest through the library's <b>multi-storied</b> windows, or from the outside deck which overlooks the park and Cascade Creek.|$|E
25|$|The Stelae (hawilt/hawilti {{in local}} languages) {{are perhaps the}} most {{identifiable}} part of the Aksumite legacy. These stone towers served to mark graves and represent a magnificent <b>multi-storied</b> palace. They are decorated with false doors and windows in typical Aksumite design. The largest of these towering obelisks would measure 33 meters high had it not fallen. The Stelae have most of their mass out of the ground, but are stabilized by massive underground counter-weights. The stone was often engraved with a pattern or emblem denoting the king's or the noble's rank.|$|E
25|$|The {{city life}} of Kollam has changed greatly {{in the last}} {{previous}} decade. In terms of economic performance and per capita income, Kollam city is in 5th position from India and third in Kerala. Kollam is famous as a city with excellent export background. 5 star, 4 star and 3 star hotels, <b>multi-storied</b> shopping malls, branded jewelleries, textile showrooms and car showrooms have started operations {{in the city and}} suburbs. Kollam was the third city in Kerala (after Kozhikode and Kochi) to adopt the shopping mall culture. Kollam district ranks first in livestock wealth in the state. Downtown Kollam is the main CBD of Kollam city.|$|E
25|$|Corfu's urban {{architecture}} {{differs from}} that of other major Greek cities, because of Corfu's unique history. From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the Republic of Venice, with <b>multi-storied</b> buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the World Heritage Sites in Greece. It was in the Venetian period that the city saw the erection of the first opera house (Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù) in Greece, but it was badly damaged during World War II by German artillery.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, various {{industrial}} enterprises and governmental institutions developed in Salaspils, {{such as the}} nuclear plant and four branches of the Academy of Science. Large <b>multi-storied</b> housing blocks appeared to house incoming power plant workers, {{many of whom were}} Russians. In a few decades Salaspils transformed from a very peaceful rural settlement to a mikroraion-style town. Due to the rapid development, Soviet authorities ordered construction of the Riga HES and Riga TEC-2. The dam created a massive reservoir that flooded monuments of Salaspils ancient history. The last unsubmerged sections of old Salaspils have been preserved at Salaspils railway station.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a Hindu {{temple in}} Lahore was {{destroyed}} {{to pave the}} way for construction of a <b>multi-storied</b> commercial building. When reporters from Pakistan-based newspaper Dawn tried to cover the incident, they were accosted by the henchmen of the property developer, who denied that a Hindu temple existed at the site. In January 2014, a policeman standing guard outside a Hindu temple at Peshawar was gunned down. The 25 March 2014 Express Tribune citing a All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement (PHRM) survey said that 95% of all Hindu temples in Pakistan have been converted since 1990. Pakistanis attack Hindu temples if anything happens to any mosque in neighbouring India.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the role in management of the Employees' Councils (which the workers' committees were transformed into after being properly constituted, with democratic elections supervised by the Elections Commission), commuter organisations were included in an advisory role. The services were expanded and measures were taken to improve efficiency, including rationalising bus types. The CTB started buying buses from the Isuzu Company of Japan, to offset any cartelisation by Tata and Ashok Leyland, the main suppliers, and also purchased Ikarus buses from Hungary. Several new bus stands and bus depots were established. A modern, <b>multi-storied</b> bus station was planned at the CBS, complete with hotel and cinema, but this would never be completed.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, it {{was clear}} that {{urbanisation}} had spilled over the current boundaries, and in 1986, the Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority, was established to co-ordinate the development of the entire region as a single unit. On 8 February 1981, a major fire broke out at Venus Circus in Bangalore, where more than 92 lives were lost, the majority of them being children. Bangalore experienced a growth in its real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by capital investors {{from other parts of the}} country who converted Bangalore's large plots and colonial bungalows into <b>multi-storied</b> apartments. In 1985, Texas Instruments became the first multinational corporation to set up base in Bangalore. Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had established itself as the Silicon Valley of India. Today, Bangalore is India's third most populous city. During the 21st century, Bangalore has suffered terrorist attacks in 2008, 2010, and 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The British Army {{occupied}} Ramallah in December 1917 {{during the}} war years. Following the First World War, it was designated as a mandate territory and under British rule until 1948. The economy improved in the 1920s, and the landed aristocracy and merchants of the Palestinian upper class built stately <b>multi-storied</b> villas, many of which still stand. The Jerusalem Electric Company brought electricity to Ramallah in 1936, and most homes were wired shortly thereafter. The same year the British inaugurated the [...] "Palestine Broadcasting Service" [...] in Ramallah. The British Broadcasting Corporation trained the local staff to deliver daily broadcasts in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. The station was later renamed [...] "Kol Yerushalayim" [...] (The Voice of Jerusalem).|$|E
2500|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone for}} the new <b>multi-storied</b> building now housing the High Court of Kerala was laid on 14 March 1994 by the then Chief Justice of India, Justice M. N. Venkatachaliah. The estimated cost of construction was 10 crore Indian rupees. The construction was completed in 2005 {{at a cost of}} 85 crore Indian rupees. The completed High Court building was inaugurated by the Chief Justice of India, Justice Y. K. Sabharwal on 11 February 2006. The new High Court building is equipped with modern amenities like videoconferencing, air conditioned courtrooms, intranet, facilities for retrieval of order copies and publishing of the case status via the internet. The building is built on [...] of land and has a built-up area of [...] over nine floors. The building has in it a post office, bank, medical clinic, library, canteens and such other most needed utilities and services. The High Court of Kerala has moved to its new building from the date of its inauguration, from the adjacent Ram Mohan Palace, where it had been functioning.|$|E
2500|$|Walled and moated {{cities with}} large gates and <b>multi-storied</b> {{buildings}} which consistently used arched {{windows and doors}} are important features of the architecture during this period. The Indian emperor Ashoka (rule: 273—232 BCE) established a chain of hospitals throughout the Mauryan empire by 230 BCE. One of the edicts of Ashoka (272—231 BCE) reads: [...] "Everywhere King Piyadasi (Ashoka) erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for animals. Where there were no healing herbs for people and animals, he ordered that they be bought and planted." [...] Indian art and culture has absorbed extraneous impacts by varying degrees and is much richer for this exposure. This cross fertilization between different art streams converging on the subcontinent produced new forms that, while retaining {{the essence of the}} past, succeeded in the integrating selected elements of the new influences. A long tradition of art and culture was already established well before the beginning of 20th century in India. Indian painting can be broadly divided into two categories — murals and miniature.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{third of the}} Spanish period, two massive fires burned the great {{majority}} of the city's buildings. [...] The Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 destroyed 856 buildings in the city on Good Friday, March 21 of that year. [...] In December 1794 another fire destroyed 212 buildings. [...] After the fires, the city was rebuilt with bricks, replacing the simpler wooden buildings constructed in the early colonial period. Much of the 18th-century architecture still present in the French Quarter was built during this time, including three of the most impressive structures in New OrleansSt. Louis Cathedral, the Cabildo and the Presbytere. While the architecture from this period is commonly attributed to French influence, characteristics of the French Quarter, such as <b>multi-storied</b> buildings centered around inner courtyards, large arched doorways, and the use of decorative wrought-iron, were most ubiquitous in parts of Spain and the Spanish colonies. This influence may be attributed {{to the fact that the}} period of Spanish rule saw a great deal of immigration from all over the Atlantic, including Spain and the Canary Islands, and the Spanish colonies. In addition, although the architectural style of New Orleans, with its wrought iron balconies and full-height windows may remind one of Paris, many of New Orleans's oldest buildings actually predate the Haussman Projects that later renovated large areas of Paris in this same style.|$|E
2500|$|The {{architecture}} of Corfu City still reflects its long Venetian heritage, with its <b>multi-storied</b> buildings, its spacious squares {{such as the}} popular [...] "Spianada" [...] and the narrow cobblestone alleys known as [...] "Kantounia". The town began to grow during the Venetian period on a low hillock situated between the two forts. In many respects, Corfu typifies the small Venetian town, or borgo, {{of which there are}} numerous other surviving examples in the former Venetian territories of the Adriatic Sea, such as Ragusa and Spalato in Dalmatia. As in Venice itself, the [...] "campi" [...] developed haphazardly in the urban fabric where it was natural for residents to congregate, especially around churches, civic buildings, fountains, and cisterns. The best example of such a space is Plateia Dimarcheiou ("Town Hall Square"), overlooked on its north side by the 17th century Loggia dei Nobili (which today serves as the seat of the local government) and on the east side by the late sixteenth century Catholic Church of St. Iakovos, or St. James. The Italian Renaissance is best represented on Corfu by the surviving structures of the Fortezza Vecchia (the Old Fortress) on {{the eastern side of the}} town, built by the Veronese military engineer Michele Sanmicheli and the Venetian Ferrante Vitelli, who also designed the later fortress on the west, the Fortezza Nuova.|$|E
2500|$|Tourism {{more or less}} {{disappeared}} during World War II, Indonesian National Revolution and in {{the early}} years of the Sukarno era. On 1 July 1947, the government of Republic of Indonesia tried to revive tourism sector in Indonesia by establishing HONET (Hotel National & Tourism) led by R. Tjitpo Ruslan. This new national tourism authority took over many of the colonial heritage hotels in Java and renamed them all [...] "Hotel Merdeka". After Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference in 1949, this tourism authority changed its name to NV HORNET. In 1952 the President formed the Inter-Departement Committee on Tourism Affairs which is responsible for reestablishing Indonesia as the world's tourism destination. National pride and identity in the late 1950s and early 1960s was incorporated into the monumentalism of Sukarno in Jakarta and this included the development of grand <b>multi-storied</b> international standard hotels and beach resorts, such as Hotel Indonesia in Jakarta (est. 1962), Ambarrukmo Hotel in Yogyakarta (est. 1965), Samudra Beach Hotel in Pelabuhan Ratu beach West Java (est. 1966), and Inna Grand Bali Beach Hotel in Bali (est. 1966). The political and economic instability of the mid-1960s saw tourism decline radically again. Bali, and in particular the small village of Kuta, was however, in the 1960s, an important stopover on the overland hippy trail between Australia and Europe, and a [...] "secret" [...] untouched surf spot.|$|E
