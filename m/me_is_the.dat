5|$|Bleed Like <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth studio album by American-Scottish {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Garbage. It {{was released on}} April 11, 2005 by A Records and Warner Bros. Records. The group chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of Garbage's live performances instead of the electronica that permeated the previous album, Beautiful Garbage (2001).|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who Loved <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ninth {{novel in}} Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E
5|$|All That Is Within <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fifth studio album by American Christian {{rock band}} MercyMe. Produced by Brown Bannister, it was {{released}} on November 20, 2007 through INO Records. The album, intended by the band to be a worship album split between covers and original songs, was recorded following the band's tour with Audio Adrenaline in promotion of their previous studio album Coming Up to Breathe (2006). Although the band intended to write material for a new album during the tour, they had only written one song {{by the time they}} entered their recording studio, Cider Mountain Studio in Athol, Idaho. The band wrote so many songs at the studio that they decided not to include any cover songs; all of the songs on the album but were written or co-written by the band. The album was described as being a rock and worship album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E

5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> basic issue.|$|E

For {{the production of the}} album, Rihanna worked with Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken, StarGate, J. R. Rotem and label-mate Ne-Yo, who wrote the album's second single. A Girl like Me is a pop, reggae and R album influenced by Rihanna's Caribbean roots. The album also incorporates elements of dancehall and rock, as well as ballads, which music critics were ambivalent towards.|$|E

The album is her first studio album in four years since 2006's Fantasia. The album's title was suggested to her by comedian Steve Harvey, when Barrino visited his morning radio program. The album sold 117,000 in its first week, debuting at number two on the US Billboard 200 and at {{number one on the}} Billboard R/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it Fantasia's highest charting album as of September 2010.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{business}} strategy includes increasing international trade. eBay has already expanded to over two dozen countries, including China and India. Strategic international expansion has failed in Taiwan and Japan, where Yahoo! had a head start, and New Zealand, where Trade <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> dominant online auction website. eBay also notably failed in China due to competition from local rival Taobao. eBay entered the Chinese market in 2002 {{and shut down}} its Chinese site in 2007. In India too, eBay's operations {{came to a halt}} after it sold off its India operations to country's largest ecommerce company Flipkart, in the latter's $1.4Bn fundraise, where eBay was a participant too.|$|E

25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

500|$|In 2003 Bullen made {{a journey}} to Perth's Small Screen Big Picture. On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always interested <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what fascinated <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way we arrive at the choices we make. The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E
500|$|Hand is also {{remembered as}} a pioneer of modern {{approaches}} to statutory interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields, such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint. He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the [...] "combination of toleration and imagination that to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> epitome of all good government".|$|E
