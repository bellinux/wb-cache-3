This plan was never followed, however, as he met and married the German minor aristocrat, Frieda Weekley, who was the wife of a former professor of his at the University of Nottingham.

5000|$|Mallik was the {{daughter}} of a barrister. Alice, whom she played when she was thirteen, was her only known professional role, although Miller's adaptation of Lewis Carroll’s mid-19th century fantasy, with its star-studded cast and gothic and bohemian overtones, created quite a stir at the time. Miller had envisaged an Alice [...] "with no stage experience, not very pretty but curiously plain, sallow and a bit priggish" [...] After advertising the part, he cast Mallik within twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> her, having asked her (as Mallik recalled) to recite the poem [...] "You Are Old, Father William" [...] which Alice performs for the Caterpillar. Miller's first impression of her was of a [...] "rather extraordinary, solemn child" [...] who proved to be [...] "naturally expressive" [...] and [...] "not amused by anything was surrounded by". In similar, though less complimentary, vein, the biographer of Peter Cook, who played the Mad Hatter, has described Mallik's Alice as [...] "a sullen, pouting, pubescent with no sense of bewilderment", noting also that, in his view, [...] "the whole piece was strangely lacking in either humour or fear".|$|E
