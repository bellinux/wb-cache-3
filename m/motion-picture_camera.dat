500|$|Filming {{began on}} 27 August 2012 in Mumbai, with filming moving to Oman in September, {{becoming}} the first major Indian production filmed in the sultanate. Footage was shot in beach in Qantab, Qurum, and at the Shangri-La's Barr Al Jissah Resort & Spa in Muscat. The film's visual effects (VFX) were by Reliance MediaWorks, {{and a team of}} 40 artists augmented 600 digital shots in one month. The live action sequences were filmed with RED and Arri's Alexa digital <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera.</b> Once Upon [...] Time in Mumbai Dobaara! was well-promoted, and the film's second trailer was shown on prime-time slots on four television channels.

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} (VFX) were by Reliance MediaWorks, which also {{produced}} computer-generated imagery (CGI) for Balaji Motion Pictures and Luthria for its prequel, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010). Since {{the company was}} also generating VFX for the yet-unreleased Chennai Express (2013) its roster of animators and compositors was divided into two teams. The Once Upon [...] Time in Mumbai Dobaara! team consisted of 40 artists, who augmented 600 digital shots in one month. Luthria informed the company that Dobaara! was set during the 1980s, with car chases requiring visual effects. About 25 percent were shot against chroma key backgrounds, since {{they would have been}} difficult to film otherwise. Scenes in the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in the United Arab Emirates were recreated three-dimensionally with polygonal modeling in Autodesk Maya instead of the live-action plates used for shots in Muscat. Adobe Photoshop and ZBrush were used to add texture to matte paintings in the background and the 3D models. Outdoor shots in Mumbai (such as Colaba Causeway and Ballard Pier) were replaced by interior and exterior live-action plates from Oman. According to Sanjiv Naik, the film's VFX supervisor, the last few scenes were the most difficult ones to shoot. In the last scene where Khan is lying wounded in the cargo hold of a ship, the camera zooms out to reveal the word Mumbai. The VFX shot was captured in 2,000 frames which took 15 days to complete, with the camera panning out only 30 feet in reality. Except for the interior shot of Kumar, the remaining shots were digital. The live action was filmed with RED and Arri's Alexa digital <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Yet here {{beside them}} was the <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera,</b> {{clicking}} steadily away and operated by {{a man in his}} shirt-sleeves who watched the scene with sharp eyes, now frowning and now nodding approval. Beside him at times, but rushing from one point to another just outside the chalk-marks that indicated the [...] "dead line," [...] was the director of this production, who shouted commands in a nervous, excited manner and raged and tore his hair when anything went wrong.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1972, {{concerned}} about the geologic conditions of the Teton River Canyon, USGS geologist David Schleicher wrote about the Bureau of Reclamation’s (BOR) Teton Dam, then under construction in eastern Idaho: “A final point is that flooding in response to seismic or other failure of the dam - probably most likely {{at the time of}} highest water - would make the flood of February 1962 look like small potatoes. Since such a flood could be anticipated, we might consider a series of strategically-placed <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras</b> to document the process.” ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of rotary shutters are naturally used on <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras</b> (as well as projectors), there were some still cameras that employed this type of shutter, notably the Univex Mercury rangefinder and the Olympus Pen F SLR. Both of these cameras were half-frame 35mm cameras (frame size 18 x 24 mm). The rotary shutter proved to be very simple to construct, accurate and reliable in these cameras. Though, {{in the case of the}} Univex, it resulted in a very strange [...] "hump" [...] on top of the camera to cover the shutter disc.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras</b> were {{mounted on}} the thrust {{structure}} of the S-II second stage, for verification of proper staging sequence. Similar cameras were also {{mounted on the}} second Saturn V flight, Apollo 6. The cameras ran at four times normal speed to show the events in slow motion. The camera capsules were jettisoned soon after the first stage separation, {{at an altitude of}} about 200,000 ft. They then reentered the atmosphere, and parachuted to the ocean for recovery. Both S-II cameras from Apollo 4 were recovered, so there is footage {{from both sides of the}} vehicle.|$|R

5000|$|Flaherty was {{determined}} {{to make a new}} film, one following a life of a typical Inuk and his family. In 1920, he secured funds from Revillon Frères, a French fur trade company to shoot what was to become Nanook of the North. On 15 August 1920, Flaherty arrived in Port Harrison, Quebec to shoot his film. He brought two Akeley <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras</b> which the Inuit referred to as [...] "the aggie". He also brought full developing, printing, and projection equipment to show the Inuit his film, while he was {{still in the process of}} filming. He lived in an attached cabin to the Revillon Frères trading post.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted in a supersonic wind tunnel {{to determine the effect}} a sudden high velocity headwind had on the physical deformation and structural breakup characteristics of birds. Several sizes of recently killed birds were dropped into the test section at free-stream Mach numbers ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 8 and photographed with high-speed <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras.</b> These conditions simulated flow conditions encountered when birds are ingested into the inlets of high speed aircraft, thereby constituting a safety hazard to the aircraft and its occupants. The investigation shows that, over the range of headwind conditions tested, the birds remained structurally intact and did not suffer any appreciable deformation or structural breakup...|$|R
40|$|Combustion in a {{spark-ignition}} engine was investigated {{by means of}} the NACA high-speed <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras.</b> This camera is operated at a speed of 40, 000 photographs a second and therefore makes possible the study of changes that take place in the intervals as short as 0. 000025 second. When the motion pictures are projected at the normal speed of 16 frames a second, any rate of movement shown is slowed down 2500 times. Photographs are presented of normal combustion, of combustion from preignitions, and of knock both with and without preignition. The photographs of combustion show that knock may be preceded by a period of exothermic reaction in the end zone that persists for a time interval of as much as 0. 0006 second. The knock takes place in 0. 00005 second or less...|$|R
50|$|Many {{programs}} {{in the early days}} of television were live broadcasts that are lost because they were not recorded. Most prime-time programs that were preserved used the kinescope recording process, which involved filming the live broadcast from a television screen using a <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera</b> (videotape, for recording programs, was not perfected until the late 1950s and was not widely used until the late 1960s). This was also a common practice for broadcasting live TV shows to the west coast, as performers often performed a show back-to-back, but never back-to-back-to-back.|$|E
5000|$|In 1876, Thomas Edison set up {{his home}} and {{research}} laboratory in New Jersey {{on the site of}} an unsuccessful real estate development in Raritan Township called [...] "Menlo Park", (currently located in Edison State Park).

[...] Before his death at age 83 in 1931, the prolific inventor amassed a record 1,093 patents for creations including the phonograph, a stock ticker, the <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera,</b> the incandescent light bulb, a mechanical vote counter, the alkaline storage battery including one for an electric car, and the first commercial electric light.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company, {{manufacturers}} of the Red One, a new digital <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera,</b> offered Jackson {{the chance to}} test their prototype cameras and record some sample footage for the 2007 NAB convention. Jackson instead proposed that he should use the testing time to shoot a short film. In March 2007, staff from Red flew to New Zealand with two of their prototype cameras, nicknamed [...] "Boris" [...] and [...] "Natasha". The film was shot over two days, 30 and 31 March, in Masterton. [...] The short film was shown two weeks later at NAB where it attracted large crowds and long lines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Motion-picture</b> <b>cameras</b> {{conventionally}} film at 24 frames per second. Although {{the wheels}} of a vehicle {{are not likely to}} be turning at 24 revolutions per second (as that would be extremely fast), suppose each wheel has 12 spokes and rotates at only two revolutions per second. Filmed at 24 frames per second, the spokes in each frame will appear in exactly the same position. Hence, the wheel will be perceived to be stationary. In fact, each photographically captured spoke in any one position will be a different actual spoke in each successive frame, but since the spokes are close to identical in shape and color, no difference will be perceived. Thus, as long as the number of times the wheel rotates per second is factor of 24 and 12, the wheel will appear to be stationary.|$|R
5000|$|Konvas (Конвас) is {{the general}} name of {{portable}} 35mm <b>motion-picture</b> <b>cameras</b> that was manufactured in the USSR by KMZ (KRASNOGORSKIY MEKHANICHESKIY ZAVOD - Krasnogorsk Mechanical Works), known as ZENIT camera makers, and later on, MOSKINAP (MOSKOVSKIY ZAVOD KINOAPPARATURIY - Moscow Works of Cinema Equipment (The holder of the Order of the Badge of Honour - Орден «Знак Почета»), at one time in the late 80's had over 2,000 employees; now OAO [...] "MOSKINAP", and {{for a short period}} at the same factory {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union.

50|$|Louis Lumière {{worked with}} his brother Auguste to create a <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera</b> {{superior}} to Thomas Edison's kinetograph, which {{did not have a}} projector. The Lumières endeavored to correct the flaws they perceived in the kinetograph and the kinetoscope, to develop a machine with both sharper images and better illumination. The Cinématographe weighed only 16 lbs., which allowed for ease of transportation and placement. As well, the Cinématographe was manually operated by a hand-crank, as opposed to Edison's electrically powered camera, which was not readily portable. Furthermore, while only {{one person at a time}} could use Edison's kinetoscope for viewing—through an eyepiece, peep show style—the Cinématographe could project an image onto a screen so a large audience of people could view images simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|This book {{covers the}} basics, {{realization}} and materials for {{high power laser}} systems and high power radiation interaction with  matter. The physical and technical fundamentals of high intensity laser optics and adaptive optics and the related physical processes in high intensity laser systems are explained. A main question discussed is: What is power optics? In what way is it different from ordinary optics widely used in <b>cameras,</b> <b>motion-picture</b> projectors, i. e., for everyday use? An undesirable consequence of the thermal deformation of optical elements and surfaces was discovered during studies of the interaction with powerful incident laser radiation. The requirements to the fabrication, performance and quality of optical elements employed within systems for most practical applications are also covered. The high-power laser performance is generally governed by the following: (i) the absorption of incident optical radiation (governed primarily by various absorption mechanisms), (ii) followed by a temperature increase and response governed primarily by thermal properties and (iii)   the thermo-optical and thermo-mechanical response of  distortion, stress, fracture, etc. All {{this needs to be}} understood to design efficient, compact, reliable and useful high power systems for many applications under a variety of operating conditions, pulsed, continuous wave and burst mode of varying duty cycles. The book gives an overview of an important spectrum of related topics like laser resonator configurations, intermetallic optical coatings, heat carriers for high power optics, cellular materials, high-repetition-rate lasers and mono-module disk lasers for high power optics...|$|R
50|$|La Jetée is {{constructed}} almost entirely from optically printed photographs playing {{out as a}} photomontage of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a <b>motion-picture</b> <b>camera,</b> this {{due to the fact}} that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a Pentax Spotmatic and the motion-picture segment was shot with a 35mm Arriflex. The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a voice-over narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo which Marker also references in his 1983 film Sans soleil.|$|E
