For alcohol concentrations of more than 50 mol per cent, the increase of relative volatility of the esters was inversely proportional to the alcohol concentration.

40|$|Blueberry {{contains}} many substances {{that are important}} to the human body and can prevent cardiovascular diseases, protect the retina, and soften blood vessels. Anthocyanin, which is extracted from blueberry, can activate the retina, strengthen vision, reduce serum cholesterol, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein, and protect cell nucleus tissues from radical oxidation; hence, blueberry is of importance to scientists from different countries. In this study, anthocyanin was extracted and separated from blueberry using <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to investigate the effects of factors, such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> volume ratio on anthocyanin extraction and separation technologies. The extracting solution was then purified using the macroreticular resin purification method to investigate the effects of <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration and eluent dosage on anthocyanin extraction during purification. The research results demonstrated that 60  % <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> volume fraction, 1  :  10 mass ratio of solid to liquid, and 60  °C ultrasonic temperature were the best conditions for anthocyanin extraction. The best purification conditions were 95  % <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> which had been acidized by 0. 3  % hydrochloric acid and 70  ml of eluent.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} brain {{morphological}} changes in acute combined intoxication with asaleptin and <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Material and methods. The cerebral cortex (the parietal region) was histologically examined in 26 patients (19 men and 7 women, 22 to 63 years old) {{who had died}} of acute (first 24 hour) combined intoxication with asaleptin and <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Blood <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentrations varied from 1. 4 to 4. 1 %o. Brain pieces were fixed in 10 % formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histologic specimens were stained with hematoxilin and eosin by Nissl and analyzed using the Olympus BX 41 microscope. Morphological changes in the nerve cells were assessed according to existing classification and protocols («Histopathology of the central nervous system», Meditsina Publishers, Moscow, 1969). Results. In cases of death from acute combined intoxication with asaleptin and <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> morphological patterns of acute brain neuronal damages were detected. They included (a) nonspecific reversible and irreversible neuronal damages and (b) circulatory disorders comprising of vascular plethora in the microcircula-tory bed and developed perivascular and pericellulary edema. Conclusion. Detection of brain neuronal damage patterns in acute combined intoxications with asaleptin and <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> might aid in justification of an immediate death cause {{as a supplement to}} forensic chemical analysis.

40|$|Aims: To {{elucidate}} the possible effects of alcohol control policy measures on alcohol-related mortality in Russia between 1998 and 2013. Methods: Trends in mortality, alcohol production and sales were analyzed {{in conjunction with}} alco-hol control legislative measures. Correlation analysis of health and alcohol market indicators was performed. Results: <b>Ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> production was the strongest correlate of alcohol-related mortality, which is {{probably due to the}} fact that <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is used for both recorded and unrecorded alcohol produc-tion. Measures producing greatest mortality reduction effect included provisions which reduced <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> production (introduction of minimum authorized capital for <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and liquor producers in 2006 and the requirement for distillery dreg processing), as well as measures to tax and denaturize ethanol-containing liquids in 2006.
