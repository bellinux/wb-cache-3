25|$|In 2000, International Place Tower III was {{designed}} and rests amid the two existing towers and courtyard. The Crump Firm designed the eleven-story, 234,000 square foot tower to include offices, conference rooms, training rooms and dining facilities. The exterior granite was bought and warehoused in the mid-1980s with the intent that its construction would mimic that of the earlier towers. However, inclusion of seismic criteria to the Memphis building code in 1994 made the initial design unable to move forward. Therefore, architects had to completely change the original structural design in order {{to adhere to the}} strict exterior dimensions needed to utilize the existing granite and to <b>match</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> towers.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the {{southern}} New England states began numbering their main highways, {{most of which}} had, by the time, been under state control. Massachusetts had numbered {{the continuation of the}} Thompson Turnpike as Highway 131, but the designation did not continue into Connecticut at that time. In Connecticut, the middle portion of the former Thompson Turnpike, between Thompson center and North Grosvenor Dale, had become part of Highway 185. The southern and northern sections remained unnumbered. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, {{the southern}} portion and part of the middle portion (Thompson Hill Road) became a section of Route 200. The northern portion was designated as SR 874, an unsigned state road. At the same time, a Route 131 was also created in Roxbury. This Route 131 was then renumbered in 1935 to Route 199, and the number 131 was then assigned to SR 874 (Quinebaug Road) to <b>match</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> route number in Massachusetts.|$|E

2500|$|This station {{lasted until}} 1984 {{when a new}} station was proposed. [...] The result was two brick and glass pavilions {{designed}} in a Georgian style to <b>match</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> architecture of the Shaker Square buildings that surround them. [...] The old coffee shop was retained, but a new exterior was built around it. [...] Designed by Cleveland architect William Gould, the new station opened in July 1986. [...] It won design awards from both Cleveland and Ohio architectural societies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, US202 {{was created}} and routed along NY116 from Peekskill to Somers. Farther east, NY123 was {{extended}} westward along current NY35 to NY22 northeast of Katonah [...] In the early 1940s, modern NY35 in Westchester County was established, extending across Upper Westchester County on parts of NY116, NY132, and NY123. All three routes were truncated to their current termini at this time. The western terminus of NY35 {{was set at}} US9 in Peekskill, creating a long overlap with US202 that still exists today. The number 35 was chosen to <b>match</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> route number in Connecticut. In the 1950s, several plans to build an expressway along the NY35 corridor were studied, {{but none of these}} plans were built. NY35 was moved onto its current alignment north of Katonah in the mid-1970s.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] was {{released}} in the 1980s for home media use, such as on VHS and Laserdisc, the licence {{for the use of}} [...] "Goodnight, Sweetheart" [...] had lapsed and was instead picked up by a different studio. A new score was created to replace the song where it was used in the episode, however the new pieces did not <b>match</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> Steiner works as they used a different orchestral arrangement. Steiner was not contacted or informed of the modifications to the episode, and was instead composed by J. Peter Robinson. The original intention was not to restore [...] "Goodnight, Sweetheart" [...] to the DVD release, and issue the DVD with a disclaimer on the box, [...] "Some music has been changed for this DVD." [...] However, the original [...] "Goodnight, Sweetheart" [...] portion was erroneously included and Paramount reportedly had to pay royalties. Since the royalties had been paid, all subsequent releases have included the original [...] "Goodnight, Sweetheart" [...] music and with the 1980s scores omitted.|$|E

50|$|The US Post Office-Stuttgart is a {{historic}} post office building at 302 South Maple Street in Stuttgart, Arkansas.

50|$|The new {{courthouse}} {{building was}} designed by the Mobile architectural firm of Carey and Dowling, with Louis A. Simon as the federal Supervising Architect.

Site works on the $672 million project were formally commenced on 19 April 2010, when Minister of Energy Gerry Brownlee turned the first sod.

50|$|Grid parity {{occurs when}} {{the cost of an}} {{alternative}} technology for electricity production <b>matches</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> average for <b>the</b> area. Parity can vary both in time (i.e. {{during the course of the}} day and over the course of years) and in space (i.e. geographically). The price of electricity from the grid varies widely from high-cost areas such as Hawaii and California, to lower-cost areas such as Wyoming and Idaho. In areas with time-of-day pricing, rates vary over the course of the day, rising during high-demand hours (e.g. 11 AM-8 PM) and declining during low-demand hours.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new dynamic generating graphical model for point-sets <b>matching.</b> <b>The</b> <b>existing</b> algorithms on graphical models {{proved to be}} quite robust to noise but are susceptible {{to the effect of}} outliers. We discuss the separator‚Äôs influences on point-sets matching in inference on graphical models theoretically and find that the separator which consists of outliers will break the message-passing, which will directly lead to the breaking down of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> methods. Due to the conclusion above, in order to minimize the outliers in separator we propose a new algorithm in generating a graphical model and the corresponding Junction Tree for point-sets <b>matching.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly more stable and possesses higher accuracy on point-sets matching, which can overcome the limitation of sensitivity on outliers in <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> graphical models. ...|$|R
