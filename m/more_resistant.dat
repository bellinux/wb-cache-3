5|$|Fluoride {{therapy is}} often {{recommended}} {{to protect against}} dental caries. Water fluoridation and fluoride supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. The incorporated fluoride makes enamel <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to demineralization and thus <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to decay. Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash, is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.|$|E
5|$|Cysts of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to adverse {{environmental}} factors than the vegetative cells; in particular, they are twice as resistant to UV light. They are also resistant to drying, ultrasound and gamma and solar irradiation, but not to heating.|$|E
5|$|Different AtPeps {{may allow}} A. thaliana to {{distinguish}} between different pathogens. When inoculated with a fungus, oomycete and a bacterium, the increases in AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen. A. thaliana overexpressing AtProPep1 was <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to the oomycete Phythium irregulare.|$|E

5|$|A {{trial in}} Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly {{sensitive}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) {{was part of}} a secondary regrowth of understory species after <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to firing for a period of time. This {{is due in part to}} the effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to attack by carbonic acid {{and they can}} therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} Psilocybe semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. Other Psilocybe species known to produce sclerotia include Psilocybe mexicana and Psilocybe caerulescens. Sclerotia are also produced when the species is grown in culture.|$|E
5|$|The bark {{of other}} {{varieties}} of oak {{has traditionally been}} used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to bacterial attack.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{molecular}} {{weight of the}} polymer of interest is known to affect its creep behavior. The effect of increasing molecular weight tends to promote secondary bonding between polymer chains and thus make the polymer <b>more</b> creep <b>resistant.</b> Similarly, aromatic polymers are even <b>more</b> creep <b>resistant</b> due to the added stiffness from the rings. Both molecular weight and aromatic rings add to polymers' thermal stability, increasing the creep resistance of a polymer.|$|R

5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E

50|$|Bacteria with {{resistance}} to antibiotics predate medical use of antibiotics by humans; however, widespread antibiotic use has made <b>more</b> bacteria <b>resistant</b> {{through the process of}} evolutionary pressure.|$|R
50|$|M5 is <b>more</b> fire <b>{{resistant}}</b> than meta-Aramid. It is {{the most}} fire resistant organic fiber yet developed. It is less brittle than carbon fiber and will yield when stretched.|$|R
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1671 a malaria {{epidemic}} broke out, leading to additional complications. The epidemic was devastating to numerous hajduk families, the natives being <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to malaria; thus, part of the settlers moved to Ližnjan and Premantura, while others left to return to Dalmatia. Pivljanin and Njegošević lived in Premantura. In 1673, Pivljanin and his followers included 34 households, 18 of which lived in towns; 8 in Premantura (Promontore), 8 in Mutvoran (Momorano) and one in Peroj (Peroi); his followers consisted {{of a total of}} 157 individuals, 89 adults and 68 minors, 75 males and 82 females.|$|E

5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging electrical wire, light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|Plants grown under UVB light are <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to insect {{herbivory}} {{compared with}} plants grown under filters that exclude the radiation. When tomato plants {{are exposed to}} a pulse of UVB radiation and then weakly wounded, PIs accumulate throughout the plant. By themselves, neither the radiation nor weak wounding is sufficient to induce systemic PI accumulation. Tomato cell cultures respond similarly, with systemin and UVB acting together to activate MAPKs. Short pulses of UVB also cause alkalisation of the culturing medium.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials and}} {{modifications}} {{lasted more than}} a year, and once she entered active service in October 1899, the ship became the flagship of Prince Heinrich in the I Squadron of the German Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and Sweden–Norway. In 1901, the ship was severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to design changes in later German battleships to make them <b>more</b> <b>resistant</b> to underwater damage.|$|E
