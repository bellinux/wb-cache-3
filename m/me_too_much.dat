25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated <b>me</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E

2500|$|In {{introducing}} [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", Elton John said {{he believed}} it to be [...] "one of the best songs ever written." [...] The Lennon-sung [...] "I Saw Her Standing There" [...] (credited to the Elton John Band featuring John Lennon) was originally released in 1975 on the B-side of Elton John's [...] "Philadelphia Freedom" [...] single. In 1981, all three live songs were issued on 28th November 1974, an Elton John EP. In 1990, the three songs were made available on the Lennon box set. In 1996, they were also included on the remastered edition of Elton John's Here and There album. Elton John once stated that [...] " [...] 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' is a song that I never do in a set at a concert simply because it reminds <b>me</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of John Lennon. This is the same with 'Empty Garden'." [...] It {{was a part of}} his standard repertoire from 1974 until 1976, and sporadically until 1998. It also appeared in the 1976 musical documentary All This and World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people thought I had a lot of wear and tear on <b>me,</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{sending his}} Historical preface and {{corrections}} for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as [...] "a Review from a man, {{who is not}} an entire convert, if fair & [...] moderately favourable, is in all respects {{the best kind of}} Review. About weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder." [...] In April he continued, [...] "It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, & now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" [...] A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the theological aspects and [...] "had no intention to write atheistically, but could not see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd wish to do, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to <b>me</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" [...] – expressing his particular revulsion at the Ichneumonidae family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their parasitoid young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was [...] "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" [...] – referring to Isaac Newton.|$|E
