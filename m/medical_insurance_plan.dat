25|$|Like {{all of the}} TNF inhibitors, {{infliximab}} is {{an expensive}} medication, costing about US$900 for a 100mg dose, and within the United States is covered by almost every <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>plan</b> (though caps on many plans {{make it possible to}} be covered for only a subset of treatments {{in the course of a}} year). Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.|$|E

Dim light bulbs flickered, keeping them from seeing clearly in the room. The community committee helped them apply for MLS and enrolled them in social medical insurance at no cost. Regarding their understanding of equity, Mr. T’s wife said: “The medical insurance and MLS for my family is fair. Without it, our life is even bitterer. After getting the MLS certificate, all the medical insurance premiums are covered by the governments, and the benefits are exactly the same as those of employees. We used to pay all the medical bills and could not afford it at all … now the pressure is much lighter!” (Interviewee 1, old person T of city C).|$|E

30|$|This {{study reveals}} the disparities in {{healthcare}} utilization and health outcomes {{of older people}} affected by different <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>plans,</b> especially for older residents in rural areas insured by the NRCMS. The path-analysis model showed {{that there was no}} significant difference in the healthcare expenditures or health outcomes for NRCMS participants compared to those of the uninsured group. Outcome-based health equity appeals to the universal <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> system and the welfare ideology of giving priority to disadvantaged groups. Vulnerable older people have the social right to achieve an equitable health outcome after receiving fair treatment from healthcare services when compared with their advantaged counterparts with similar illness conditions. This reflects a developmental perspective from the previous focus on treatment mode to a comprehensive mode of health equity that comprises prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.|$|R

30|$|This article aims {{to define}} health equity {{in theory and}} {{proceeds}} from the social justice theory of giving priority to disadvantaged groups to establish the theoretical framework of process- and outcome-based health equality.

In order to meet the healthcare needs of the disadvantaged elderly, this article analyzes, with the help of the qualitative research method, the impacts of the reform on health equity in the specific process of healthcare service delivery.
