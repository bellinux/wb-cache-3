The underlying theory behind the choice of Gold codes is briefly discussed, and a method for reducing the amount of hardware required is introduced. The system is implemented using a Xilinx Logic Cell Array, and it is shown that use of a <b>multiplexing</b> <b>arrangement</b> can reduce the amount of hardware by a factor proportional to the number of transmitters in the network.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} the verification of nonclassical light which is independent of the complex interaction between the generated light and the material of the detectors. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} <b>multiplexing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Its theoretical description yields that the coincidence statistics of this measurement layout is a mixture of multinomial distributions for any classical light field and any type of detector. This allows us to formulate bounds on the statistical properties of classical states. We apply our directly accessible method to heralded multiphoton states which are detected with a single multiplexing step only and two detectors, which are in our work superconducting transition-edge sensors. The nonclassicality of the generated light is verified and characterized through the violation of the classical bounds without the need for characterizing the used detectors.

40|$|In this paper, a low-complexity Euclidean distance-based power {{allocation}} (PA) {{algorithm is}} proposed for spatial modulation (SM) aided multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm only exploits the Euclidean distances of a few dominant error vectors for optimizing the PA matrix, hence its computational complexity is considerably reduced compared to the exhaustive-search based algorithm.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{features and}} complexity of today's automotive architectures are becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Each new innovation typically requires additional mechanical actuators and associated electrical controllers. The sheer number of black boxes and wiring are being limited not by features or cost but by the inability to physically assemble them into a vehicle. A new architecture is required which will support the ability to add new features but also enable the Vehicle Assembly Plants to easily assemble and test each subsystem. One such architecture is a distributed <b>multiplex</b> <b>arrangement</b> that reduces the number of wires while enabling flexibility and expandability. Previous versions have {{had to deal with}} issues such as noise immunity at high switching currents.

40|$|Specific {{oligonucleotide}} primers were selected and combined in a <b>multiplex</b> <b>arrangement,</b> {{in order to}} detect simultaneously three economically important porcine viruses by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The pathogen panel was comprised of viruses that cause reproductive failure in infected herds: Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV), porcine parvovirus (PPV) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV). In {{order to reduce the}} time required for the detection of the pathogens, the assay was optimised to a RapidCycler PCR instrument. The multiplex PCR assay was shown to be specific, sensitive and rapid, because the results were read in less than 60 min after sample preparation. Due to its speed, efficiency and sensitivity, the described rapid multiplex PCR assay serves as a useful novel tool in the veterinary diagnostic laboratories for the quick and complex detection of these important porcine pathogens...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{document}} the experimental quantification of molecules {{on top of a}} common compact disc (CD) using the ubiquitous and inexpensive technology of a CD drive. To illustrate the concept, glucose is chosen as the target molecule and a colorimetric enzymatic glucose assay is carried out on top of a modified CD. Test strips, similar to the ones used for blood glucose monitoring, are incorporated on top of a CD with audio files burned on it. When a substance containing glucose is dropped onto the strip the resulting change in optical density is proportional to glucose concentration. Using the laser light, optical pickup and the error detection and correction protocol present in all CD drives, this change in optical density and hence the concentration of glucose in the sample are determined quantitatively. The resulting potential ???CD glucose meter??? can be a cost-effective, mass-deployable, point-of-care tool for rapid blood glucose monitoring and the diagnosis of diabetes. This CD based method for molecular quantification is independent of the type of target molecule and the concept can hence be extended for quantifying other important molecules and carrying out other diagnostic tests in a <b>multiplexed</b> <b>arrangement...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} status of our work {{implementing}} a single photon on-demand source based on a <b>multiplexed</b> <b>arrangement</b> of parametric downconverters. An array of downconverters with multiplexed outputs {{makes it possible to}} create light pulses with increased probability of containing a single photon, while suppressing the probability of producing more than one photon. This is crucial for quantum cryptographic applications. Our current setup implements the scheme in a greatly simplified manner that produces photons along with a measure of the likelihood that the light pulse emitted is just a single photon. This implementation uses a virtual array of downconverters and an array of staggered length optical fibers allowing a single detector to measure a herald photon output by a series of downconverters. This single detector arrangement is a great savings considering the cost of such detectors. The timing of the herald tells us which path the herald took, which in turn, provides information on the single vs. multiphoton probabilities. So far, our work shows that the individual correlated photon peaks are clearly resolvable with our 2. 4 ns delay line steps and the 1 ns full width half maximum (FWHM) of the correlated photon peaks, and that we can observe four correlated photon peaks simultaneously, a requirement to fully implement our scheme. Our current efforts are to increase the brightness and utility of the system for incorporation into a quantum communication testbed...|$|R
40|$|We compare diverse frequency-domain <b>multiplexed</b> pilot <b>arrangement</b> {{schemes for}} {{time-varying}} channel estimation in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. In the first scheme, the comb-type, {{only a fraction}} of the subcarriers is dedicated to the pilots, but the pilots are carried by each OFDM symbol. In the second scheme, the block-type, the pilots occupy all subcarriers, but such pilot OFDM symbols are interleaved with data OFDM symbols. The third scheme, the mixed-type, is a combination of the two previous schemes. Pilot-aided channel estimators are applied, which take into account the channel variation within one OFDM symbol. The performance of the three pilot schemes is compared for different channel situations. We will show that the comb-type scheme can be opted for estimating short but fast channels, while the block-type scheme is promising for long but slow channels. The mixed-type scheme yields a good tradeoff between these two channel situations. Index Terms — OFDM, time-varying channel, pilot-aided channel estimation...|$|R

Volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) are important holographic optical elements in many spectral systems. Using multiple volume gratings, whether multiplexed or arranged sequentially, provides advantages to {{many types of}} systems in overall efficiency, dispersion performance, flexibility of design, etc. However, {{the use of multiple}} gratings [...] -particularly when the gratings are multiplexed in a single holographic optical element (HOE) [...] -is subject to inter-grating coupling effects that ultimately limit system performance. Analyzing these coupling effects requires a more complex mathematical model than the straightforward analysis of a single volume grating. We present a matrix-based algorithm for determining diffraction efficiencies of significant coupled waves in these multiplexed grating holographic optical elements (HOEs). Several carefully constructed experiments with spectrally multiplexed gratings in dichromated gelatin verify our conclusions. Applications of this theory to broad- and narrow-band systems are explored in detailed simulations. Broadband systems include spectrum splitters for diverse-bandgap photovoltaic (PV) cells. Volume Bragg gratings can serve as effective spectrum splitters, but the inherent dispersion of a VBG can be detrimental given a broad-spectrum input. The performance of a holographic spectrum splitter element can be improved by utilizing multiple volume gratings, each operating in a slightly different spectral band. However, care must be taken to avoid inter-grating coupling effects that limit ultimate performance. We explore broadband multi-grating holographic optical elements (HOEs) in sandwiched arrangements where individual single-grating HOEs are placed in series, and in <b>multiplexed</b> <b>arrangements</b> where multiple gratings are recorded in a single HOE. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to tailor these systems to the solar spectrum taking into account both efficiency and dispersion. Both multiplexed and sandwiched two-grating systems exhibit performance improvements over single-grating solutions, especially when reduced dispersion is required. Dispersion performance can be further improved by employing more than two VBGs in the spectrum splitter, but efficiency is compromised by additional cross-coupling effects. Narrow-band applications of the multi-grating theory include spectral beam combining (SBC) systems. SBC systems utilizing multiple VBGs must be carefully analyzed to maximize channel density and efficiency, and thus output radiance. This analysis grows increasingly difficult as the number of channels in the system increases, and heuristic optimization techniques (e. g. PSO) are again useful tools for exploring the limits of these systems. We explore three classes of multi-grating SBC systems: "cascaded" where each grating adds a new channel to the system in sequence, "sandwiched" where several individual gratings are placed together and all channels enter the system at the same facet, and "multiplexed" where all of the gratings occupy the same holographic optical element (HOE). Loss mechanisms differ among these three basic classes, and the optimization algorithm shows that the highest channel density for a given minimum efficiency and fixed operating bandwidth is achieved for a cascaded-grating system. The multiplexed-grating system exhibits the lowest channel density under that same constraints but has the distinct advantage of being realized by a single HOE. For a particular application, one must weigh channel density and efficiency versus system complexity when choosing among these basic classes of SBC system. Additionally, one may need to consider the effects of finite-width input beams. As input beam radius is reduced, angular clipping effects begin to dominate over spectral interference and crosstalk effects, limiting all three classes of SBC systems in a similar manner...|$|R
