5|$|Because {{of their}} sizable {{temperature}} and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For example, in: industrial and extractive metallurgy, surface treatments such as plasma spraying (coating), etching in <b>microelectronics,</b> metal cutting and welding; {{as well as}} in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps, while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering.|$|E
5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock {{remained the}} most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of <b>microelectronics</b> in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in <b>microelectronics</b> and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{is often}} used as an {{insulator}} and chemical barrier in manufacturing integrated circuits, to electrically isolate different structures or as an etch mask in bulk micromachining. As a passivation layer for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in <b>microelectronics.</b> It is also used as a dielectric between polysilicon layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
5|$|Central Campus {{is home to}} the {{majority}} of the academic, research, and administrative buildings.

Intermingled with these are a variety of research facilities, such as the Centennial Research Building, the <b>Microelectronics</b> Research Center, the Neely Nuclear Research Center, the Nanotechnology Research Center, and the Petit Biotechnology Building.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, RTI's {{staff of}} 430 was reorganized into four {{research}} groups: {{social and economic}} systems, statistical sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation. Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects. RTI provided funding assistance to help found the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in 1980, {{and two years later}} was part of a joint venture to create <b>Microelectronics</b> Center of North Carolina (MCNC), a non-profit whose computer network connected local K-12 schools. A Health Solutions division formed in 2000 serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. In 2015, it formed a subsidiary in New Delhi, India. Among other projects, it was funded to develop a waterless toilet for use in third-world countries.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 1969, {{the first}} {{connection}} {{on a wide}} area network to use packet switching, ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Douglas Engelbart's laboratory at SRI using Interface Message Processors at both sites. The following year, Engelbart's laboratory installed the first TENEX system outside of BBN where it was developed. In addition to SRI and UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah {{were part of the}} original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire four-node network was connected. In the 1970s, SRI developed packet-switched radio (a precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, vacuum <b>microelectronics,</b> and software-implemented fault tolerance.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept has}} been {{developed}} for technology and economics {{in the identification of}} new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy (Carlota Perez; earlier work only on technological paradigms by Giovanni Dosi).

25|$|In 1984 the Bell System {{broke up}} into the various Baby Bell {{operating}} companies and AT. As {{a result of this}} divestiture in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT Technology Systems (AT Technology Systems) location as part of AT, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all-time high of 4,900. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT organization called AT <b>Microelectronics.</b> In 1989 the AT work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT <b>Microelectronics</b> had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used. AT Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993, but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period. In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the Lightwave unit. The Lightwave unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers. In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT <b>Microelectronics</b> and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT into Lucent Technologies.|$|E
25|$|Microelectronic {{components}} {{are created by}} chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current.

25|$|The jute {{industry}} fell into {{decline in the}} early 20th century, partly due to reduced demand for jute products and partly due to an inability {{to compete with the}} emerging industry in Calcutta. This gave rise to unemployment levels far in excess of the national average, peaking in the inter-war period, but major recovery was seen in the post-war period, thanks to the arrival first of American light engineering companies like Timex and NCR, and subsequent expansion into <b>microelectronics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once {{reliant on}} {{traditional}} manufacturing industries, the region {{became a major}} high-tech industrial hub after the establishment of Southern Taiwan Science Park in 1995.

25|$|Development of ARPA {{started after}} the {{accident}} when the Italian liner SS Andrea Doria collided with the MS Stockholm in dense fog and sank off {{the east coast of}} the United States.

ARPA-enabled radars are now available even for small yachts.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, TSMC {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications, leading major smartphone chip companies such as Qualcomm, Mediatek and Apple to place an increasing amount of orders. While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United <b>Microelectronics</b> Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28nm capacity, the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.|$|E
