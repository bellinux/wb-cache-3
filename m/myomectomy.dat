25|$|They are in {{most cases}} still hormone {{dependent}} but may cause life-threatening complications when they appear in distant organs. Some sources suggest that a substantial share of the cases may be late complications of surgeries such as <b>myomectomy</b> or hysterectomy.

25|$|<b>Myomectomy</b> is a {{surgery to}} remove one or more fibroids. It is usually {{recommended}} when more conservative treatment options fail for women who want fertility preserving surgery or who want to retain the uterus.|$|E
30|$|Methods: From January 2000 to December 2006, were {{performed}} 98 laparoscopic <b>myomectomies</b> (LM) and 125 abdominal <b>myomectomies</b> (AM). Indications for both procedures were similar, including menometrorrhagia, pelvic pain, enlarging myomata and infertilitas.|$|R
30|$|All laparoscopic <b>myomectomies</b> in our {{teaching}} institution were analysed. To {{assess a}} potential learning curve, we only considered procedures by surgeons experienced {{in general and}} laparoscopic surgery. They should have undertaken more than 20 laparoscopic <b>myomectomies</b> (multiple fibroids and/or different presentations) within the study period. Out of these 20 laparoscopic <b>myomectomies,</b> more than ten women {{must have had a}} singular fibroid lying intramurally or a fibroid that did not bulge subserously more than 50 %. Cases were analysed according to the order of surgery for the individual surgeon. During the study period, all surgeons undertook laparoscopic <b>myomectomies</b> in women presenting with multiple fibroids or even more complex laparoscopic procedures.|$|R
30|$|Results: In 740 (91, 6 %) {{procedures}} uterine cavity was reached. 556 (75, 1 %) polypectomies, 131 (17, 7 %) <b>myomectomies,</b> 27 (3, 6 %) <b>myomectomies</b> plus polypectomies and 26 (3, 5 %) endometrial ablations were performed. In 17 (2, 10 %) {{cases it}} was not possible to enter cavity. Complications rate was low (2, 23 %). Eight cases of endometrial carcinoma were diagnosed unexpectedly.|$|R
25|$|In a hysteroscopic <b>myomectomy</b> (also called {{transcervical}} resection), the fibroid can {{be removed}} by either {{the use of a}} resectoscope, an endoscopic instrument inserted through the vagina and cervix that can use high-frequency electrical energy to cut tissue, or a similar device.|$|E

30|$|The most {{frequent}} type of endoscopic surgery performed is LH, {{and the least}} preferred surgical approach is LSH. Figure 2 demonstrates surgeons, with the least exposure to MIS (1 – 10 cases/annum), performed more <b>myomectomies</b> and subtotal hysterectomies than LH compared to more experienced surgeons with exposure to more than 11 endoscopic cases per year, on average. There was greater preference for LH than LSH by all experienced surgeons who performed more than 11 cases per year of MIS. The higher rate of hysteroscopic <b>myomectomies,</b> being 22.5 and 16.5 %, were performed by surgeons reporting between 11 – 20 and 21 – 30 operations per year, respectively. Surgeons with exposure to MIS in more than 31 cases per year performed less hysteroscopic <b>myomectomies,</b> between 2.5 and 12 %.|$|R

2500|$|A {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} menorrhagia is to perform hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). The {{risks of the}} procedure have been reduced with measures {{to reduce the risk}} of deep vein thrombosis after surgery, and the switch from the front abdominal to vaginal approach greatly minimizing the discomfort and recuperation time for the patient; however extensive fibroids may make the womb too large for removal by the vaginal approach. [...] Small fibroids may be dealt with by local removal (<b>myomectomy).</b> [...] A further surgical technique is endometrial ablation (destruction) by the use of applied heat (thermoablation).|$|E

2500|$|Eighty {{percent of}} African-American women will develop benign uterine fibroid tumors by their late 40s, {{according}} to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. African-American women are {{two to three times}} more likely to get fibroids than Caucasian women. In African-American women fibroids seem to occur at a younger age, grow more quickly, and are more likely to cause symptoms. [...] This leads to higher rates of surgery for African Americans, both <b>myomectomy,</b> and hysterectomy. Increased risk of fibroids in African- Americans causes them to fare worse in in-vitro fertility treatments and raises their risk of premature births and delivery by Cesarean section.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Prospective {{study of}} 500 {{consecutive}} cases of women undergoing laparoscopic surgery with previous abdominal surgery {{in private practice}} setup. Laparoscopic surgery was performed for endometriosis, <b>myomectomies,</b> adhesiolysis, tubal pregnancies, ovarian tumors, pelvic floor repair or hysterectomies.|$|R
30|$|There were {{performed}} 36 polypectomies, 5 with Versapoint, the others with Bettocchi System; 3 <b>myomectomies,</b> {{two of them}} with Versapoint, (1, 5 and 2  cm respectively). 41 targeted biopsies, 20 internal os adhesiolisys, 10 IUD extractions, and 2 resections of vaginal polyps.|$|R

30|$|Discussion: There is {{evidence}} that supports the advantages of laparoscopy over laparotomy in pregnant patients, and laparoscopic <b>myomectomies</b> have been accomplished during gestation. We reviewed the literature and found 9 previously published cases. No obstetric complications associated to the procedure were reported.|$|R
30|$|Results: Uterine {{perforation}} was {{the only}} serious complication of hysteroscopies performed in our department between 2007 - 2013. 10 perforation took place during operative procedures: 2 in 267 <b>myomectomies,</b> 6 in 744 polypectomies and 2 in 42 septal resections. 5 perforation - during diagnostics procedures.|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{surgical}} management history, these women had {{a variety of}} procedures. Twenty-one patients had a total of 32 laparoscopies. Eighteen had undergone hysterectomies, five had <b>myomectomies,</b> and three had prior adnexal surgery. Additionally, one woman underwent an endometrial ablation procedure, while another had undergone hysteroscopy.|$|R

50|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>myomectomy</b> surgery is {{associated}} with a higher risk of uterine rupture in later pregnancy. Thus, women who have had <b>myomectomy</b> (with the exception of small submucosal myoma removal via hysteroscopy, or largely pedunculated myoma removal) should get Cesarean delivery to avoid the risk of uterine rupture that is commonly fatal to the fetus.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{potential}} {{weakness of the}} hysterotomy scar manifesting as a uterine rupture in the third trimester of pregnancy before labour is being realised [3 – 5]. This risk exists not only after intramural but also subserosal laparoscopic <b>myomectomies,</b> even when the myoma was superficial [4].|$|R
30|$|Depth of myometrial {{penetration}} - when {{tissue damage}} extends into the deeper myometrium, instilled fluid can be rapidly absorbed through opened myometrial venous sinuses. The risk of fluid absorption is even greater during <b>myomectomies</b> where large blood vessels are breached facilitating {{the absorption of}} fluid under pressure.|$|R
50|$|This {{includes}} {{the use of}} the da Vinci surgical system in benign gynecology and gynecologic oncology. Robotic surgery can be used to treat fibroids, abnormal periods, endometriosis, ovarian tumors, uterine prolapse, and female cancers. Using the robotic system, gynecologists can perform hysterectomies, <b>myomectomies,</b> and lymph node biopsies.|$|R
