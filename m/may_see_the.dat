Émile Durkheim has {{described}} loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason for what he called egoistic suicide. In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and alcoholism. People who are socially isolated may report poor sleep quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes. Loneliness has also been linked with a Schizoid character type in which one <b>may</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world differently and experience social alienation, described as the self in exile.|$|E

Matthew Chisling of Allmusic called the track [...] "the most brilliant, perfect mainstream pop single of 2009", commending the song's synthesized beat and larger-than-life chorus, and Flo Rida's rap, stating that it made Burke [...] "the prime UK import for the North American market". Popjustice called the song [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "phenomenal", commending the song's [...] "Womanizer"-like intro and the chorus’s strong melodic topline. The review praised Burke's vocals, calling them [...] "Whitneyish in parts" [...] and compared them to Donna Summer. Although the review noted the song was not built for Burke's extreme vocals, it said, [...] "that there's something quite exciting about an incredible singer being forced to follow a very strong and melodic topline instead of going all over the show." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com also said the song was reminiscent of Donna Summer, and said, [...] "Big international success seems a real possibility as Burke steps into the battle for R diva crown." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy said the song complimented Burke's [...] "sass and all-around performance skill" [...] rather than a ballad would, and called the song [...] "fun", pulling off a [...] "minor pop miracle- turning a cameo by Flo Rida into a good thing". Alexis Petrids of The Guardian noted although some <b>may</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> single as [...] "generic", and [...] "currently pop's factory-default setting", he ascertained the song was [...] "a superior example of the type, furnished with an effortlessly unshakeable chorus".

To understand this phenomenon more clearly Franklin conducted experiments.

2500|$|When {{individuals}} with a divinity worldview make meaning through spirituality and religiosity, those [...] "individuals perceive the divine {{to be involved in}} a major stressful life event" [...] and use the divine to develop a meaning for the loss. There are three main ways in which a theistic individual may create meaning through religion: benevolent religious reappraisals, punishing God reappraisals, and reappraisals of God's power. Benevolent religious reappraisals cast God in a positive light and grievers <b>may</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> death as a part of God's plan. Punishing God reappraisals cast God in a dark light and grievers may blame God for the loss or feel punished by God. Reappraisals of God's power questions God's ability to intervene on the situation. All of these appraisals contribute to how the griever may create meaning of their loss.|$|E

2500|$|The Gibson Girl {{was one of}} {{the origins}} of the flapper. The {{invention}} of Charles Dana Gibson, the Gibson Girl changed the fashion, patterns, and lifestyles of the 1920s; these were much more progressive than the traditions of women’s styles in the past. Before the Gibson Girl movement, women's voices as a group were infrequently heard. [...] While some <b>may</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Gibson Girl as just a fashion statement, it was much more broadly influential than that. [...] "She depicted the modern woman, known popularly as the 'new woman', at a time when more women gained independence, began to work outside the home, and sought the right to vote and other rights." [...] Gibson's illustrations showed feminist women of all kinds who worried more about themselves than about pleasing the men in their lives. [...] It was the first time a woman could actually concentrate on her own dreams and goals. The Gibson Girl also exemplified the importance of intelligence and learning rather than catering to men's needs.|$|E
