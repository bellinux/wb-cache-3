40|$|The {{design of}} {{distributed}} mechanisms for interference management {{is one of}} the key challenges in emerging wireless small cell networks whose backhaul is capacity limited and heterogeneous (wired, wireless and a <b>mix</b> <b>thereof).</b> In this paper, a novel, backhaul-aware approach to interference management in wireless small cell networks is proposed. The proposed approach enables macrocell user equipments (MUEs) to optimize their uplink performance, by exploiting the presence of neighboring small cell base stations. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game among the MUEs that seek to optimize their delay-rate tradeoff, given the conditions of both the radio access network and the [...] possibly heterogeneous [...] backhaul. To solve this game, a novel, distributed learning algorithm is proposed using which the MUEs autonomously choose their optimal uplink transmission strategies, given a limited amount of available information. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is shown and its properties are studied.

40|$|In this {{publication}} we describe a novel two-dimensional approach for automatic music genre classification. Although the subject poses a well studied task in Music Information Retrieval, some fundamental issues of genre classification {{have not been}} covered so far.

Most of all, this holds true for the broad category “World Music”, which comprises many different regional styles and a mutual <b>mix</b> up <b>thereof.</b> A common approach to tackle this issue in manual categorization is to assign multiple genre labels to a single recording. However, for commonly used automatic classification algorithms, multilabeling poses a problem due to its ambiguities.

A corresponding multi-stage evaluation based on a representative set of items from a global music taxonomy is performed and discussed accordingly.

40|$|Introduction In {{the present}} study, we {{established}} a novel in vitro coculture model {{to evaluate the}} influence of osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage explants on the composition of newly produced matrix and chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the phenotype of OA chondrocytes. In addition, we included a “tri-culture” model, whereby a mixture of BMSCs and chondrocytes was cultured {{on the surface of}} OA cartilage explants. Methods Gene expression analysis, protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) assays, dot-blot, immunofluorescence, and biomechanical tests were used to characterize the properties of newly generated extracellular matrix (ECM) from chondrocytes and chondrogenically differentiated BMSCs and a <b>mix</b> <b>thereof.</b> We compared articular cartilage explant cocultures with BMSCs, chondrocytes, and mixed cultures (chondrocytes and BMSCs 1 : 1) embedded in fibrin gels with fibrin gel-embedded cells cultured without cartilage explants (monocultures). Results In general, co- and tri-cultured cell regimens exhibited reduced mRNA and protein levels of collagens I, II, III, and X in comparison with monocultures, whereas no changes in GAG synthesis were observed. All co- and tri-culture regimens tended to exhibit lower Young’s and equilibrium modulus compared with monocultures. In contrast, aggregate modulus and hydraulic permeability seemed to be higher in co- and tri-cultures. Supernatants of cocultures contained significant higher levels of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), IL- 6, and IL- 8. Stimulation of monocultures with IL- 1 β and IL- 6 reduced collagen gene expression in BMSCs and mixed cultures in general but was often upregulated in chondrocytes at late culture time points. IL- 8 stimulation affected BMSCs only. Conclusions Our results suggest an inhibitory effect of OA cartilage on the production of collagens. This indicates a distinct modulatory influence that affects the collagen composition of the de novo-produced ECM from co- and tri-cultured cells and leads to impaired mechanical and biochemical properties of the matrix because of an altered fibrillar network. We suggest that soluble factors, including IL- 1 β and IL- 6, released from OA cartilage partly mediate these effects. Thus, neighbored OA cartilage provides inhibitory signals with respect to BMSCs’ chondrogenic differentiation and matrix composition, which need to be accounted for in future cell-based OA treatment strategies...|$|R

The normal nocturnal production of CO 2 by soil and vegetation mixes only into this small layer, and this leads to highly elevated concentrations of CO 2. During the day, the contact between the lower layer and the free troposphere is gradually restored, causing the CO 2 concentration to sink towards the free troposphere background concentration.

Studies of mucosal immunity induced by oral poliovirus (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccines and <b>mixed</b> schedules <b>thereof</b> will determine the effectiveness of different vaccine strategies to block virus shedding. We used samples from a clinical trial of different vaccination schedules to measure intestinal immunity as judged by neutralisation of virus and virus-specific IgA in stools. MethodsIn the FIDEC trial, Latin American infants {{were randomly assigned to}} nine groups to assess the efficacy of two schedules of bivalent OPV (bOPV) and IPV and challenge with monovalent type 2 OPV, and stools samples were collected. We selected three groups of particular interest—the bOPV control group (serotypes 1 and 3 at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), the trivalent attenuated OPV (tOPV) control group (tOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), and the bOPV–IPV group (bOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks plus IPV at 14 weeks). Neutralising activity and poliovirus type-specific IgA were measured in stool after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks of age. Mucosal immunity was measured by in-vitro neutralisation of a type 2 polio pseudovirus (PV 2). Neutralisation titres and total and poliovirus-type-specific IgG and IgA concentrations in stools were assessed in samples collected before challenge and 2 weeks after challenge from all participants. Findings 210 infants from Guatemala and Dominican Republic were included in this analysis. Of 38 infants tested for mucosal antibody in the tOPV group, two were shedding virus 1 week after challenge, compared with 59 of 85 infants receiving bOPV (p< 0 · 0001) and 53 of 87 infants receiving bOPV–IPV (p< 0 · 0001). Mucosal type 2 neutralisation and type-specific IgA were noted primarily in response to tOPV. An inverse correlation was noted between virus shedding and both serum type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p< 0 · 0001) and mucosal type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p< 0 · 0001). InterpretationMucosal type- 2 -specific antibodies can be measured in stool and develop in response to receipt of OPV type 2 either in the primary vaccine series or at challenge.

The {{objective of the}} study was to establish the optimum conditions for a pilot plant operation that would use water, or alcohol, or water-alcohol mixtures as the solvolysis reagent Small amounts of B 5 H 9 sprayed from a syringe will not necessarily enflame, nor will a small pool on a spot plate. Therefore, a procedure was developed to reproducibly demonstrate the flammability of B 5 H 9 In these tests every sample of neat B 5 H 9 ignited and burned with a very sooty flame till the sample was consumed. The spontaneous self-ignition of B 5 H 9 was quenched by the addition of small concentrations of the ethers THF (tetrahydrofuran) or DME (1, 2 -dimethoxy ethane). It was found that 10 % (volume) of either provided total quenching with a large margin of safety. When these stabilized solutions were exposed to air, they decomposed and evaporated leaving a residue that was identified by NMR analysis as boric acid. Most of the laboratory solvolysis experiments used the 90 % B 5 H 9, 10 % THF solution. This mixture was safer to handle and its solvolysis reactivity was virtually identical to that of 100 % B 5 H 9.

The study uses microscopic simulation methods for the assessment. The paper also assesses the impact that wheelchair users or Non-Ambulant Persons (NAP?s) and Persons with Bicycles (PWB?s) have on the design service criteria; in other words, {{the assessment of the}} reduction in Level-of-Service (LOS), due to a proportion of NAP?s and/or PWB?s within the pedestrian <b>mix.</b> The quantification <b>thereof</b> and the implication on universal design is discussed in terms of the need for additional infrastructure (spatial) requirements. Currently, little research has been undertaken regarding multi-modal LOS (MMLOS), or the impact of multiple pedestrian modal types on LOS; specifically, the impact of pedestrians pushing bicycles or people in a wheelchair on the standard LOS classification system. Since there is no accepted standard design methodology available for determining multi-modal level-of-service (MMLOS), the paper suggests that the resulting reduced MMLOS can be calculated {{on the basis of the}} reduced space-density (M) experienced by each individual person based on the additional space requirements in accordance with ?equivalent? pax factors specifically defined in this paper.

In the study a structured questionnaire was mailed to all residential estate agencies which are members of the Estate Agency Affairs Board. The most significant findings are that: the majority of respondents do not have mission statements and do not know what a mission statement is; they set marketing objectives which are communicated to the agents; when appointing new agents they consider the agent's service orientation and ability to work with clients, but qualifications and previous experience are not viewed as important; they train estate agents themselves and emphasise after-sales contact and building of long-term relationships, but do not stress customer behaviour influences; a large percentage do not conduct competitor analyses and view marketing research as unimportant, but are of the opinion that they have superior market knowledge and offer the best service quality; they regard the principles of the marketing concept as important; they engage in a large number of after-sales services, although few realise that contact after occupation is important; they regard the buyer's financial means as important and engage in activities to ensure customer service, but do not have formalised feedback systems to test customer satisfaction; they engage in internal marketing activities, strive to create a positive corporate culture and try to retain good agents.

40|$|The {{definition}} of similarity between data objects {{plays a key}} role for the applicability of many analytical systems. Similarity measures are used for prominent data analysis tasks like nearest neighbor search, clustering, or pattern recognition. These tasks are applied in many scientific domains like Information Retrieval, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Information Visualization and Visual Analytics. The data used for the calculation of similarity can either be of uniform attribute type (like numerical, ordinal, categorical or binary) or consist of combinations <b>thereof</b> (<b>mixed</b> data). The process of similarity definition comprises several challenges which I aim to tackle in this work. To start with, in many applications the developers (data experts) of the analytical system are not necessarily the users (domain experts) of the system. A problem arises, because data experts implement the functional similarity specification for domain experts. The functional similarity specification, however, should reflect the similarity notion in the minds of domain experts. Therefore the domain experts should be involved in the similarity generation process. The second challenge refers to the similarity definition for mixed data. A variety of similarity definitions for numerical, categorical or binary data exist. However, the similarity definition based on mixed data is cumbersome because of the complexity of the data. Finally, there are two possibilities when the similarity can be defined, namely at compile time or at run time. Today, many analytical systems define the similarity at compile time. However, the similarity notion of domain experts or the data set may vary over time. This would require a new specification of the functional similarity and a new compilation of the system. The {{definition of}} similarity at run time would solve this problem. I present a visual-interactive system that enables domain experts to define a similarity measure that reflects their similarity notion. The system is applicable for mixed data sets. Domain experts can align objects in a visual interface to generate feedback. Dynamic recalculation of the functional similarity specification allows to match the similarity notion of domain expert at run time. This way the functional similarity specification can be adjusted at any time. Further, I provide a visual-interactive mode which enables the data expert to explore the similarity definition process of the domain expert. In addition, I evaluate the system to assess the quality of the similarity concept as well as the feedback generation process. The results of the evaluation illustrate both: the validity of my solution as well as extension possibilities depending on the complexity of the given user feedback. In two case studies I show the applicability of the system. Both use cases show that the 'mental' similarity notion of users can be captured by the similarity concept. The results of the evaluation and the observations made in the case studies can be applied to improve the system or be used as a baseline for future approaches for user-centered interactive similarity definition for complex data objects...|$|R
