500|$|Chesnutt's lyrics mix {{irony and}} sincerity. He wrote the album {{to express the}} {{complexity}} of his personal experiences, such as {{falling in love with}} his wife, rock and roll, and reconciling his love for the music with the trappings of the rock lifestyle. Pitchfork journalist Rob Mitchum wrote that [...] "Serve This Royalty" [...] celebrates Chesnutt's [...] "cultural sect", and [...] "The Seed" [...] mixes his [...] "hypersexual egotism" [...] with [...] "a tone of evolutionary bravado." [...] On the former song, Chesnutt sings [...] "Thank you Jesus / For <b>my</b> <b>mama</b> / Thank you bitches / For my money". He said of recording the song, [...] "I woke up, went to the organ, and played these chords". Following [...] "Bitch, I'm Broke", the album features a suite of songs written about Chesnutt's wife and the pleasures of monogamy.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "All About That Bass" [...] became {{a subject of}} {{controversy}} among several music critics who felt that the song did not promote a positive body image as Trainor intended. The singer was accused of anti-feminism and shaming thin women in the song, namely in the lyrics [...] "bringing booty back / Go ahead and tell them skinny bitches that," [...] and [...] "Yeah <b>my</b> <b>mama</b> she told me don't worry about your size / She says, 'Boys like a little more booty to hold at night.'" [...] The former lyric was however developed by Kadish and not Trainor. In a publication by The Daily Telegraph, Olivia O'Niell analyzed, [...] "If the song's 908,000 likes on YouTube and Meghan's 90,000 followers on Twitter are anything to go by, {{it would seem that}} the message most people are taking away from the hit is a positive one". However, O'Niell went on to highlight that the lyrics [...] "have outraged some listeners, with YouTube comments criticizing Trainor for her 'thinly veiled hypocrisy'".|$|E
500|$|Garrett {{said the}} song appeals to everyone, saying [...] "Whether you're a female in love, male in love, it's a real record. Your mama has {{to feel this}} record, your daddy has to feel this record, {{everybody}} has to feel this record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost <b>my</b> <b>mama,</b> I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E

Segrest's work was one of her favorite novels and she was repulsed by reviewer's use of words like [...] "white trash" [...] and his insulting attitude toward Southerners. To dispel the stereotype that Southerners were stupid, brain-damaged, or morally lacking, she spent the next two years writing Trash.|$|R

They performed regularly on the British club circuit in the early 1970s, clocking up over 500 gigs at venues such as the Marquee Club before they eventually split in 1975. Their live performances were flamboyant and Saward's reputation for erotically charged on-stage antics drew {{both positive and negative}} publicity. In 1973, the band were signed by EMI, and released their only album Skeleton in Armour.
