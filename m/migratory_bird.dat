5|$|Migratory raptors {{native to}} the United States are {{protected}} by the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act of 1918, so American kestrels are illegal to possess without a permit (such as a falconry permit) in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The salt lagoons, {{mangroves}} and samphire wetlands are recognised {{as important}} areas for migratory birds by their coverage under the China-Australia and Japan-Australia <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> agreements. The agreements are treaties created {{to for the}} protection of the birds and their environment.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> {{pass through}} the area, such as {{flamingos}} from Siberia, which come in large numbers. Approximately 400 <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> were reported in 2005.|$|R

50|$|<b>Migratory</b> <b>birds</b> do not visit Satapada very often, {{but a few}} {{varieties}} of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> move to Nalabana bird sanctuary. It takes around four hours by boat from Satapada to reach Nalaban.|$|R
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} species {{that causes the}} most damage to bird populations is the cat (Felis catus), both domestic and feral. Cats that are let outside live close to suburban populations and have been estimated to number 640per square mile. In such close numbers in historic migratory areas, they have devastating effects on <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|There are twenty-seven private duck clubs, seven state {{waterfowl}} management areas, {{and a large}} federal {{bird refuge}} on the Great Salt Lake's shores. Wetland/wildlife management areas include the Bear River <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Refuge; Gillmor Sanctuary; Great Salt Lake Shorelands Preserve; Salt Creek, Public Shooting Grounds, Harold Crane, Locomotive Springs, Ogden Bay, Timpie Springs, and Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Areas.|$|E

50|$|Several {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} including 49 local <b>birds,</b> 11 <b>migratory</b> <b>birds,</b> 3 rare birds and 54 common birds. Some of the rare <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> are: golden-backed woodpecker (Dinopium benghalense, crimson-breasted barbet (Megalaima haemacephala) and green barbet (Stactolaema olivacea).|$|R
50|$|A {{research}} center for <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> {{has been created}} in 1994. It {{is part of the}} European project European-African Songbird Migration Network of the Oldenburg University. Thanks to these studies has been discovered the importance of the Bolle di Magadino for <b>migratory</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|R
5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E
5|$|Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager {{indicates}} that “Thumbelina” {{was the first}} of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen’s identification with the swallow as a <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.|$|E
5|$|Each April, Burns {{hosts the}} John Scharff <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Festival and Art Show during the annual spring {{migration}} of waterfowl and other birds through the area. Pelicans, ducks, and raptors {{are among the}} birds frequenting the Harney Basin wetlands, a stopping place on the Pacific Flyway. Named for a former manager of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, the festival includes tours of the wetlands and nearby ranches as well as classes in topics such as birdhouse building, Harney County archeology, and bird sketching.|$|E
40|$|<b>Migratory</b> <b>birds</b> {{have been}} known to be passive {{carriers}} of arthropod vectors of various pathogens. A study to assess the potential role of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds,</b> which are tick-carriers, as a possible route to spread the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) into Europe was initiated in 2017 by the Italian Ministry of Health.

50|$|The Pacific Flyway {{is a major}} north-south flyway for <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> in America, {{extending}} from Alaska to Patagonia. Every year, <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> travel {{some or all of}} this distance both in spring and in fall, following food sources, heading to breeding grounds, or travelling to overwintering sites.|$|R
5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Act.|$|E
5|$|Concurrent {{highways}} I-15/84 continue south, {{parallel to}} rail {{belonging to the}} Union Pacific Railroad (UP) past the Wellsville Mountain Wilderness, to an interchange at 1100West in Brigham City, also known as US-91, which once in Brigham City becomes concurrent with US-89 and the two highways travel northeast from Brigham City into Box Elder Canyon towards Logan {{in the heart of}} the Cache Valley. US-89 closely parallels I-15/84 east,as the highways pass Willard Bay, the Willard Bay State Park and Bear River <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Refuge before crossing into Weber County.|$|E
5|$|Northern Paiutes {{or their}} ancestors, who were hunter-gatherers, {{have lived in}} the region for {{thousands}} of years. Since the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, cattle ranching and other forms of agriculture have dominated land use in the area. In 1930, logging in the mountains north of Burns {{led to the creation of}} Hines, a lumber company town, and the timber industry remained important to the local economy until the 1990s. In addition to ranching, a variety of private and public enterprises support the Burns–Hines economy in the 21stcentury. Annual events include a <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> festival, the county fair, and a country music jamboree.|$|E

50|$|<b>Migratory</b> <b>birds</b> from {{neighbouring}} Tibet, Central Asia and Eastern Europe {{have been}} flocking to ecologically rich districts in Rajasthan. With their wetlands, thick forests and water bodies, the four districts of Hadoti, Kota, Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar have {{now come to}} be recognized as a paradise for <b>migratory</b> <b>birds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> study.|$|E
5|$|Terns are {{protected}} by international legislation such as the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act of 1918. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required {{to engage in a}} wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rico Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS), {{established}} in 1997, {{is a program}} {{with the purpose of}} monitoring the status and trends of Puerto Rican breeding bird populations. The information gathered by these surveys is used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to assess bird conservation priorities. Other conservation programs by the USFWS include the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Conservation and the maintenance of 5 wildlife refuges at Cabo Rojo, Laguna Cartagena, Vieques, Culebra and Desecheo. Other institutions supporting bird conservation in Puerto Rico are the Puerto Rican Ornithological Society and the Puerto Rico National History Association.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Migratory</b> <b>Birds</b> Convention Act (also MBCA) is a Canadian law {{established}} in 1917 and significantly updated in June 1994 which contains regulations to protect <b>migratory</b> <b>birds,</b> their eggs, and their nests from hunting, trafficking and commercialization. A permit {{is required to}} engage {{in any of these}} activities.|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we show that {{non-migratory}} forest birds have increased in population {{over the last several}} decades in Central Europe, while <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> have declined in abundance. We associate the response of the non-migratory birds with changes in the environment and in forest management. In contrast, <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> have constant or declining populations. At least some migrating species face increasing problems of coordinating migration due to climate change (Saino et al. 2011), but the complex reasons underlying the decline of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> (see e.g. Vickery et al. 2014) were not addressed in this study.|$|R
50|$|<b>Migratory</b> <b>birds</b> {{are flying}} toward the {{south-west}} during the autumn, {{many of them}} attempt to follow land {{as long as they}} can (especially such birds that cannot land on water), and as Falsterbo is located as south-west as possible at the Scandinavian peninsula. The <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> tend to gather around Falsterbo for a rest or until the weather conditions are good in order to fly across the Baltic Sea to the European continent. The high number of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> during September, October and November also attract birds of prey to the area.|$|R
5|$|The {{removal of}} dead trees from forests may cause {{problems}} locally for this species {{because it requires}} cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest. This nuthatch is protected under the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act of 1918, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) are all signatories.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is a {{scavenger}} and feeds on carrion, {{but will also}} eat eggs or kill newborn animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals either by using its keen eyesight or by following other (New World) vultures, which possess {{a keen sense of}} smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves or hollow trees or on the bare ground, and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by regurgitation. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{protected}} in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Treaty, later extended {{to all of}} North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States {{due to the fact}} that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.|$|E
