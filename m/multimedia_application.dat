HotStart enables what Microsoft has referred to as appliance-like availability, allowing a PC to take on a number of roles based on the type of application launched—a PC that boots into a <b>multimedia</b> <b>application,</b> for example, can essentially function as a dedicated media device. Original equipment manufacturers can customize HotStart hardware implementation and functionality. Users may also customize application launch functionality through the Windows Registry; instead of launching a <b>multimedia</b> <b>application,</b> a user can, for example, configure a HotStart button or other form of input to instantly launch an e-mail application.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Interscope notifying mainstream media outlets on upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga {{announced plans for}} a <b>multimedia</b> <b>application</b> software which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community". Relative Wave, the architects behind Björk's multimedia app for Biophilia (2011), took nearly a year to develop the Artpop app. Some dismissed the project as an elaborate ploy to inflate album sales, under the assumption Billboard would count a downloaded track as a complete unit. Editorial director Bill Werde later addressed these concerns on in July 2013, [...] "As we understand, Gaga fans will get [...] Artpop app for free and can buy the album [...] app. Albums purchased this way would count on Billboard charts, however, ... concerns about self-reported data by Gaga's [...] seem unfounded– sales will be fulfilled and reported by existing digital retailers... for those who may ask: This is obviously different from Jay Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail / Samsung [...] which—via an app—gave [...] for free [...] had no option for fans to buy." [...] In October 2013, a fan asked Gaga why the song [...] "Brooklyn Nights" [...] was not included the album, to which she replied: [...] "I wanted {{to spend more time}} on it. It will come out [...] the app sometime during the album cycle".|$|E

Internet Spades, Internet Backgammon and Internet Checkers, {{which were}} removed from Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. Users are able to disable or customize many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista. New additions to this list of components include Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player 12, Windows Media Center, Windows Search, and Windows Gadget Platform. A new version of Microsoft Virtual PC, newly renamed as Windows Virtual PC was made available for Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions. It allows multiple Windows environments, including Windows XP Mode, to run on the same machine. Windows XP Mode runs Windows XP in a virtual machine, and displays applications within separate windows on the Windows 7 desktop. Furthermore, Windows 7 supports the mounting of a virtual hard disk (VHD) as a normal data storage, and the bootloader delivered with Windows 7 can boot the Windows system from a VHD; however, this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) of Windows 7 is also enhanced to support real-time <b>multimedia</b> <b>application</b> including video playback and 3D games, thus allowing use of DirectX 10 in remote desktop environments. The three application limit, previously present in the Windows Vista and Windows XP Starter Editions, {{has been removed from}} Windows 7. All editions include some new and improved features, such as Windows Search, Security features, and some features new to Windows 7, that originated within Vista. Optional BitLocker Drive Encryption is included with Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. Windows Defender is included; Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus software is a free download. All editions include Shadow Copy, which—every day or so—System Restore uses to take an automatic [...] "previous version" [...] snapshot of user files that have changed. Backup and restore have also been improved, and the Windows Recovery Environment—installed by default—replaces the optional Recovery Console of Windows XP.|$|E

40|$|CPU {{scheduling}} and admission testing for <b>multimedia</b> <b>applications</b> have been extensively studied, and various solutions {{have been proposed}} using assorted simplifying assumptions. However, {{we believe that the}} complexity and dynamic behavior of <b>multimedia</b> <b>applications</b> and systems make static solutions hard to apply in real-world situations. We are analyzing the di culties that arise when applying the rate-monotonic (RM) scheduling algorithm and the corresponding admission tests for CPU management, in the context of real <b>multimedia</b> <b>applications</b> running on real systems. RM requires statically predictable, periodic workloads, and while <b>multimedia</b> <b>applications</b> appear to be periodic, in practice they exhibit numerous variabilities in workload. Our study suggests the need for more adaptive scheduling mechanisms, which would allow complex applications to dynamically respond to variations in workload and resource availability. Furthermore, we believe {{there is a need for}} a more abstract characterization of applications and resources for admission testing purposes. We conclude that adaptive CPU scheduling policies should address the needs of CPU {{scheduling and}} reservation for current <b>multimedia</b> <b>applications.</b> ...|$|R
