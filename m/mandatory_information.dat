40|$|China has {{developed}} a comprehensive program of energy efficiency standards and labels for household appliances. In 1989, China first launched its minimum energy performance standards (MEPS), which are now applied to an extensive list of products. In 1998, China launched a voluntary energy endorsement label, which has grown to cover both energy-saving and water-saving products. And, in 2005, China launched a <b>mandatory</b> energy <b>information</b> label that initially covered two products. CLASP has assisted China in developing 11 minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for 9 products and endorsement labels for 11 products including: refrigerators; air conditioners; televisions; printers; computers; monitors; fax machines; copiers; DVD/VCD players; external power supplies; and set-top boxes. CLASP has also assisted China {{in the development of}} the <b>mandatory</b> energy <b>information</b> label. Increasingly, attention is being placed on maximum energy savings from China's standards and labeling (S&L) efforts in order to meet the recently announced goal of reducing China's energy intensity by 20 percent by 2010 with an interim objective of 4 percent in 2006. China's mandatory standards system is heavily focused on the technical requirements for efficiency performance, but historically, it has lacked administrative and personnel capacity to undertake monitoring and enforcement of these legally binding standards. Similarly, resources for monitoring and enforcement have been quite limited. As a consequence, compliance to both the mandatory standards and the <b>mandatory</b> energy <b>information</b> label is uneven with the potential and likely result of lost energy savings. Thus, a major area for improvement, which could significantly increase overall energy savings, is the creation and implementation of a regularized monitoring system for tracking the compliance to, and enforcement of, mandatory standards and the energy information label in China. CLASP has been working with the China National Institute of Standardization (CNIS), the China Administration for Quality, Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) and relevant stakeholders in the industry to develop a stronger system of monitoring and enforcement. In November 2005, CNIS and LBNL (a CLASP implementing partner) with funding from the Energy Foundation jointly organized an international workshop to present the international best practices in S&L monitoring and enforcement. Currently, CNIS is developing a guideline for monitoring and enforcement for appliance standards. With support from METI, CLASP has been able to expand the on-going collaboration with CNIS to include enforcement needs for the <b>mandatory</b> energy <b>information</b> label and to accelerate the progress of the project to develop a more robust monitoring and enforcement for S&L programs in China. This expanded effort has included: (1) Holding an enforcement and monitoring roadmap planning workshop with key S&L stakeholders; (2) Interviews with S&L stakeholders on the need and scope of national compliance tests; (3) Research on past enforcement activities; (4) An analysis of compliance data from the <b>mandatory</b> energy <b>information</b> labeling program; (5) Interviews with stakeholders on the need and scope of testing infrastructure; and (6) Development of a roadmap for future activities. This report summarizes the findings of these activities and identifies the progress that China is making, and can make, toward developing a stronger system of monitoring and enforcement (M&E). In sum, it outlines a vision of moving forward with more vigorous M&E in China...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBanks are {{supposed}} to respond to imperfect information in credit markets. They are thought to access private information and to create additional information through credit granting. This means two things. First, <b>mandatory</b> accounting <b>information</b> {{is not sufficient to}} create a state of perfect information. Second, because of their status of delegated monitors it could be interesting to identify the private information used by banks. In fact, this information could help to understand their superiority as monitors and their informational needs. This could be interesting for accounting standard setting. Based on interviews with bank loan officers, this study tries to identify what questions they attempt to answer while analysing and monitoring a credit file, what information they need and what are the problems with accounting information. We find that the analysis of borrower's risk relies heavily on bank private information and on bank shared information through Banque de France. But, bank loan officers look for more information, like risk indicators. The main problem with <b>mandatory</b> accounting <b>information</b> is its timeliness that does not allow an effective monitoring. Moreover, hardly gives it information about real cash and cash flows. So, supplementary non-accounting indicators are needed. Finally, our verbatim underline the need for cross validation by different information, including accounting information.
