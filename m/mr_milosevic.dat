U.S President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, [...] "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide." [...] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, [...] "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered." [...] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of [...] "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, [...] "they're going to have to come to grips with what <b>Mr.</b> <b>Milošević</b> ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..." [...] In the same press conference, Clinton also claimed [...] "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." [...] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, [...] "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." [...] President Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. The New York Times reported, [...] "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević." [...] The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1996, Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Milošević {{first visited}} China {{in the early}} 1980s while head of Beobank. Milošević visited China again in 1997, after an {{invitation}} by Chinese president Jiang Zemin. Milošević was often popularly known in China by the nickname [...] "Lao Mi" [...] (老米), a shortened form of the informal Chinese-style nickname [...] "Old Milošević" [...] (老米洛舍维奇); among the state-operated media in China, Milošević was {{often referred to as}} [...] "Comrade Milošević" [...] (米洛舍维奇同志). Many sources hold that the Chinese government asserted strong backing of Milošević throughout his presidency until his surrender, {{and was one of the}} few countries supportive of him and the Yugoslav government, at a time when most Western countries were strongly critical of the Milošević government. The New York Times states that People's Republic of China was [...] "one of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Milošević's</b> staunchest supporters" [...] during the Kosovo conflict. China vocally opposed NATO armed intervention in Kosovo throughout the campaign. Chinese parliamentary leader Li Peng, was presented by Milošević with Yugoslavia's highest medal (the Great Star) in Belgrade in 2000.|$|R
5000|$|After the NATO bombing, Otport {{somewhat}} {{changed its}} goals {{and focused on}} campaigns which often provoked the regime in humorous and ironic ways, thus drawing citizens’ attention and raising their motivation. One vivid example was the [...] "birthday party for Milošević" [...] demonstration organized in Niš, during which more than two thousand citizens {{had a chance to}} write down what they wished <b>Mr</b> <b>Milosevic</b> for his birthday on a joint birthday card. Along with the card, gifts, including a one-way ticket to the Hague, prison uniform, books by Mira Markovic, handcuffs and a birthday cake {{in the shape of a}} fivepointed star served to everybody present at the end of the action, were received on behalf of president Milosevic.|$|E
5000|$|The CIA {{was aware}} {{as early as}} last autumn of a plan, codenamed Operation Horseshoe, to kill or drive them out over several months. A village a day was the rate that <b>Mr</b> <b>Miloševic</b> {{calculated}} the West would wring its hands over without acting. In Priština, public records have been combed to identify precisely which homes, shops and businesses were Albanian-owned; Serb police and paramilitaries have emptied towns and villages neighbourhood by neighbourhood in a pattern that has been as unvaried {{as it has been}} ruthless.The packed trains, the snipers picking off those who strayed out of line on the forced marches to the borders: every detail points to the existence of a detailed blueprint, without which so many could not have been murdered or driven into exile within a fortnight. In this context, yesterday's reported sealing of the frontiers by Serb forces is a sinister development; {{there is no such thing}} as safety in Kosovo for a people marked for destruction solely because of their racial identity.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the topic of Yugoslav Hyperinflation of 1992 - 1994. Contrary to many works dealing with the most recent episodes of {{hyperinflation}} in the Latin American countries there is no work explaining the causes and dynamics of the Yugoslav hyperinflation. What precisely was the setting and monetary policies that led to such an extreme case of hyperinflation? This study explains through the theory of hyperinflation what happens {{when there is a}} continuous creation of money by the government and for how long the government can profit from creating money. There is a thorough analysis of the types of monetary abuse the regime of <b>Mr</b> <b>Milosevic</b> resorted to for its own personal benefit, specifically concentrating on the illegal grey issue component of primary money. The conclusion of my thesis is that the hyperinflation was made more severe by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Milosevic</b> and his subordinates with the sole purpose of depriving the people of their foreign currency. This was necessary for the regime of <b>Mr</b> <b>Milosevic</b> to stay in power. This work relied primarily on secondary sources dealing with the economic situation in Yugoslavia of that time. These included chiefly articles from independent Serbian journals as well as a few official government produced documents. Endast sammandrag.
