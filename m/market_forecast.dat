50|$|At age 13, Armstrong {{began working}} at a coin and stamp {{dealership}} in Pennsauken, New Jersey. After buying a bag of rare Canadian pennies, he became a millionaire in 1965 {{at the age of}} fifteen.

Armstrong progressed from gold coin investments to following commodity prices for precious metals. In 1973, he began publishing commodity market predictions as a hobby. As his coin and stamp business declined ten years later, Armstrong spent more of his time on his commodity business. In 1983, Armstrong began accepting and fulfilling paid subscriptions for a commodity <b>market</b> <b>forecast</b> newsletter.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{prepared}} {{in the framework}} of the "Priority Project T 1 MOP - 2. 3. 2 - 09 / 1 : Establishing labour <b>market</b> <b>forecasts</b> and foreseeing structural changes". It presents a comprehensive overview of labour <b>market</b> <b>forecasting</b> activities, mostly quantitative, based on multi-sector models, in 12 countries and the European Union. The principal aim of this effort is to provide ideas, lessons and benchmarks for similar forecasting exercises in Hungary. After outlining the basic model of quantitative labour <b>market</b> <b>forecasting</b> the paper identifies the technical conditions of model building and model quantification, as well as the characteristic features of organising the forecasting work. This analysis is based on the forecasting activities in individual countries. In the following section the authors address the paths of improvement in the traditional forecasting model. Here the possibilities of substitution in terms of occupations and qualifications are discussed, as well as their integration to the forecasting model. Another innovation is the inclusion of generic skills as a new variable in the forecasts. The next section deals with the analytical tools that can be used after the forecasts are ready, such as the shift-share analysis and the Indicator of Future Labour Market Situation (IFLM). The latter compares forecasted demand and supply in individual occupations or qualification categories. The discussion of forecasted labour shortages and vacancies as well as the measured accuracy of the forecasts leads us to one of the fundamental issues of labour <b>market</b> <b>forecasts,</b> i. e. whether the results of the calculations can be considered forecasts proper for future developments, or they should be seen simply as well-informed, systematic projections...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{evaluate}} small- and medium-sized display <b>market</b> <b>forecasts</b> made by a market research firm. Hypotheses concerning the relationship between stages of technology development and the accuracy of <b>market</b> <b>forecasts</b> are first developed. The hypotheses are then tested and evaluated using the data issued by one market research company, Techno Systems Research (TSR). Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test and nonparametric simple regression are the statistical methods used. The results of the data analysis showed that the forecasts made by the market research company are dependable for mature technology in mature markets, whereas for a new technology their forecasts are inaccurate. Furthermore, the accuracy of forecasts quite often does not improve over time. To our knowledge, no prior published works examine the accuracy of the <b>forecasts</b> made by <b>market</b> research firms.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an aviation <b>market</b> <b>forecasting</b> model {{which focuses on}} <b>market</b> <b>forecasts</b> for airports. Most forecasting models in use today assess aviation trends resulting from macroeconomic trends.

The model requires relatively few data. In cases where specific airport data are lacking, such data can be estimated using worldwide airline schedule data. This makes the model suitable for practically every airport in the world. The first part of the paper describes the general functionality of the model and its components.

Using the {{survey conducted by}} the Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) among professional forecasters during the inflation targeting period, the main results are as follows: i) credibility in Brazilian monetary policy has increased over time, since inflation targets are important to explain inflation expectations, and private agents perceive the CBB as following a Taylor-type rule that is consistent with the inflation targeting framework; ii) <b>market</b> inflation <b>forecasts</b> had similar or better forecast performance than ARMA-, VAR- and BVAR-based forecasts with standard information sets; iii) the joint performance of <b>market</b> <b>forecasts</b> has improved over the past years; iv) in the decomposition of forecast errors for inflation, interest rate and exchange rate, the common forecast error component prevails over the idiosyncratic component across survey respondents; v) top-five forecasters published by the CBB are influential in other respondents’ forecasts; vi) inflation forecasts are unbiased but not fully efficient; and vii) inflation forecast uncertainty is positively related to increasing inflation and to country-risk premium. ...|$|R
