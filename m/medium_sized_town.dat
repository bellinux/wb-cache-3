From 1906 to 1949, Bandung grew from a <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>town</b> with 38.000 inhabitants to the third City in Nederlands-Indië with 590.000 inhabitants. In 1929, Bandung approved the Framework plan city planning, which covered an area of 12.758 ha, divided in plans for mainly the Northern- and partly the Southern areas of the town. This plan which followed the garden city concept was successfully applied in the Northern part of the town {{where most of the}} European population lived. The north part was designed with large public spaces, spacious and green residential areas in which public and private greens are integrated. The roads were fit out with, originally, a consequent planting of trees. But the valley of the river Cikapundung - which was ones fitted up as a park landscape (Ijzermanpark) is nowadays occupied by spontaneous kampung-settlements. The North part was divided in an Army area, a Governmental area, areas for dwelling houses and villas, small-housing for the common people and kampung-areas for the labor people. The Chinese inhabitants lived in the Pasar Baru quarter, southwest of the railroad. The natives lived in the Southern part of the town, like many of the Indo-Europeans.|$|E

Pursuing the main aim, i. e. sustainable integration of the public transport into the urban development process by optimally satisfying the needs of Lithuania’s people, it its necessary to consider such aspects as general planning of development of residential and business areas, {{at the same time}} expanding the priority system of the public transport that is environment-friendly and safe, integration and inter-coordination of the public transport modes, also hierarchisation and inter-coordination of the public transport modes. In many countries the public transport is recognized to be a priority branch of urban transport in order to at least partially solve the problems of urban transport. After regaining independence, the post-Soviet countries saw a rapid growth in the level of automobilization, which resulted in transport problems in small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>towns.</b> In 90 ’s the public transport system was neglected; and only recently it has been recovering the former level of services.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study that}} is part of a multidisciplinary project examining the relationship between transport, air pollution and health in Guildford, a <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>town</b> in the UK. Real-time air quality monitoring revealed low levels of air pollution through vehicle emissions. However, the residents of the town claim that there is an air pollution problem, perceptions reinforced by visual and sensory feedback, i. e., people see dust, feel irritations to their eyes, noses and throats and smell exhaust fumes. It is shown that the higher people believe air pollution levels to be the more responsible they feel and the less trust they have in local authorities and technological developments. Beliefs about the health consequences of air pollution are not related to responsibility and trust. The findings support other studies on risk perception that have shown that people find a risk less acceptable when they have a lower trust in risk managers. It is concluded that these findings are of importance for the environmental education of the public generally and risk communication by local authorities in particular...|$|E

Three hundred and ninety-one individuals (54 % females) participated. A logistic regression analysis was used to investigate which factors (i. e. need, sociodemographic and <b>town</b> <b>size)</b> predicted lifetime help-seeking for emotional or mental problems from formal health providers in the study sample.

Current Government policy is to incorporate sustainable development into the planning system through new and re-issued planning policy guidance notes for planning authorities. The research suggests that current government policy is conflicting and impractical, as well as ignoring the possible impact of demographic change. Planning policies for sustainable development must be adapted tolocal conditions. The local environment, including climate, topography, transport links, social and economic forces, determines which measures will prove most effective.

The study also analyses the obstacles in effective data collection and processing which implementation team faced during the analysis. The primary limitation of the analysis, is similarly as in other studies, is the quality of the non-financial information which had to be obtained.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the interactions}} between vehicles, infrastructure and environment for rail traffic. It identifies variables having a significant influence on sound levels, defines a standard procedure for measuring noise, and develops a database for setting up and calibrating train noise models. A pilot study looks at two railway lines passing through Vercelli, a <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>town</b> in the north-west of Italy. Four main conclusions were drawn. First, in certain conditions, variables that normally influence noise production can be neglected (e. g. when surrounding environmental conditions are constant, different types of train do not cause a significant variation in noise level). Secondly, when diesel trains are travelling at less than 70 km/h, a speed change of 30 - 40 km/h significantly affects the maximum noise level (Lmax). However, for electrified lines, when speed is below 80 km/h, a change of 20 - 30 km/h does not cause significant variations in Lmax. Thirdly, for diesel trains transiting at low speeds [...] e. g. near stations [...] noise emissions are strongly affected by acceleration/deceleration. Lastly, an approach based on sites types is able to produce useful results because site configuration {{and the presence of}} building significantly affect Lmax. High buildings along the line can increase noise levels and may nullify the advantages derived from technological advance in the vehicles...|$|E
