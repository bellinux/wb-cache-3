5000|$|On 27 October 2011 three clocks of Ghanta Ghar were {{repaired}} {{and started}} again showing time of PST which is +5GMT. This effort {{was done by}} a watch company [...] Rado. The machinery and needles of the clocks were changed while the clock's <b>main</b> <b>dial</b> was unchanged. It runs by solar energy. The clock had stopped working in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Probe {{indicators}} typically {{consist of}} a graduated dial and needle driven by a clockwork (thus the clock terminology) to record the minor increments, with a smaller embedded clock face and needle to record the number of needle rotations on the <b>main</b> <b>dial.</b> The dial has fine gradations for precise measurement. The spring-loaded probe (or plunger) moves perpendicularly to the object being tested by either retracting or extending from the indicator's body.|$|E
50|$|The Lounge was a 24-hour music network {{produced}} by Dial Global and distributed under their Dial Global Local brand (formerly by Waitt Radio Networks). The network's tag line was Great Songs and Stars. The format was discontinued on June 17, 2012, {{as part of}} a corporate reorganization by Dial Global which resulted in the elimination of the Dial Global Local brand and the absorption of most of the other DG Local formats into the <b>main</b> <b>Dial</b> Global portfolio.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} instrumentation of the Ka-26 {{resembles that}} of larger naval Kamovs and is considered excessive for civilian or cropdusting use. The large cockpit panel with its 18 <b>main</b> <b>dials</b> obscures {{a significant part of}} the right-downwards view direction from the cabin, which is crucial to avoid telephone and power lines in agricultural and other low-altitude roles. It is common practice to replace the instrument panel with a simplified layout, retaining only the six generally useful dials for better vision.|$|R
50|$|Exeter. The Exeter Cathedral {{astronomical clock}} {{is one of}} the group of famous 14th to 16th century astronomical clocks {{to be found in the}} West of England. The <b>main,</b> lower, <b>dial</b> is the oldest part of the clock, {{probably}} dating from the 1480s.|$|R
50|$|The {{same shape}} was carried {{over to the}} {{interior}} of the car where the <b>main</b> <b>dials</b> and controls on the dash-board were surrounded by a thick frame in the shape that respected a short sausage (or a very long lozenge). The repetitious use of a single simple shape at different levels of the design gave the overall car a consistent visual unity which was {{in stark contrast to the}} high finned flamboyance of the previous Taunus 17M and was seen at the time as a radical switch by Ford of Germany away from American styling in favour of European styling. There were no tails fins and there was very little decorative chrome included. The efficiency of its superficially much more simple design enabled Ford to boast that the 1960 car, despite being fractionally narrowed on the outside, offered usefully more interior width than the car it replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{top left}} of the body had a Command Dial for choice of either Creative or Image zones and buttons to control the {{integral}} flash. The top right of the body had a multi-function <b>Main</b> <b>Dial,</b> buttons for autofocus and film advance control, the shutter release button and an LCD display panel. The back of the body had the Quick Control Dial, used for aperture control, and the AE Lock Button, used to lock exposure settings.|$|E
50|$|The Southwestern Bell Telephone Company {{constructed}} a two-story building in 1924. The structure, which encompassed 18726 sq ft, was {{to house the}} <b>main</b> <b>dial</b> equipment for the new automatic dial equipment {{that the company had}} introduced to Tulsa in November 1924. The architecture of the building was Gothic Style. In 1930, the company added four floors {{to the top of the}} 1924 structure to house its divisional offices and toll terminal equipment needed for the underground cable that connected Tulsa with Oklahoma City. The 1930 addition was constructed in Zig Zag Art Deco Style.|$|E
5000|$|One {{method of}} adding a {{bandspread}} control {{was to put}} a relatively small value variable tuning capacitor and dial directly in parallel with the main tuning variable capacitor ( [...] or connected to a tap on the coil of the tuned circuit). The smaller capacitor would have much less effect on the resonant frequency than the main capacitor, allowing fine discrimination of the tuned frequency. A second method, mechanical bandspread, was a second tuning knob connected through a gear train to the main tuning knob; each turn of the bandspread dial moved the <b>main</b> <b>dial</b> through {{a small part of}} its range, improving the precision of tuning.|$|E
50|$|The <b>main,</b> lower, <b>dial</b> is {{the oldest}} part of the clock, dating from 1484. The fleur-de-lys 'hand' {{indicates}} the time (and {{the position of the}} sun in the sky) on a 24-hour analogue dial. The numbering consists of two sets of I-XII Roman numerals. The silver ball and inner dial shows both the age of the moon and its phase (using a rotating black shield to indicate the moon's phase). The upper dial, added in 1760, shows the minutes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{much of the}} North American Numbering Plan, a 0 or 1 in {{the second}} digit {{signified}} an area code until 1994; these numbers could not be issued as individual local exchanges without breaking eight-digit (1+7D) long-distance calls within an area code. The B-52's (album) used the non-working number 6060-842 {{as the title of}} a 45 rpm 'B'-side track on the 1979 version of hit single 'Rock Lobster'; the song's <b>main</b> character <b>dials</b> [...] "(the) stupid number all day long" [...] only to find it disconnected. This reservation no longer exists.|$|R
25|$|The Metonic <b>Dial</b> is the <b>main</b> upper <b>dial</b> on {{the rear}} of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several {{physical}} units, is 235 synodic months, which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the Corinthian month names.|$|R
5000|$|The {{outermost}} disc {{is decorated}} with a fleur-de-lis which represents the sun, and which orbits the dial once every 24 hours. This indicates the hour of the day, counted from I to XII in Roman numerals in first the right and then the left hemispheres of the clockface. This {{is an example of}} a 24-hour analog dial. The tail of the sun's fleur-de-lis points to the day in the lunar month on the inner ring. The half-black, half-silver moon inside the lunar month ring rotates on its axis to show the correct phase of the moon. The earth is represented as a fixed golden ball in the centre of the dial. The Latin inscription [...] "Pereunt et imputantur" [...] below the <b>main</b> <b>dial</b> may be translated as [...] "The hours pass and are reckoned to our account".|$|E
50|$|The clock {{movement}} had a balance wheel regulated to beat {{at the rate}} of 2 seconds. Its simple wheel train turned a dial marked on the margin with a scale of 24 equal hours and 10-minute intervals. The dial rotated anticlockwise against a fixed pointer, showing mean time, and could be adjusted if necessary by intervals of 10 minutes of time by sliding out a pinion of 12 teeth that meshed with the 144 teeth of the <b>main</b> <b>dial.</b> On each side of the clock dial was a fixed plate or 'tabula orientii', graduated with months and days of the Julian calendar for the purpose of determining the times of the rising and setting of the mean sun for the latitude of Padova (about 45Â°deg N). At the time the clock was made, the dates of the solstices were 13 June and 13 December (Old style or Julian Calendar).|$|E
5000|$|The rarest Daytonas {{are those}} {{with what has}} been called the [...] "Paul Newman" [...] dial. It is said that Newman wore one of these watches, given to him by his wife Joanne Woodward when he took up {{automobile}} racing, from 1972 until his death in 2008. Its distinguishing features are subtle and often unnoticeable to the untrained eye. First, a Paul Newman dial must be in a Reference 6239, 6241, 6262, 6263, 6264 or 6265 watch, installed by Rolex Geneva as original. All of these References had acrylic domed crystals. That aside, the sub-dials (the dials that are the opposite or contrasting color of the <b>main</b> <b>dial)</b> of a Paul Newman dial have block markers instead of lines, have crosshairs across each sub-dial meeting at the centre (unlike the normal Daytona), and the seconds sub-dial placed at 9:00 is marked at 15, 30, 45 and 60, whereas a normal Daytona dial is marked at 20, 40 and 60. The dial {{may or may not have}} the word [...] "Daytona" [...] written on the dial above the hour sub-dial located at 6:00. The dial came in four color and layout combinations, and was installed as an option by Rolex on the Daytona line of watches in the Reference 6239, 6241, 6262, 6263, 6264 or 6265 watches. The watch went out of production in the early 1970s, and Rolex does not supply any replacement version of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four <b>main</b> input <b>dials,</b> were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|R
50|$|The central {{element of}} the MMI {{terminal}} is the control dial. This dial can be rotated, to navigate up and down through menus, and pressed to activate a selected highlighted function. Starting with MMI 3G system an integrated joystick in the <b>main</b> control <b>dial</b> {{can be used to}} (for example) navigate the map. Depending on the MMI generation and configuration, four to eight function buttons surround the control dial which are used to launch the various features. The MMI screen is available as a five-inch monochrome black-and-red or seven-inch 16:9 full colour display, depending on the variation of MMI fitted in the car. MMI uses Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) technology to interconnect the various systems. Harman Becker Automotive Systems manufactures the MMI system, utilizing QNX Neutrino's Real Time Operating System (RTOS) software.|$|R
5000|$|More {{accurate}} tooth counts {{were also}} obtained, allowing a new gearing scheme to be advanced. [...] This more accurate information allowed Wright to confirm Price's perceptive {{suggestion that the}} upper back dial displays the Metonic cycle with 235 lunar months divisions over a five-turn scale. In addition to this Wright proposed the remarkable idea that the <b>main</b> back <b>dials</b> are {{in the form of}} spirals, with the upper back dial out as a five-turn spiral containing 47 divisions in each turn. It therefore presented a visual display of the 235 months of the Metonic cycle (19 years â 235 Synodic Months). Wright also observed that fragmentary inscriptions suggested that the pointer on the subsidiary dial showed a count of four cycles of the 19-year period, equal to the 76-year Callippic cycle.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was also}} the last NHL arena to retain {{the use of an}} analog dial-type large four-sided clock for {{timekeeping}} in professional hockey games. Boston Garden and the Detroit Olympia (as well as the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in its pre-NHL days) had identical scoreboards but replaced them with digital timers in the mid-1960s, with Boston having their digital four-sided clock in use for the 1969-70 NHL season. Built by Bulova as their [...] "Sports Timer", and installed in Chicago in 1943, each side of the clock had a large diameter 20-minute face in the center that kept the main game time for one period of ice hockey, with a set of shorter black-colored minute and longer red-colored sweep-second hands, and a pair of smaller, 5-minute capacity dual-concentric faces for penalty timekeeping, to the left and right of the primary 20-minute face â with each of the 5-minute penalty timers having its own single hand and each clock face, both the central main timer's dial and flanking penalty timer dials (when a penalty was counting down) illuminated from behind during gameplay. The [...] "outer" [...] face of each penalty timer had a single hand that avoided obscuration of the [...] "inner" [...] face and its own, [...] "solid" [...] single hand, through the use of metal rods forming the outer hand's [...] "shaft", holding its hand's [...] "pointer" [...] head â the set of two concentric faces for each penalty timer dial could handle two penalties for each set, with an illuminated [...] "2" [...] on each penalty timer dial lighting up to display a minor penalty infraction. It was difficult to read how much time was left in a period of play on the main game timer's large face, as each minute of play was marked by a longer line on every third [...] "seconds" [...] increment on the central <b>main</b> <b>dial,</b> due to the minute hand's twenty-minute [...] "full rotation" [...] timing capacity for one period of ice hockey. The difficulty was compounded on the main central dial from the aforementioned minute and sweep-second hands being in constant motion during gameplay. The [...] "Sports Timer's" [...] only digital displays were for scoring and for penalized players' numbers, each digit comprising a six-high, four-wide incandescent light dot matrix display.|$|E
2500|$|The Saros <b>dial</b> is the <b>main</b> lower spiral <b>dial</b> on {{the rear}} of the mechanism. The Saros cycle is 18 years and [...] days long (6585.333â¦ days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of {{repetition}} of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict themâ not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read: ...|$|R
50|$|Before 1969, Australia did {{not have}} a {{national}} number for emergency services; the police, fire and ambulance services had many phone numbers, one for each local unit. In 1961, the office of the Postmaster General (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and {{near the end of the}} 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a <b>main</b> centre; thus <b>dialling</b> 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones, so it was easy to dial in darkness.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} {{the knowledge of}} basic life-support and training experience in cardiopulmonary resuscitation among the public in Hong Kong and to identify areas for improvement in public education. Design. Telephone interview using a structured multiple-choice questionnaire. Setting. Random cross-section of the Hong Kong public, from mid-March to May 2002. Participants. Men and women aged 16 years and older selected using random telephone <b>dialling.</b> <b>Main</b> outcome measure. Overall score in the cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge questionnaire. Results. Of the 357 participants, approximately 12 % had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation knowledge in Hong Kong was poor, even among the previously trained and {{especially with regard to}} circulatory maintenance. The most common reason for not taking cardiopulmonary resuscitation training was lack of time. Conclusion. The degree of citizen preparedness in initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation is very poor in Hong Kong. Intensified educational efforts and exploration of new approaches to improve this first stage in the chain of survival are warranted. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|Jones Radio Networks, {{the largest}} {{independent}} radio network, provided many programming options for local radio stations. The company provided many satellite-driven formats to affiliate stations, mostly in small & mid-size markets and on major market HD Radio subchannels, however {{they can also}} be used on some major market stations as alternate or permanent programming. They could operate their stations virtually unmanned with nothing more than a computer and a satellite hookup. The [...] "clock" [...] included options for a 2-, 3-, or 5-minute newscasts {{at the top of the}} hour, followed by other holes for local spots. While the programming was live, DJ's had to avoid references to the weather or anything else that would not be appropriate in many time zones. An 800-line was eventually added, allowing the live DJ's to take phoned in requests. On June 20, 2008, Triton Radio Networks, a wholly owned subsidiary of Triton Media Group, announced the acquisition of Jones Media Group and its operating companies, Jones Media America, Jones Radio Networks and JonesTM from Jones International Ltd. Only two months prior, Triton had acquired two of Jones's three <b>main</b> competitors, <b>Dial</b> Global and Waitt Radio Networks (only Citadel Media remains not under the Triton banner). JonesTM (now renamed TM STUDIOS), a leading provider of music libraries, imaging products and jingles, will remain a separate reporting unit.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine whether}} {{the risk of}} breast cancer is {{increased}} by a recent term pregnancy. DESIGN [...] Population based case-control study. SETTING [...] Eight areas in the United States. SUBJECTS [...] Cases were 2279 multiparous women residents of the eight areas aged 25 - 49 who were diagnosed as having breast cancer during 1980 - 2. Controls were 2357 multiparous women selected from the same areas by random digit <b>dialing.</b> <b>MAIN</b> OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Relative risk of developing breast cancer according to the time interval since last full term pregnancy. RESULTS [...] The distribution of intervals since the last term pregnancy was similar in cases and controls. Adjusted for age, parity, and age at first term pregnancy, the odds ratios observed for categories of years since the last full term pregnancy were: 0 - 2 years, odds ratio 1. 16 (95 % confidence interval 0. 84 to 1. 59); 3 - 6 years, odds ratio 1. 21 (0. 95 to 1. 54); 7 - 9 years, odds ratio 1. 04 (0. 84 to 1. 38); > or = 10 years, odds ratio 1. 00 (reference).

40|$|UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE, DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The {{objective}} was to investigate media influence on consumers' health related behaviours. A cross-sectional survey of randomly selected adults (18 + years) residing in the Hunter Region of New South Wales Australia was conducted. The sample was selected {{using a combination of}} the white pages and random digit <b>dialling.</b> <b>MAIN</b> OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportions of respondents who recalled seeing or hearing about conditions or treatments in the media over the 12 months prior to interview (August 2009 -August 2010) and their subsequent health related behaviour. RESULTS: Although most survey participants reported seeking health information from their doctors, around two-thirds of survey participants (551, 68. 8 %) recalled hearing, seeing or reading about one or more medical conditions (totalâ=â 1097 instances) in the mainstream media over the past 12 months. Almost 40 % of respondents (307, 38. 4 %) stated that they had looked for more information about a condition as a result of hearing about it in the media, and most used the internet (269, 87. 4 %). More than a quarter of respondents (215, 26. 9 %) indicated that they had asked their doctor about a condition they had heard about in the media. Around half of those who asked their doctor (109, 50. 6 %) reported that their inquiry resulted in them receiving treatment, of whom almost half (53, 48. 3 %) reported being prescribed a medicine. CONCLUSION: The survey results show that consumers become aware of medicines through traditional media and then to learn more often turn to the internet where quality of information may be poor...|$|R
