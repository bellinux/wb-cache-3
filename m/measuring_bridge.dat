40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 1990 {{the skin}} source <b>measuring</b> <b>bridge</b> was {{proposed}} {{as a tool}} to measure (1) the distance between the interstitial implant and the overlying skin during brachytherapy boost treatment as well as (2) the distances between the lateral source end and the exit point of the guide needle. The present study reports on the clinical experience using the source skin <b>measuring</b> <b>bridge</b> with respect to incidence and grade of teleangiectasia, and their relation to source skin distances and doses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-two breast cancer patients (229 breasts) treated between 1983 and 1996 with breast conserving therapy including a brachytherapy boost were scored on the occurrence of teleangiectasia. The minimum distance between the sources (above implant and laterally) and the skin surface were measured. RESULTS: If no bridge was used the appearance of teleangiectasia in the epiderm above the implant is 77, 63 and 50 % for boost doses of 25, 20 and 15 Gy, respectively. For brachytherapy boost doses of 25 and 20 Gy and distances smaller than 10 mm between the implant and the overlying epiderm, as determined with the skin source <b>measuring</b> <b>bridge,</b> the appearance of teleangiectasia was 78 and 46 %, respectively. When respecting provisional dosimetry to spare the skin for a boost dose of 15 Gy, resulting in distances between 10 and 15 mm for the implant overlying skin and distances between 5 and 10 mm for the lateral skin, teleangiectasia can be reduced to a minimum (6. 3 % above and 3. 3 % laterally). While in a univariate analysis several parameters (use of the bridge, boost dose, boost modality, external beam therapy modality) were predictive factors, the use of the bridge remained the only significant variable in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The skin source <b>measuring</b> <b>bridge</b> reduces teleangiectasia after interstitial brachytherapy boost treatment. A hypothesis made previously relating teleangiectasia and source skin distances was verified and extended. Even when 3 D planning is used, the bridge allows for a provisional calculation of the security margins between source positions and the skin at the time of BT implantation to assure a correct needle positioning from the beginning, instead of correcting dwell times later on to avoid unnecessary high skin doses. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Bridge {{managers}} {{all over}} the world are always looking for simple ways to <b>measure</b> <b>bridge</b> vertical displacements for structural health monitoring. However, traditional methods to obtain such data are either tedious or expensive. There is a need to develop a simple, inexpensive, and yet practical method to <b>measure</b> <b>bridge</b> vertical displacements. This paper proposes two methods using either optical fiber (FBG) sensors or a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera, respectively, for vertical displacement measurements of bridges. The FBG sensor method is based on the measured horizontal strains together with the identified curvature functions obtained by a self-developed FBG Tilt sensor. CCD cameras use a large number of pixels to form an image. The CCD camera method utilizes image processing techniques for pixel identification and subsequent edge detection. A preliminary study to validate the proposed methods in laboratory was presented. The tests include applying the methods to determine the vertical displacements separately for a concrete beam and a steel beam under various loadings. The comparisons include their installations, costs, degrees of accuracy, external factors affecting the measurement, etc. It was concluded that both methods could be used for vertical displacement measurement, and they could be complementary with one another. It was suggested to further improve the two methods developed and a successful outcome will not only help to solve an important problem for bridge management, but also prepare the way for better structural health monitoring techniques.

Bedload was directly sampled using 152 mm square Helley–Smith type samplers deployed from a portable <b>measuring</b> <b>bridge,</b> and independent transport rate estimates for the coarser size fractions {{were obtained from the}} dispersion of magnetically tagged tracer pebbles. Bedload transport time series show pulsing behaviour under both marginal (1998) and partial (1999) transport regimes. There are generally weak correlations between transport rates and shear stresses determined from velocity data recorded at the <b>measuring</b> <b>bridge.</b> Characteristic parameters of the bedload grain-size distributions (D 50, D 84) are weakly correlated with transport rates. Analysis of full bedload grain-size distributions reveals greater structure, with a tendency for transport to become less size selective at higher transport rates. The bedload time series show autoregressive behaviour but are difficult to distinguish by this method. State–space plots, and associated measures of time-series separation, reveal the structure of the time series more clearly. The measured pulses have distinctly different time-series characteristics from those modelled using a one-dimensional sediment routing model in which bed shear stress and grain size are varied randomly. These results suggest a mechanism of pulse generation based on irregular low-amplitude bedforms, that may be generated in-channel or may represent the advection of material supplied by bank erosion events...|$|E

Current telemetering systems are too heavy and offer too few channels for successful application to the investigation of supersonic test vehicles. A study of the available systems indicates three factors which are uniformly insufficient. These factors are (1) the duplication of circuitry incident to the use of a separate amplifier for each channel; (2) inefficient methods of electronic commutation; (3) water of power by the continuous excitation of <b>measuring</b> <b>bridges.</b> A system is proposed which obviates these three points of inefficiency. A single amplifier for the whole system and a commutation scheme using a binary scaling circuit and a resistance matrix reduce the tube requirements for these two functions from 480 tubes to 45. Power is conserved by exciting the <b>measuring</b> <b>bridges</b> only during the time that information is desired from them. This process reduces the power requirements for bridge excitation from the power required for continuous excitation by a factor equal to the reciprocal of the number of channels. Following these principles, circuits were constructed which indicate that the proposed system seems entirely practical. Such a system should be lighter than any of the present ones and also capable of providing at least four times as many channels. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

The test helps balance users to gain confidence in load predictions of non-traditional balance designs. It also {{makes it possible to}} better evaluate load predictions of traditional balances that are not used as originally intended. The test works for both the Iterative and Non-Iterative Methods that are used in the aerospace testing community for the prediction of balance loads. It is based on the hypothesis that the total number of independently applied balance load components must always match the total number of independently <b>measured</b> <b>bridge</b> outputs or bridge output combinations. This hypothesis is supported by a control volume analysis of the inputs and outputs of a strain-gage balance. It is concluded from the control volume analysis that the loads and bridge outputs of a balance calibration data set must separately be tested for linear independence because it cannot always be guaranteed that a linearly independent load component set will result in linearly independent bridge output measurements. Simple linear math models for the loads and bridge outputs in combination with the variance inflation factor are used to test for linear independence.
