500|$|The {{first months}} of 1846 were {{dominated}} by a battle in Parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and Lord George Bentinck. [...] The landowning interest in the Party, under its leader, William Miles MP for East Somerset, had called upon Disraeli to lead the Party. [...] Disraeli had declined, though pledged support to the Country Gentlemen's Interes, as Bentink had offered to lead if he had Disraeli's support. Disraeli stated, in a letter to Sir William Miles of 11 June 1860, that he wished to help [...] "because, from <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> years, my sympathies had been with the landed interest of England".|$|E

Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. <b>My</b> <b>earliest</b> films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E

Verdi did not encounter Shakespeare's original work until after the first performance of the opera, although he had read Shakespeare in translation for many years, as he noted in an 1865 letter: [...] "He {{is one of my favorite}} poets.

In consequence, I determined to apply all the powers which my individual efforts could move, in order to separate the two countries."

[...] "One of <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> memories", he later recalled, [...] "is of seeing her at her desk... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper.

In a 2006 interview, he told Adult Video News, [...] "It was a steep learning curve. I look back at some of <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> work and cringe.

[...] However, Jefferson later refused an offer of Wythe's lecture notes and other legal papers, believing they should go instead to what became the Library of Virginia. Last reported either in the possession of Spencer Roane (who burned many papers before his own death) or his ally Thomas Ritchie (publisher of the Richmond Enquirer), they were reported lost by the 1830s.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a present}} for his 16th {{birthday}} Weston's father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, which was a simple box camera. He took it on vacation in the Midwest, {{and by the time}} he returned home his interest in photography was enough to lead him to purchase a used 5 × 7inch view camera. He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, [...] "I feel that <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to my latest work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913–1920, a period in which I was trying to be artistic." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{edition of}} the book {{appeared}} in 1972, without Fischer's permission and without regard for copyright laws. This was standard Soviet practice at the time. The translator had trouble with some of Fischer's American colloquialisms and also omitted several statements that were felt to be anti-Soviet. The edition included a supplementary article assessing Fischer's playing style, written by Grandmaster Alexey Suetin, and a short biographical article, written by Grandmaster (and former World Champion) Vasily Smyslov. At one of the press conferences for his 1992 rematch with Boris Spassky, Fischer said 50,000 copies had been printed in the USSR and he [...] "hadn't got a penny" [...] from them. He answered speculation about a match with the then World Champion Garry Kasparov by saying nothing could take place until the Russian authorities had paid him all the royalties {{he felt he was}} owed. [...] In 1995, Fischer accepted payment of $100,000 from Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the (then) newly elected president of FIDE, as financial settlement. This edition was one of Kasparov's first chess books, which he described as [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> and most treasured chess possessions" [...] and [...] "a great influence on my chess." ...|$|E

2500|$|No {{account of}} my {{childhood}} {{would be complete without}} mentioning the eunuchs. They waited on me when I ate, dressed and slept; they accompanied me on my walks and to my lessons; they told me stories; and had rewards and beatings from me, but they never left my presence. They were my slaves; and they were <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> teachers. The eunuchs were all slaves who did all of the work in the Forbidden City such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and all of the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire and serving as the emperor's advisers. The eunuchs spoke in a distinctive high-pitched voice and to further prove that they were really eunuchs had to keep their severed penises and testicles in jars of brine that they wore around their necks when working. The Forbidden City was full of treasures, which the eunuchs were constantly stealing and selling on the black market. The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption and virtually all of the eunuchs engaged in theft and corruption of one sort or another.|$|E

[...] Her approbation and unremitting kindness, when we were both very young indeed, kindled the latest sparks of genius to a flame, which she now gazes on with wonder and delight. [...] Let this not appear like vanity. [...] Recollect what I am, and you will find it proceeds from a better source. [...] She cannot have so much pleasure in seeing the plant she has so kindly cherished in such a thriving state, as I have in seeing the plant she has so kindly cherished in such a thriving state, as I have in seeing her united to a man every way worthy of her, and whose whole life is devoted to her happiness in short, they form a harmony seldom to be met with – their souls are in unison. [...] The end of this history is, that it is impossible to me to go to Lord Harcourt's this summer how I shall excuse myself I know not; but I know everything forbids me refusing to stay with <b>my</b> <b>earliest</b> friend." ...|$|E
