40|$|The {{discovery}} of giant magnetoresistance (GMR) in rare earth <b>manganates</b> {{of the general}} formula Ln(1 -x) A(x) MnO(3) (Ln = rare earth, A = divalent cation) has aroused much interest {{not only because of}} its technological implications, but also due to the fascinating features and mechanism of the phenomemon in these oxides. GMR is observed in these <b>manganates</b> when they become ferromagnetic and transform from an insulating state to a metallic state close to the Curie temperature. The essential features of magnetoresistance in the <b>manganates</b> can be understood {{on the basis of the}} double-exchange mechanism, but this is too simplistic to account for all the observed data. The most curious property of the <b>manganates</b> relates to the high resistivity exhibited in the so-called metallic state. Charge ordering competes with the double-exchange interaction responsible for ferromagnetism and GMR in these materials. The charge-ordered (charge-crystal) insulating state in the rare earth <b>manganates</b> can be melted into a metallic and ferromagnetic charge-liquid state by applying a magnetic field, thus providing a unique case of charge and spin separation in solids.

This was the first time that the FAA had grounded an airliner type since 1979. The FAA also announced plans to conduct an extensive review of the 787's critical systems. The focus of the review was on the safety of the lithium-ion batteries that use lithium cobalt oxide(LiCoO2) as the positive electrode. These electrodes are known for their thermal runaway hazard and provide oxygen for a fire. The 787 battery contract was signed in 2005, when LiCoO2 batteries were the only type of lithium aerospace battery available, but since then newer and safer types (such as LiFePO4) and LiMn2O4 (Lithium <b>Manganate),</b> which provide less reaction energy during thermal runaway, have become available.

40|$|Properties of the hole-doped Ln(1 -x) A(x) MnO(3) (Ln = rare earth, A = {{alkaline}} earth, x 0. 5). Charge ordering is {{the dominant}} interaction in the latter class of <b>manganates</b> unlike ferromagnetism and metallicity in the hole-doped materials. Properties of charge-ordered (CO) compositions in the hole- and electron-doped regimes, Pr 0. 64 Ca 0. 36 MnO 3 and Pr 0. 36 Ca 0. 64 MnO 3, differ markedly. Thus, the CO state in the hole-doped Pr 0. 64 Ca 0. 36 MnO 3 is destroyed by magnetic fields and by substitution of Cr 3 + or Ru 4 + (3 %) in the Mn site, while the CO state in the electron-doped Pr 0. 36 Ca 0. 64 MnO 3 is essentially unaffected.
