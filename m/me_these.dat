500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Gregory Hardy of the Orlando Sentinel placed it at number eleven {{on his list}} of the show's fifteen best episodes that target the world of sports. Writing for IGN, Robert Canning gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, commenting that he thought the three acts felt disconnected. He wrote: [...] "First Maude dies, then Ned dates and now Ned questions his faith. To <b>me,</b> <b>these</b> three storylines {{would have been better}} served had they been the focus of their own individual episodes." [...] Canning added that he felt [...] "the episode made a poor choice by rushing through the mourning period and moving right into Ned dating," [...] but that [...] "the dating stuff, while, again, feeling hurried, was quite funny, especially Ned's date with Edna Krabappel." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1884, the 44-year-old Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed the unsociability and restlessness that had plagued him since his {{abortive}} marriage in 1878, and which had {{caused him to}} travel incessantly throughout Russia and Western Europe. In March 1884, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which carried with it hereditary nobility, and won Tchaikovsky a personal audience with the Tsar. The Tsar's decoration was a visible seal of official approval, which helped Tchaikovsky's rehabilitation from the stigma associated with the conditions of his marriage. This rehabilitation may have been cemented in the composer's mind {{with the success of}} his Third Orchestral Suite at its January 1885 premiere in St. Petersburg, under Hans von Bülow's direction. Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "I have never seen such a triumph. I saw the whole audience was moved, and grateful to <b>me.</b> <b>These</b> moments are the finest adornments of an artist's life. Thanks to these it is worth living and laboring." [...] The press was likewise unanimously favorable.|$|E
500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Downs {{music is}} rooted in Americana and draws {{on a number of}} styles, {{including}} blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country music. For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions. In his interview on Marketplace, he explained his stylistic approach for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, stating [...] "to <b>me,</b> <b>these</b> musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them — if it's an accordion, horns, the banda horns for the immigrant tunes — they all are part of the story. And you can see it then, you can imagine the Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there." [...] According to him, musical settings for certain songs were decided based on their respective compositions, such as when [...] "the words would come to me in ¾ time, that meant corrido, that means accordion; banda horns because they’re exciting." ...|$|E

Pedro's {{last couple of years}} were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil. He never {{supported}} a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire [...] "to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort." [...] One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia. Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family. His last words were [...] "May God grant <b>me</b> <b>these</b> last wishes—peace and prosperity for Brazil".

500|$|An {{undercover}} agent for Scientology went to Stirling University, where Wallis was a teacher. The individual {{pretended to be}} a student, and asked Wallis if he was involved with illegal drugs. Wallis recognized the individual from the Scientology facility Saint Hill Manor, and the agent switched his cover and then asserted {{that he was actually}} a defector from Scientology. In a 1977 article in Doing Sociological Research titled [...] "The Moral Career of a Research Project", Wallis details what occurred after this incident, [...] "In the weeks following his visit a number of forged letters came to light, some of which were supposedly written by <b>me.</b> <b>These</b> letters sent to my university employers, colleagues and others, implicated me in a variety of acts from a homosexual love affair to spying for the drug squad. Because I had few enemies and because this attention followed so closely upon the receipt of my paper by the Church of Scientology organization, it did not seem too difficult to infer the source of these attempts to inconvenience me." [...] According to Lamont, as of the publication of Religion Inc. in 1986, [...] "the book is now accepted by the Public Affairs office of the Church of Scientology as reasonable and fair", and he was provided a copy of the book from the organization itself.|$|E

When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: [...] "Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff.

He would tell <b>me</b> <b>these</b> horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient." ...|$|E

He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union.

2500|$|Much American fictional {{literature}} {{has focused on}} issues of racism and the black [...] "racial experience" [...] in the US, including works written by whites such as Uncle Tom's Cabin, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Imitation of Life, or even the non-fiction work Black Like <b>Me.</b> <b>These</b> books, and others like them, feed into {{what has been called}} the [...] "white savior narrative in film", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. Textual analysis of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African American writers have sometimes been portrayed in African-American studies as retreating from racial issues when they write about [...] "whiteness", while others identify this as an African American literary tradition called [...] "the literature of white estrangement", part of a multipronged effort to challenge and dismantle white supremacy in the US.|$|E

Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, {{in the course of}} filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of cannabis to the attendant, a youth named Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: [...] "The end is coming (for <b>me).</b> <b>These</b> guys are going to kill me."
