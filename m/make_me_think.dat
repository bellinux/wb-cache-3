Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is so damn clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E

Foer recalled later that Oates {{took an interest}} in his writing and his [...] "most important of writerly qualities, energy," [...] noting that she was [...] "the first person to ever <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> I should try to write in any sort of serious way. And my life really changed after that." [...] Oates served as Foer's senior thesis advisor, which was an early version of his novel Everything Is Illuminated (published to acclaim in 2002).|$|E
2500|$|During the April 2014 Bundy standoff, {{in which}} the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) {{attempted}} to round up cattle belonging to rancher Cliven Bundy, who refused to vacate public land, Jerad Miller {{was said to have}} been among the armed protesters who joined Bundy during the incident. According to Bundy's son, Ammon Bundy, the Millers were present during the standoff for a few days, but had been instructed by a militia member to leave due to [...] "their radical beliefs", which did not align with the protest's main issues. They were also instructed to leave because Jerad Miller was a felon in possession of a firearm. Carol Bundy later commented, [...] "I have not seen or heard anything from the militia and others who have came to our ranch that would, in any way, <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> they had an intent to kill or harm anyone." ...|$|E

There's no question that my colleagues back here, the governors of Western states, do not want people riding roughshod over the landscape ... put our people in grave danger by calling in armed civilians from around the country, and that's not okay." [...] Carol Bundy said, [...] "I have not seen or heard anything from the militia {{and others who have}} came to our ranch that would, in any way, <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> they had an intent to kill or harm anyone." [...] Bundy's son said that the couple had been asked to leave the ranch after a few days because they were [...] "very radical" [...] and did not align themselves with the protest's main issues. According to Mark Potok, a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, Jerad and Amanda Miller considered the outcome of the standoff as [...] "a huge victory against the federal government", which reportedly motivated them to commit the shooting spree.|$|E

2500|$|The United Daily {{newspaper}} {{referred to}} the Taiwan crossing paintings as [...] "a joy to view." [...] In the January 2006 issue of The Artist’s Magazine, which featured Yim’s Lady in Shimmering Light as its cover, Yim’s painting {{is described as a}} “stunning work” which has a “classic quality that crosses geographic and cultural boundaries.” [...] The prominent writer Li Ao, one of Taiwan's foremost public intellectuals, heaped similar praise on Yim's Mackay Practicing Medicine in a supplement to the Yangcheng Evening News in 2008 and also on his television show. [...] Lin Yong, former President of the Guangdong Artists' Association, waxes poetic in a memorable passage: [...] "Yim Mau-Kun has spent decades quietly, calmly, diligently and thoughtfully painting. [...] I don't know how many drawings and paintings he's created, and I don't know how many books he has read. [...] But over the decades, whenever we talk he often has impressive insights; he has never stopped thinking. [...] It's his diligence in studying, thinking, and articulating his thoughts that <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> of him as a Confucian scholar. [...] His insights have been very beneficial for me. [...] I see deep wrinkles in an old tree, ripples in a river, a rock unmoved by thunder and storms, a massive tree that remains unbent, and I see in Yim Mau-Kun a refreshing spring breeze." [...] Liang Jiang—former Deputy Director of the [...] National Art Museum of China and former Director of the Art Institute of China Army Academy—in the essay [...] "True to Himself" [...] for Taiwan's Arts and Literature Daily celebrates at length Yim's still lifes, landscapes, as well as Crossing the Stormy Strait and Reaching Shore. [...] Ned Jacob, nationally renowned artist and teacher at the Scottsdale Artists' School, in the foreword to A Classical Guide to How to Draw the Head speaks of [...] Yim as [...] "a craftsman of surpassing ability and sensibility," [...] a [...] "brave and vociferous champion of the classical legacy," [...] whose works [...] "resonate [...] virtuosity and boldness of handling[...] [...] [...]Treasures such as these – sacredly kept – will comfort us in those hours when fears and doubts come calling." ...|$|E
