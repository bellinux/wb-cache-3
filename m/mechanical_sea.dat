Here, we have evaluated the prospect of porosity retrieval of sea ice by means of bulk conductivity estimates using 1 D multifrequency EM inversion schemes. We have focused on two inversion algorithms, a smoothness-constrained inversion and a Marquardt-Levenberg inversion, which we modified for the nonlinear signal bias caused by a passive bucking coil operated in such a highly conductive environment. Using synthetic modeling studies, 1 D inversion algorithms and multiple frequencies, we found that we can resolve the sea ice conductivity within +- 0. 01 S∕m.

It is currently unclear if this {{has an impact on}} the skeleton function or if this can be considered as a detoxification mechanism. In the present work, populations of the sea urchin Echinus acutus and the starfish Asterias rubens were studied in stations distributed along a metal contamination gradient in a Norwegian fjord (Sørfjord). Ossicles involved in major <b>mechanical</b> functions - <b>sea</b> urchin spine and starfish ambulacral plate - were analyzed for their metal concentration (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) and their biometric and mechanical properties. Starfish plates were more contaminated by Cd, Pb and Zn than sea urchin spines. Cu concentrations were at background levels. In E. acutus, metals principally affected size. In A. rubens, material stiffness and toughness were decreased in the most contaminated station. This reduction is attributed either to the direct incorporation of metals in the calcite lattice and/or to deleterious effects of metals during skeleton ontogenesis. The contrasting incorporation of metals in the skeleton of the two investigated species accounts for the different impact of the metals, including in terms of fitness. The present results clearly indicate that, at least in A. rubens, incorporation of metals in the skeleton cannot be considered as a detoxification mechanism. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Final {{published}} versionStatistical {{comparisons between}} numerical sea ice models and an observed large-scale strain array {{in the western}} Weddell Sea during 1992 are {{used to evaluate the}} performance of three of the more generally utilized sea ice rheology formulations. Results show that sea ice velocity is reproduced with relatively high accuracy (90 % coherence, > 80 % normalized cross correlation) in models having high-quality atmospheric forcing fields (e. g., the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). On the other hand, temporal and spatial variability of the velocity field, as exemplified by progressive vector plots and ice deformation, respectively, are reproduced less accurately (coherence and normalized cross correlation < 50 %). In terms of model sensitivity, this means that deformation and temporal variability are more discriminating in terms of elucidating specifics about the constitutive relation and <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>sea</b> ice on a large scale. For example, inclusion of both compressive and shear stresses is important in attaining a proper probability distribution of deformation relative to observations. Additional analysis shows that adjustments to specific model parameters improve the model results for either drift or select deformation components, but no best solution could be found, given the models examined here. Results suggest that inclusion of more physically based processes, such as subdaily tidal and inertial oscillations; reconsideration of the boundary layer formulation, and consideration of anisotropy, may be necessary to include in next-generation sea ice models, especially those that are intended for coupling with high-resolution (eddy resolving) ocean models.

40|$|The Arctic {{climate system}} {{includes}} numerous highly interactive small-scale physical {{processes in the}} atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. During and since the International Polar Year 2007 – 2009, significant advances {{have been made in}} understanding these processes. Here, these recent advances are reviewed, synthesized, and discussed. In atmospheric physics, the primary advances have been in cloud physics, radiative transfer, mesoscale cyclones, coastal, and fjordic processes as well as in boundary layer processes and surface fluxes. In sea ice and its snow cover, advances have been made in understanding of the surface albedo and its relationships with snow properties, the internal structure of sea ice, the heat and salt transfer in ice, the formation of superimposed ice and snow ice, and the small-scale dynamics of sea ice. For the ocean, significant advances have been related to exchange processes at the ice–ocean interface, diapycnal mixing, double-diffusive convection, tidal currents and diurnal resonance. Despite this recent progress, some of these small-scale physical processes are still not sufficiently understood: these include wave–turbulence interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the exchange of heat and salt at the ice–ocean interface, and the <b>mechanical</b> weakening of <b>sea</b> ice. Many other processes are reasonably well understood as stand-alone processes but the challenge is to understand their interactions with and impacts and feedbacks on other processes.

40|$|Benthic {{surveys of}} Borge Bay, Signy Island, South Orkney Islands {{indicated}} that the biomass of macrophytes per area, in shallow; antarctic waters, was less than in temperate seas. This decrease was mainly attributed to the shading and <b>mechanical</b> attrition of <b>sea</b> ice. The habitat provided by macroalgae was important {{as a source of}} food and shelter {{to a wide variety of}} benthic and demersal species. Feeding relationships within the habitat were complex. Many species relied heavily on phytoplankton or detritus (often phytoplankton 'fall-out') as the main source of food. The biology of two contrasting invertebrates, commonly associated with the fronds of the brown alga Desmarestia anceps was investigated. The species chosen were the amphipod Pontogeneia antarctica and the bivalve Lissarca miliaris. The mollusc remained in the benthos throughout the year, whilst the crustacean exhibited a major migration to the under surf ace of the fast ice during the winter. Despite such obvious ecological differences, some fundamental similarities were apparent in the reproductive biology of these animals. In addition, the growth rates of both species were relatively slow. Studies on metabolism and feeding of P. antarctica {{indicated that the}} rate of respiration was higher than expected for the constant low ambient temperature. It is considered that the phenomena of slow growth, increased parentalism and decreased fecundity present in these, and many polar species, can be partly attributed to such elevated metabolism and to the highly fluctuating primary production of antarctic waters which subsequently affects the overall amounts of energy which can be ingested during the year. Breeding in both animals was synchronised to the period of optimum food supply during early spring or summer...|$|R

Data are available on sea urchins, starfish, and brittle stars in 33 studies. Skeleton growth of juveniles of all sea urchin species studied so far is affected from pH 7. 8 to 7. 6 in seawater, values that are expected to be reached during the 21 st century. Growth in adult sea urchins (six species studied) is apparently only marginally affected at seawater pH relevant to this century. The interacting effect of temperature differed according to studies. Juvenile star-fish as well as adults seem to be either not impacted or even boosted by acidification. Brittle stars show moderate effects at pH below or equal to 7. 4. Dissolution of the body wall skeleton is unlikely to be a major threat to sea urchins. Spines, however, due to their exposed position, are more prone to this threat, but their regeneration abilities can probably ensure their maintenance, although this could have an energetic cost and induce changes in resource allocation.

40|$|Sea {{ice in the}} Arctic Ocean {{ranges from}} thin new ice to thick {{deformed}} ridges. Changes in thickness are due to melting and freezing, and to physical rearrangement of existing ice to form leads and pressure ridges. As a brittle solid, fractures are created when the ice cover moves and deforms. Openings along fractures are sites of local heat exchange between the atmosphere and ocean, and of local ice production in the winter as ocean water freezes when exposed to the colder atmosphere. Closing of the ice forces it to raft or pile up into pressure ridges and to be forced down into keels, increasing the volume of sea ice that can be stored within a given area of the Arctic Ocean. This <b>mechanical</b> redistribution of <b>sea</b> ice affects ice strength and has {{a profound impact on}} ice behavior over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Accurate observation and simulation of the relative contributions of thermodynamics and dynamics to ice thickness distribution are thus critical for understanding the ice cover in terms of how it changes, and its vulnerability in a warming climate. Recent satellite altimetry and high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imaging have provided near-basin-scale views of ice thickness and motion for use in quantifying changes, and for assessment and refinement of models. During this coming decade, several satellite missions are poised to provide improved, coordinated, and near-continuous measurements of thickness and motion that will advance our understanding of the Arctic ice cover.

40|$|International audienceWave action {{combined}} to sea level rise and coastline retreat may weaken coastal and port structures. The combination of energetic flows and loose <b>seabed</b> <b>mechanical</b> properties at {{the vicinity of}} a structure may trigger scour and liquefaction phenomena (Sumer et al. 2001; de Groot et al. 2006). The ocean waves can generate significant dynamic pressures on the sea floor, that further induce pore-water pressure variations and effective stresses within the seabed. With excess pore pressure and limited vertical effective stress, part of the seabed may become unstable or even liquefied. Once liquefaction occurs, the soil particles {{are likely to be}} carried away as a fluid by any prevailing bottom current (Jeng et al., 2010). Former field experiments in a macro-tidal environment have shown that air bubbles can be trapped within the sand bed, as the beach de-saturates at low tide and partially saturates during rising tide (Breul et al. 2008). In these field experiments (Mory et al. 2007), liquefaction has been observed at the toe of a vertical wall subjected to intense wave forcing. The phenomenon was identified as momentary liquefaction (Sakai et al. 1992) and promoted by air bubbles trapped inside the bed. The seabed gas content is of major influence on pore pressure transmission and hence on liquefaction occurrence (Michallet et al. 2009). Detailed measurements and visualization of the seabed are not easily obtained in the field. The present study aims at understanding the main physics of the seabed response to wave impact on a coastal structure with a physical model using light-weight sediment (Michallet et al., 2012). Both momentary liquefaction and liquefaction induced by pore-pressure build-up under cyclic loading are reproduced. It is shown that air bubbles trapped in the sediment bed is promoting the first type of liquefaction whereas it prevents the second type to occur...|$|R
40|$|Artificially {{increasing}} the albedo of marine boundary layer clouds by the <b>mechanical</b> emission of <b>sea</b> spray aerosol {{has been proposed}} as a geoengineering technique to slow the warming caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. A previous global model study (Korhonen et al., 2010) found that only modest increases (− 3, the injected diameter is > 250 – 300 nm, the background aerosol loading is large (≥ 150 cm − 3) and the in-cloud updraught velocity is low (− 1). With lower background loadings and/or increased updraught velocity, significant increases in CDN can be achieved. None of the global models predict a decrease in CDN {{as a result of}} geoengineering, although there is considerable diversity in the calculated efficiency of geoengineering, which arises from the diversity in the simulated marine aerosol distributions. All three models show a small dependence of geoengineering efficiency on the injected particle size and the geometric standard deviation of the injected mode. However, the achievability of significant cloud drop enhancements is strongly dependent on the cloud updraught speed. With an updraught speed of 0. 1 m s − 1 a global mean CDN of 375 cm − 3 (previously estimated to cancel the forcing caused by CO 2 doubling) is achievable in only about 50 % of grid boxes which have > 50 % cloud cover, irrespective of the amount of aerosol injected. But at stronger updraft speeds (0. 2 m s − 1), higher values of CDN are achievable due to the elevated in-cloud supersaturations. Achieving a value of 375 cm − 3 in regions dominated by stratocumulus clouds with relatively weak updrafts cannot be attained regardless of the number of injected particles, thereby limiting the efficacy of sea spray geoengineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Arctic coasts {{over the coming}} decades will be governed by changes in the natural environment caused by the effects of climate warming. Rising temperatures are altering the arctic coastline by reducing sea ice and permafrost thawing, and larger changes are projected to occur as this trend continues. This is an important topic to pursue given the direct impacts to human communities and infrastructure already being felt along Arctic coasts. About half of the Russian Arctic coast is composed of ice-rich permafrost deposits. The mean annual coastal retreat rate is 1 - 5 m per year, but at single sites can exceed 25 m for some years. In general, the exact processes which affect thermal-erosion coasts {{and the intensity of}} these processes are determined by a combination of and interaction between thermal and wave-energy factors. Thermal energy is transmitted to the frozen coast via radiative and sensible heat fluxes from the air and water. Correspondingly, higher air and water temperatures, together with longer durations of ice-free seas and positive air temperatures, affect the stability of frozen coasts. The wave-energy factor acts via the direct <b>mechanical</b> impact of <b>sea</b> waves on the shore. In arctic seas the wind-induces waves are predominate. The effectiveness of this factor is determined by storm-driven sea surge intensity {{as well as by the}} length of the stormiest period. Conversely, surge intensity substantially depends on the fetch, which is intrinsically linked to sea-ice extent. The minimum area of sea ice extent in the northern hemisphere during the last 30 years has changed from 6 to 3. 5 million square kilometers. In September, 2007, sea ice area achieved its historical minimum for the period of satellite observation (since 1978). Less extensive sea ice creates more open water and longer fetches, allowing stronger wave generation by winds and increasing wave-induced erosion along arctic shores. Therefore, the acceleration of erosion and thermo-abrasion of the coast can be caused by the increase of the air and water temperatures and by the wind-wave activity increases. Coastal dynamics have been observed at key sites in the western and eastern sectors of Russian Arctic. We have calculated annual wave energy variations for the last 30 years. Hindcast analysis has revealed that warming events have not always lead to an increase in wave energy or to acceleration of coastal erosion. For example, in the Arctic regions that we studied, in half of the cases warm periods were characterized on one hand by reduced ice cover and growth of open water area, and, on the other hand, by decreased wind-wave activity. As a result no acceleration in coastal retreat was observed. Furthermore, in the western sector of the Russian Arctic the wave fetch was limited by the presence of islands, while in the eastern one by wave acceleration limit. Thus, expectations of catastrophic acceleration of coastal erosion in Arctic are probably exaggerated...|$|R
40|$|The Ocean Cleanup {{proposes to}} place a huge barrier in the ocean in order to clean it from plastic waste. Plastic will be caught as it flows towards the barrier on the ocean’s currents. As such a {{structure}} has no precedent, the concept has to be engineered {{from the bottom up}} and tested extensively. The barrier has a relatively shallow draft and moves in the splash zone, making it difficult to model the barrier’s behaviour. First, this study focusses on the development of a numerical two dimensional (2 D) hydro-elastic model. This model {{has to be able to}} simulate the motions of such a barrier as observed in two dimensional tests and allows for a better understanding of the barrier’s hydrodynamic behaviour. The wave forces on the barrier are calculated with the Morison equation, which is often used in offshore hydrodynamics to calculate the wave forces on slender members. Including all details necessary for a correct simulation, the model is simplified wherever possible. This reduces runtime so that the model can be used for simulations for a fatigue assessment in the second part of this thesis. These assumptions are validated using the results from 2 D tests carried out by Deltares. In addition, another student will develop a CFD model to validate these simplifications by an alternative way. The results of the validation using the 2 D tests suggest that the motions can be simulated very well using this approach. The validation also shows that the horizontal position of the barrier seems to be mostly affected by the forces on the screen, while the vertical position is dominated by the buoyancy force of the floating boom. The second part of this study consists of a first qualitative assessment of the fatigue life of the barrier. Earlier tests have shown that the loads on the barrier are relatively low. This is why fatigue is expected to play an important role, given the fact that the barrier will be deployed for about 5 to 10 years. Fatigue life of the rubber component at the point where the floating boom is connected to the plastic capturing screen is investigated. To carry out this assessment, the prototype currently deployed in the North Sea is used as a starting point. The hydro-elastic model from the first part of this thesis is used to simulate the barrier’s motions. Using a structural model which simulates the rubber’s behaviour, these motions are superimposed from the global to the local structure. For this structural model a hyperelastic material that resembles the rubber component is assumed. After superimposing the barrier’s motions, fatigue life of the barrier is calculated using a damage model suitable for rubber. The results show that fatigue life seems to be dominated by seastates with steep waves or with large velocity and acceleration amplitudes. Also, the fatigue life in the Pacific Ocean will be about two and a half to three times longer than for one deployed in the North <b>Sea.</b> <b>Mechanical,</b> Maritime and Materials EngineeringMarine and Transport TechnologyOffshore & Dredging Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Sea ice {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} for developing oil and gas industries in Arctic regions. To ensure safe and efficient exploration and exploitation of resources in the Arctic Basin, knowledge of the type, thickness, strength and concentration of sea ice is required, especially in areas in which developments are planned. In addition, data on the physical properties (e. g., the temperature, salinity and density) would greatly facilitate the prediction of ice loads because these properties influence ice strength. A special feature of the ice cover is the sea ice ridges, which {{are considered to be}} the design loads for offshore structures in ice-infested waters in the absence of icebergs. This thesis consists of 6 papers and is composed of 2 separate but nevertheless very close parts. The first part presents and analyzes field measurements of different properties of level ice, whereas the second part covers the spatial and temporal evolution of the morphology as well as the physical and <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>sea</b> ice ridges. Fieldwork investigating the mechanical and physical properties of land-fast level ice in the frozen fjords of Spitsbergen commenced in 2003. With the design of a transportable uniaxial compressive rig in 2005, uniaxial compressive strength tests were performed directly on-site. An intensive field campaign was performed in the winter of 2010 on Van Mijenfjorden, Spitsbergen, to study the spatial and temporal distribution of the properties of level ice, namely, uniaxial compressive strength, temperature and salinity. Sampling matrices were established, and 310 samples were extracted for immediate compression, considering the load direction. Additional samples were collected in the vicinity of these boreholes to measure the temperature, density and salinity profiles and to produce a structural profile using thin sections. The variability in strength correlated with the variability in salinity, the brine fraction and possibly the sample spacing. The drainage and the localization of the brine channels may have been important for the spatial variability of the strength. Because uniaxial compressive tests were performed on site with the same rig from 2005 to 2011, the data were sufficient for a statistical analysis of the uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice. Over 7 years, 1237 samples were collected and used to determine a statistical distribution that explained the uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice. Seven groups were defined: “horizontal”, “vertical”, “early”, “late”, “horizontal early/late”, “vertical early/late” and “ridge”, to determine the impact of the loading direction and the season on the best fitting statistical distribution. Key statistics were calculated. The vertical samples were stronger than the horizontal samples with an average value of the strength of 4. 2 MPa and 2 MPa, respectively. The early or “cold” samples were stronger than the late or “warm” samples, with an average value of the strength of 3. 7 MPa and 2. 1 MPa, respectively. The key statistics were visualized using box plots. The gamma, Weibull and lognormal distributions were examined. The least squares combined with QQ-Plots enabled the observation and the quantification of the fit between the data distribution and the hypothesized theoretical distribution. The Weibull parameters (scale and shape) were estimated using the maximum likelihood method, the method of the moments and the least squares method. The optimum pair (scale and shape) was obtained through a combination of the least squares method (for the scale parameter) and the maximum likelihood method or the method of the moments (for the shape parameter). The fit between the data distribution and the theoretical distribution was good. Neither the sample orientation nor the season influenced the statistical distribution determination, even though the defining parameters varied between the groups. The gamma distribution was the best candidate for the statistical distribution of the field data with a coefficient of correlation of 0. 986. Finally, a new experimental setup was established in May 2008 to measure the propagation of stresses in the ice. This setup consisted of freezing 6 stress sensors in the ice. The sensors were placed at a depth of 0. 2 m and every 0. 6 m along a line. A borehole jack was used to trigger the stresses that propagated to the sensors. The borehole jack was placed along the same line at 8, 5, 2, 1 and 0. 6 m from the first stress sensor. A 98 % decreased pressure was recorded by the sensors within the first 60 cm, and the pressure was 0 after 4 m. The stresses decreased for increasing distances between the triggering source and the measurement point, following an inverse exponential law. The second focus of this thesis was on sea ice ridges. For a better understanding and overview of the current knowledge of ridges, an extensive analysis of their morphological properties was performed. Over 300 full-scale, floating first-year ridges were examined from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, Beaufort Sea, Svalbard waters, Barents Sea and the Russian Arctic Ocean for the Arctic regions; from the Canadian east coasts, the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, Sea of Azov, Caspian Sea and Offshore Sakhalin for the Subarctic regions. A catalogue of all the available dimensions of the ridges, their macroporosities and the dimensions of the blocks constituting the sail was also provided. The maximum sail height was 8 m (offshore Sakhalin), and the mean peak sail height was 2. 0 m based on 356 profiles. The mean peak keel depth was 8. 0 m based on 321 profiles. The correlation between the internal dimensions such as the sail height and the keel depth as well as or the sail width and the keel depth were h k = 5. 11 h s 0. 69 and w k = 7. 19 h k 0. 72. The statistical distribution of keel-tosail ratios is best represented by a lognormal distribution. Ridge cross-sectional geometry can vary greatly along the length of a ridge, even over a short distance. The block thicknesses were very different from the surrounding level ice thicknesses and they correlate well with the sail height with a square root model: h s = 3. 73 h b 0. 5. The consolidated layer tended to grow evenly with time over the width of the ridge cross section. A statistical analysis based on 377 measurements of the consolidated layer of ridges in the Barents Sea showed that the gamma distribution well described the distribution of the consolidated layer thickness in that area. When prospecting for sea ice ridges in Van Mijenfjorden in February 2009, only a small first-year ridge feature was found. The ridge was visited 6 times between February 14 and May 14. The thickness of the consolidated layer was measured by drilling along two lines across the ridge. It grew as fast as the surrounding level ice (approximately 25 cm in 3 months). The block thickness of the sail was relatively constant until May, after which the block thickness decreased rapidly due to solar radiation. In addition, temperature, density and salinity profiles were constructed. The salinity of the consolidated layer was relatively constant for increasing porosities, mostly because of increasing air temperatures. Samples were extracted for in field compressive tests during two visits. The average strength, porosity and temperature for the first date was 3. 0 MPa, 11 % and - 11. 3 °C, respectively, and for the second date 2. 6 MPa, 11 % and - 10. 6 °C, respectively. The data fit reasonably well with the empirical formulae established for level ice. The rubble was soft and eroded, even more than in previous ridge studies in Van Mijenfjorden because of the small size of the ridge and the increased contribution of oceanic fluxes. In early September 2009, six medium-sized sea ice ridges were investigated in the Fram Strait as part of the fourth year of a field study of multi-year ice ridges. The geometry and macroporosity were examined by cross-sectional drillings. The largest depth recorded was 7. 8 m, and the highest sail measured was 1. 9 m. In addition, a profile of the physical properties of each ridge was established. The average density, salinity and porosity of the keel were respectively 945 kg/m 3, 2. 05 psu and 14 %, respectively. For the first time in that area, uniaxial compression tests were performed at three stations, and the average strength of the keel was 1. 8 MPa.
