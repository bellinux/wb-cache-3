5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} connect the tunnel with a free-flow, grade-separated <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> {{as part of the}} London Ringways project. Aside from the construction of the A102(M) Blackwall Tunnel approach roads, opened in 1973, these plans were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is placed}} along the Pan-European {{corridors}} X and VII. The <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> provides for {{easy access to}} Novi Sad and Budapest, in the north; Niš to the south; and Zagreb, to the west. Expressway is also toward Pancevo and new Expressway construction toward Obrenovac (Montenegro) is set scheduled for March 2017. Belgrade bypass is connecting the E70 and E75 motorways and it is currently under construction.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because of the close links to the <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{final section}} of the motorway, the northernmost section between the Umag {{interchange}} and the Slovenian border at Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing, is currently spanned by a two-lane connector road via a roundabout located at the provisional northern terminus of the A9. Since the Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing is the agreed contact point for the motorway link between Croatia and Slovenia, the section {{is expected to be}} built when Slovenia completes its H5 expressway; connecting the border crossing to Koper and its <b>motorway</b> <b>system.</b> The Slovenian motorway development company DARS made plans in 2010 to build the expressway.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{developed}} during the Industrial Revolution as the area's leading port. The River Parrett was navigable by large ships as far as Bridgwater. Cargoes were then loaded onto smaller boats at Langport Quay, next to the Bridgwater Bridge, to be carried further up river to Langport; or they could turn off at Burrowbridge and then travel via the River Tone to Taunton. The Parrett is now only navigable as far as Dunball Wharf. Bridgwater, in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a centre for the manufacture of bricks and clay roof tiles, and later cellophane, but those industries have now stopped. With its good links to the <b>motorway</b> <b>system,</b> Bridgwater has developed as a distribution hub for companies such as Argos, Toolstation, Morrisons and Gerber Juice. AgustaWestland manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based in the town. Many towns have encouraged small-scale light industries, such as Crewkerne's Ariel Motor Company, one of the UK's smallest car manufacturers.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{the town}} was joined to the UK <b>{{motorway}}</b> <b>system,</b> when the M25 motorway was built to the north. Leatherhead became Junction 9, which has odd non-aligned entry/exit points on each side.|$|E
25|$|Work {{to upgrade}} two {{sections}} of the M60 to a managed <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> had been planned to commence in 2013. This would have included a new lane from junction 12 to 15 and a new lane from junction 8 to 12 near the Trafford Centre. Both these projects were subsequently cancelled in favour of a new project that includes speed cameras on this section but no additional lane or hard-shoulder running. An 'environmental assessment' was cited as the reason an additional lane will not be provided. Consequently, daily congestion on this section {{is expected to continue}} indefinitely. A combined approach was initiated in 2014, comprising managed <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> and lane gain scheme. Work commenced in July 2014 and is expected to be completed by summer 2018.|$|E
25|$|Pre-2009 {{proposals}} {{to widen the}} motorway between junctions 25 and 28 to four lanes were withdrawn in January 2009 and replaced by a project to install hard shoulder running and a smart <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> between junctions 25 and 30. Work started in 2014 to install the system around the M62 – M60 section.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{congestion}} was of {{such great}} concern {{by the late}} 1930s that the influential Automobile Club of Southern California engineered an elaborate plan to create an elevated freeway-type <b>Motorway</b> <b>System,</b> a key aspect {{of which was the}} dismantling of the streetcar lines, replacing them with buses that could run on both local streets and on the new express roads.|$|E
25|$|Wakefield {{has good}} {{access to the}} <b>motorway</b> <b>system,</b> with the {{intersection}} of the M1 and M62 motorways, junctions 42/29, lying to the north west, whilst the M1 to the west is accessed at junctions 39, 40 and 41. The A1(M) is to the east of the district. Wakefield is crossed by the A61, A638, and A642 roads and is the starting point of the A636 and A650 roads.|$|E

25|$|The <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> {{has been}} {{incorporated}} with the Øresund Bridge; the European route E20 {{goes over the}} bridge and then, together with the European route E6 follows the Swedish west coast from Malmö–Helsingborg to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through Norway to the Norwegian town Kirkenes at Barents Sea. The European route to Jönköping–Stockholm (E4) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in direction of Växjö–Kalmar, Kristianstad–Karlskrona, Ystad (E65), and Trelleborg start as freeways.|$|E
25|$|Historically Auckland {{was well}} served by public transport, but the {{dismantling}} of its extensive tram system in the 1950s, together with the decision by William Goosman not to electrify the rail network and instead heavily invest into a <b>motorway</b> <b>system,</b> led to a collapse in both mode share and total trips. Major projects have been undertaken {{in recent years to}} improve public transport, both smaller-scale initiatives such as bus priority measures and large-scale bus and rail infrastructure projects. Public transport use grew by 4.4% over all modes in the year to June 2008 (with rail passengers up 18.4%), and later accelerated even more, growing by 8.3 percent in the year to February 2011 (with rail passengers up 17.9%), with Auckland for the first time reaching 1950s overall numbers again.|$|E

25|$|This {{species is}} of {{interest}} to entomologists due to the variety of subspecies, often only restricted to a specific valley in the Alps. The beautiful Apollo butterfly has long been prized by collectors, who aim to possess {{as many of the}} variants as possible. While over-collecting is believed to have caused populations to decline in some areas, such as in Spain and Italy, habitat change is thought to be a far more significant threat to this species' survival. Plantations of conifers, the succession of suitable habitat to scrubland, agriculture, and urbanization have all reduced the habitat of the Apollo butterfly. Climate change and acid rain have also been implicated in this species decline in Fennoscandia. In addition, motor vehicles have been cited as a cause of Apollo butterfly mortalities; vehicles on a <b>motorway</b> <b>system</b> near Bolzano in South Tyrol, Italy, are said to have nearly wiped out a race of the Apollo.|$|E
