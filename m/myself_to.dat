5|$|I {{pledge that}} I will serve {{faithfully}} in the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, and that I will attend meetings regularly, participate actively in unit activities, obey my officers, wear my uniform properly, and advance my {{education and training}} rapidly to prepare <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be of service to my community, state, and nation.|$|E
5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
2500|$|One of Ludwig's most quoted sayings was [...] "I wish {{to remain}} an eternal enigma <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> and <b>to</b> others." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had nothing}} to say. At least I had nothing {{in my mind that}} I could say. I had an {{undefined}} impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate, but I could hardly have explained why even <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> Or, if <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> certainly not <b>to</b> anybody else.|$|R

5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} the misery into which I had fallen, {{and much more}} at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E
5|$|In {{stating the}} {{experimental}} proceedings {{necessary for the}} detection of the frauds which it has been my object to expose, I have confined <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> the task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by persons unacquainted with chemical science; and it has been my purpose to express all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest language, divested of those recondite terms of science, which would be out of place in a work intended for general perusal.|$|E
5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place here, and the consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show {{that this is not a}} case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> the trial by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and therefore we must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E

25|$|Without {{expanding}} on {{the greater}} or lesser accuracy of a name which nobody, I should hope, can really be expected to understand, I will limit <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{a few words of}} elucidation in order to cut short the misunderstandings.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] said I, more {{interested}} than I cared <b>to</b> own <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> or <b>to</b> {{show to the}} fellow--"why, Andrew, you know all the secrets of this family." ...|$|R
25|$|There was {{no reason}} to put my life on the line, and the lives of {{everyone}} who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control..... I vowed to never allow <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be {{in a situation like that}} again.|$|E
25|$|I {{see myself}} as that little girl, crying <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> sleep at night, crying and wishing I could go home to my family. Everything's gone, the loss of your culture, the loss of your family, all these things have a big impact.|$|E
25|$|Exceeding {{beyond the}} {{limitations}} set down by others shall be my goal. Sacrificing personal comforts and dedicating <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{the completion of}} the reconnaissance mission shall be my life.

25|$|Recently my {{work with}} color has led me, {{in spite of}} <b>myself,</b> <b>to</b> search little by little, with some {{assistance}} (from the observer, from the translator), for the realization of matter, and I have decided to end the battle. My paintings are now invisible and I would like to show them in a clear and positive manner, in my next Parisian exhibition at Iris Clert's.|$|E
25|$|Minimal pronouns require {{closeness}} to a vP, often with an embedded possessive. An embedded v would {{start with a}} relative pronoun in specifier position, which would later {{be followed by a}} bound variable interpretation. Locality domains for reflexives are first determined by the proximity of indexicals, <b>myself,</b> <b>to</b> v. Previously thought of as indexicals, the subject pronoun myself can be instead attributed to being bound pronouns connected to the closest v.|$|E
25|$|I {{have nowhere}} in any thing I may have written {{declared}} <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be a Republican; nor should I think it worth while to be a martyr and a confessor to any form or mode of government. But what I have staked health and wealth, name and fame upon, and {{am ready to}} do so again and to the last gasp, is this, {{that there is a}} power in the people to change its government and its governors.|$|E
6000|$|... "The dickens take my luck!" [...] said I <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> {{beginning}} <b>to</b> feel extremely uncomfortable. [...] "I suppose I have offended {{against the}} laws and customs by working the horses too long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, because I ask you, as a favour <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> not <b>to.</b> She's {{the most}} charming {{creature}} I've ever seen. Therefore don't touch her. Don't know--don't want to know. And moreover--yes--you won't." ...|$|R

25|$|My God, {{in union}} with the Immaculate Heart of Mary I offer Thee the Precious Blood of Jesus from all the altars {{throughout}} the world, joining with it the offering of my every thought, action and suffering of this day.

25|$|Seeing {{that there}} are many reasons for expounding the Madhyamakalankara, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, our {{incomparable}} guide, unbounded in his kindness, whose very name I hardly dare to pronounce, who is the very personification of the compassion of the abbot Bodhisattva, of the master Padmasambhava, and of King Trisongdetsen, who is the sovereign among the learned and accomplished, who is supreme Manjushri appearing {{in the form of a}} monk in saffron robes, and whose renown fills the world, gave to me the Indian and Tibetan commentaries on the Madhyamakalankara, asking me to study them well and to compose a commentary. And as his diamondlike injunction came down upon my head, I earnestly gave <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> the task.|$|E
25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

60|$|Mabane {{resumed his}} work. Such a discussion, his gesture seemed to indicate, {{was not worth}} continuing. But I continued, {{following}} out my train of thought, though I spoke as much <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> as <b>to</b> my friend.|$|R
