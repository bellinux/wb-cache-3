40|$|The ‘Conseil Général du Département du Nord’ is {{the manager}} of 480 ha of Flemish dunes located at the far North of France. These spaces, {{initially}} preserved {{by the action of}} the ‘Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque’ are now the property of the ‘Conservatoire de l’Espace Littoral et des Rivages Lacustres’. Characterised by an aelian dynamism and by the winter flooding of their damp depressions, these systems had represented a very high patrimonial richness before man, by these actions (the pumping of the aquifers, the parcelling out of dune massifs, the fixation of sand by plantations, the destruction of rabbits), reduced to nothing the natural expression of perturbations (storms, floods, important sandbanks) and made dune massifs become wastelands and low marshes and dry lawns disappear. The first step for preservation was the in extremis safeguard and the maintenance by secateurs (1989) then by <b>motor</b> <b>scythes</b> (1992) of micro-habitats with a high richness over a 2 ha total surface lost in very important pre-forested systems. Rapidly, the objectives of preservation obliged us to put into practice the restoration of natural environments by stripping and clearing the ground (1994 and 1997). But these operations of a large scale (10 ha) were always based on a ‘fixist’ and ‘museographical’ approach to the environment (the maintenance of a representative sample of habitats). The management which consists of stopping certain pioneer and post-pioneer stages of vegetation can in fact correspond to a counter-natural step as these dune systems make the proof of a very high dynamism and permanent evolution. Today the management of dune space is done by bulldozers: first the pre-forested vegetation is totally destructed (16 ha in 2004) leaving systems of bare sand freely evolving and accepting their spontaneous wastelanding over more than 50 % of their surfaces. The return to uncontrolled vegetal dynamism is only accepted if perturbations are periodically created in order to regularly produce the starting or reappearance conditions of the different series of vegetation. The last stage of our managing operations would consist, with a middle-term effect, in reducing the stability of the edging dune row and in favouring the development of wind passages with their devastation or saving effects on the dune we intend to preserve...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the literature is given of- nine possible methods for estimating herbage intake by grazing ruminants, with special attention to the sward-cutting and indirect animal methods- the factors determining the herbage intake by grazing ruminants. The herbage intake of lactating cows was determined in 151 trials at Lelystad from 1976 to 1979. The pre-cut swards consisted predominantly of perennial ryegrass. A swardsampling technique was used for estimating herbage intake by cows grazing swards for 3 or 4 days (with corrections for herbage accumulation during grazing). If herbage samples were cut both with a <b>motor</b> <b>scythe</b> and a lawn~mower accurate intake figures could be obtained. It was shown that there were no significant effects of higher levels of areic mass of herbage (by taking longer rest periods) on daily organic matter intake of herbage neither by grazing nor by stall-fed cows. However in early summer daily intake of nutrients and milk production decreased at increasing maturity; in late summer these effects were not significant. Higher levels of daily herbage allowance had significant positive effects on daily intake of organic matter of nutrients from herbage and ondaily milk production per grazing animal. High amounts of residual herbage (achieved by higher levels of daily herbage allowance) increased net regrowth of herbage, especially in early summer. At a mean allowance level of 23 kg d - 1 above 4. 5 cm our grazing cows consumed 13. 6 - 14. 8 kg d - 1 of organic matter if no concentrates were fed. This was sufficient, at the quality of herbage as in our trials, for a daily 4 %-fat corrected milk production of 22 - 23 kg...|$|R
