5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast the shark with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards the shark while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales the shark in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E
5|$|Sevastopol saw {{service in}} the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Slightly damaged during a {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where she was damaged by several shells but managed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> port with {{the remnants of the}} Russian Fleet, leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur, Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Japanese never raised her. The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port.|$|E
5|$|The player picks one of {{the three}} {{brothers}} to play as; Pixie can also be unlocked as a playable character. They traverse six areas within a time limit to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fairy world in time. The areas all consist of a number of floors; the player needs to collect all keys on each floor, before being allowed to jump down to a lower floor. To find the keys, the player uses a radar that displays their locations; once all have been collected, it shows the location of the exit. Once the player reaches the bottom floor, they are faced with a boss character they need to defeat, after which they can proceed to the next area.|$|E

5|$|The trio {{returns to}} the hospital, resolving to defend {{themselves}} against the zombie horde. Setting up barricades and making improvised weapons, they battle the zombies, but Menard is killed. The patients reanimate inside the hospital, killing the staff, as the zombies breach the defences. Peter, Anne, and Brian escape as the hospital is consumed by fire. Brian is attacked by a zombified Susan, whom Peter shoots before the three <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the boat and leave the island. At sea, Brian dies. Anne and Peter lock his body in a cabin as proof {{of what has happened}} on Matul. His reanimated corpse begins banging on the door, as Peter and Anne listen to a radio report that the New York Harbor incident has escalated into an epidemic: as zombies advance on the Brooklyn Bridge, the entire city is under attack.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away in an effort to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests who happen to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E
50|$|Karl <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hamburg, {{where he}} meets Anna and {{occupies}} a spare room in her flat. Soon friendship deepens, and {{both he and}} Anna have guilt feelings about their attraction.|$|R

5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914 Beadles, along {{with two of his}} older brothers, Ewart and Ernie, enlisted in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, even though he was only 16 years old at the time, under the permitted age of enlistment. While his regiment was stationed in Britain on training exercises, Beadles was a bugle boy. In 1915, his unit took part in the landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli where, despite still being under the minimum age, he served on the frontline as a rifleman. During this time, Beadles performed an action that would later see him awarded the Serbian Gold medal for gallantry. He received the honor for saving the life of a Serbian observer officer who had been wounded in no man's land and was unable to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the line. Under heavy rifle and artillery fire, Beadles helped the officer back, having his cap and epaulettes shot off in the process but remaining unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Another early roguelike whose {{development}} pre-dated Rogue was Sword of Fargoal (1982), {{developed by}} Jeff McCord starting in 1979. The game {{was based on}} GammaQuest, an earlier title McCord had created on the Commodore PET which he shared locally with friends while a student at Henry Clay High School in Kentucky; the game itself {{was based on a}} Dungeons & Dragons campaign he had run himself in the prior years. Before graduating and attending the University of Tennessee in 1981, he had started work on GammaQuest II, which required the player to navigate through randomly generated dungeon levels, acquire a sword, and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the surface with that sword through more randomly generated levels. The more advanced computers available at the school, such as the Commodore VIC-20, enabled him to expand out the game further from the highly limited memory on the PET. On seeing the prospects of selling computer software, he eventually got a publication deal with Epyx, where they helped him to refine the marketing of the game, renaming it Sword of Fargoal, and giving him access to the more powerful Commodore 64, enabling him to use graphics and sound as part of the game. The game was considered a success, and when it was ported to the PC in 1983, it out-shone Rogues PC release the same year due to Sword of Fargoals superior graphics and sound.|$|E
5|$|Rei finds {{a heavily}} injured man and races {{to try to}} save his life, but the man shortly dies after he brings him to the church. The whole town shows up to show their respects at the funeral. Worried about Tipi's state of mind in dealing with the man's death, Rei {{repeatedly}} tries to go see Tipi, but Shiona keeps preventing him from going to see her. Rei eventually makes it to the library, but Shiona merely tells Tipi that her parents, who she has been waiting to return, are dead and that she will always be alone. Enraged at Shiona's behavior, Rei gets her to leave the library and Rei stays with Tipi overnight. Rei and Tipi wake up the next morning to find that the town is under attack. When Rei leaves to investigate, he finds humans have infiltrated the town and are killing the townspeople. Rei is nearly killed by them, but Shiona protects him from a gunshot, which leaves her unconscious, but alive. Rei takes Shiona back to the library where they regroup with Tipi before leaving through the sewer system to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the church. A lone man comes to the church, and while Rei is fighting him, the man uses a grenade, but Shiona protects Rei from the blast.|$|E

50|$|Craig <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Joanne's room, {{claiming}} he'd {{been knocked}} {{out and that}} he cannot find Patty anywhere. Joanne is eventually cornered by Hemmit while she discovers Bryan's mutilated corpse in a storage room. She flees from him and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Craig, when they both team up and manage to kill him. At this point, Craig reveals that HE was the killer the whole time, and that John knew {{and was trying to}} warn Joanne. After being chased by him, Joanne is shown the corpses of Patty, Debbie and her family while Craig explains that he loves her and got rid of anyone who clung to her or ruined his chances with her.|$|R
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Fourth Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet, together with , under the command of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta. She was tasked to support Operation AL, an attack planned to seize several Aleutian Islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while {{the main body of the}} American fleet was occupied defending Midway. Jun'yō carried 18 A6M2 Zeros and 18 D3As for this operation. At dawn on 3 June, she launched 9 Zeros and a dozen D3As to attack Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. They had to turn back due to bad weather, although an American PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a Zero. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. As the aircraft from Jun'yō were regrouping after the attack, they were attacked by 8 Curtiss P-40 fighters that shot down 2 Zeros and a pair of D3As while losing 2 of their own. Another D3A got lost and failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the carrier. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.|$|E
25|$|However, the Twins did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the postseason}} {{during the rest}} of Puckett's career, {{although}} Puckett continued to play well. In 1994, Puckett was switched to right field and won his first league RBI title by driving in 112 runs. He was having another brilliant season in 1995 before having his jaw broken by a Dennis Martínez fastball on September 28.|$|E
25|$|The Chiefs {{took the}} ball back and fought hard for a winning field goal, driving into Dolphins {{territory}} where Okoye's 26-yard burst moved {{the ball to the}} 26-yard line. But on the next play, a holding call wiped out his 12-yard run and pushed the team back 10 yards. As the final seconds of the game approached, the Chiefs could only <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the 34. Lowery, who had made his last 22 field goals, attempted a game winner from 52 yards out, but it fell just short.|$|E

25|$|My {{assignment}} {{was on the}} bridge in the pilot house as helmsman. While steering the ship I {{had the opportunity to}} glance out the port holes and I saw the condition of the San Francisco and the Juneau. I remember commenting to one {{of the men in the}} pilot house that the San Francisco looked so beat up that she would be lucky to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Espiritu Santo, but that the Juneau, while she was down by the bow, still looked seaworthy enough to make it back.|$|E
25|$|Hug {{would then}} lose {{in his next}} two outings, firstly to Ernesto Hoost by {{majority}} decision at the K-3 Grand Prix '95 on July 16, 1995 and then Mike Bernardo by KO in a rematch at K-1 Revenge II on September 3, 1995. The fight was even going into the latter stages of round two when Bernardo landed a right hook which sent Hug to the canvas. He was able to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his feet but was clearly on wobbly legs and the referee in charge, Genshu Igari, stopped him from taking any more damage than was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Chabran and Schwarz were {{defeated}} at the Battles of the Bruch in mid-June and Duhesme was repulsed in the Battle of Gerona on 2021 June. After securing {{the assistance of}} an improvised division commanded by General of Division Honoré Charles Reille, Duhesme initiated the Siege of Gerona. This unsuccessful operation lasted from 24 July to 16 August before Duhesme retreated to Barcelona and Reille withdrew to Figueres. News of the French disaster at the Battle of Bailen on 22 July 1808 buoyed Spanish morale and depressed the Imperial troops. Duhesme's troops had to fight their way back through the hills and abandon their field artillery in order to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Barcelona, where they arrived on 20 August.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} turned {{worse for}} Ming Rui. By early 1768, battle-hardened Burmese reinforcements from Siam {{had begun to}} arrive back. Bolstered by the reinforcements, two Burmese armies led by Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Sithu succeeded in retaking Hsenwi. The Qing commander at Hsenwi committed suicide. The main Qing army was now cut off from all supplies. It was now March 1768. Thousands of Bannermen from the freezing grasslands along the Russian border, began dying of malaria as well as Burmese attacks in the furnace-like hot weather of central Burma. Ming Rui gave up all hope of proceeding toward Ava, and instead tried to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Yunnan with as many of his soldiers as possible.|$|E
25|$|Swett {{repeatedly}} {{attacked the}} line of dive bombers, downing each in turn with short bursts. He brought down four and was attacking a fifth when his ammunition was depleted {{and he had his}} cockpit shot up by return fire. Wounded, he decided to ditch his damaged fighter off the coast of Florida Island, after it became clear that his oil cooler had been hit and he would not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> base. After a few seconds his engine seized, and despite initially being trapped in his cockpit underwater, Swett extricated himself and was rescued in Tulagi harbor after ditching his plane. This feat made the 22-year-old Marine aviator an ace on his first combat mission.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Nebraska sprinted {{into the}} top 5 nationally, and was looking poised to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Omaha for the College World Series. They were ranked as high as number 2 nationally and swept 3 Big 12 teams. However, Nebraska ran into a huge late season slump losing 8 of their last 11 regular season games and losing their last 3 Big 12 series. They were 3–0 in the Big 12 Tournament going into the {{championship}} game but lost to Kansas 7–9. They managed to host a regional, only to go two and out and bow out early ending with a 42–17 record. Brandon Buckman, Ryan Wehrle, Luke Gorsett, Tony Watson, and Brett Jensen earned First Team All Big 12 honors.|$|E
