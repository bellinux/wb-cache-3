5|$|The <b>medial</b> graph {{of a plane}} graph is {{isomorphic}} to the <b>medial</b> graph of its dual. Two planar graphs {{can have}} isomorphic <b>medial</b> graphs {{only if they are}} dual to each other.|$|E
5|$|The foramen may {{pass through}} the sphenoid bone {{at the apex of}} the spinous process, or along its <b>medial</b> surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} is a foramen through the sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle cranial fossa. It {{is one of two}} foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of these two cranial foramina, situated directly anterior and <b>medial</b> to the foramen spinosum. The spine of sphenoid falls <b>medial</b> and posterior to the foramen. Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular fossa, and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|A {{legitimate}} syllable in Hokkien {{takes the}} form (initial) + (<b>medial</b> vowel) + nucleus + (stop) + tone, where items in parenthesis indicate optional components.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{the lateral}} pectoral nerve innervates the axillary arch, although instances {{have been found}} where the intercostobrachial nerve, the <b>medial</b> pectoral nerve and the thoracodorsal nerve provide the nervous supply.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 2017, Robinson {{was ruled}} out {{for three to}} four months after {{undergoing}} surgery for a repair of <b>medial</b> and lateral ligaments in his left ankle.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the <b>medial</b> condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the <b>medial</b> edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the <b>medial</b> scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the <b>medial</b> scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of <b>medial</b> scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the <b>medial</b> geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other <b>medial</b> temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|Layla {{announced}} that she had suffered a knee injury at Extreme Rules on SmackDown on 13 May, and was interrupted and attacked by Kharma to write her off television. Later that month, {{it was confirmed that}} Layla had legitimately torn both her Anterior cruciate and <b>Medial</b> collateral ligaments, and required surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the <b>medial</b> tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the <b>medial</b> pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that {{this part of the}} brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England. On {{the basis of an}} example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by <b>medial</b> slabs, which served the same purpose as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's Smithy.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the <b>medial</b> surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
25|$|Most reconstructions since Pulleyblank have {{included}} a <b>medial</b> *r, but the *j <b>medial</b> {{has become more}} controversial.|$|E
25|$|Supratrochlear nerve â€“ conveys {{sensation}} to the <b>medial</b> {{region of}} the eyelid skin area, and the <b>medial</b> {{region of the}} forehead skin.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} construction, the <b>medial</b> graph, {{coincides with}} the line graph for planar graphs with maximum degree three, but is always planar. It has the same vertices as the line graph, but potentially fewer edges: two vertices of the <b>medial</b> graph are adjacent {{if and only if}} the corresponding two edges are consecutive on some face of the planar embedding. The <b>medial</b> graph of the dual graph of a plane graph {{is the same as the}} <b>medial</b> graph of the original plane graph.|$|E
25|$|<b>Medial</b> rectus {{recession}} in the involved eye or both eyes. By weakening the <b>medial</b> rectus muscles this procedure improves the crossed-eye appearance but does not improve outward eye movements (abductions).|$|E
25|$|Some letters {{cannot be}} joined {{to the left}} and so do not possess {{separate}} <b>medial</b> and initial forms. In <b>medial</b> position, the final form is used. In initial position, the isolated form is used.|$|E
25|$|The Herschel graph also {{provides}} an example of a polyhedral graph for which the <b>medial</b> graph cannot be decomposed into two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. The <b>medial</b> graph of the Herschel graph is a 4-regular graph with 18 vertices, one for each edge of the Herschel graph; two vertices are adjacent in the <b>medial</b> graph whenever the corresponding edges of the Herschel graph are consecutive on one of its faces.|$|E
25|$|The {{abductor}} hallucis stretches {{along the}} <b>medial</b> {{edge of the}} foot, from the calcaneus {{to the base of}} the first phalanx of the first digit and the <b>medial</b> sesamoid bone. It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. Lateral to the abductor hallucis is the flexor hallucis brevis, which originates from the <b>medial</b> cuneiform bone and from the tendon of the tibialis posterior. The flexor hallucis has a <b>medial</b> and a lateral head inserted laterally to the abductor hallucis. It is an important plantar flexor which comes into prominent use in classical ballet (i.e. for pointe work).|$|E
25|$|The <b>medial</b> border (also {{called the}} {{vertebral}} border or <b>medial</b> margin) {{is the longest}} of the three borders, and extends from the superior angle to the inferior angle. In animals it {{is referred to as}} the dorsal border.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{between the}} nasal dorsum and the <b>medial</b> canthal tendon is uniquely suited to healing by {{secondary}} intention; the outcomes often {{are superior to}} what is achieved with either skin grafts or skin-flaps and tissue-flaps. Because the <b>medial</b> canthal tendon is affixed to the facial bone, it readily resists the forces of wound contracture; moreover, the animation (movement) of the <b>medial</b> brow also lends resistance to the forces of wound contracture. Furthermore, the <b>medial</b> canthal region is aesthetically hidden by {{the shadows of the}} nasal dorsum and of the supraorbital rim, thereby obscuring any differences in the quality of the color and of the texture of the replacement skin (epithelium).|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{includes}} {{the use of}} syllables with division-III finals to transcribe foreign words lacking any such <b>medial,</b> the lack of the <b>medial</b> in Tibeto-Burman cognates and modern Min reflexes, {{and the fact that}} it is ignored in phonetic series.|$|E
25|$|EEG testing can {{diagnose}} {{patients with}} <b>medial</b> temporal lobe epilepsy. Epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp {{waves in the}} <b>medial</b> temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition, which can in turn {{be the cause of}} an epileptic patient's micropsia.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of new episodic memories requires the <b>medial</b> temporal lobe, {{a structure that}} includes the hippocampus. Without the <b>medial</b> temporal lobe, one is able to form new procedural memories (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which they happened (See the hippocampus and memory).|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} {{the dimensions of}} the new nipple-areola complex, the surgeon de-epithelializes the <b>medial</b> pedicle skin-flap that provides the venous-arterial vascular system for the nipple-areola complex. The first incisions are through the parenchymal tissue, and separate the <b>medial</b> pedicle. The incision is effected to avoid undercutting the skin pedicle and so preserve the nipple-areola complex blood-supply vessels. Hence, the tissue volume of the pedicle flap is essential for {{establishing the}} adequate projection of the upper pole of the breast, where the breast originates from the chest. The surgeon resects (cuts and removes) an almost-triangular segment of tissue below the <b>medial</b> pedicle. Finally, for emplacing the nipple-areola complex, the incisions are completed by cutting the ellipse and the tissue adjacent to the <b>medial</b> pedicle.|$|E
25|$|The second cognitive/associative pathway {{proposed}} is {{a circuit}} projecting from the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, the temporal gyrus, and {{anterior cingulate cortex}} into the ventromedial caudate, followed by a projection into the lateromedial GPi, and rostrolateral SNr before looping into the cortex via the <b>medial</b> VAmc and <b>medial</b> magnocellularis.|$|E
25|$|Teochew finals consist maximally of a <b>medial,</b> nucleus and coda. The <b>medial</b> can be i or u, {{the nucleus}} {{can be a}} monophthong or diphthong, and the coda can be a nasal or a stop. A {{syllable}} must consist minimally of a vowel nucleus or syllabic nasal.|$|E
25|$|Elbow {{dysplasia}} is {{a condition}} found more commonly in large breeds. It incorporates several different hereditary conditions of the elbow, including osteochondritis of the <b>medial</b> condyle of the humerus, fragmentation of the <b>medial</b> coronoid process of the ulna, and ununited anconeal process of the ulna.|$|E
25|$|Each letter has a position-independent {{encoding}} in Unicode, and the rendering {{software can}} infer the correct glyph form (initial, <b>medial,</b> final or isolated) from its joining context. That {{is the current}} recommendation. However, for compatibility with previous standards, the initial, <b>medial,</b> final and isolated forms can also be encoded separately.|$|E
