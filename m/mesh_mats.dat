50|$|Another {{problem is}} that the {{reflection}} process is highly dependent on the angle between the signal and the ionosphere, and is generally limited to about 2 to 4 degrees off the local horizon. Making a beam at this angle generally requires enormous antenna arrays and highly reflective ground along the path the signal is being sent, often enhanced by the installation of wire <b>mesh</b> <b>mats</b> extending as much as 3 km in front of the antenna. OTH systems are thus very expensive to build, and essentially immobile.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: First {{described}} in 1764, the hernia of the semilunar line {{is called a}} Spigelian hernia. Spigelian hernias are rare: comprising only 1 - 2 % of all abdominal hernias. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73 -year-old man presented at the emergency department complaining of not having defaecated and swelling of the right lower abdomen. This proved to be ileus caused by an incarcerated Spigelian hernia. The patient underwent surgery at which the hernia was reposited at an open procedure and repaired with a <b>mesh</b> <b>mat.</b> The patient quickly recovered. CONCLUSION: Spigelian hernias {{are located in the}} aponeurosis of the transverse abdominal muscle and internal oblique muscle. Diagnosis can be challenging; often the hernia is covered by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. Because of the high risk of strangulation, operation is almost always indicated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{implementation}} {{aspects of a}} surface finite element (FE) meshing algorithm described in Part I (this volume) [1]. This meshing scheme {{is based on the}} medial axis transform (MAT) [2] to interrogate shape and to subdivide it into topologically simple subdomains. The algorithm can be ef-fectively used to create coarse discretization and fine triangular surface meshes. We describe our techniques and methodology used in the implementation f the <b>meshing</b> and <b>MAT</b> algorithms. We also present some running times of our experimental system. We finally report the results we have obtained from several de-sign and analysis applications which include adaptive surface approximations using triangular facets, and adaptive h- and p-adaptive finite element analysis (FEA) of plane stress prob-lems, These studies demonstrate the potential applicability of our techniques in computer aided design and analysis. ...|$|R

To inspect the conformity as filler, the activated carbon from rice husk was applied in the preparation of rubber mat compound, in the case carbon black N 330 was used as the standard of comparison. Activated carbon from rice husk was made by carbonization process at temperature of 450 oC for one hour and activation process with NaCl 4 % for 24 hours, followed by pyrolysis at temperature 500 oC for one hour. Filler was milled and sieved by 400 <b>mesh</b> siefter. Rubber <b>mat</b> compound were prepared with various filler level of activated carbon from rice husk, carbon black N 330 either separately formulated or combination. The vulcanized rubber mat was then physically tested its tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness, an density. The research showed that the addition of filler by combining the activated carbon from rice husk and carbon black with ratio of 40 : 20 phr into the rubber compound could meet the physical properties requirements of rubber mat. Activated carbon from rice husk can be used as filler, but not as reinforcing filler...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} primary breakup of liquid jet in {{crossflow}} (LJCF) is investigated {{by means of}} detailed numerical simulations. A spectrally refined interface tracking technique, which is coupled to a Navier-Stokes/Ghost fluid solver, is employed to track the liquid-gas interface. From the parametric space corresponding to the LJCF, the effect of varying momentum flux ratio, liquid Weber number, and crossflow Weber number on the liquid jet trajectory and the liquid surface wavelengths on the windward side of the liquid jet is investigated. Predicted liquid jet trajectories show good match with published experimen-tal datasets. The numerical simulations predict that the wavelength of the liquid surface disturbances scale with the liquid Weber number rather than the crossflow Weber number for the conditions studied in this work. The numerical simulations also provide preliminary evidence that for the conditions chosen in this study, the smallest liquid length scales are controlled by the liquid Weber number rather than the crossflow Weber number.

40|$|A new mesh {{generation}} algorithm called ‘LayTracks’, {{to automatically}} generate an all quad mesh that {{is adapted to}} the variation of geometric feature size in the domain is described. LayTracks combines the merits of two popular direct techniques for quadrilateral mesh generation—quad meshing by decomposition and advancing front quad <b>meshing.</b> While the <b>MAT</b> {{has been used for}} the domain decomposition before, this is the first attempt to use the MAT, for the robust subdivision of a complex domain into a well defined sub-domain called ‘Tracks’, for terminating the advancing front of the mesh elements without complex interference checks and to use radius function for providing sizing function for adaptive meshing. The process of subdivision of a domain is analogous to, formation of railway tracks by laying rails on the ground. Each rail starts from a node on the boundary and propagates towards the medial axis (MA) and then from the MA towards the boundary. Quadrilateral elements are then obtained by placing nodes on these rails and connecting them inside each track, formed by adjacent rails. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on some typical geometries {{and the quality of the}} output mesh obtained are presented. Extension of this technique to all hexahedral meshing is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Geotextile mats made of woven palm leaves showed {{potential}} using a {{rainfall simulator}} for their effectiveness in reducing surface runoff and sediment load {{from a range}} of South African soils and mine tailings. This paper advances that research by using field plots to evaluate and quantify the palm mats on a larger scale. Plots at four localities (Bergville, Ladybrand, Roodeplaat and Mabula) were used. Results showed that average runoff under the palm mats decreased by between 0 % and 70 % at Bergville, and by between 0 % and 7 % at Ladybrand, compared to bare soil. Sediment load under the mats decreased by between 0 % and 7 % at Ladybrand, and by between 3 % and 9 % at Roodeplaat, for three different combinations of slope, mat density and <b>mat</b> <b>mesh</b> size. At Roodeplaat, splash erosion decreased by between 62 % and 6 %, while at Ladybrand and Mabula, re-vegetation increased by between 3 % and 0 %. Organic carbon content and topsoil surface levels also increased under the mats. Organic, bio-degradable, easy to manufacture geotextiles, such as palm leaf mats, show much potential, especially in combining employment opportunities with enhanced environmental protection in many susceptible areas of South Africa.

40|$|Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a {{prevalent}} {{and aggressive}} form of {{primary brain tumor}} afflicting about 20, 000 patients in the US every year. The prognosis for patients diagnosed with GBM is {{in the order of}} months and the treatment of this disease, which confers a mere increase of 8 weeks in patients with recurrent tumors and 18 weeks in patients with first time tumors, has shown almost no improvement over the last four decades. The current treatment involves a combination of surgical resection and insertion of BCNU loaded polymer wafers (Gliadel?) followed by chemo or radiotherapy. The Gliadel? wafers are known to stack and dislocate in the surgical cavity due to postsurgical inflammation resulting in suboptimal drug delivery. In addition, the wafers are loaded with only a single drug type and even that at a much lower than tolerable dose. Yet, no efforts to address these deficiencies have been identified. This may be in large part {{due to the lack of}} an adequate brain model. As such, we have initiated the design and development of a novel polymer implant device to address the drawbacks of the current wafers and have in the process developed a preliminary brain phantom model using 0. 6 % agarose gel cast in a life-size plastic mold to test our device. This model has incorporated the diffusion properties of the brain tissue and the simulation of the effects of postsurgical inflammation. We have also developed a preliminary computer simulation model based on an appropriate mathematical model described in the literature which will be used to validate our phantom model as well as provide a basis for a tool that may be used to predict patient outcomes in the clinical setting. The computer simulation has been validated through the generation of results which concur with data from published literature and has also been used to establish that the morphology of the implant device has a significant effect on the drug delivery in the brain. We developed an electrospun polymer (polycaprolactone or PCL) mesh loaded with a drug substitute (fluorescein) and carried out preliminary tests to demonstrate empirically the effect of morphology on drug release and delivery. Empirical determination of the diffusion parameters were incorporated in our phantom and computer model to cross-validate their design and establish proof of concept. The simultaneous development of all three aspects has provided a justification for the preferential development of the implant device in spring or coil morphology as opposed to a <b>mesh</b> or <b>mat</b> morphology and will serve to continually cross-validate our designs as the project proceeds. PCL as the testing polymer has been deemed inappropriate due to limitations on fabrication (extrusion) as well as a very slow degradation rate. Suggestions for the exploration of deployment mechanisms of the spring or coil have also been made...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EmF) form symbioses with trees. These symbioses profoundly {{influence}} forest ecology. Certain EmF form specialized profusions of hyphae, {{known as}} ectomycorrhizal fungal mats (mats) which are {{visible to the}} naked eye, alter forest soil biogeochemistry, substantially contribute to soil microbial biomass/respiration and support unique microbial communities. Piloderma and Ramaria mats stratify in organic and upper mineral soil, respectively, and are the dominant mat-forming fungi of old-growth Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest, USA. The importance of Piloderma and Ramaria mats to forest ecosystem processes has driven the need to better understand their associated microbial communities, particularly development (birth) and decline (death) dynamics. To explore these dynamics, a reciprocal soil transplant experiment was established at seven old-growth Douglas-fir sites in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest. At each site Piloderma, Ramaria and non-mat soils underwent birth (non-mat into mat enclosed in 2 -mm <b>mesh),</b> death (<b>mat</b> into non-mat enclosed in PVC pipe), disturbance control (core non-mat soil, replace in 2 -mm mesh) and background (no manipulation) treatments. After 51 months, treatments were harvested and three microbial community components were assessed through molecular analyses: active EmF root-tips using Sanger sequencing and soil fungi and bacteria using 454 -pyrosequencing. Results from this study revealed differential persistence of mats formed by Piloderma and Ramaria. In the mineral horizon, we found few microbial community differences. Originally unique Ramaria mat microbiota were no different from non-mat soils after 51 months, and the mat-forming genus, Ramaria, was notably missing from fungal sequences; these data support the ephemeral nature of Ramaria mats where their hydrophobic powdery structure may, at times, be a visual legacy of mat presence, a remnant of physical alteration of the soil environment. In the organic horizon, Piloderma mat fungal communities persisted for 51 months and remained distinct from non-mat soils; this permitted birth and death treatment analysis. Our data indicate strong development of Piloderma mat fungal communities in birth treatments, beyond colonization by Piloderma, making them indistinguishable from Piloderma mats; mat development can take many years. Death treatments were dissimilar to Piloderma mats and contained similar fungal communities to non-mat soils. Enclosure in PVC pipe, thereby removing roots and EmF from the system, significantly shifted the soil fungal community toward saprotrophic dominance. To compliment Piloderma, the EmF genus Russula was a robust indicator of non-mat organic soils; there was strong evidence for the competitive exclusion of Russula in Piloderma mats, though it may take many years for exclusion to occur. For organic horizon bacterial communities, only death treatments differed from others. Strong similarities were found between overall Piloderma mat and non-mat bacterial communities; however, Piloderma mat and non-mat soils impose selection pressure on a small subset of bacterial taxa masked when the community is considered as a whole. This work contributes to the body of knowledge regarding complex microbial community dynamics of EmF mats. The occurrence and distinct microbial taxa of Piloderma mats in these forests suggests large-scale spatial differences in ecological function. The extent of functional differences is currently unknown, but Piloderma mats present a unique microbial system, supported by over 30 years of research, to test difficult microbial ecology questions...|$|R
