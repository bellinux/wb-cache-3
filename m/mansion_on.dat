5|$|According to the Council of Trent, every Catholic {{church is}} {{required}} to have a residing pastor. Before {{the building of the}} rectory began in 1944, the three priests and their housekeeper had lived in the Leslie Mansion (the <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the property).

5|$|On June 28, 1860 Eilley Bowers {{gave birth}} to a son, John Jasper Bowers, who died on August 27, 1860. On June 16, 1861 she {{gave birth to}} a daughter, Theresa Fortunatas Bowers, who died on September 17, 1861. With money to be had, the couple began to plan a grand <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the old Cowan Ranch in Washoe Valley.

5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit.

5|$|The {{land for}} the fort was {{appropriated}} from James Roach, a building contractor in Washington who was the second-largest landowner in the county, behind only the Lee family. Soldiers tore up land, dug trenches, and used gardens for latrines. Roach's <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> Prospect Hill was vandalized by Union forces during the construction of Fort Runyon, but survived the war and was demolished in 1965. Other land for Fort Runyon and Fort Jackson came from the demolition of Jackson City, a collection of gambling establishments, saloons, and a racetrack that were located {{at the southern end}} of the Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1700s, John Tynte owned {{what is now}} the Tyntesfield estate; at that time the house was {{approached}} by an avenue of elm trees, planted after they were bequeathed in the 1678 will of Sir Charles Harbord to the people of Wraxall in memory of two boys he had apprenticed from the village. The Tynte's had originally lived on the estate, but by the early 1800s, John had made Chelvey Court in Brockley his principal residence. Tynte's Place was downgraded to a farmhouse and leased to John Vowles. In 1813, George Penrose Seymour of the adjoining Belmont estate purchased the property and gave it to his son, the Rev. George Turner Seymour. He in turn built a new Georgian <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the site of the former Saddler's Tenement, and demolished the old farmhouse. Further remodelling was undertaken by Robert Newton of Nailsea.|$|E
5|$|Elaine's role is {{significantly}} reduced for the sequel , though {{the majority of}} the story is conveyed by Guybrush to Elaine {{in the form of a}} flashback. Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor's <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a map that belonged to Elaine's grandfather, which leads to fabled treasure Big Whoop. After discovering Guybrush's intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him. Guybrush eventually becomes trapped at the site of Big Whoop, with Elaine arriving to rescue him. Guybrush falls into a chasm, where he is confronted by LeChuck, recently resurrected as a zombie. As the game ends with Guybrush thinking he is a child in a theme park, Elaine is seen worrying that LeChuck has placed a curse on Guybrush.|$|E

5|$|In March 1923, Lenin {{suffered}} a third stroke {{and lost his}} ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, {{he appeared to be}} making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Moscow Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the day of his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{followed}} a similar format: Dr. Cave's tenancy {{was cut short}} in 1551, when King Edward VI granted the abbey to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, brother of the former Queen Catherine Parr. Much of the abbey stone was then {{used to create a}} new <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the site, for the Marquess. The Marquess only held the abbey for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of Bloody Mary, he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted the abbey and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth I came to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Plantations {{continued}} to develop along {{the fringes of}} present-day West Virginia. By {{the close of the}} 18th century, Harman Blennerhassett had constructed a <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> his plantation on Blennerhassett Island and Moses Shepherd had built Shepherd Hall near Wheeling, both in the Ohio River valley. Despite the agricultural development of then western Virginia's bottomlands and the resulting wealth of the plantation owners, the hinterlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Allegheny Plateau regions remained underpopulated and inhabited by subsistence farmers of meager means {{into the middle of the}} 19th century. By the 1860 United States Census, Berkeley, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, and Monroe counties consequently had the largest populations of slaves in present-day West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 (2009) {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} African town of Kijuju in 2009, where a {{biological}} agent has turned local residents into zombies. Valentine has been missing since a fight with her commander-turned-double agent Albert Wesker, years before the game's events. The fight is shown in the game's Lost in Nightmares downloadable content (DLC), in which Redfield and Valentine search for Umbrella's founder, Ozwell E. Spencer, inside a <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> the edge of a cliff. Instead they find Wesker, who overpowers them. To save Redfield, Valentine tackles Wesker, and they both crash through a window and over the cliff. Their bodies are not recovered, and Valentine is declared dead. In fact she was injured by the fall and saved by Wesker, who then used her as a test subject in his experiments on mutagenic viruses.|$|E
5|$|The West Wycombe {{estate was}} {{acquired}} by Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his brother Samuel in 1698. Dashwood demolished the existing manor house and built a modern <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> higher ground nearby. This mansion forms {{the core of the}} present house. Images of the house on early estate plans show a red-brick house with stone dressings and a hipped roof in the contemporary Queen Anne style. In 1724, Dashwood bequeathed this square conventional house to his 16-year-old son, the 2nd Baronet, also Francis, who later inherited the title Baron le Despencer through his mother and is perhaps best known for establishing the Hellfire Club close to the mansion, in the West Wycombe Caves. Between 1726 and 1741, Dashwood embarked on a series of Grand Tours: the ideas and manners he learned during this period influenced him throughout his life and were pivotal in the rebuilding of his father's simple house, transforming it into the classical edifice that exists today.|$|E

5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E
5|$|LeChuck's advances, he {{nevertheless}} pursues {{her love}} and aims to impress her by discovering {{the secret of}} Monkey Island. The exhibition ultimately costs LeChuck his life, but he returns as a ghost still intent on marrying Elaine. LeChuck's ambitions for Elaine's hand in marriage—whether given willingly or not—form {{a major part of}} the franchise's plot. Elaine first encounters Guybrush when he breaks into the governor's <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> Mêlée Island in an attempt to steal a valuable idol. Elaine has been fascinated to meet Guybrush since hearing of his arrival on the island and his strange name, however, their first meeting is stunted by Guybrush being too awestruck by Elaine's beauty to say anything intelligible. When the local sheriff tries to drown Guybrush after a fight, Elaine nevertheless rushes to his aid, confessing that she feels deeply attracted to Guybrush, which he reciprocates. She implores Guybrush to finish his pirate trials before they act on their new-found love, but is kidnapped by LeChuck and taken to his hideout on Monkey Island when the ghost pirate's crew suddenly raids the island. Guybrush mounts a rescue attempt, but fails to reach Elaine before LeChuck's ship returns to Mêlée Island for LeChuck's wedding to Elaine. The well-intentioned Threepwood gatecrashes the wedding, but in actuality ruins Elaine's own plan to defeat LeChuck with an anti-ghost concoction. Guybrush still manages to destroy LeChuck, and the game closes with the happy couple watching the fireworks as the evil pirate's ghost form explodes.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was the spark that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the <b>mansion</b> <b>on</b> fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
