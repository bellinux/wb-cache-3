40|$|During cruises with Danish {{research}} vessels {{more than}} 17, 000 wild marine fish belonging to 41 different species were sampled and examined virologically. Birnavirus serogroup B was isolated from 7 marine fish species: plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), dab (Limanda limanda), flounder (Platichthys flesus), smear dab (<b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt),</b> {{long rough dab}} (Hippoglossoides platessoides), cod (Gadus morhua) and grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus) with 43 of the 45 isolations coming from flatfish. Birnavirus serogroup B seems to be endemic in the North Sea close to Denmark and in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. Surveillance of aquacultured fish, mainly rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), for VHS, IHN and IPN, in Denmark during the previous 30 years, have resulted in Birnavirus serogroup B isolations twice. These isolations were from healthy rainbow trout. Samples sent to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory for virological examination and charac-terisation have revealed the presence of Birnavirus serogroup B in haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), plaice and dab from wild marine fish caught by Irish fishermen and from Icelandic farmed halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} changes in prey groups of six species of a marine fish assemblage. The study site was an inshore fishing ground 6 km south of Plymouth Sound, UK Changes were tested using a data set of. stomach contents from Merlangius merlangus (L.), <b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt</b> (W.), Pleuronectes platessa (L.), Solea solea (L.), Zeus faber (L.) and Callionymus lyra (L.) from 1928 and 1929 and a matching set from 2004. Significant {{differences were found}} in the overall diet of Merlangius merlangus between the two sampling periods. Further significant differences were found within the diets of Pleuronectes platessa and Callionymus lyra by examining within the prey categories of Polychaeta (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Amphipoda (increase), Upogebia (decrease) and Porcellana (decrease). Stomach contents analysis found a slight increase in the proportion of scavenging species such as Ophiuroidea, Polychaeta and Amphipoda, and a decrease in the proportions of crustaceans such as Upogebia, Porcellana and Portunus in stomach contents. These changes are in in line with what would be expected in an area impacted by trawl gear from commercial fishing fleets, Data of prey groups was not of sufficient taxanomic resolution to examine the possible contribution of climate change to the distribution of prey species.

40|$|To analyse {{the effects}} of {{anthropogenic}} stress and rapid global warming on fish populations {{off the coast of}} Plymouth, 100 years of data which details both the abundance and length of different species has been explored. The size structure of five different species populations were studied {Gadus morhua, <b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt,</b> Merlangius merlangus, Solea solea and Trisopterus minutes) in order to determine any changes within the size structure over time, and in order to identify any relationships between the size structure of the species with fishing pressure and with temperature change. The size structure of the species populations was seen to decrease over time (apart from M. kitt). There was a trend between the size structures of species and fishing effort, where as fishing effort increased the size structure of species populations decreased. T. minutes populations showed a negative trend between size structure and average annual catch per unit effort, indicating that density dependent competition is influencing the size structure of this trash fish species. The average annual sea surface temperature (SST) at the time if recruitment was shown to be responsible for the majority of variance in both G. mohua and T. minutes populations, where as SST increases the size structure of these populations' decreases.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of an extensive ichthyoplankton survey {{that covered the}} continental slope, the offshore banks and oceanic regions west of Ireland. Oceanographic measurements revealed domes of cold, less saline water over the Porcupine, Rockall and Faroese Banks, constituting Taylor columns. The most species-rich stations were those found on {{and close to the}} offshore banks and the shelf edge. Larvae found in these areas were mainly from demersal fish species, including some commercial species such as haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole <b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt</b> (Walbaum, 1792), ling Molva molva (L.) and witch Glyptocephalus cynoglossus (L.). The deep water stations of the Rockall Trough and the north and west stations off the Rockall and Hatton Banks were characterized by a low number of species and high numbers of individuals of mesopelagic species such as Maurolicus muelleri and Benthosema glaciale. Results from multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that species compositions varied significantly at different sites and were related to environmental conditions, whereby sites of similar temperature, salinity and bottom depth harboured similar species assemblages. Generalized additive mixed modelling was used to model the relationship between species richness and environmental variables and confirmed that there was a significant negative relationship between species richness and bottom depth indicating that the offshore banks and the slope stations present favourable habitats for a large number of species. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} habitat {{used during}} spawning may potentially {{be an important}} factor affecting reproductive output of broadcast spawning marine fishes, particularly for species with complex, substrate-oriented mating systems and behaviors, such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. We characterized the habitat use and behavior of spawning Atlantic cod at two locations off the coast of southwestern Iceland during a 2 -d research cruise (15 – 16 April 2009). We simultaneously operated two different active hydroacoustic gear types, a split beam echosounder and a dual frequency imaging sonar (DIDSON), as well as a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). A total of five fish species were identified through ROV surveys: including cusk Brosme brosme, Atlantic cod, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, lemon sole <b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt,</b> and Atlantic redfish Sebastes spp. Of the three habitats identified in the acoustic surveys, the transitional habitat between boulder/lava field and sand habitats was characterized by greater fish density and acoustic target strength compared to that of sand or boulder/lava field habitats independently. Atlantic cod were observed behaving {{in a manner consistent with}} published descriptions of spawning. Individuals were observed ascending 1 – 5 m into the water column from the bottom at an average vertical swimming speed of 0. 20 – 0. 25 m s− 1 and maintained an average spacing of 1. 0 – 1. 4 m between individuals. Our results suggest that cod do not choose spawning locations indiscriminately despite the fact that it is a broadcast spawning fish with planktonic eggs that are released well above the seafloor...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in the protection of sea bed habitats that are important for commercially exploited fish species ('Essential Fish Habitats', EFH) and may be vulnerable to anthropogenic activities such as bottom fishing or aggregate extraction. Locating such habitats in the vast space of the sea, however, is difficult. The concept of habitat selection based on 'Ideal free distribution' theory suggests that areas of high suitability may attract larger quantities of fish than less suitable or unsuitable areas. Here, we used catch data from groundfish surveys to identify areas of consistently high densities of whiting (Merlangius merlangus), cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), in the Irish Sea and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea), lemon sole (<b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt)</b> in the English Channel over a period of 9 and 10 years respectively. A method was developed to identify areas of the seabed that may constitute EFHs and may therefore merit further investigations. In addition, the number of potential EFHs identified and the number of stations where no fish were caught gave an indication of the site specificity of the fish species analysed. For the gadoids, whiting was found to be less site specific than cod and haddock, while for the flatfish plaice and sole were less site specific then lemon sole. Our findings are discussed in the context of previously published studies on dietary specialism. The site specificity of demersal fish has implications for the siting process for marine protected areas as fish species with a strong habitat affinity can be expected to benefit more from such management schemes...|$|E
40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a twin trawl setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm diamond meshes in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and lemon sole (<b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt)</b> and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency. Around 85 % of saithe, 80 % of haddock, 44 % of witch flounder, 55 % of lemon sole, and 55 % of cod (below 68 cm) contacted the large mesh panel and escaped. We also demonstrated the need to account for potential selectivity in the trawl body, as it can bias the assessment of length-based escape behaviour. Our indirect assessment of fish behaviour was in agreement with the direct observations made for the same species in a similar section of the trawl body reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Hypotheses of phylogenetic and {{historical}} zoogeographic relationships of glyptocephalines (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, G. zachirus, G. stelleri, <b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt,</b> H. pacificus, H. achne, Embassichthys bathybius, and Tanakius kitaharae) were constructed based on comparative anatomy and external morphology. The phylogenetic approach was cladistic and character polarity {{was determined by}} using out-group comparison. One nominal in-group, Platichthys bicoloratus, is {{shown to be a}} derived out-group taxon. Two other out-group taxa used are Parophrys vetulus and Atheresthes stomias. Monophyly of glyptocephalines is suggested by the results of minimum distance clustering of shape, as well as asymmetrical jaw dentition and mi-serial arrangement of jaw teeth; loss of ural neural arch; median number of rays on fifth hypural greater than two; and median number of parhypural rays greater than three. Two monophyletic groups are identified within glyptocephalines: Clade M, Embassichthys and Microstomus; and Clade G, Tanakius and Glyptocephalus. Each clade includes a primitive monotypic genus and a derived genus with three species. The most recent speciation event in each clade separated an Atlantic species from a western Pacific species. One trans-Pacific dispersal event is hypothesized for the ancestor of Clade G and one recent trans-Arctic dispersal is hypothesized for both clades. The trans-Pacific dispersal probably occurred during the Miocene. The trans-Arctic dispersal probably occurred during the Pliocene. The western North Pacific or North Pacific is the most likely the center of origin of glyptocephalines, since this area possesses the most primitive taxa. Some ontogenetic data are discussed to corroborate glyptocephaline monophyly and phylogenetic relationships. Relative timing of ontogenetic events and ontogenetic shape changes corroborate generic groupings. A more thorough study of ontogenetic biometry may shed light on the robustness of glyptocephaline phylogeny. In addition, the specialized giant larvae of eastern North Pacific glyptocephalines deserves further study of ecologic and ontogenetic interactions...|$|E
40|$|The age, growth, {{maturity}} and population dynamics of lemon sole (<b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt),</b> captured off {{the west coast}} of Ireland (ICES division Vllb), were determined for the period November 2000 to February 2002. The maximum age recorded was 14 years. Males of the population were dominated by 4 year olds, while females were dominated by 5 year olds. Females dominated the sex ratio in the overall sample, each month sampled, at each age and from 22 cm in total length onwards (when N > 20). Possible reasons for the dominance of females in the sex ratio are discussed. Three models were used to obtain the parameters of the von Bertalanfly growth equation. These were the Ford-Walford plot (Beverton and Holt 1957), the Gulland and Holt plot (1959) and the Rafail (1973) method. Results of the fitted von Bertalanffy growth curves showed that female lemon sole o f f {{the west coast of}} Ireland grew faster than males and attained a greater size. Male and female lemon sole mature from 2 years of age onwards. There is evidence in the population o f a smaller asymptotic length (L«, = 34. 47 cm), faster growth rate (K = 0. 1955) and younger age at first maturity, all of which are indicative o f a decrease in population size, when present results are compared to data collected in the same area 22 years earlier. Results of the yield per recruit curve indicate that lemon sole are currently being over-fished o f f the west coast of Ireland. Problems of selectivity within the sampling method, particularly at the discarding stage, may have influenced the outcome of results of the models used in the assessment of this stock. Therefore, additional/future work on this species should include catch data which incorporates discards and not landings data alone...|$|E
40|$|Fish stock {{identification}} and stock assessment are {{fundamental to the}} science underpinning contemporary fisheries management. Although of considerable economic importance to fisheries in South-west Britain, {{little research has been}} undertaken into the demographic characteristics and stock structure of lemon sole (<b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt)</b> on the South-west European continental shelf, and they are not considered to be of sufficient economic value Europe-wide to wan-ant annual assessment. This study investigates whether populations of lemon sole in ICES. (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) Divisions Vlla;e;f;g & h should be viewed as discrete stocks for assessment and management purposes by examining various life history parameters and population characteristics from samples collected during research surveys from 1992 to 2001. Clear differences were found in the recruitment process (length and age based) and length frequency distributions in catches from north (Vlla;f;g) and south (Vlle;h) of the Cornish Peninsula. Temporal changes in L 1 and a crude maturity analysis support this north/south divide. Sex ratios are similar in Vlla and f, but markedly different to the ratio's observed in Vllg and e. Mean length at age analysis was inconclusive, probably as a result of limited data. It is proposed that, in the absence of further research, lemon sole populations in Vlle&h and Vllf&g exhibit sufficient similarities to be considered as two gross management and assessment units. From a practical perspective, however, current data availability will preclude useful stock assessments and reduce the potential for management options for all areas except Vlle. Traditional and separable VPA models are used to carry out an assessment of stock status for lemon sole in ICES Division Vile. The results indicate that the spawning stock in 2001 was at its lowest level since 1990, possibly {{as a result of a}} succession of below average recruitments.

40|$|Flatfishes {{have been}} the subject of {{scientific}} research since the beginning of the 19 th century but information on the specific habitat requirement of the adult life stages is largely anecdotal. Detailed knowledge of flatfish habitats however is a precondition for a more ecosystem orientated approach to fisheries management. Here the association between benthic habitat and the adult life stage of three flatfish species plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea) and lemon sole (<b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt)</b> was investigated in the English Channel. Data from groundfish surveys spanning a period of 9 years was used to identify three distinct site groups: sites where a species occurred in consistently high abundances, sites of variable or low abundance and sites at which none were caught. Following the supposition of habitat selection theories such as the ideal free distribution theory these three sites groups should represent a gradient in habitat suitability from highly suitable to less suitable and unsuitable respectively. Habitat parameters and features for the three site groups and species were described and analysed. In particular sediment type and the importance of structuring epifauna for adult flatfish was investigated. Overall plaice and sole showed very similar trends for abiotic environmental parameters such as depth, temperature, salinity and tidal currents. Lemon sole was found over distinctly different habitats which may indicate a stronger niche partitioning of this species. Sediment associations differed between the three species with plaice predominantly occurring over sandy substrates with little mud and gravel content, while sole was found over a wider range of muddy to sandy substrates. Lemon sole was predominantly found over sand however containing a higher percentage of gravel than plaice. Structuring emergent epifauna was related positively to plaice and lemon sole abundances. These structures might be important as they tend to harbour larger numbers of epibenthic species upon which adult plaice and lemon sole prey. No such trend was found for the tactile feeding sole which mainly forages on infaunal polychaetes and molluscs...|$|E
40|$|The Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus (Lockington) is {{a fairly}} large {{flatfish}} belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is not a true sole, but a flounder. However, through continued common usage of the term "sole" {{for most of the}} flounders along the Pacific Coast, this appellation has become recognized by the fishing industry and the different government agencies concerned. It has been known along the Pacific Coast under several different common names, such as slippery sole (California and Puget Sound), lemon sole (Vancouver), smear dab (Puget Sound), rubber sole and short finned sole (San Francisco), slime sole (California and Puget Sound), tongue sole, and Dover sole (Pacific Coast). The common name of Dover sole was first suggested by Mr. Stewart, employee of the New England Fish Co., Astoria, Oregon, around 1939 according to the Eureka fishermen. He probably associated Microstomus pacificus, the only representative of its genus along the eastern Pacific Coast, with <b>Microstomus</b> <b>kitt</b> Walbaum, which ranges from the White Sea into English waters and is probably taken off the Dover coast. The two species are very similar in general appearance and might well appear identical to an untrained observer, but in meristic counts and morphometric measurements they differ significantly. In 1946, Clemens and Wilby used the name Dover sole in their Fishes of the Pacific Coast of Canada, and in 1948 it was adopted as the official name in California by the Department of Fish and Game. It is evident that the name Dover sole has a greater marketing value than some of the other names, such as slime sole, slippery sole, etc., with their rather unappetizing connotations. Although the range of the Dover sole extends from Southern California to Alaska, it is important commercially only from San Francisco northward along the Oregon coast. Small amounts have been landed in Washington and British Columbia, but the centers of fishing are at Fort Bragg and Eureka in California, and at Newport and Astoria in Oregon. South of Monterey it is not found in great abundance. In developing a management program for the conservation of a fisheries resource, a knowledge of the biology of the species concerned is important. Full utilization of the population is desirable, but a balance must be maintained between the recruitment and the total mortality. Regulation of fishing areas, closed seasons, restrictions on destructive gear, and limitations on total catch are tools that may be used in the maintenance of a fisheries resource at the most productive level, but their use should be based on sound reasoning and biological facts. It is in the hope of providing a few of the required facts that this study is presented. In the course of this investigation approximately 3, 200 specimens of Dover sole were examined during the period from July, 1948, to October, 1949. The bulk of the material was gathered from commercial fishermen and dealers in the Eureka region, although a small amount of sampling was conducted at Fort Bragg. After the fish are taken from the vessel during normal commercial handling, they are weighed by the dealer and dumped in a pile near the end of a conveyor system. The measuring board was placed on a fish box or bench as close to this source of supply as possible, and specimens were taken at random from the pile. Each fish was weighed, laid on the board with the nose against the end plate and the total length measured. The abdominal wall was cut to determine the sex and to obtain gonad samples. Stomach contents were sampled in some cases. If scales were required they were taken by means of a pair of forceps and either placed in an envelope or put directly on a slide. Otoliths were taken by holding the fish firmly with the left hand (thumb in the lower eye orbit) and making a diagonal cut into the head exposing the brain and inner ears. Otoliths were taken from both sides, placed in an envelope, and preserved dry. All data were recorded on a white plastic sheet with a lead pencil. In this way, the sampler, with wet slimy hands, could write down the necessary information and by washing the sheet in water have a clean neat record. After transferring the information to paper, the plastic sheet was washed with a cleanser to remove the pencil marks...|$|E
