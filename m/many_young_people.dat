5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. <b>Many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in the region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father {{was a friend of}} Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations ranked Sierra Leone 180 out of 187 {{on their}} Human Development Index. One {{of the major}} factors in this low world ranking was gender inequality. Despite a {{civil war in the}} country, {{football}} remained important to <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> regardless of gender, in the country. The reason was that football was seen as one way of understanding life by watching what happened on the pitch. In 2007, a football administrator from the country {{is in charge of the}} women's football committee in the West African Football Union. In 2011, Brazilian women's football superstar Marta visited the country and met with the national team. Her visit was part of the United Nations Development Programme where Marta is a Goodwill Ambassador. In 2011, there was no national women's league in the country. In 2012, Girls Football League was launched by the Craig Bellamy Foundation after a pilot programme in 2010/2012 in Makeni that included four teams. Girls participating in the programme are given scholarships to attend, with 93% attending school regularly while involved with the programme, a much higher percentage than the national average for female school attendance.|$|E

5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. Iron deficiency anaemia seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} five successive, {{comparable}} studies of English <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> experiences and opinions of debt, conducted between 2004 and 2014. The paper makes three main contributions to conceptualisations of geographies of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and economic change. First, I evidence how multiple forms of indebtedness {{have become increasingly}} commonplace, taken-for-granted, normative, efficacious constituents of <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> everyday geographies in England over the last decade. Second, I argue that <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> narratives of debt have increasingly been infused with a particular sense of the inevitability of future debt, especially in a ‘current climate’ of ‘austerity’. Third, I explore some day-to-day narratives, practices and dispositions through which <b>young</b> <b>people</b> ‘get on with’ presently experienced and anticipated future debts. In particular, and in distinction to much extant research on <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and debt, I highlight the constitutive presence of anticipated, ‘inevitable’, future indebtedness in <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> everyday geographies. I suggest that the recognition that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> frequently, and increasingly, figure future debts – and their inevitability – as burdensome, problematic presences within present-day geographies necessitates a conceptual widening of normative understandings of <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> participation in contemporary economic geographies: beyond formulations of ‘student debt’, beyond a commonplace focus on <b>young</b> <b>people</b> as consumers and beyond assumptions of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> as passive victims of economic change...|$|R
50|$|Farming {{continued}} {{to be the primary}} source of income. The rise of the auto industry in the late 1910s to 1920s led <b>many</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> to leave the area to settle in the Detroit and Flint areas of Michigan. Today, many residents of Long Lake township are retirees or commute to work in Traverse City.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture was at {{the heart}} of Avellino's economy until the mid-1970s, since then <b>many</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> have moved away from family farms, and {{sometimes}} also migrated away from the area, in pursuit of higher wages. Nevertheless, tobacco, viticulture and, especially the production of hazelnuts remain important to the local economy and, with increased investment in recent years, employ large numbers of people.|$|R
25|$|Fulmer {{sponsored}} the further education of its technicians and helped many young graduates in metallurgy, physics and other sciences {{on the road}} to successful careers. In the 1970s and 80s Fulmer undertook curriculum development projects in Berkshire and Buckinghamshire primary and secondary schools. It thus introduced <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to engineering, to problem solving methods and to working in teams. A senior staff member joined the Berkshire education advisory service from Fulmer to continue and extend work of this kind.|$|E
25|$|Due to an {{increase}} in Welsh-language nursery education, recent census data reveals a reversal of decades of linguistic decline: there are now more Welsh speakers under five years of age than over 60. For <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in Wales, the acquisition of Welsh is a gateway to better careers, according to research from the Welsh Language Board and Careers Wales. The Welsh Government identified media as one of six areas likely to experience greater demand for Welsh speakers: the sector is Wales's third largest revenue earner.|$|E
25|$|Youth {{activism}} in Indonesia takes many different forms {{and include a}} number of mass protests to overthrow governments and remove colonial powers in the past. Popular motivations of youth {{activism in}} Indonesia are indigenous rights and national unity, pro-communism, anticommunism, pro-democracy and militant Islam. A common form of activism is massa, a cavalcade of motorcycles, trucks, music, and <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> on foot. These cavalcades are mostly males and end with a rally to address a certain political issue. In general, youth {{have been looking for}} political change during the last four decades.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, pitmatic, {{together}} with some rural Northumbrian communities including Rothbury, used a guttural R. This is now less frequently heard; since {{the closure of}} the area's deep mines, <b>many</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> speak in local ways that do not usually include this characteristic. The guttural r sound can, however, still sometimes be detected, especially amongst elderly populations in more rural areas.|$|R

2500|$|Only fluent {{speakers}} of Araki {{distinguish between the}} flap [...] and the trill and only they can distinguish and pronounce the linguolabial consonants. 'Passive' users of the language replace these consonants either with bilabial consonants or alveolar consonants.

25|$|Cistercian monk Father Thomas Keating, {{a founder}} of Centering Prayer, was abbot all through the 60s and 70s at St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts. This area is thick with {{religious}} retreat centres, including the well-known Theravada Buddhist centre, Insight Meditation Society. Fr. Keating tells of meeting <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> some who stumbled on St. Joseph’s by accident, many of them born Catholic, who had turned to Eastern practices for contemplative work. He found {{many of them had}} no knowledge of the contemplative traditions within Christianity and set out to present those practices in a more accessible way. The result was the practice now called Centering Prayer.|$|E
25|$|The {{recorded}} history of Maryland {{dates back to}} when Europeans began exploring the area, starting with the Italian/Venetian John Cabot (c. 1450– c. 1500), exploring {{the coast of the}} continent of North America for England in 1498. The first European settlements were made in 1634, when the English arrived in significant numbers and created a permanent colony. Maryland was notable for having been established with religious freedom for Roman Catholics. Like other colonies of the Chesapeake Bay, its economy was based on tobacco as a commodity crop, cultivated primarily by African slave labor, although <b>many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> came from Britain as indentured servants in the early years.|$|E
25|$|Faroese {{handicrafts}} {{are mainly}} based on materials available to local villages—mainly wool. Garments include jumpers, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations {{handed down from}} mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This {{appears to be a}} reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. <b>Many</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.|$|E
50|$|Interest in Chinese, as the {{language}} of the other neighbouring power, has been growing. A number of older educated Mongolian citizens speak some German, as they studied in the former East Germany, while a few speak other languages from the former Eastern Bloc. <b>Many</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> are fluent in the Western European languages as they study or work in, among other places, Germany, France and Italy.|$|R
