Strong republican feelings in Sheffield: cannon have been firing on news of the Duke of Brunswick's retreat [the "Brunswick Manifesto" issued on 25 July 1792 threatened the French populace with retaliatory violence by Prussian forces should the French royal family be harmed. It antagonised the population and on 20 September 1792 the Prussians were defeated in the Battle of Valmy and retreated from France]. The 15 October has been set as a day of celebration by several sets of workmen and a republican printer has a new sign of [Thomas] Paine [(1737 - 1809), author and revolutionary] at a bookdesk, and several street corners bear the inscription "Death or Liberty". A government directive for dealers in perfumery, hats, and gloves to form committees to report on evasion of duties was met with remark that it "must be a poor government that cannot be supported without sowing dissension among neighbours and making fellow citizens informers of one another".

30|$|All non-oxidized samples, for all eumelanin {{immobilization}} approaches considered here, {{showed a}} marked photosensitivity. When illuminating {{with the whole}} lamp spectrum, the variation in the photocurrent intensity from very low ambient light to the maximum impinging light intensity showed an increase of more than three orders of magnitude, fully reproducible for the same gold plot. However, while the wavelength dependence was highly reproducible, as discussed later in more detail, a variability was observed in the maximum measured photocurrent when using different gold contacts on the same sample and/or on different samples, even if nominally identical. At the same time, the maximum photogenerated voltage showed a much lower variation, being between 100 and 150 [*]mV <b>for</b> <b>impregnated</b> samples and between 120 and 200 [*]mV for empty samples, suggesting a contact-related and non material-related issue.

Recent studies of the properties of impregnated wood have demonstrated the possibility of substantially improving its mechanical characteristics.

The results demonstrate that the compressive strength of impregnated test specimens is greater than that of nonimpregnated ones, indicating that monocomponent polyurethane resin can be considered suitable <b>for</b> <b>impregnating</b> wood, since it increases the compressive strength of eucalyptus...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} and {{investigation of a}} new technique for measuring tropospheric concentrations of hydroxyl radicals (OH) is presented. The technique {{is based on the}} near-infrared fluorescence of IR 125 which is quenched upon reaction with OH. IR 125, is shown to react with OH, and be sufficiently less reactive with other tropospheric oxidants that when exposed to tropospheric air samples, changes in the dye fluorescence are related to the ambient OH concentration. A near-infrared fluorimeter was constructed to determine IR 125 concentrations. Detection of 10 - 12 M IR 125 in solution was obtained. This sensitivity allows observation of changes in IR 125 concentrations due to reaction with typical tropospheric OH concentrations. Changes in the fluorescence of IR 125 when sampling the ambient air using dye <b>impregnated</b> quartz <b>wool</b> cartridges were shown to follow predicted OH concentrations for the observed environmental conditions. Photodecomposition by sunlight and reaction with other, longer lived, oxidants were accounted for in determining the IR 125 response to OH. An OH source of known concentration to calibrate the IR 125 response based on the photolysis of HONO or H 2 was constructed. A photochemical computer model developed and used to determine the steady-state OH concentrations was validated by the successful prediction of concentrations of some cogenerated compounds. This OH source was not compatible with the sampling technique using dye <b>impregnated</b> quartz <b>wool</b> cartridges, because of the overwhelming interference caused by suspected heterogeneous reactions of the precursors.

30|$|From {{the results}} shown in Figures[*] 7 and 8, {{there are several}} {{considerations}} that can be made.

The second significant feature is that impregnated samples show a steep photocurrent increase in the lower energy part of the spectrum.

If we compare empty and impregnated samples with similar maximum photocurrent, about 40 [*]% of the total photocurrent is generated, <b>for</b> <b>impregnated</b> samples, when using wavelengths longer than 780 [*]nm; while for empty PSi layers, the same wavelength range gives only about 15 [*]% of the maximum photocurrent.|$|R
