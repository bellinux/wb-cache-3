5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E

With all normal communications shut down, he wanted to let these people know that those left behind were not being mistreated and that the Germans were behaving like gentlemen. Accepted as such by most islanders, when broadcast from Germany it was viewed differently in Britain, coming as it did in the midst of the Battle of Britain. The BBC did not repeat the broadcast as requested.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Saavedra and Shulman {{associate}} {{produced the}} New York premiere of Craig Wright's <b>Mistakes</b> <b>Were</b> <b>Made</b> Off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre. The comedy, directed by Dexter Bullard, starred Academy Award-nominated actor Michael Shannon as Felix Artifex, a B-list Off-Broadway producer who gets in way over his fast-talking head {{when he takes}} on a gargantuan epic about the French Revolution which he thinks {{is going to be}} his ticket to professional and personal reclamation. While trying to land a big star for the lead role, he uses all his powers of persuasion, seduction and intimidation to strong-arm the writer into massively rewriting his play.|$|E
25|$|MPD {{commander}} Leocadio Santiago, while {{agreeing with}} the decision to put the assault on hold until Mendoza had started shooting hostages, admitted that <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made.</b> Senior Supt. Agrimero Cruz Jr., {{spokesman for the national}} police, said five general lapses were observed by the PNP Command Group and Staff: poor handling of the hostage negotiation; side issues and events that further agitated the hostage taker; inadequate planning of the assault, and lack of team capability, skills and equipment; improper crowd control; and non-compliance with media relations procedures in hostage taking. Interior secretary Jessie Robredo, {{who is in charge of}} the national police, also admitted problems with how the crisis was handled. Manila Police District director Rodolfo Magtibay, as commander of the rescue operation, took leave and four members of the SWAT team were suspended, pending investigation.|$|E
25|$|Remaining {{challenges}} However, in {{the rush}} to construct planning <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made.</b> Demand was overestimated, the construction of sewerage lagged behind the construction of treatment plants, designs were sometimes inappropriate, there was no requirement for pre-treatment of industrial effluents thus affecting the effectiveness of treatment processes, and the sites chosen for the first priority investments within a river basin were not always those where the highest impact could have been achieved in terms of improving river water quality. As a result, many plants are underutilized or poorly functioning. According to the Ministry of Construction, more than 50 wastewater treatment plants in more than 30 cities operated at only 30 percent of their capacity or did not even come into operation. Consequently, the impact of the investment program on the water quality in rivers and coastal waters has been limited.|$|E

25|$|On four {{occasions}} since 1990, the Middletown Times-Herald Record has run lengthy investigative {{articles on}} claims of electoral {{fraud in the}} village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at yeshivas in Brooklyn had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and Brooklyn; a year later the paper reported that it had happened again. In 2001 absentee ballots were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in Antwerp, Belgium, without a set date of expected return and thus {{would not be allowed}} under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office. That article led to a county grand jury investigation in 2001, which concluded that while procedures were not followed and many <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> {{there was no evidence of}} deliberate intent to violate the law.|$|E
500|$|On August 23, 1963, Hurricane Beulah was {{the site}} of the next seeding attempt. It had an indistinct eyewall. In addition, <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> as the {{seedings}} of silver iodide were dropped in the wrong places. As a consequence, nothing happened. The next day, another attempt was made, and the seeders hit their targets. The eyewall was observed to fall apart and be replaced by another eyewall with a larger radius. The sustained winds also fell by twenty percent. All in all, the results of the experiments on Beulah were [...] "encouraging but inconclusive." ...|$|E

Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches. According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10 the next morning. Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border.

500|$|Joseph [...] "Beppo" [...] Schmid was {{commander}} of the Luftwaffe's Military Intelligence Branch (Abteilung 5 as Chief IC). Throughout this time, Schmid's reports {{made a series of}} errors. In July 1940, Schmid grossly overestimated the strengths of the Luftwaffe and underestimated the RAF. The most serious <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> concerning radar, airfield identification, and production sites. Schmid asserted that the number of operational airfields in southern England were severely limited; estimated that the British could produce only 180–330 fighters per month (the true figure was 496) and that figure would decrease, indicating that the RAF could not sustain a long battle of attrition. Schmid also claimed the command at all levels was rigid and inflexible, with fighters being tied to home bases. In his list of omissions, Schmid failed to mention the RAF maintenance and organisation operations, which put back damaged aircraft with rapid effect. He anticipated a short battle. Crucially, Schmid failed to mention radar at all.|$|E
500|$|The next day, {{there was}} a small {{demonstration}} in front of Portland mayor Ted Wheeler's house to protest the arrests. The group protesting outside Wheeler's home had obtained a permit for the demonstration, however, the organizer, Gregory McKelvey, also said that the mayor is [...] "perpetuating this idea we only get hurt or sprayed or physically beat because we don't have a permit". Wheeler later issued a statement in which he said that <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by the police during the event. He also said, [...] "Yesterday we saw images of a woman in her sixties injured during an arrest. That isn't good for democracy either." [...] The ACLU condemned the actions of Portland police and asked that the force [...] "end the violence against protesters. Stop the unnecessary use of crowd control weapons. Stop sending officers in riot gear to peaceful protests. Stop arresting organizers." [...] Following the arrests of the protesters and their treatment by police, Wheeler, Police Chief Mike Marshman, and the ACLU held discussions about tactics and policies relating to crowd control by the police.|$|E
500|$|The MCIB {{released}} {{their full}} report on 11 February 2015. The {{report found that}} {{the main cause of}} the incident was that the ship had not been operated safely in compliance with international conventions, and that the direct cause of the ship's grounding was due to engine failure as a result of fresh water contamination of the engine's fuel, which occurred by human error when the water was taken on board in Brighton on 12 July 2013. It found a [...] "catalogue of failures and breaches of international regulations", including unsafe route planning that was influenced by photo opportunities rather than following the safest route, and it recommended that the master of the ship should always have authority to override courses during promotional activities {{to ensure the safety of}} the ship and its crew and passengers. It found that the SOLAS Conventions had been breached, and that the ship had not been certified as a passenger ship for either EU or international voyages, that the crew were not appropriately certified, and that the ship should not have been at sea. The liferafts were three months overdue of inspection, the Certificate of Seaworthiness was invalid, and the master's Certificate of Competency had expired a month before the accident. It also noted that <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> with the mayday alert, causing a 10-minute delay in deploying the RNLI and Coast Guard, which could have had a significant impact if the conditions of the incident had been worse. The ship's owners were financially ruined by the incident.|$|E

2500|$|The {{statute of}} {{limitations}} has expired {{on each of these}} charges. The most serious charge considered in 1986 was manslaughter for the death of her brother.

2500|$|Promotion to knight {{may also}} be done for {{defensive}} reasons; to the right is such a case, a 2006 game between Gata Kamsky and Étienne Bacrot.

2500|$|Hollywood, Florida Police Chief Chadwick Wagner said Ottis Toole {{had been}} the prime suspect all along, but went on to admit that {{although}} Toole's case was weak, {{he could have been}} charged during the original investigation. Wagner acknowledged that many <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by the department and apologized to the Walsh family. Public critics of the indictment [...] argue that lack of new (public) evidence, and the inability of the defendant to defend himself of the allegations, leaves no definitive claim to his guilt. To this Wagner has stated: [...] "If you're looking for that magic wand, that one piece of evidence, it's not there." [...] However, by reexamining previously uncorrelated evidence, police and the Walsh family are satisfied with the new report and existing evidence that points only to Ottis Toole.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, former {{chairman}} Richard Parsons hired long-time Washington, D.C. lobbyist Richard F.

While some speculated anonymously that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) {{would have been a}} particular focus of Hohlt's attention, Hohlt said he'd had no contact with the government insurance corporation. Some former regulators found room to criticize Hohlt's involvement with Citigroup, because of his earlier involvement with the financial-services industry during {{the savings and loan crisis}} of the 1980s. Hohlt responded that though <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> in the earlier episode he'd never been investigated by any government agency and his experience gave him reason to be back in the [...] "operating room" [...] as parties address the more recent crisis.|$|E
