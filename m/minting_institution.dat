5000|$|The Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint) is a {{government}} owned institution responsible for producing France's Euro coins. Founded in 864 AD, it is the world's oldest continuously running <b>minting</b> <b>institution</b> operating from two sites, one in Paris and one in Pessac. Administratively speaking, the [...] "Direction of Coins and Medals", the national mint is an administration of the French government charged with issuing coins as well as producing medals and other similar items. Many ancient coins are housed in the collections maintained there. Though in the Middle Ages there were numerous other mints in provincial cities officially issuing legitimate French coinage struck {{in the name of}} the ruler, the Monnaie de Paris has always been the prime issuer.|$|E
50|$|The Free Silver {{movement}} {{arose from}} a synergy of farming and mining interests. Farmers sought to invigorate {{the economy and}} thereby end deflation, which was forcing them to repay loans with increasingly valuable dollars. Mining interests sought the right to turn silver directly into money without a central <b>minting</b> <b>institution.</b> The Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, while falling short of the Free Silver movement's goals, required the U.S. government to buy millions of ounces of silver above what was required by the 1878 Bland-Allison Act (driving {{up the price of}} silver and pleasing silver miners). People attempted to redeem silver notes for gold. Ultimately, the statutory limit for the minimum amount of gold in federal reserves was reached and U.S. notes could no longer be successfully redeemed for gold. Investments {{during the time of the}} panic were heavily financed through bond issues with high interest payments. Rumors regarding the National Cordage Company's financial distress (NCC was the most actively traded stock at the time) caused its lenders to call in their loans immediately, and NCC went into bankruptcy receivership as a result. The company, a rope manufacturer, had tried to corner the market for imported hemp. As demand for silver and silver notes fell, the price and value of silver dropped. Holders worried about a loss of face value of bonds, and many became worthless.|$|E
50|$|He succeeeded {{his father}} Mustafa Bey on 10 October 1837. He had grand ambitions - {{to expand his}} army and create a modern navy; {{to build a new}} royal residence, a <b>mint</b> and modern <b>institutions</b> of {{education}} but neither he nor his brother-in-law the young Mustapha Khaznadar who served as his finance minister, had a clear idea of what such initiatives would cost. As a result, many of his projects became expensive failures which damaged the financial health of the country.|$|R
25|$|In 1728 he {{authorized}} Juan Francisco Sahugún de Arévalo {{to restart}} the newspaper La Gaceta de México, which had been suspended in 1722. In 1730 he directed that all the silversmiths move to a central location, San Francisco Street, now calle de Francisco I. Madero. In 1731 he ordered {{the construction of the}} customshouse, with all its warehouses, and the rebuilding of the <b>mint.</b> The latter <b>institution</b> already was known around the world for the quality of its work. In 1730 the mint produced more than ten million pesos of silver and 151,560 of gold, conforming to rigorous standards of weight and form.|$|R
500|$|The {{embargo and}} {{decrease}} in foreign trade {{led to the}} development of local factories to produce goods no longer available as imports. Manufacturing plants and foundries were built and Philadelphia became an important center of paper-related industries and the leather, shoe, and boot industries. Coal and iron mines, and the construction of new roads, canals, and railroads helped Philadelphia's manufacturing power grow, and the city became the United States' first major industrial city. Major industrial projects included the Waterworks, iron water pipes, a gasworks, and the U.S. Naval Yard. In response to exploitative working conditions, some 20,000 Philadelphia workers staged the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday and an increase in wages. [...] In addition to its industrial power, Philadelphia was the financial center of the country. Along with chartered and private banks, the city was the home of the First and Second Banks of the United States, Mechanics National Bank and the first U.S. <b>Mint.</b> Cultural <b>institutions,</b> such as the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the Athenaeum and the Franklin Institute also developed in the nineteenth century. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed the Free School Law of 1834 to create the public school system.|$|R
50|$|PAMP was {{the first}} refiner {{in the world to}} {{introduce}} a wide variety of decorative designs on the reverse side of its ingots, also known as 'small bars’. Today, the company accounts {{for more than half of}} the world market for gold bullion bars weighing less than 50-grams. The Lady Fortuna (Roman goddess of fortune) design is the first decorative motif to ever decorate precious metals bullion. The company also designs and produces commemorative coins and medals to mark historical or significant events. It produces, under license, proprietary collections for brands such as Sanrio’s ‘Hello Kitty’, Iconic Brand Group’s ‘Peanuts’ and international organizations such as UNESCO. It also supplies coin and medal blanks to leading government <b>mints</b> and banking <b>institutions</b> internationally. PAMP also manufactures minted gold bars that incorporate fashion, pop culture, nature derived motifs on their reverse sides.|$|R
500|$|The {{financial}} {{legacy of}} the Protectorate consisted, apart from crippling Crown debts, of an unprecedentedly debased coinage. On the second day as Lord President of the Council, Dudley began a process to tackle {{the problems of the}} mint. He set up a committee that looked into the peculation by the officers of the <b>mint</b> and other <b>institutions.</b> In 1551 the government at the same time tried to yield profit and restore confidence in the coin by issuing yet further debased coinage and [...] "crying it down" [...] immediately afterwards. The result was panic and confusion and, to get hold of the situation, a coin of 92.3% silver content (against 25% silver content in the last debasement) was issued within months. The bad coin prevailed over the good, however, because people had lost confidence. Northumberland admitted defeat and recruited the financial expert Thomas Gresham. After the first good harvest in four years, by late 1552 the currency was stable, prices for foodstuffs had dropped, and a basis for economic recovery had been laid. A process to centralise the administration of Crown revenue was underway and foreign debt had been eliminated.|$|R
