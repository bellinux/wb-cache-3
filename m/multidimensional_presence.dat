40|$|The novel Hwanghon (Dusk) by leftist writer Han S&# 466;r-ya (1900 - 1976) {{portrays the}} {{dramatic}} transformation {{of a country}} girl into a revolutionary worker in Korea. Another aspect of the drama, one that reflects the context of its different editions, {{is the story of}} the novel's revision. This paper compares the original censored text, published in 1936 as a newspaper serial, and the revised 1955 text, which removed "unsatisfactory" expressions and reflected the North's postliberation politics. Examining the 1936 version, I argue that Han deliberately disrupted the regular serialization schedule by skipping days in order to disguise subversive themes and to confound the censor's memory. The articulation of those scenes, especially the rise of revolutionary workers, is significantly enhanced by Han's uses of space and characters. By setting up contrasts among his characters, and weaving them into spatial confrontations, Han not only evokes socialist themes, but also creates a <b>multidimensional</b> <b>presence</b> for them that frustrates attempts to locate them in a single source. close...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of presence on users {{attitudes and behavior}} is widely reported in the literature. However, we still lack {{a good understanding of}} the effects of system design on the formation of a sense of presence in computer-mediated environments in general and virtual communities in particular. In this research, we address this void. More specifically, we examine the relationship between important system design characteristics and perceived presence. We adopt a <b>multidimensional</b> conceptualization of <b>presence,</b> distinguishing between telepresence and social presence. Deviating from the virtual reality literature, we apply new frameworks for the conceptualization of the main determinants of presence (i. e., interactivity and vividness) that are more relevant to the virtual community context. An empirical study involving 149 members of a virtual community specializing in health issues provided strong support for our model. Vividness and interactivity are found to be significant determinants of both telepresence and social presence. While the role of vividness is more important for social presence, that of interactivity is more important for telepresence. All interactivity dimensions (i. e., active control, communication, and synchronicity) are found to be significant for telepresence. For social presence, however, synchronicity {{does not seem to be}} as important as the other interactivity dimensions. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Family {{violence}} is a complex, <b>multidimensional</b> and pervasive <b>presence</b> in many Aboriginal communities. Although practitioners acknowledge that intimate partner violence (IPV) is a grave concern in the North, as in other jurisdictions in Canada, there is a paucity of literature about IPV and the local response to that violence. Objective. The {{purpose of this study}} is to report on a synthesis of Northern Territorial literature and a 3 -year media watch conducted in the Canadian territories. Design. This review is part of a multidisciplinary 5 -year study occurring in the Northwest Territories (NT) and northern regions of the Prairie Provinces of Canada. The methods included a review of the literature through CINAHL, PubMed, Academic Search Complete, Social Sciences Index and JSTOR (1990 &#x 2013; 2012) combined with a media watch from 2009 to 2012. A thematic content analysis was completed. Results. Themes included: colonization; alcohol and substance use; effects of residential schooling; housing inadequacies; help-seeking behaviours; and gaps within the justice system. Identified themes from the media watch were: murders from IPV; reported assaults and criminal charges; emergency protection orders; and awareness campaigns and prevention measures. Conclusion. When synthesized, the results of the literature review and media surveillance depict a starting context and description of IPV in the Canadian territories. There are many questions left unanswered which build support for the necessity of the current research, outline the public outcry for action in local media and identify the current published knowledge about IPV...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of vector fields {{on the origin}} of a classical space in quantum cosmologies and on the possible compactification process in multidimensional gravity is investigated. It is shown that all general features of the transition between classical and quantum regimes of the evolution can be obtained within the simplest Bianchi-I model for arbitrary number of dimensions. It is shown that the classical space appears when the horizon size reaches the smallest of characteristic scales (the characteristic scale of inhomogeneity or the scale associated with vector fields). In <b>multidimensional</b> case the <b>presence</b> of vector fields completely removes the initial stage of the compactification process which takes place in the case of vacuum models [1]. One of the most important problems of quantum cosmology is an adequate description of the origin of the classical background space. Indeed, the transition from the pure quantum regime to the quasiclassical one forms initial properties of the early Universe and, therefore, defines whether subsequent stages contain an inflationary period and which kind of the initial quantum state should be chosen for its realization [2]. In vacuum inhomogeneous models the origin of a classical background space was first investigated in Ref. [3]. It was found that the background metric belongs to the class of quasi-isotropic spaces and the moment of origin of the classical space corresponds to the moment of time when the horizon size matches the scale of inhomogeneity of the space. However, the complete investigation of the problem requires to study the {{influence of}} different matter sources and also to reserve the possibility of that our Universe has extra dimensions, as predicted by a number of unified theories [4]. In the last case the transition between quantum and classical regimes should include the so-called compactification stage [5]. And indeed, as it was shown in Refs. [1] the quantum evolution of inhomogeneous models in dimensions less or equal than ten include...|$|R
40|$|Most principal-agent {{relationships}} in firms are <b>multidimensional.</b> In the <b>presence</b> of multiple tasks and multiple performance signals, the contract between {{principal and agent}} not only has to motivate the agent, but also has to direct the agent to allocate effort among different tasks. The value of efforts for a specific task accrues not only through the principal's expected returns, but also through its contribution to overall risk, and therefore to the risk diversification of the task portfolio. Hence, if the agent is risk-averse, multitask relationships {{can be considered as}} a portfolio problem coupled with incentive constraints. We examine the relationship between specific control (SC) and general control (GC) for multitask principal-agent problems. Under SC, the principal observes the outcome of each individual task and uses this set of information for compensation. Under GC, contracts are based only on the aggregate signal, such as cumulative profits of all tasks. We describe two sets of multitask problems for which GC and SC are equivalent. That is, contracts based only on aggregate performance signals impose the same incentives for the agent as a contract that is based on the outcome of each task. The first multitask problem is characterized by homogeneous tasks. In the second multitask problem, all activities are perfect substitutes in the cost function of the agent. The equivalence of SC and GC arises since GC provides insurance to the agent and yields the same overall risk premium as specific control. Moreover, GC allows the principal to set the same incentives as SC, since the marginal returns from GC are equal to the sum of the marginal returns for each task under SC. The results described in this paper can serve as benchmarks where GC and SC are equivalent. We show how the equivalence can be relevant for a variety of business situations, such as the compensation of sales persons or managers at all hierarchy levels. We also discuss the reasons when GC and SC differ. Suppose, for instance, that tasks are technologically separable and the precision of the performance of one task is low. Then, the principal is forced under GC to adopt an incentive scheme that implements only a low effort across all tasks since the average precision matters. Under SC, however, the principal can tailor the optimal efforts to each task.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Dissertation geht es um die Dokumentation, theoretische Begründung und Auswertung des in 25 Jahren Praxis entwickelten Curriculums der Bewusstseinsschulung und -weitung der Orgodynamik. Dabei geht es insbesondere um den Vergleich und die forschungsorientierte Verknüpfung verschiedener Traditionen der Bewusstseinsbildung, der ihnen zugrunde liegenden Konzepte und anthropologischen Dimensionen im Schnittfeld pädagogischer, psychologischer und spiritueller Perspektiven. In Anlehnung an das von Fuhr/Dauber (2002) entwickelte Modell, der Praxisentwicklungsforschung, welche die Verflechtung von Theorie und Praxis ansteuert, wird der orgodynamische Ansatz wissenschaftlich dokumentiert und theoretisch begründet. Über eine induktive Vorgehensweise werden die historischen Wurzeln konzeptionell dargelegt, die verborgenen Paradigmen herausgearbeitet, sowie das Curriculum erläutert und ausgewertet. In einem ersten theorieorientierten Kapitel wird das orgodynamische Methodenspektrum in seinem Grundmodell und den vier zentralen Dimensionen (mentale, körperliche, {{emotional}}e, energetische Dimension) aufgezeigt und mit theoretischen Hintergrundkonzepten verglichen und verknüpft. Die vier sich überlappenden Methodengruppen der mental, körperlich, emotional und energetisch orientierten Bewusstseinsarbeit werden differenziert dargestellt und in ihrer Beziehung zueinander diskutiert. Anhand eines Modells (Methodenrad) wird die multi-dimensionale Perspektive des Methodenspektrums, in einer nichthierarchischen Zuordnung sichtbar. Im zweiten theorieorientierten Hauptteil werden zunächst die zentralen vier Paradigmen der Orgodynamik (Präsenz, Multidimensionalität, Flow/Fließendes Gewahrsein, Bezogenheit) vorgestellt, theoretisch und praxisbezogen entfaltet und in einer Paradigmen-Landkarte zueinander in Beziehung gesetzt. Dabei werden die kategorialen Ausführungen durchgehend an Praxisbeispielen veranschaulicht und im Blick auf drei vorgestellte Zugänge zur Bewusstseinsweitung (Immersion, Integration und Dekonstruktion) exemplarisch didaktisch kommentiert. Im dritten Hauptteil wird das Curriculum im Zusammenhang mit einer Auswertungsmatrix erläutert. Diese dient als Überprüfungsinstrument. Mit ihrer Hilfe werden die verschiedenen methodischen Zugangsweisen und Arbeitsformen dieses Ansatzes, exemplarisch anhand von 2 Ausbildungswochen, im Blick der Multidimensionalität dokumentiert. Damit wird diese multidimensional angelegte Praxis exemplarisch bis in methodische Details nachvollziehbar und in dialogisch-selbstreflexiver Form überprüfbar. Exemplarisch werden in einem Exkurs erste Itemvorschläge gemacht, welche die wissenschaftliche Anschlussfähigkeit an neuere Forschung im transpersonalen Bereich aufzeigen. Das innere Anliegen der vorliegenden Arbeit zeigt in der Verschränkung von Theorie und Praxis, dass die Paradigmen der Orgodynamik, Präsenz, Multidimensionalität, fließendes Gewahrsein und bewusste Bezogenheit vier pädagogisch umgesetzte Paradigmen für eine Bewusstseinserforschung in der Erwachsenenbildung sind. Stichworte: Multidimensional, Bewusstseinserforschung, Bewusstseinsweite, Präsenz, bewusste Bezogenheit, Flow/Fließendes Gewahrsein, das „Größere“, Immersion, Integration, Dekonstruktion, pädagogische Paradigmen, Erwachsenenbildung, Multidimensionales Methodenspektrum, Orgodynamik, Körpertherapie. [...] -The {{subject of}} this thesis is a documentation, theoretical elucidation and evaluation of a curriculum of Consciousness-training and expansion, that has been developed in 25 years of practical experience. This thesis focuses specifically on the comparison and the research-oriented interlinking of various traditions of Consciousness-expansion, its underlying concepts and anthropological dimensions {{at the intersection of}} educational, psychological and spiritual perspectives. Leaning on the practice-development-research-model, as it was developed by Fuhr/Dauber (2002), which aims at the intercon-nection of theory and practice, the orgodynamic approach is scientifically documented and theoreti-cally founded. By means of an inductive way of proceeding, the historical roots are conceptually ex-pounded and the hidden paradigms made transparent, moreover, the curriculum is described and evaluated. In a first chapter, which is theory-oriented, the orgodynamic spectrum of the methods that are used, is described in its basic model and {{in the use of the}} four central dimensions (mental, bodily, emotional and energetic dimension). It is compared and linked with theoretical background-concepts. The four overlapping sets of methods of this mental, bodily, emotional and energetic Consciousness-work are presented and differentiated, and it is discussed how they are interrelated. Using a model, called the “method-wheel”, the multidimensional perspective of this spectrum of method is made transparent in its non-hierarchical structure. In the second theory-oriented main part of this thesis the four central paradigms of the orgodynamic approach (presence, multidimensionality, flow/flowing awareness, relatedness) are presented, and unfolded on the theoretical and practical level. In a map of paradigms it is elucidated how they are interrelated. Proceeding in this way, the explanations of the categories that are being used are illustrated by examples of orgodynamic work-practices. In view of the basic three accesses to the expansion of consciousness, immersion, integration and deconstruction, they are commented on by means of exam-ples. These examples are examined from the view-point of teaching skills. In the third main part of this thesis, the curriculum is explained in the context of a specific matrix of evaluation. This matrix is serving here as an instrument of scrutiny. With its use, the various methodical pathways and ways of orgodynmic work are documented by the example of 2 weeks of orgodynamic training, using the multidimensional view. In this way, the multidimensional- oriented form of practice can be traced down to its methodical de-tails and can be evaluated in a self-reflexive and dialogue-oriented way. In an additional chapter, the first proposition for the use of items are made by using examples. They show how the capacity for a linkage to scientific research in the transpersonal field can be estab-lished. The inner concern of this thesis shows, in interconnecting theory and practice, that the paradigms of Orgodynamics (presence, multidimensionality, flowing awareness, and conscious relatedness) are four educational paradigms that can actually be put into practice in adult-education in the field of con-sciousness-exploration.
