5|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{people with}} low levels of education living in poorer areas are most at risk for elevated lead. In the US, the groups most at risk for lead exposure are the impoverished, city-dwellers, and immigrants. African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia queens are brachypterous, {{meaning that}} they have stubby {{rudimentary}} wings that render them flightless. This may correlate with population structure, possibly as an adaptation in small populated colonies or by unusual ecological requirements. The alates <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> emerge in late summer and early autumn (March or April), and colony-founding queens excavate to considerable depths underground; queens start to lay eggs by spring. Queens are univoltine and only produce a single generation of ants annually, and eggs may take 12 months to fully develop. When a colony is mature, only 50 to 100 individuals are present in each nest. In some colonies, colony founding can occur within a colony itself when a queen dies, taken over by one of her daughters. This method of colony founding may render a nest immortal.|$|E
5|$|The male becomes broody {{after his}} mate starts laying, and <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{incubate}} the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, {{he does not}} eat, drink, or defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he does about ten times a day. He develops a brood patch, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over {{the course of the}} eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as the superb fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{scholars}} {{warn that}} {{the implementation of the}} Force Intervention Brigade under the larger MONUSCO mandate may be blurring the line between peace enforcement and peacekeeping. As a result, rebel groups <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> target UN peacekeeping officials as well as humanitarian aid workers, even those who are not involved in the Force Intervention Brigade component of the MONUSCO mission. This may make it increasingly difficult for humanitarian aid to be distributed to civilians.|$|E

25|$|PGP {{can begin}} {{as early as}} the first {{trimester}} of pregnancy. Pain is usually felt low down over the symphyseal joint, and this area may be extremely tender to the touch. Pain may also be felt in the hips, groin and lower abdomen and can radiate down the inner thighs. Women suffering from PGP <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> waddle or shuffle, and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis. PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy, gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses.|$|E
60|$|<b>May</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> repent of her {{determination}} to walk; Lescombe seemed very far off, {{and she had}} an instinct {{that she was an}} awkward fifth wheel.

25|$|According to Governing, Cities and Localities section More commonly, central cities seek ways to tax nonresidents working {{downtown}} – {{known as}} commuter taxes – as property tax bases dwindle. Taken together, {{these two groups}} of taxpayers represent a largely untapped source of potential revenue that cities <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> target more aggressively, particularly if they're struggling. According to struggling cities, this will help bring in a substantial revenue for the city {{which is a great}} way to tax the people who make the most use of the highways and repairs.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the goals}} from phase I will be {{continued}} to the following phases until they have been reached. Some of these goals are reducing pain, swelling, and increasing the knee’s range of motion is still crucial during this phase. Physical therapist <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> incorporate core exercises as well as light weight exercises to strengthen the surrounding muscles and hips. Some examples of these exercises include the usage of resistance/stretch bands, stationary biking, and elliptical. During this phase the patient may begin performing more strenuous exercises such as half-squatting and partial lunges.|$|E
25|$|Two seam bowlers {{are usually}} {{expected}} to bowl in tandem {{for the first}} 10 or so overs, after which time the ball <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> swing and {{one or both of}} them is substituted for a swing bowler or a spin bowler. This is why most sides opt to include at least two seam bowlers who are known as opening bowlers. Seam bowling usually becomes very ineffective with older balls and is virtually useless after 60 overs or so and as a result the bowling places in the side are filled with swing or spin bowlers.|$|E

25|$|Glaucoma is a {{group of}} eye {{diseases}} which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.|$|E
25|$|MPS I H (also called Hurler {{syndrome}} or α-L-iduronidase deficiency), is {{the most}} severe of the MPS I subtypes. Developmental delay is evident {{by the end of}} the first year, and patients usually stop developing between ages 2 and 4. This is followed by progressive mental decline and loss of physical skills. Language may be limited due to hearing loss and an enlarged tongue. In time, the clear layers of the cornea become clouded and retinas <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> degenerate. Carpal tunnel syndrome (or similar compression of nerves elsewhere in the body) and restricted joint movement are common.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone <b>may</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E
