25|$|In August 1912, the President of Nicaragua, Adolfo Díaz, {{requested}} {{the resignation of}} the Secretary of War, General Luis Mena, concerned that Díaz was leading an insurrection, fled Managua with his brother, the Chief of Police of Managua, and the insurrection escalated. When the U.S. Legation asked President Adolfo Díaz {{to ensure the safety of}} American citizens and property during the insurrection, Díaz replied that he could not and that... In consequence <b>my</b> <b>Government</b> desires that the Government of the United States guarantee with its forces security for the property of American Citizens in Nicaragua and that it extend its protection to all the inhabitants of the Republic.United States Marines were stationed in Nicaragua from 1912 to 1933, except for a nine-month period beginning in 1925. From 1910 to 1926, the conservative party ruled Nicaragua. The Chamorro family, which had long dominated the party, effectively controlled the government during that period. In 1914, the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty was signed, giving the U.S. control over the proposed canal, as well as leases for potential canal defenses.|$|E

25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that <b>my</b> <b>government</b> once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

He believed the attacks were a response from [...] "some vested interest trying to tarnish the secular image of his government". He said at the press conference, [...] "My government is committed to maintaining peace and harmony in the state; law and order has been top priority by <b>my</b> <b>government....</b> Nobody is above law, irrespective of caste and creed the culprits will be punished". The state government ensured that special security was given to important places of worship throughout the state {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and Yeddyurappa set up a corps of detectives to investigate. He promised the Christian community leaders that all churches and shrines vandalised in the districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Chikkamagaluru during the attacks would be restored and paid a visit to all of the areas affected by communal riots and attacks. Some politicians such as former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS) national president H.D. Deve Gowda and M. P. Prakash also visited the Christian institutions in the aftermath. In February 2010, Yeddyurappa allocated 500millions for Christian development projects in Karnataka in his state budget, the first time he had ever done so.|$|E

500|$|Before Frémont, two generals had {{previously}} served {{as head of}} the Department of the West during the first four months of the war. [...] Brigadier General William S. Harney had taken a diplomatic approach in Missouri, attempting to respect Missouri's neutrality through the Price-Harney Truce, negotiated with Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Militia. [...] The truce was unacceptable to many Unionists and particularly to President Lincoln, as continued neutrality in Missouri would result in the state's refusal to supply men for the Union army. [...] Harney was removed on May 30 and replaced with the hard-line Radical Republican Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon. [...] Earlier, while still a subordinate of Harney's, Lyon had raised tensions in Missouri to a fever-pitch by acting independently and capturing a portion of the Missouri State Militia during the Camp Jackson Affair on May 10, 1861. [...] Although the maneuver eliminated a threat to the St. Louis Arsenal, it also caused a riot in St. Louis. [...] As commander of the Department of the West, Lyon met with Gov. Jackson and informed him that, [...] "rather than concede to the State of Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to <b>my</b> <b>government</b> in any matter...I would see you...and every man and woman and child in the State dead and buried." [...] After this, [...] open warfare commenced between pro-Confederate militia and Union forces in Missouri. [...] Gov. Jackson fled St. Louis, and the Missouri State Militia was re-organized to become the Missouri State Guarda pro-secession force under the command of Sterling Price and Governor-in-Exile Jackson.|$|E

India claims that the accession is unconditional and final while Pakistan maintains that the accession is fraudulent.|$|R

Kennedy {{was reported to have}} said [...] "My God! <b>My</b> <b>government's</b> coming apart."

The Coalition senators tried to remain united, as several became increasingly concerned about the tactic of blocking supply. As the crisis dragged into November, Whitlam attempted to make arrangements for public servants and suppliers to be able to cash cheques at banks. These transactions would be temporary loans which the government would repay once supply was restored.|$|R
