5|$|Ramírez had {{difficulty}} with his vision; {{he could not}} see which pitch the catcher was calling for. He was fitted for prescription goggles, which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 final faced {{scheduling}} {{problems and}} the match clashed with top flight League fixtures {{for the first time}} since 1934, which disappointed football traditionalists. The 2011 UEFA Champions League Final was being hosted at Wembley on 28 May 2011 and UEFA rules stipulate that the host stadium for the final <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a fixture played two weeks prior to the final. Therefore, the FA Cup final had to be moved forward, and {{for the first time since}} 1989 was played before the English football domestic season ended.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been much}} earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
5|$|The song {{submitted}} {{into the}} contest cannot have previously been released commercially and must last between 2 minutes 45 seconds and 3 minutes (as of 2013 onwards). The rule stating that performers also <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> previously released music commercially was active from 2003 to 2006. This rule was dropped in 2007 thus allowing already experienced singers and bands in the competition. As a result, NRK chose {{to withdraw from}} the contest.|$|E

5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Leofric survived William the Conqueror's 1068 {{siege of}} Exeter unscathed, {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} he was present in the city during the siege. Whether Leofric had originally supported King Harold against William or if he supported William from the start is unclear. The fact that he survived William's purge of the native English bishops in 1070 is evidence that he <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been too outspoken against William. Leofric remained bishop until he died on 10 February or 11 February 1072. He was buried in the crypt of his cathedral. When the cathedral was rebuilt, his remains were moved to the new church, but the location of the tomb has been lost. The current tomb only dates from 1568 and does not mark Leofric's resting place.|$|E
