500|$|Both legal teams, in {{planning}} their trial strategy, considered {{the implications of}} trying a white man based on the testimony of a black <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South, writes that the defense tried to picture Conley as [...] "a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous." [...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man {{could not have been}} intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E

500|$|When {{military}} activity resumed {{in the winter}} of 1807, Napoleon hoped to overwhelm a Russian rear guard at Hof near Eylau, which was called [...] "Preussisch Eylau" [...] (and is now within the borders of the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast). He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you. And I am so pleased with you that I kiss all your arses." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, a judge {{agreed that}} the [...] "pink room scene', which shows Rihanna {{dominating}} a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> pink and white striped walls, was very similar to LaChapelle's [...] "Striped Face" [...] photograph; the judge pinpointed a scene where Rihanna is seen against a blue background, wearing pink latex and placing a sweet on her tongue." [...] Rihanna and LaChapelle settled the case out of court for an undisclosed sum. After the case, LaChapelle said the lawsuit was [...] "not personal, it's strictly business", and that [...] "musicians commonly pay to sample music or use someone's beats {{and there should be}} no difference when sampling an artist's visuals." [...] In June 2011, German photographer Philipp Paulus sued Rihanna and her record labels, alleging further copyright violations with regard to a scene in the music video where Rihanna wears an expansive dress and is taped to the wall with a plastic sheet in front of her. According to Paulus, Rihanna and Matsoukas appropriated the image from his photographic series Paperworld.|$|E
500|$|Pembleton and Lange grow closer; Lange {{experiences}} {{more pain}} as time passes, and switches among remorse, anger, and casual small talk during their conversations. Later, Pembleton holds Lange's hand {{to comfort him}} and confides about his recent stroke. Bayliss grows suspicious when Biedron says that he cannot recall his last place of work or {{when he moved to}} Baltimore. Biedron eventually admits that he had been criminally charged and placed into a psychiatric ward for pushing a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a Chicago subway train for no reason. Biedron is arrested, and Bayliss confirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton decides not to tell Lange because he does not think that it will comfort him, but Lange figures it out for himself by observing their conversation. Lange experiences greater pain and starts to lose consciousness. After saying [...] "I'm OK" [...] to Pembleton, Lange falls unconscious and the EMTs push the train with the airbags. Lange dies immediately after he is removed. A shocked and disoriented Pembleton leaves the subway and, after staring at Biedron {{in the back of a}} police squad car, walks to his vehicle while recalling a line about how sugar maple leaves behave when it rains (a line that Lange said as he was dying). He then drives away with Bayliss. The episode ends with Flannigan jogging past the subway station.|$|E

He later ordered a small silver cup from a Berlin jeweller to commemorate the victory. The inscription read: [...] "1. Vickers 2. 17.9.16". [...] This was the first of 60 such cups which von Richthofen ordered up until September 1917, at which time the jeweller declined further orders, since production was impossible due to a wartime silver shortage.|$|E
