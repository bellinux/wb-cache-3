40|$|Abstract — Network coding {{refers to}} the {{capability}} of coding incoming information flows before transmitting to other nodes in the network, beyond the traditional capabilities of message forwarding and replication on a network node. It has been envisioned that network coding is best applied to overlay networks, in which network nodes are computers {{at the edge of}} the Internet and are sufficiently capable and flexible to perform coding operations. There exist a wide range of theoretical studies on the benefits of network coding, especially with respect to throughput improvements in the multicast case. However, there has been very little published work on the empirical analysis regarding the benefits and drawbacks of network coding in realistic overlay networks. Towards this objective, we have designed and implemented RapidFlow, a complete and easy-to-use experimental testbed for studying information flows with network coding. In RapidFlow, each node is equipped with a high-performance overlay <b>message</b> <b>switch</b> and a randomized network coding mechanism. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of RapidFlow in an emulated overlay network running on a cluster of workstations, as well as our initial experimental observations with respect to the performance of coded information flows.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of computing machines, there has been continual advances in computer and communication technologies and approaching limits. The user interface has evolved from a row of switches, character based interface using teletype terminals and then video terminals, to present day graphical user interface. It is expected that next significant advances {{will come in the}} availability of services, such as electronic mail and directory services, as the standards for applications are developed and in the 'easy to use' interfaces, such as Graphical User Interface for example Window and X Window, which are being standardized. Various proprietary electronic mail (email) systems are in use within organizations at each center of NASA. Each system provides email services to users within an organization, however the support for email services across organizations and across centers exists at centers to a varying degree and is often easy to use. A recent NASA email initiative is intended 'to provide a simple way to send email across organizational boundaries without disruption of installed base. ' The initiative calls for integration of existing organizational email systems through gateways connected by a <b>message</b> <b>switch,</b> supporting X. 400 and SMTP protocols, to create a NASA wide email system and for implementation of NASA wide email directory services based on OSI standard X. 500. A brief overview of MSFC efforts as a part of this initiative are described. Window based graphical user interfaces make computers easy to use. X window protocol has been developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984 / 1985 to provide uniform window based interface in a distributed computing environment with heterogenous computers. It has since become a standard supported by a number of major manufacturers. Z Windows systems, terminals and workstations, and X Window applications are becoming available. However impact of its use in the Local Area Network environment on the network traffic are not well understood. It is expected that the use of X Windows systems will increase at MSFC especially for Unix based systems. An overview of X Window protocol is presented {{and its impact on the}} network traffic is examined. It is proposed that an analytical model of X Window systems in the network environment be developed and validated through the use of measurements to generate application and user profiles...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{switching}} technique called virtual cut-through is proposed and its performance is analyzed. This switching system {{is very similar}} to <b>message</b> <b>switching,</b> with the difference that when a message arrives in an intermediate node and its selected outgoing channel is free (just after the reception of the header), then, in contrast o <b>message</b> <b>switching,</b> the <b>message</b> is sent out to the adjacent node towards its destination before it is received completely at the node; only if the message isblocked due to a busy output channel is a message buffered in an intermediate node. Therefore, the delay due to unnecessary buffering in front of an idle channel is avoided. We analyze and compare the performance of this new switching technique with that of mes-sage switching with respect to three measures: network delay, traffic gain and buffer storage requirement. Our analysis hows that cut-through switching is superior (and at worst identical) to <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> with respect o the above three performance measures...|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> was the {{precursor}} of packet <b>switching,</b> where <b>messages</b> were routed in their entirety, one hop at a time. It was first built by Collins Radio Company, Newport Beach, California, {{during the period}} 1959-1963 for sale to large airlines, banks and railroads. <b>Message</b> <b>switching</b> systems are nowadays mostly implemented over packet-switched or circuit-switched data networks. Each message is treated as a separate entity. Each message contains addressing information, and at each switch this information is read and the transfer path to the next switch is decided. Depending on network conditions, a conversation of several messages may not be transferred over the same path. Each message is stored (usually on hard drive due to RAM limitations) before being transmitted to the next switch. Because of this it {{is also known as}} a 'store-and-forward' network. Email is a common application for <b>message</b> <b>switching.</b> A delay in delivering email is allowed, unlike real-time data transfer between two computers.|$|R
