25|$|In 2008, morale was low at the {{beginning}} of the SuperSonics season as talks with the City of Seattle for a new arena had broken down. The Sonics had gotten a franchise player with second overall pick in the NBA draft with Durant. However, with the Allen trade the Sonics did not have <b>much</b> <b>talent</b> to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under coach P. J. Carlesimo on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle SuperSonics posted a franchise worst record of 20-62. It would end up being the final season in Seattle as Bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city.|$|E
25|$|The Wings {{were quickly}} {{selected}} as favorites {{to win the}} Stanley Cup and they were right. With so <b>much</b> <b>talent</b> on one team, including the first time three 500-goal scorers {{were on the same}} team, they quickly got off to a great start, winning 22 of their first 27 games. After finishing with 116 points and {{the best record in the}} NHL (by 15 points), the Wings had earned the first seed in the Western Conference and met the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. After the Canucks took the first 2 games, it looked like the Canucks were going to sweep the Red Wings and the Red Wings were going to have their 2nd straight early exit. Their Captain, Steve Yzerman gave a closed-door speech to the team. Only the players in the locker room knew what was said, but the Wings headed to Vancouver and won four straight games to take the series.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{announcement}} that Russell Domingo would not be retained as head coach of South Africa, Gibson accepted a deal in August 2017 {{to take charge of}} the Proteas until the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. He was well-acquainted with the country and its cricket culture, having played for three sides in the Currie Cup during the 1990s, and inherited a team with <b>much</b> <b>talent</b> and promise but also faced with unique challenges, such as government-mandated racial transformation targets and a number of top players leaving for lucrative Kolpak contracts with English counties that rendered them out of the national team picture. In his first series against Bangladesh, Gibson's sides swept all three portions (two Tests, three ODIs, and two Twenty20 matches) with ease, including a record-setting ODI where Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock combined to chase a total of 281 without losing a wicket and David Miller scoring the fastest century in a T20 international, reaching 100 off just 35 balls. Other highlights included a maiden Test century for highly-regarded youngster Aiden Markram, AB de Villiers' highest ODI score of 176, and Kagiso Rabada's 100th Test wicket.|$|E

500|$|The Expansion draft day on June 18, 1992, was memorable. The team's laptop {{computer}} failed {{and the club}} was unprepared with a backup plan, picking several ineligible players. Not <b>much</b> <b>talent</b> was available as other teams protected young prospects. The players the Senators did select were [...] "journeymen NHLers or players who had good years in minor leagues but no longer were considered prospects." [...] While side-deals during the Draft were not allowed, the team would select players {{in concert with the}} other teams and in return, other teams gave the Senators Neil Brady, Jody Hull, Brad Marsh and Steve Weeks during the summer, all who would ultimately make the team. In the Entry Draft, the Senators would name Alexei Yashin their first-ever pick, though he would not join the team until 1993.|$|E
500|$|During {{his final}} season with Juventus, Pogba was {{deployed}} {{in a more}} advanced and creative midfield role rather than in his usual box-to-box role, which saw him gain {{more time on the}} ball, and he excelled as the team's main playmaker, due to his vision, and passing range; his performances in this role saw him develop from a promising youngster into one of the best and most complete midfielders in the world. Upon Pogba's departure from Juventus in 2016, his former teammate Gianluigi Buffon compared him to French former playmakers Michel Platini and Zinedine Zidane, and also praised his ability, leadership, work-rate and attitude, both on the pitch and in training, stating that he [...] "..is a tremendous warrior on the pitch but also has so <b>much</b> <b>talent.</b> His control of the ball and the way he can swiftly change the play from defence to attack is special." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Schwimmer {{made his}} Off-Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The {{production}} won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times, which wrote: [...] "Based on Fault Lines... we can't really tell whether Schwimmer has <b>much</b> <b>talent</b> as a director. We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows {{a thing or}} two about freewheeling banter... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E

500|$|Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough {{said that}} Sellers [...] "had the genius {{comparable}} to Chaplin", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as [...] "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts {{he gave to}} the world. For them, he is assured of {{a place in the}} history of art as entertainment." [...] Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that [...] "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything". Director Blake Edwards thought that [...] "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said [...] "I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so <b>much</b> <b>talent,</b> it just oozed out of him"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, [...] "Anything to avoid paying for dinner". Secombe later declared to journalists [...] "Bluebottle is deaded now". Milligan later said that [...] "it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time." [...] The Daily Mail described Sellers as [...] "the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness", a [...] "flawed genius" [...] who, once he latched on to a comic idea, [...] "loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes".|$|E
500|$|On 3 June 1797 Bonaparte {{notified}} the French government {{that he was}} sending Sérurier with 22 captured colors. He wrote that he, [...] "has {{in the last two}} campaigns displayed as <b>much</b> <b>talent</b> as bravery and patriotism ... General Sérurier is extremely severe with himself: he is sometimes so with others. A strict friend of discipline, and of the order and virtues most necessary to the maintenance of society, he disdains intrigue and intriguers, which has sometimes made him enemies amongst those men who are always ready to accuse of unpatriotism any one who wishes to see them submitted to their superiors". He was received in Paris by a large audience of government officials on 28 June who he assured of his loyalty and that of his soldiers. He was back with his division on 9 August and missed the Coup of 18 Fructidor. A little later Louis Desaix described him, [...] "tall, 55 years old ... honest, estimable in every respect, considered to be an aristocrat but supported by General Bonaparte, who values and admires him". Venice was occupied by French troops but by the recent treaty was to be handed over to Austria. Bonaparte ordered Sérurier to carry out the unpleasant job of removing all military stores and ships as well as all works of art. Over the objection of the Austrians and the inhabitants, the city was thoroughly plundered. Although he was the target of anger and abuse, Sérurier did not personally benefit from the looting and did his best to prevent others from doing so. He confiscated the salt and biscuits in the Venice arsenal but that was to raise money to pay his soldiers. In the same army, Masséna and Augereau were notorious for looting for personal gain, and many lesser officers also did it. Sérurier earned such a reputation for honesty that his soldiers called him the [...] "Virgin of Italy".|$|E

In 1938, Woolf wrote of the term in Three Guineas, [...] "an old word ... that has much harm in its day and is now obsolete". When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as [...] "a feminist", Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment [...] "I myself {{have never been able to}} find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute."
