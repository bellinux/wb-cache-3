5|$|At about 2:00p.m., the American <b>military</b> <b>authorities,</b> who {{had arrived}} in the city, ordered that the bodies be taken down and {{delivered}} to the city morgue for autopsies to be carried out. A US army cameraman took photographs of the bodies for publication, including one with Mussolini and Petacci positioned in a macabre pose as though they were arm-in-arm.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his term}} in Congress, Wickliffe was thrown from a {{carriage}} and permanently crippled. Despite his injury, he remained politically active. In 1863, he ran for governor as a Peace Democrat on an anti-Lincoln platform. <b>Military</b> <b>authorities</b> considered him subversive, however, and interfered with the election; Wickliffe lost to Thomas E. Bramlette in a landslide.|$|E

5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> were unaware of it. Both Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E
5|$|For a {{long time}} Tronstad had wanted to return to Norway to {{organize}} resistance work, however he was prevented by the Norwegian <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> in Britain. In 1944, however, he did travel to Norway, to organize Operation Sunshine, for the defence of Norwegian infrastructure. After five months in the country, {{he was killed in}} action after his team had taken the local bailiff hostage.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting began local magistrates called on the <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> to arrest Hunt and several others on the hustings with him, and to {{disperse}} the crowd. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15people were killed and 400–700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in an ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years earlier.|$|E

At the time, the <b>military</b> <b>authority</b> in Lotharingia was assigned to Count Reginar I of Hainaut (died 915), but at his death it fell to Wigeric, who became count palatine, exercising as such the <b>military</b> <b>authority</b> in Lotharingia.|$|R

5|$|The {{widespread}} anxieties and consternation over government inactivity {{throughout the}} crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing {{a handful of}} children. In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> alike), the desire to do (and be seen to do) something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell {{the public about the}} danger involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> but not turned over to Sagane until a month later. In 1949, {{one of the authors of}} the letter, Luis Alvarez, met with Sagane and signed the document.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E

5|$|An ′iṣābā from Jableh led by Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam also formed {{part of the}} revolt. The French <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> {{considered}} al-Qassam's group, which relocated {{its headquarters}} to the Jabal Sahyun village of Zanqufa from Jableh in early 1920, {{to be a part}} of al-Bitar's unit, but the two commanders operated in different sectors. Al-Bitar's unit had been active in Jabal Sahyun since early 1919 soon after French forces landed in Latakia. Al-Qassam left Syria to British-held Palestine sometime after the Battle of Maysalun to avoid capture by the French who issued a warrant for his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Both {{civilian}} and <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> considered the Wehrmachtbericht to be a vital instrument of German home-front mobilisation, the civilian {{contribution to the}} German war effort, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. According to historians Wolfram Wette and Daniel Uziel, the final 9 May 1945 communiqué {{laid the foundation for}} the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion that the Wehrmacht had fought honourably and was not implicated in the crimes of the Nazi regime, for which (according to the myth) only the SS bore responsibility.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to the North Vietnamese <b>military</b> <b>authorities.</b> The South Vietnamese military in Huế also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Deir al-Balah's first village {{council was}} {{established}} in 1946 and an elected local government continued to administer the city until 1982 when the Israeli <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> dissolved the council and appointed a mayor. In 1994 Deir al-Balah gained {{the status of a}} city by the Palestinian Authority (PNA). The Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, appointed Samir Mohammed Azayiza as mayor until 2000 when he replaced him with Sami Abu Salim, a wealthy businessman from the city. The services and functions of the municipality include city planning, infrastructure maintenance and repair, providing utilities, school administration and garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of the First World War Beach Thomas defied <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> to report news stories from the Western Front for his employer, the Daily Mail. As a result, he was briefly imprisoned before being granted {{official}} accreditation as a war correspondent. His reportage for the remainder of the war received national recognition, despite being criticised by some and parodied by soldiers. His book With the British on the Somme (1917) portrayed the English soldier in a very favourable light. Both France and Britain rewarded him with knighthoods after the war, but Beach Thomas regretted some of his wartime output.|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> in the case of a siege.|$|E

5|$|In late 1939, he {{was accused}} by French <b>{{military}}</b> <b>authorities</b> of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Citadel of Damascus. While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment {{marked the beginning of}} a new life wherein the Quran becomes a major concern for the next several years. He was released in November 1944. After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for Turkey, mostly staying in Bursa until the end of 1945.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian Arab irregulars led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and {{his local}} commander, Abd al-Halim Jawlani, battled British Army forces in Bani Na'im in December 1938. According to British {{military}} accounts, {{a resident of}} Bani Na'im called for intervention when the rebels entered the town. Israeli scholar Hillel Cohen wrote that Fakhri Nashashibi, a political rival of al-Husayni, informed <b>military</b> <b>authorities</b> on three rebel units forcing Bani Na'im's largely pro-Nashashibi inhabitants to join the revolt. The British promptly confronted a force of 100 irregulars. With British Air Force assistance, al-Husayni's troops dispersed and fled east of Bani Na'im where they were pinned down. British forces killed 60 rebels and captured 15. One British soldier was killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{economical}} situation Tubas {{during the}} 199399 period was prosperous, however {{since the start}} of the Second Intifada in 200001, Tubas' income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS, receding to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or <b>military</b> <b>authorities.</b> According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.|$|E
50|$|MARSA {{procedures}} are used when military aircraft must operate {{in close proximity}} and with close coordination. Under such conditions, it may be impractical for standard civilian air traffic controllers to ensure safe separation of the aircraft. MARSA procedures delegate the separation responsibility temporarily to the <b>military</b> <b>authority</b> operating the flights, thereby relieving ATC of the separation workload. When operations in close proximity have concluded, the designated <b>military</b> <b>authority</b> relinquishes responsibility back to ATC, and normal ATC procedures resume.|$|R
