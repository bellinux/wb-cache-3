40|$|Abstract: Detailed {{knowledge}} of the wind resource is necessary in the developmental and operational stages of a wind farm site. As wind turbines continue to grow in size, masts for <b>mounting</b> <b>cup</b> anemometers—the accepted standard for resource assessment—have necessarily become much taller, and much more expensive. This limitation has driven the commercialization of two remote sensing (RS) tools for the wind energy industry: The LIDAR and the SODAR, Doppler effect instruments using light and sound, respectively. They are ground-based and can work over hundreds of meters, sufficient for the tallest turbines in, or planned for, production. This study compares wind measurements from two commercial RS instruments against an instrumented mast, in upland (semi-complex) terrain typical of where many wind farms are now being installed worldwide. With appropriate filtering, regression analyses suggest a good correlation between the RS instruments and mast instruments: The RS instruments generally recorded lower wind speeds than the cup anemometers, with the LIDAR more accurate and the SODAR more precise...|$|E

40|$|Acetabulum cups are the {{counterparts}} of endoprostheses, {{which are}} {{mounted in the}} pelvis. There are different designs of such cups. They differ in their form {{and in the way}} of mounting. This paper deals with the threaded acetabulum cups with conical shape mounted in the pelvis. In general, one has to distinguish between stresses caused by the mounting process and lifetime stresses of the <b>mounted</b> <b>cup.</b> Stresses remaining of the mounting must ensure the so-called primary stability; however, they will disappear to some degree due to rheological properties of bone. The question arises whether the mounting stresses are responsible for local plastic deformations and the corresponding residual stresses or not. In this paper, mostly loading stresses and their dependence on the contact properties between pelvis and cup or between cup and polyurethane inlay are considered.

40|$|A {{case study}} {{concerning}} validation of wind speed measurements {{made by a}} laser wind sensor mounted on a 190 square foot floating platform in Muskegon Lake through comparison with measurements made by pre-existing <b>cup</b> anemometers <b>mounted</b> on a met tower on the shore line is presented. The comparison strategy {{is to examine the}} difference in measurements over time using the paired-t statistical method to identify intervals when the measurements were equivalent and to provide explanatory information for the intervals when the measurements were not equivalent. The data was partitioned into three sets: not windy (average wind speed measured by the cup anemometers ≤ 6. 7 m/s) windy but no enhanced turbulence (average wind speed measured by the cup anemometers 3 ̆e 6. 7 m/s), and windy with enhanced turbulence associated with storm periods. For the not windy data set, the difference in the average wind speeds was equal in absolute value to the precision of the gages and not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained for the windy with no enhanced turbulence data set and the average difference was not statistically significant (α= 0. 01). The windy with enhanced turbulence data set showed significant differences between the buoy mounted laser wind sensor and the on-shore mast <b>mounted</b> <b>cup</b> anemometers. The sign of the average difference depended on the direction of the winds. Overall, validation evidence is obtained in the absence of enhanced turbulence. In addition, differences in wind speed during enhanced turbulence were isolated in time, studied and explained...|$|R

50|$|This richly <b>mounted</b> 'Grace' <b>Cup</b> {{would have}} been passed {{around the dinner table}} after prayers had been said. It is a {{survivor}} from the English Tudor Court. The ivory bowl is said to have belonged to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in his cathedral in 1170. Such relics of England's favourite saint were treasured until the English Reformation. When the gilded silver mounts were commissioned in 1525, the engraver was instructed to incorporate the initials of TB and a mitre on the cover. These alternate with the pomegranate badge of Catherine of Aragon. The cup was said to have been bequeathed to the queen by Sir Edward Howard (d. 1513), High Admiral to Henry VIII. The vital role played by prints in the dissemination of Renaissance styles to Northern Europe is revealed in some of the ornamentation on the cup which, like Henry VIII's writing desk, derives from the work of Hans Burgkmair. The cast marks and sheaves taken from an engraving by the artist are the earliest example of Renaissance influence in English goldsmiths' work. After Catherine of Aragon's death in 1536 the cup was returned to the Howard family, who were renowned both as devout Roman Catholics and as art collectors. It descended through successive generations of the family until it was bought by the Museum in 1931.|$|R
