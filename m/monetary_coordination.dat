The results show, as expected, that coordination is always useful to deal with <b>monetary</b> shocks. But <b>coordination</b> {{is not always the}} best response against real shocks, since the cooperative solution may be counterproductive when aggregate supply is relatively rigid. Finally, the benefits of coordination become evident under supply shocks, because cooperation minimizes the cost of applying an inappropriate economic policy.

The possible gains in terms of well-being associated with policy coordination are explored, {{in order to make a}} rational evaluation of the proposals calling for greater <b>monetary</b> <b>coordination.</b> An analysis is made of the problem of selecting the nominal anchor most suitable for serving as the basis for cooperative agreements, in an economy affected by real and monetary upsets. In view of the structural differences that exist among the economies that make up MERCOSUR, it is concluded that a flexible form of macroeconomic coordination is needed in the context of this regional bloc. Special attention is given, in the context of a centre-periphery <b>monetary</b> <b>coordination</b> model, to the problems of sustainability of an asymmetrical-type <b>monetary</b> <b>coordination</b> mechanism based on use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. A proposal is then set forth for a sustainable form of macroeconomic coordination under a flexible exchange agreement based on a system of ranges of fluctuation backed up by nominal convergence criteria, structural reforms designed to make markets more flexible, and possible moderate controls on capital movements. The study ends with some considerations on the design of a strategy providing for the gradual abandonment by Argentina of the quasi currency board mechanism, in order to permit macroeconomic coordination in MERCOSUR...|$|E

Are the stabilization gains from having separate currencies largely squandered in the absence of effective international <b>monetary</b> <b>coordination?</b> We argue that sunder plausible assumptions the answer is no.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the efficiency consequences of interactions between nominal tax systems and inflation in open economies. Domestic inflation changes after-tax real interest rates {{at home and}} abroad, thereby stimulating international capital movement and influencing domestic and foreign tax receipts, saving, and investment. The efficiency costs of inflation-induced international capital reallocations are typically much larger than those that accompany inflation in closed economies, even if capital is imperfectly mobile internationally. Differences between inflation rates are responsible for international capital movements and accompanying deadweight losses, suggesting that international <b>monetary</b> <b>coordination</b> {{has the potential to}} reduce the inefficiencies associated with inflation-induced capital movements. ...|$|E

40|$|A fixed-exchange-rate {{system is}} {{characterized}} by two pillars: <b>monetary</b> policy <b>coordination</b> and foreign exchange reserves. This paper concentrates on the fluctuation of foreign exchange reserves by taking <b>monetary</b> policy <b>coordination</b> as given: the sustainability of the fixed exchange rate regime is insured via a cointegration restriction {{on the path of}} money supplies. The paper considers three types of cash-in-advance models of money demand. The first two types are more traditional models where the cash-in-advance constraint is applied on the goods produced in the two countries. The third type is a model where cash is required in transactions with the government. The main finding is that when the exchange rate is credibly fixed, currencies are perfectly substitutable as stores of value although they might not be perfectly substitutable as transactions media. While the total demand for money is always determined, the composition of foreign exchange reserves might be indeterminate if currencies are held for store-of-value purposes only.

40|$|This paper empirically {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of interest-rate monetary rules for interdependent economies characterized by model uncertainty. We set out a two-bloc dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with habit persistence (that generates output persistence), Calvo pricing and wage-setting with indexing of non-optimized prices and wages (generating inflation persistence), incomplete financial markets and the incomplete pass-through of exchange rate changes. We estimate a linearized form of the model by Bayesian maximum-likelihood methods using US and Euro-zone data. From the estimates of the posterior distributions we then examine monetary policy conducted both independently and cooperatively by the Fed and the ECB {{in the form of}} robust inflation-targeting interest-rate rules. Comparing the utility outcome in a closed-loop Nash equilibrium with the outcome from a coordinated design of policy rules, we find a new result: the gains from <b>monetary</b> policy <b>coordination</b> rise significantly when CPI inflation targeting interest-rate rules are designed to account for model uncertainty. <b>monetary</b> policy <b>coordination,</b> robustness, inflation-targeting interest-rate rules. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} international policy coordination when both monetary and fiscal policy choices are endogenous. We show that a movement from insular monetary commitment to international monetary policy coordination will, if fiscal policies are not coordinated, produce higher output and public expenditure levels {{at the expense of}} higher inflation rates. We also show that the concurrent coordination of monetary and fiscal policies raises output and inflation while lowering public expenditure relative to a regime of <b>monetary</b> <b>coordination</b> alone.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the issue of}} {{cooperation}} among national fiscal authorities in a monetary union {{within the framework of}} their strategic interactions with the common monetary authority. We find that: a) in the lack of cooperation with the central bank, cooperation among fiscal authorities is not desirable; b) if the authorities have different targets, both fiscal leadership and monetary leadership result in a Pareto improvement with respect to the Nash outcome; however, the central bank is better off acting as a follower rather than as a leader; c) harmonization of targets makes policy coordination unnecessary, unless countries are hit by asymmetric shocks: in this case, either cooperation among national fiscal authorities or state-contingency of targets are necessary to obtain an efficient outcome. These findings are applied to the EMU case.

40|$|Most {{countries}} have recently experienced high fiscal deficits and real interest rates that depressed national saving and slowed economic growth. This study analyzes {{the reasons that}} underlie the skewed fiscal-monetary mix.

The second section applies this approach to the Clinton package by using three macroeconomic models to estimate the likely macroeconomic impacts of different degrees of coordination.

40|$|The fiscal {{theory of}} the price level (FTPL) has {{attracted}} much attention but disagreement remains concerning its defining characteristics. Some writers have emphasized implications regarding interest-rate pegging and determinacy of rational expectations solutions, whereas others have stressed its capacity to generate equilibria in which price-level trajectories mimic those of bonds and differ drastically from those of money supplies. We argue that the FTPL attained prominence precisely because it appeared to provide a theory whose implications differ greatly from conventional monetary analysis; accordingly we review monetarist writings to identify the primary distinctions. In addition, we review recent findings concerning learnability—and therefore plausibility—of competing rational expectations equilibria. These indicate that when FTPL and monetarist equilibria differ, the latter are more plausible {{in the vast majority}} of cases.
