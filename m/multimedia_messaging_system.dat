Drawing on previous efforts with LMM systems and an envisioned scenario illustrating how LMM can be used, the authors discuss what playful experiences are and three problems that arise in realizing the scenario: how playful experiences can be inferred (the inference problem), how the experience of capture can be motivated and maintained (the experience-capture maintenance problem), and how playful experiences can be measured (the measurement problem). In response {{to each of the}} problems, three design considerations are drawn for playful Human-Computer Interaction: 1) experiences can be approached as information-rich representations or as arising from human-system interaction 2) incentive mechanisms can be mediators of fun and engagement, and 3) measuring experiences requires a balance in testing methodology choice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} {{encryption}} and steganography algorithms are implemented using JAVA ™ with android platform {{to provide the}} security for real time <b>multimedia</b> <b>messaging</b> service <b>system.</b> Establishing hidden communication for mobile has become an important subject of security. One of the methods to provide security is steganography. Steganography is used to hide secret information inside some carrier. To improve the security, encrypted secret data will be hidden inside MMS. The image is made to be hidden into image from MMS which provides more secured transmission than text information embedded into the MMS. The Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding technique is used to hide the secret information (image). Different sizes of secret images are taken and later the calculations have been done for the PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) of image in MATLAB. Encryption and steganography algorithms are ported on HTC Desire mobile device with android version 2. 2. 3...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, the {{widespread}} adoption of personal, mobile computing devices in everyday life, has allowed entry {{into a new}} technological era in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The constant change of the physical and social context in a user's situation {{made possible by the}} portability of mobile devices means that the user's attention becomes limited. This can negatively impact the user experience. To deal with this problem, this thesis draws from two developments in HCI, context-awareness and 3 D gestural input. From these developments, we introduce the concept of minimal mobile HCI, a subset of eyes-free mobile interaction that allows minimal combination of the visual modality with other sensory modalities to improve the user experience of interacting with smartphones. In the first part, we look closely at the design and evaluation of location-aware <b>multimedia</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>systems,</b> and how they can lead to playfulness in a minimal interaction setting. We then look at how urban interactions are connected across locations by designing and evaluating an exploration-based route planner that makes use of large amounts of geotagged data. In the second part, we look closely at the usability and user experience issues associated with 3 D mobile gestural interaction when recognition errors occur. Upon showing that this form of interaction is usable in the face of errors, we then investigate two example applications. We revisit how this kind of 3 D gestural interaction can be applied in a playful setting by looking at gesture-based music composition and gaming. Finally, we look at how minimal mobile interaction can be used to support mobile user authentication using 3 D gestural input. Together, our user studies show that interaction designers need not abandon screen-based interaction, nor stop designing for users' visual modality, only complementing it with context-awareness or 3 D gestural input solutions. This can expand the design space for designing and developing mobile systems/applications that keep user interaction costs at a minimum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Following {{the success}} of short <b>messaging</b> service (SMS), <b>multimedia</b> <b>messaging</b> service (MMS) is {{emerging}} as a natural but revolutionary successor to short messaging. MMS allows personalized <b>multimedia</b> <b>messages</b> containing content such as images, audio, text and video to be created and transferred between MMS-capable phones and other devices. By using IP and its associated protocols, MMS is able to interwork with other <b>messaging</b> <b>systems</b> such as Internet messaging services. An important feature of MMS is the guaranteed delivery of messages via a store-and-forward mechanism which temporarily stores messages in the network until successfully delivered. Unlike SMS, <b>multimedia</b> <b>messaging</b> service does not mandate any maximum size for a <b>multimedia</b> <b>message.</b> This enhanced flexibility of MMS requires a careful design of the network {{in order to avoid}} excessive message delays and losses. This paper develops a mathematical model for evaluating the performance of an MMS system. Using the model, closed-form expressions for major performance parameters such as message loss, message delay and expiry probability have been derived. Furthermore, a simple algorithm is presented to find the optimal temporary storage size for a given set of system parameters. The accuracy of the presented analysis is evaluated through simulations which shows a close agreement between analytic and simulation results. I...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{messaging}} {{has become}} a huge business all around the world. Currently, the richness of multimedia messages {{is limited by the}} language used for describing media timing and interactions, for which Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) is a de facto standard. A proposed, richer, new SMIL version for multimedia messages is the Third Generation Partnership Program (3 GPP) SMIL. This thesis studies the use of 3 GPP SMIL for scene description in multimedia messages. Nokia Series 40 mobile platform is used as the target. <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Messaging</b> <b>System</b> (MMS), SMIL, and the Series 40 platform are presented in sufficient detail. Then the problems that may arise are discussed and solutions presented. The conclusion is that 3 GPP SMIL is a feasible standard, and can be utilized on a Series 40 mobile phone. The 3 GPP SMIL profile is much more complex than the SMIL profile currently used in multimedia messages, and provides a richer user experience. Interoperability will be an issue, especially for messages sent from a PC. Small screen size of the terminal and the smaller processor and memory capacity will cause problems. User interface design for a 3 GPP SMIL viewer is non-trivial, {{because there are so many}} actions the user should be able to take.

40|$|Nowadays, {{traditional}} {{services are}} {{being replaced by}} mobile or M-business that is more efficient, faster and accessible. To enable M-business operators to service many customers efficiently but with {{the impression of a}} personalized individual service, a method called mass customization is used. For this service to work, detailed information about each customer is needed and is achieved by customer profiling. The big challenge is how to profile M-business customers who have very short attention span and want to quickly conclude a transaction on their mobile device to avoid expensive air time charges and restriction to their mobility. Currently, M-business companies do not have sufficient strategic information about their customers to correctly target them for mass customization. To answer this question, research was conducted in Iran and Malaysia to determine what technique is most suitable for profiling. Various on-line psychographic profiling methods are available and three methods, namely Big Five, Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), and ProScan were found to be most suitable. Big Five was found to be the best method but requires customers to answer 40 to 120 questions. NLP on the other hand, only requires customers to answer a minimum of 10 questions. The number of questions to be answered matters significantly in a M-business service. This was confirmed by a survey conducted in Iran and Malaysia, on the willingness of the respondents to answer profiling questions. After NLP was chosen, another survey was conducted to determine the different NLP profiles of M-business customers. This information was used to design and implement a prototype system for a mobile news service that is able to profile customers by NLP and then mass customize news messages either in the form of text, audio, or interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIn South Africa, Deaf people {{communicate}} with one another and the broader community by means of South African Sign Language. The majority of Deaf people who have access to a mobile phone (cell phone) use Short Message Service (SMS) to communicate and share information with hearing people, but seldom use it among themselves. It is assumed that video messaging will be more accessible to Deaf people, since their level of literacy may prevent them from making effective use of information that is disseminated via texting/SMS. The principal objective of the esearch was to explore a cost-effective and efficient mass <b>multimedia</b> <b>messaging</b> <b>system.</b> The intention was to adapt a successful text-based mass notification system, developed by a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), to accommodate efficient and affordable video mass messaging for Deaf people. The questions that underpin this research are: How should video- streaming mass-messaging methods be compared and evaluated to find the most suitable method to deliver an affordable and acceptable service to Deaf people? What transport vehicles should be considered: Multimedia Message Service (MMS), the web, electronic mail, or a cell phone resident push/pullapplication? Which is the most cost effective? And, finally: How does the video quality of the various transport vehicles differ in terms of the clarity of the sign language as perceived by the Deaf? The soft-systems methodology and a mixed-methods methodology were used to address the research questions. The soft-systems methodology was followed to manage the research process and the mixed-methods research methodology was followed to collect data. Data was collected by means of experiments and semi-structured interviews. A prototype for mobile phone usage was developed and evaluated with Deaf members the NGO Deaf Community of Cape Town. The technology and internet usage of the Deaf participants provided background information. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyse the quantitative data, and content analysis was used to analyse the documents and interviews. All of the Deaf participants used their mobile phones for SMS and the majority (81. 25 %) used English to type messages; however, all indicated that they would have preferred to use South Africa sign language on their mobile phones if it were available. And they were quite willing to pay between 75 c and 80 c per message for using such a video-messaging service. Of the transport vehicles demonstrated, most Deaf people indic indicated that they preferred to use the SMS prototype (with a web link to the video) rather than the MMS prototype with the video attached. They were, however, very concerned about the cost of using the system, as well as the quality of the sign language videos. South Afric...|$|E
