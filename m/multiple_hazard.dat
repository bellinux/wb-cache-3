40|$|Pokhara {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{naturally}} beautiful cities in the world with a unique geological setting. This important tourist city is under intense pressure from rapid urbanization and population growth. Multiple hazards and risks are rapidly increasing in Pokhara due to unsustainable land use practices, particularly the increase in built-up areas. This study examines the relationship among urbanization, land use/land cover dynamics and <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> and risk analysis of the Pokhara valley from 1990 to 2013. We investigate some of the active hazards, such as floods, landslides, fire, sinkholes, land subsidence and earthquakes, and prepare an integrated <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> risk map indicating the highly vulnerable zones. Land use and land cover maps from 1990 and 2013 from Landsat images (30 m resolution) have been prepared and analyzed for the spatial dynamics of urbanization and the transition of land use and land cover. In the 23 -year period, the built-up area more than doubled from 24. 03 km² to 54. 20 km². Although the landscape in the urban, peri-urban and rural areas appears to be fragmented, different drivers play pivotal roles in landscape change in these areas. The results provide substantial information for establishing innovative action plans for disaster risk management in the valley. Recommendations are made for the most suitable places for future urban expansion in the valley. This study is important for raising awareness among policy makers and other public officials to include <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> risk mitigation in land use policies and plans. Establishing connections between urban expansions, escalating population growth and multiple hazards and risk assessment will also improve in modelling the latent impact of future catastrophes and emergency preparedness.

40|$|Multi-hazard risk {{assessment}} {{is a major}} concern in risk analysis, but most approaches do not consider all hazard interactions when calculating possible losses. We address this problem by developing an improved quantitative model - Model for multi-hazard Risk assessment with a consideration of Hazard Interaction (MmhRisk-HI). This model calculates the possible loss caused by <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards,</b> with an explicit consideration of interaction between those hazards. There are two main components to the model. In the first, based on the hazard-forming environment, relationships among hazards are classified into four types for calculation of the exceedance probability of <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards</b> occurrence. In the second, a Bayesian network is used to calculate possible loss caused by <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards</b> with different exceedance probabilities. A multi-hazard risk map can then be drawn addressing the probability of multi-hazard occurrence and corresponding loss. This model was applied in northeast Zhejiang, China and validated by comparison against an observed multi-hazard sequence. The validation results show that the model can more effectively represent the real world, and that the modelled outputs, possible loss caused by <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards,</b> are reliable. The outputs can additionally help to identify areas at greatest risk, and allows a determination of the factors that contribute to that risk, and hence the model can provide useful further information for planners and decision-makers concerned with risk mitigation...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{performance}}-based design (PBD) {{that has}} a single performance level has been widely researched by changing section sizes of structural members or material properties to resist single hazard levels. However, this approach has limitations in terms of achieving performance and alternative design options for the owner. To overcome these limitations of the traditional PBD method, a multi-performance-based control design (MPBCD) methodology is newly proposed. The MPBCD integrates a decentralized semi-active control algorithm with semi-active smart damping devices and an advanced multi-objective optimization method. The multi-objective optimization is used to achieve various sets of performance-based control designs. The control designs satisfy multiple performance levels under <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> levels without changing cross-section sizes or material properties of structural members. This MPBCD provides multiple sets of control designs (i. e., control device layouts with control design variables) to minimize design costs and maximize control effectiveness. The multiple sets of designs offer optimal performance-based control design covering {{a broad range of}} hazard levels with various performance levels. This numerical study uses an advanced decentralized semi-active controller and large-scale 200 -kN magnetorheological (MR) dampers installed in a nine-story moment-resisting frame (MRF) building. From the multi-objective optimization technique, multiple layouts of control devices and controller parameters for multiple performance levels under <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> levels are investigated...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{citizens}} {{are being asked}} to take {{a more active role in}} disaster risk reduction (DRR), as decentralization of hazard governance has shifted greater responsibility for hazard preparedness actions onto individuals. Simultaneously, the taxonomy of hazards considered for DRR has expanded to include medical and social crises alongside natural hazards. Risk perception research emerged to support decision-makers with understanding how people characterize and evaluate different hazards to anticipate behavioral response and guide risk communication. Since its inception, the risk perception concept has been incorporated into many behavioral theories, which have been applied to examine preparedness for numerous hazard types. Behavioral theories have had moderate success in predicting or explaining preparedness behaviors; however, they are typically applied to a single hazard type and there is a gap in understanding which theories (if any) are suited for examining <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> types simultaneously. This paper first reviews meta-analyses of behavioral theories to better understand performance. Universal lessons learnt are summarized for survey design.

30|$|The {{reliability}} {{and accuracy of}} multi-hazard risk assessment depends greatly on how the relationship between hazard intensity and loss is quantitatively evaluated, that is, vulnerability assessment. The variety of hazards, differences in exposures, and complexity of environments make extremely difficult an accurate quantitative evaluation of vulnerability to multi-hazards. The most common method for vulnerability assessment in <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> research at the global scale involves index-based methods in which fragility, adaptability or coping capability, and other vulnerability characteristics are calculated using different indicators and integrated to achieve an indirect reflection of degree of vulnerability (UNDP 2004; UNU-EHS 2013; JRC 2014). The index-based method is easily operable, but shows only relative instead of quantitative results. Vulnerability assessment based on the mortality rate or the economic losses caused by hazards helps to obtain a measure of absolute risk, namely the expected loss value. In the Hotspots Project, a vulnerability evaluation was conducted according to the mortality rate or the economic losses caused by natural hazards {{at the global level}} in order to evaluate the risk of deaths and economic losses at a 2.5 ° ×  2.5 ° grid scale (Dilley et al. 2005).|$|E

In this paper, we introduce a general framework to address both single- and multi-objective discrete optimization problems. The computational platform is built with a unified and modular structure to accommodate various evolutionary optimization schemes in a versatile manner. Included in this platform are enhanced algorithms that (1) utilize local and global fitness functions to maintain diversity of the population for multi-objective Pareto optimization, (2) employ a compact cellular automata-based genetic algorithm for complex single-objective search spaces, (3) introduce a multi-level approach for reduced computational effort, and (4) address inherent uncertainties in the objective function(s) and underlying physical processes.

Total treatment time was 1563 months and ranged from one to 83 months (median 18). Patient survival was 86 % at 1 yr and 33 % at 4 yr. Technique survival was 87 % and 63 %. Cox's <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> regression analysis showed that age above 45 yr (relative risk 2. 2), systolic hypertension (2. 6) and cardiac disease (2. 2) {{at the start of}} CAPD were associated with shorter patient survival.

30|$|The {{ranking of}} {{national}} mortality and affected population rates can reflect {{the vulnerability of}} a country to multi-hazards, that is, {{the degree to which}} a country is impacted. It can be seen from Eqs.  5 and 6 that the main factors affecting the mortality and affected population rates under multiple natural hazards are GDP per capita (negatively correlated) and multi-hazard intensity (positively correlated). The difference between mortality rate and affected population rate rankings are related to the M_h and GDP per capita. Equations  5 and 6 show that M_h has a greater impact than GDP per capita on mortality rate, and GDP per capita affect more than M_h on affected population rate. According to Table  3, countries and regions around the Pacific and Indian Oceans with high multi-hazard intensity and high population density experience high mortality and affected population rates. For countries and regions with high <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> intensity but low socioeconomic status, mortality rates and affected population rates are very high—that is, high M_h and low GDP per capita together could lead to both high mortality and high affected population rates. An example of countries under this condition is Bangladesh, which ranks among the highest in both rate categories. High M_h and high GDP per capita together could lead to lower affected population rate, but they may not lead to lower mortality rate—such as in the case of Japan.|$|E

Currently, coastal planners use probability statistics such as the Annual Recurrence Interval (ARI) as an estimate of a flood of a given magnitude occurring.

Furthermore, population inversion in the multi-wavelength remote laser occurs at an ultrafast time-scale (i. e., less than ~ 200 fs) owing to direct formation of excited molecular nitrogen ions by strong-field ionization of inner-valence electrons, which is fundamentally different from the previously reported pumping mechanisms based either on electron recombination of ionized molecular nitrogen or on resonant two-photon excitation of atomic oxygen fragments resulting from resonant two-photon dissociation of molecular oxygen.

40|$|Purpose - Holistic {{approaches}} {{to public health}} such as ‘One Health’ emphasize the interconnectedness between people, animals, ecosystems, and epidemic risk, and many advocate for this philosophy to be adopted within disaster risk management (DRM). Historically, animal and human diseases have been managed separately from each other, and apart from other hazards considered for DRM. Shifts in DRM, however, may complement a One Health approach. The taxonomy of hazards considered under DRM has expanded to include medical and social crises such as epizootics and terrorism. However, there is a gap in understanding how epidemic risk is integrated into DRM at the community-level. Approach - TACTIC adopts a participatory case study approach examining preparedness for <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> types (floods, epidemics, earthquakes, and terrorism) at the community-level. This article reports on findings from the epidemic case study which took as its focus the 2001 Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK because of the diverse human, social, and environmental impacts of this ‘animal’ disease. Findings - Epizootic preparedness tends to focus on biosecurity and phytosanitary measures, and is geared towards agriculture and farming. Greater engagement with public health and behavioral sciences to manage public health impacts of animal disease epidemics, and activities for citizen engagement to improve preparedness are discussed.

In this study, the hazards of hypoxia, earthquakes, and snowstorms in Tibet were respectively described by the percentage of oxygen at sea level, earthquake intensity, and mean annual maximum snow depth. The rates of population affected by hypoxia, earthquakes, and snowstorms were calculated by chronic mountain sickness and historical disaster data. Based on these, the study examined the change in population exposure to the three hazards and their combinations by hazard intensity level at the 1  km[*]×[*] 1  km grid scale in 1982 – 2015. The results show that population exposures to hypoxia, earthquakes, and snowstorms were about 745 thousand, 97 thousand, and 168 thousand in 2015, respectively, among a total population in Tibet of 3.24 million. These exposures were mainly concentrated in the 3400 – 5000  m above sea level zone. The population exposed to hypoxia and earthquakes showed a rising trend from 1982 to 2015, while the population exposed to snowstorms decreased after 2000 due to reduced snowstorm intensity. Hypoxia-earthquake and hypoxia-snowstorm are the main <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard</b> combinations that people in Tibet suffered from and their person·time exposures were estimated at around 842 thousand and 913 thousand in 2015, respectively, with an average annual increase of 1.7 % and 1.3 %.

30|$|Hazards causing L&D reemerge as {{a central}} aspect of the analysis. This seems odd when viewed from a {{vulnerability}} perspective, which has departed from {{a critique of the}} hazard paradigm and has argued that there is nothing “natural” in natural catastrophes (O’Keefe et al. 1976), but rather that they must be interpreted as crises that merely reveal a latent social condition. Considerable sections of certain vulnerable groups lack the capacity to cope with and adapt to climate stress, and are already experiencing L&D under current conditions. A similar paradigm shift occurred in resilience research as emphasis moved away from (natural) hazards and towards impacted individuals and provisioning systems (Turner et al. 2003). A shift from a focus on threat to a focus on social or national resilience can be observed in the U.S. homeland security policy after Hurricane Katrina, especially with respect to critical infrastructure policy (Koski 2011). But many other countries have also undergone a paradigm shift in their national security policy, often from a single-hazard to a <b>multiple</b> <b>hazard,</b> or even a so-called “all-hazard” approach (FEMA 1996). This often implies a shift towards emphasizing the capabilities of the affected systems: for instance, those of people or communities (Murphy 2007; Keck and Sakdapolrak 2013), or of society or nations (Edwards 2009; U.S. NRC 2012) to “make cities resilient” (UNISDR 2012), to protect (U.S. Government 1996), or to increase the resilience of infrastructures (Koski 2011). In all these approaches and policies, losses and damages are just the benchmarks of disaster evidence embedded in a long-term holistic risk management or governance process.|$|E

These fires are increasingly large and severe after many decades of fire suppression {{and land use}} changes, flammable fuel buildups and interactions with climate. The wildland-urban interface (WUI) continues to expand as people relocate to rural areas where they often expect structural fire protection similar to what they experienced in cities. But conditions are different in rural communities located in fire-prone forests. The risk of severe wildfire is greater and limited resources are available to deal with severe fires when they break out. Fire prevention and suppression without vegetation management to reduce accumulated fuels has and {{will result in a}} continuation of uncharacteristically severe, stand-replacing wildfires, particularly in eastern and southwestern Oregon.

40|$|ABSTRACT Santa Barbara Tea Fire Multi-Hazard Mitigation Benefit Cost Analysis David S Flamm This study {{examines}} {{the benefits and}} {{costs associated with the}} outright purchase of properties for hazard mitigation (“property acquisition mitigation”) in Santa Barbara, California which reduced four properties’ exposure to <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards.</b> The results indicate that the estimated overall benefit-cost ratio for property acquisition mitigation projects is 1. 75 : 1 when the exposed properties meet a threshold of eminent threat for total loss. This study further suggests that when property acquisitions are performed in an area threatened by <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards</b> the mitigation becomes two to three times more beneficial than in an area threatened by a single hazard. Possible implications and future benefits associated with this mitigation and mitigations like this are also explored. Multi-hazard mitigation is an action taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risks from natural or human-caused hazards. A hazard is any condition or event with the potential to cause fatalities, injuries, property damage, infrastructure damage, economic interruptions, environmental damage, or other loss. The study area for the Tea Fire BCA (Benefit Cost Analysis) is subject to <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards,</b> primarily landslides, wildfires, and earthquakes. In an attempt to reduce the exposure to landslides a mitigation project was completed in 1998. This project included purchase of four properties by the City of Santa Barbara using federal and local funds. The undeveloped properties were left empty as open space to eliminate the exposure to risk. The project, originally intended to mitigate landslide risk, mitigated risk exposure to <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards.</b> The mitigation was put to the test during the Santa Barbara Tea Fire, a wildfire which burned approximately 2, 000 acres of Santa Barbara County land in November, 2008. The following steps were followed to determine the overall loss avoidance: 1. Obtain building values before mitigation 2. Obtain current comparable building values 3. Determine burn recurrence in study area 4. Obtain fire damage estimates from FEMA BCA tool based on “before mitigation” building and contents values 5. Calculate “loss avoidance” and adjust for inflation using FEMA BCA tool 6. Add additional avoided losses not considered in BCA (e. g., emergency management costs) 7.

40|$|The Forward-Looking Interferometer (FLI) {{is a new}} {{instrument}} concept for obtaining the measurements required to alert flight crews to potential weather hazards to safe flight. To {{meet the needs of}} the commercial fleet, such a sensor should address <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards</b> to warrant the costs of development, certification, installation, training, and maintenance. The FLI concept is based on high-resolution Infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometry (FTS) technologies that have been developed for satellite remote sensing. These technologies have also been applied to the detection of aerosols and gases for other purposes. The FLI concept is being evaluated for its potential to address <b>multiple</b> <b>hazards</b> including clear air turbulence (CAT), volcanic ash, wake vortices, low slant range visibility, dry wind shear, and icing during all phases of flight (takeoff, cruise, and landing). The research accomplished in this second phase of the FLI project was in three major areas: further sensitivity studies to better understand the potential capabilities and requirements for an airborne FLI instrument, field measurements that were conducted in an effort to provide empirical demonstrations of radiometric hazard detection, and theoretical work to support the development of algorithms to determine the severity of detected hazard...|$|R
