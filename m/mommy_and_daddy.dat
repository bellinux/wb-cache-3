"'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning with {{brightest}} day, the Young Man {{is performing}} calisthenics (which {{he continues to}} do {{until the very end}} of the play) near a sandbox (or sandpit) at the beach. <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> have brought Grandma all the way out from the city and place her in the sandbox. As <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> wait nearby in some chairs, the Musician plays off and on, according to what the other characters instruct him to do. Throughout the play, the Young Man is very pleasant, greeting the other characters with a smile as he says, [...] "Hi!". As <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> cease to acknowledge Grandma while they wait, Grandma reverts from her childish behavior and begins to speak coherently to the audience. Grandma and the Young Man begin to converse with each other. Grandma feels comfortable talking with the Young Man as he treats her like a human being (whereas <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> imply through their actions and dialogue that she is more of a chore that they must take care of). While still talking with the Young Man, she reminds someone off-stage that it should be nighttime by now. Once brightest day has become deepest night, <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> hear on-stage rumbling. Acknowledging that the sounds are literally coming from off-stage and not from thunder or breaking waves, Mommy knows that Grandma's death is here. As daylight resumes, Mommy briefly weeps by the sandbox before quickly exiting with Daddy. Although Grandma, who is lying down half buried in sand, has continued to mock the mourning of <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy,</b> she soon realizes that she can no longer move. It is at this moment that the Young Man finally stops performing his calisthenics and approaches Grandma and the sandbox. As he directs her to be still, he reveals that he is the angel of death and says, [...] "...I am come for you." [...] Even though he says his line like a real amateur, Grandma compliments him and closes her eyes with a smile.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the best}} known children's books with gay themes include Heather Has Two <b>Mommies</b> (1989) <b>and</b> <b>Daddy's</b> Roommate (1991), {{published}} by LGBT publisher Alyson Books. Both books discussed same-sex parenting and attracted criticism and controversy. The American Library Association ranked Heather Has Two Mommies as the 11th most frequently challenged book in the United States in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Daddy's Roommate {{was one of}} {{the first}} children's books to portray {{homosexuality}} in a positive light; the two men in the book do the same things heterosexual couples do: Take care of the house, argue, and spend time with their child. Consequently, the book has become one of the most challenged books in recent years with the American Library Association listing it at number 2 in their list of the 100 most challenged books from 1990-1999. Lon Mabon launched an anti-gay campaign attempting to amend the Oregon state constitution to allow discrimination against lesbians and gay men. He used Heather Has Two <b>Mommies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy's</b> Roommate as evidence of a militant homosexual agenda. However, citizens of Oregon voted on November 3, 1992, and the measure was defeated. Despite its challenges, this book won a Lambda Literary Analysis book award under the Gay Men's Small Press category.|$|R
5000|$|Although larger {{publishing}} houses may reject homosexual fiction {{because of}} the smaller market, there are publishing houses available that focus on this specific genre. For almost thirty years, Alyson Books has been publishing LGBT authors, often when no other publisher would dare sign them on. Alyson Books, recently purchased by Regent Media, is the oldest LGBT book-publisher {{and the first to}} readily publish gay fiction against the marketing odds. In an interview with Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide Don Weise talks about the important impact Alyson Books has had in gay and lesbian publishing: [...] "When I look at our backlist and see the first LGBT children's books- Heather Has Two <b>Mommies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy's</b> Roommate, or the first African-American gay anthologies- In the Life and Brother to Brother- or the S/M classics Coming to Power and Leatherfolk, I see a publisher with a wide vision of who we are as LGBT people. Taken together, this sampling of books recognizes that some of us are parents, some of us are people of color, and some of us enjoy sex involving BDSM. Some of us might even be all of the above. To my thinking this inclusive view is an extraordinary achievement unto itself. While I could name any number of books that I'm proud to say Alyson has published, I think the barrier-breaking nature of our past is what excites me most." [...] Other publishing houses have begun to show an interest in gay fiction. LPI Media, also owned by Regent Media, is now the largest gay and lesbian publisher.|$|R
5000|$|The family {{consists}} of a dominating Mommy, an emasculated Daddy, and a clever and witty Grandma. An honorary {{member of the community}} and idol to Mommy, Mrs. Barker, enters and the dialogue continues with the occasional interjection by Grandma. <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> exit, leaving Mrs. Barker and Grandma alone. Grandma apparently knows why Mrs. Barker has been asked to come by and explains to her that <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> had adopted a son from her many years previously. As the parents objected to the child's actions, they mutilated it as punishment, eventually killing it. After Mrs. Barker exits, a Young Man appears at the door, looking for work. After hearing his life story, Grandma realizes that this Young Man, whom she dubs [...] "The American Dream," [...] is the twin of Mommy and Daddy's first child. As the first child was mutilated, he too was experiencing the pain and has been left as an empty shell of a man. After seeing this Young Man as a way out, she moves her things and leaves. The Young Man is introduced to the family as a suitable replacement for the original child.|$|E
5000|$|Hilton Als, in The New Yorker, {{wrote about}} the play : [...] "...is less about what happens than about how it happens—which, in the theatre, means how it’s said. <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> speak in rhythmic banalities. Greeting a guest named Mrs. Barker, Mommy asks, progressively, if she’d like a smoke, a drink, to cross her legs, and to remove her dress. Mrs. Barker {{responds}} to each inquiry in the same way: “I don’t mind if I do.” Albee is showing us the trauma of repetition: the noxious glue that holds his married couples together, despite their rage—or because of it." ...|$|E

[...] The advertising campaign was called, [...] "My <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Daddy</b> Are Heroes". However, those recruiting efforts have largely been unsuccessful. APD continues to suffer from a significant shortage of new officers and difficulty attracting qualified recruits, as of 2015. Berry has defended APD in several shootings, causing many protests in the city. Mayor Berry's platform for police reform and the department's lack of transparency have been met with national scrutiny and criticism.|$|E

Along with the marriages, the character is also given a number of other love interests. The motivation behind the multiple romances stems from the character's need to fill the void her father left when he abandoned her.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes chaos is {{an immense}} {{black hole in}} which one {{endeavours}} to fix a fragile point as a centre. (Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus) I doubt one could find an area of research more thoroughly blighted by what Deleuze and Guattari only half-jokingly call “interpretosis” than Hitchcock studies. Long a kind sacred touchstone for psychoanalytic film critics, Hitchcock is a veritable red flag to the hypersensitive Deleuzist, {{or at least he}} should be. Yet Deleuzians have so far been comparatively silent on the matter, perhaps because Deleuze himself didn’t see fit to challenge the hegemonic hold psychoanalysis has on Hitchcock. In this respect, one cannot but rue the fact that he didn’t collaborate with Guattari on the film books as well. It is difficult to believe he {{would have been able to}} resist so ripe a target. His complaints against Freud—that he didn’t listen to his patients, that he saw Oedipus everywhere he looked, that he reduced everything to <b>mommy,</b> <b>daddy</b> <b>and</b> me—would be redoubled with respect to certain of Hitchcock’s critics. Likewise, his complaint against Lacan, that he attributed everything to lack as the fundamental cause, would be redoubled with respect to certain of Hitchcock’s critics. In this regard, the task for Deleuzism is clear: overturn the psychoanalytic readings of Hitchcock. In what follows, then, taking Slavoj Zizek’s reading of The Birds as my focal point, I shall attempt to blaze a path for what must ultimately be an enormous labor of re-reading, by sketching out a few of the basic coordinates for a schizoanalysis of Hitchcock...|$|R
