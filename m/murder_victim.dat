40|$|Although early {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} number of serial <b>murder</b> <b>victims</b> in the United States varied greatly and were exaggerated, current estimates may actually underestimate the number of serial <b>murder</b> <b>victims.</b> This study provides extrapolation from existing databases including missing persons, unidentified dead, and misidentified dead to esti-mate uncounted serial <b>murder</b> <b>victims.</b> In addition to providing lower and upper estimates of possible victims from these sources, this article also provides a methodology for count-ing “the missing missing”—missing persons who were never reported as missing and some of whom may be serial <b>murder</b> <b>victims.</b> By counting various sources of possible hidden serial <b>murder</b> <b>victims,</b> {{the addition of a}} lower estimate of 182 and an upper esti-mate of 1, 832 additional annual serial <b>murder</b> <b>victims</b> in the United States is suggested...|$|R

5|$|Of {{all these}} fragmentary pre-Hellenistic sources, {{the most is}} known of Sophocles Troilos. Even so, only 54 words have been {{identified}} as coming from the play. Fragment 619 refers to Troilus as an andropais, a man-boy. Fragment 621 indicates that Troilus was going to a spring with a companion to fetch water or to water his horses. A scholion to the Iliad states that Sophocles has Troilus ambushed by Achilles while exercising his horses in the Thymbra. Fragment 623 indicates that Achilles mutilated Troilus' corpse by a method known as maschalismos. This involved preventing the ghost of a <b>murder</b> <b>victim</b> from returning to haunt their killer by cutting off the corpse's extremities and stringing them under its armpits. Sophocles is thought to have also referred to the maschalismos of Troilus in a fragment taken to be from an earlier play Polyxene.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle's Freewheels Theatre {{commissioned}} Nick Enright {{to produce}} a play that explored themes around the rape and murder. Titled A Property of the Clan, it premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in Newcastle in 1992, and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993. The title {{was taken from the}} controversial quote in the psychological report on Webster made in preparation for his trial. Enright omitted the criminal acts and the murder from the play, instead focusing on the drama, its participants and the aftermath of the murder. The play was shown at various high schools in the Newcastle area, and following its positive reception was shown at high schools nationally, winning several awards. However, Newcastle High School, where both Leigh and Webster had been students, declined to show it. The play is set in the fictional town of Blackrock, and the rape and <b>murder</b> <b>victim</b> is named Tracy. Leigh's family requested that the name be changed, as 'Tracey' was the name of Leigh's cousin and best friend. The name remained, despite other revisions to the script; the play was retitled Blackrock. It was performed by the Sydney Theatre Company in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
