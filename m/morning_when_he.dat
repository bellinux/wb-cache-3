He lay wounded on the {{battlefield}} until the next <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was recognized by Union General Alexander McDowell McCook. Johnson and McCook had both attended the 1860 Democratic National Convention and were both Freemasons. Johnson was taken aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, where despite the ministrations of several physicians, he died on April 8. Friends in the Union army, including General John M. Harlan, packed Johnson's body in salt and shipped it to Louisville, then on to Georgetown for burial.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August, Murray {{commanded}} A Company—which {{consisted of}} fewer than one hundred men—in a successful attack that captured Mouquet Farm under heavy fire. His men repelled four German counterattacks before he ordered them to withdraw. He remained in command until the next <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> fainted from loss of blood from two wounds he had sustained during the action. Murray was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the action, an event that was published in a supplement of the London Gazette dated 14 November 1916. He was later evacuated to England aboard the hospital ship Asturias, and admitted to the 4th General Hospital, London, where he was to share a ward with Albert Jacka and Percy Black, who were recovering from wounds received at Poziéres and Mouquet Farm respectively. After nearly six weeks of recuperation, {{he returned to the}} 13th Battalion in France on 19 October.|$|E

25|$|As the Pequod {{approaches}} the Equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only {{where he is}} and not where he will be. He dashes it to the deck. That evening, an impressive typhoon attacks the ship. Lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as a warning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with a musket. Next <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker's needle. He orders the log be heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship with no way to fix its location.|$|E

500|$|Gerrold {{worked on}} [...] "I, Mudd" [...] before [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] began to film. He was {{surprised}} one <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was handed {{a copy of}} the tribbles script and told to sign it for Robert A. Heinlein. The Kellam de Forest script clearance and research firm had cautioned that the tribbles in the episode resembled the Martian flat cats in Heinlein's 1952 novel The Rolling Stones, and suggested that the rights to the novel should be purchased. Gerrold became concerned that he had inadvertently plagiarized the novel which he had read fifteen years before. Coon phoned Heinlein, who, according to Gerrold, only asked for a signed copy of the script and later sent a note to Gerrold after the show aired to thank him for the script.|$|E
500|$|On 4 November 1794, Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer {{replaced}} the ill Dumerbion as army commander. Schérer wrote that Sérurier was [...] "a very good officer, {{devoted to his}} duties; his patriotism has been attacked {{in the time of}} Hébert and his consorts; he has emerged victorious from all these charges. In my opinion he is worthy of the post he holds on the right of the active army." [...] Sérurier's promotion was not confirmed until 13 June 1795. The Austro-Sardinian commander Joseph Nikolaus De Vins attacked the French lines on 24 June. Most of the assaults failed but since a few positions were captured and could not be retaken, the French withdrew from Vado to Borghetto Santo Spirito by 5 July. In the new line, Masséna with 14,000 troops held the coast while Sérurier and 6,000 men defended Ormea. On 5 July Sérurier reported that a key position had been partly lost, causing consternation at army headquarters. Later that day he reported that one of his brigadiers, Louis Pelletier, retook the position. Curiously, this incident did not count against him; instead Sérurier was given command of the left wing in place of Garnier. On the evening of 31 August, his headquarters at Saint-Martin-Vésubie was surrounded by the enemy. Though only 318 soldiers were at hand, Sérurier resisted successfully until early the following <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> attacked and scattered his attackers, capturing 86 of them. The enemy commander, the émigré Chevalier Bonnaud committed suicide. Not only was he a good soldier, but Sérurier's troops liked him, he treated the local civilians with decency and his diplomacy allowed him to serve as a link between his army and the neighboring Army of the Alps. François Christophe Kellermann then in command of both armies, wrote, [...] "It is to the coolness and courage of this excellent officer that was due the success of this glorious day." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} got {{the idea}} for Chigurh's hairstyle from a book Tommy Lee Jones had. It featured a 1979 photo of a man sitting in the bar of a brothel with a very similar hairstyle and clothes to those worn by Chigurh in the film. Oscar-winning hairstylist Paul LeBlanc designed the hairdo. The Coens instructed LeBlanc to create a [...] "strange and unsettling" [...] hairstyle. LeBlanc based the style on the mop tops of the English warriors in the Crusades as well as the Mod haircuts of the 1960s. Bardem told LeBlanc each <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finished that the style helped him to get into character. Bardem humorously quipped that he was [...] "not going to get laid for three months" [...] because of his haircut.|$|E

Fitzhugh Lee started that day, leaving Longstreet with only Brigadier General Martin Gary's cavalry brigade for scouting duties. Lee also prepared for Major General George Pickett to move his men to join the cavalry and take command. Five Forks was along the shortest route to the South Side Railroad. Lee ordered the movement of the infantry the next <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> learned that Union forces were headed toward Dinwiddie Court House. With his trenches ending at the Claiborne Road-White Oak intersection, Lee had to send Pickett [...] past the end of the Confederate line of defenses in order to defend Five Forks.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{side track}} to the Northern Air Temple on his own, Aang is betrayed by a Southern Earth Kingdom peasant and {{captured}} {{by a group}} of Fire Nation archers, led by Commander Zhao, a Fire Nation Commander appointed by the Fire Lord. However, a masked marauder, the [...] "Blue Spirit", helps Aang escape from his imprisonment, fighting off the Fire Nation soldiers under Zhao's command until the blue spirit realises they will be overwhelmed, at which point he takes Aang hostage to negotiate their way out. During the prison break, Zhao realizes that Zuko is the masked vigilante. He arranges to kill the prince, first by having a crossbowman fire a bolt over a huge distance that shatters the lower half of Zuko's mask and knocks him out, however Aang uses his skills to bend a cloud across the bridge connecting the prison {{to the other side of}} the valley, causing the Fire Nation soldiers in pursuit to stop in fear. With the cloud covering their escape, Aang escapes with an unconscious Zuko into a nearby forest and watches over Zuko until <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> leaves to reunite with Sokka and Katara. Zhao tries again to kill Zuko, this time by rupturing a gas pipe running through Zuko's quarters on Iroh's ship. Noticing the danger, Zuko manages to survive the attempt on his life with Iroh's help. He sneaks aboard Zhao's lead ship as his fleet departs for the Northern Water Tribe, which is a heavy fortress, to capture the Avatar. Upon arriving, Aang's group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Sokka quickly befriends the Northern Water Tribe princess, Yue. After a few agreements, a waterbending master, Pakku, teaches Aang waterbending. Katara also becomes a much stronger and more powerful waterbender due to her training with Master Pakku.|$|E

2500|$|Faulknor was {{promoted}} to rear-admiral of the white on 24 September 1787, beginning a steady progression through the flag ranks according to his seniority. He became rear-admiral of the red on 21 September 1790, and in 1791 hoisted his flag on the 98-gun , during the Spanish Armament. The crisis passed without breaking into open war, and Barfleur was paid off in September that year. Faulknor appears to have {{spent the rest of}} his career ashore, residing at Havant. He {{was promoted}} to vice-admiral of the blue on 1 February 1793, marking the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and was further promoted to vice-admiral of the white on 12 April 1794 and then vice-admiral of the red on 12 July 1794. His final promotion was to admiral of the blue on 1 June 1795. Now a full admiral, Faulknor made the journey to London to be presented to King George III. He arrived at the capital on 22 June, and was at the house of Colonel Hon. Stanhope on Park Lane the following <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was suddenly struck with a fit of apoplexy. He died the next day, 24 June 1795. He was survived by at least one son, Jonathan, who died a rear-admiral of the red in 1809. At least one of Jonathan Faulknor the younger's children also became an officer in the navy, maintaining the family's long naval tradition. The Gentleman's Magazine eulogised that [...] "In his death the country has lost a most gallant and meritorious officer, and his family an excellent father and friend. His well-known nautical abilities, and extensive knowledge in his profession, are above panegyric, and his name will be revered to future ages." ...|$|E
