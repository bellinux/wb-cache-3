The new Nash Rambler came only in a convertible body, a style that had a higher price in the marketplace and incorporating more standard features that make the open top models suitable more for leisure-type use than ordinary transportation. With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, electric clock, and even a pushbutton AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the <b>marketing</b> <b>mix.</b> Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but {{it should be noted that}} in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E

In his paper [...] "The Concept of the Marketing Mix", Neil H. Borden reconstructed {{the history of the}} term [...] "marketing mix". [...] He started teaching the term after an associate, James Culliton, described the role of the marketing manager in 1948 as a [...] "mixer of ingredients"; one who sometimes follows recipes prepared by others, sometimes prepares his own recipe as he goes along, sometimes adapts a recipe from immediately available ingredients, and at other times invents new ingredients no one else has tried. The marketer E. Jerome McCarthy proposed a four Ps classification (Product, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1960, which has since been used by marketers throughout the world. Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a four Cs classification (Consumer, Price, Promotion, Place) in 1990 which is a more consumer-oriented version of the four Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing to niche marketing. Koichi Shimizu proposed a 7Cs Compass Model (corporation, commodity, cost, communication, channel, consumer, circumstances) to provide a more complete picture of the nature of marketing in 1981.|$|E
