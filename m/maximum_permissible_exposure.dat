40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{describes}} signals generated by. 22 and. 32 caliber {{starter pistols}} {{in the context}} of noise-induced hearing loss risk for sports officials and athletes. DesignAcoustic comparison of impulses generated from typical. 22 and. 32 caliber starter pistols firing blanks were made to impulses generated from comparable firearms firing both blanks and live rounds. Acoustic characteristics are described in terms of directionality and distance from the shooter in a simulated outdoor running track. Metrics include peak sound pressure levels (SPL), A-weighted equivalent 8 -hour level (LeqA 8), and <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> number of individual shots, or <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>exposures</b> (MPE) for the unprotected ear. ResultsStarter pistols produce peak SPLs above 140 dB. The numbers of MPEs are as few as five for the. 22 -caliber starter pistol, and somewhat higher (22 ̆ 030425) for the. 32 -caliber pistol. ConclusionThe impulsive sounds produced by starter pistols correspond to MPE numbers that are unacceptably small for unprotected officials and others in the immediate vicinity of the shooter. At the distances included in this study, the risk to athletes appears to be low (when referencing exposure criteria for adults), but the sound associated with the starter pistol will contribute to the athlete 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s overall noise exposure.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{characterize}} the impulse noise exposure and auditory risk for youth recreational firearm users engaged in outdoor target shooting events. The youth shooting positions are typically standing or {{sitting at a}} table, which places the firearm closer to the ground or reflective surface when compared to adult shooters. DesignAcoustic characteristics were examined and the auditory risk estimates were evaluated using contemporary damage-risk criteria for unprotected adult listeners and the 120 -dB peak limit suggested by the World Health Organization (1999) for children. Study sampleImpulses were generated by 26 firearm/ammunition configurations representing rifles, shotguns, and pistols used by youth. Measurements were obtained relative to a youth shooter 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s left ear. ResultsAll firearms generated peak levels that exceeded the 120 dB peak limit suggested by the WHO for children. In general, shooting from the seated position over a tabletop increases the peak levels, LAeq 8 and reduces the unprotected <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>exposures</b> (MPEs) for both rifles and pistols. Pistols pose the greatest auditory risk when fired over a tabletop. ConclusionYouth should utilize smaller caliber weapons, preferably from the standing position, and always wear hearing protection whenever engaging in shooting activities {{to reduce the risk}} for auditory damage.

To calculate the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> daily <b>exposure</b> times for a number of different types of currently available light curing units. To evaluate the effect of orthodontic brackets to the blue light hazard. To test the hypothesis that routine use of dental curing units may lead to problems with colour discrimination in clinicians, namely orthodontists, when compared with a non- dental control. A self administered questionnaire was designed to assess the profile of orthodontists and the procedures used for light curing. This was completed by 104 orthodontists. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> daily <b>exposure</b> times of a variety of curing lights (8 LED, 2 Quartz Tungsten Halogen, and 1 plasma) were calculated at distances of 2 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 5 Ocm and 60 using a spectroradiometer. A phantom head unit with acrylic teeth was used to assess the effect of different bracket materials (metal and aesthetic) on reflected light and the maximum daily exposure limits. The Farnsworth Munsell l 00 hue test was used to assess the colour discrimination and deficiency of 15 orthodontists and 15 controls. The results demonstrate that Orthodontists knowledge about the properties of light curing units that are important for orthodontic bonding and safety is low. Blue light hazard decreases as distance from the eye increases. Current light curing units a-re unlikely to reach maximal daily exposure for blue light at normal working distances. • Orthodontic bracket materials do affect reflected light but the differences are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Continued use of current dental light curing units does not lead to problems with colour discrimination. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Objective of the {{research}} was to study the frequency of stenosing laryngotracheitis (LT) and recurrent stenosing laryngotracheitis (RLT) incidences in children depending on ambient air pollutants concentration. Methods. The concentrations of suspended sediments, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, and formaldehyde in Vinnytsia within 1508 days (2000 – 2004) have been analyzed. All medical emergency calls caused by LT diagnosis (1 – 3 episodes of the disease) and RLT diagnosis (4 and > episodes of the disease) in children aged 0 – 14 years have been studied. Results. It has been established that a level of the atmospheric air pollution in Vinnytsia had been consistently high mainly due to formaldehyde, hydrogen fluoride and suspended sediments. The 1178 incidences of LT and 72 incidences of RLT were registered. The number of daily incidences of LT and RLT ranged from 0 to 6 and from 0 to 2, respectively. The average daily concentrations and daily 20 -minute maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride in air were higher on days with LT incidences than on days without LT incidences. The average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride during the observation period exceeded the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> average daily concentrations. The average of 20 -minute maximum of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride concentrations during the observation period did not exceed the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> single <b>exposure</b> concentrations. Direct weak correlations have been revealed between LT incidences in children and daily average concentrations and 20 -minute maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride in air. It hasn’t been revealed correlations between LT incidences and ambient air pollution by suspended sediments, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia and formaldehyde. There {{were no significant differences}} in average concentrations and 20 -minute maximum concentrations of air pollutants between days with RLT incidences and days without RLT incidences. Conclusions. The correlations between LT and ambient air pollution by nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride have been established.
