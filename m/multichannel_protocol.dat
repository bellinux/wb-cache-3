40|$|Wireless ad hoc {{networks}} typically {{make use}} of a single radio interface on a fixed chan-nel to communicate with neighboring nodes. Previous research has advocated {{the use of multiple}} wireless channels for enhancing the capacity of such networks. IEEE 802. 11 based wireless network interfaces are capable of communicating over multiple frequency separated channels. In existing system architectures the use of multiple channels can be supported provided every channel has one dedicated interface. However, in many scenarios, hosts will be equipped with fewer interfaces than available channels, requiring interfaces to be switched between channels. Implementing protocols, which require fre-quent switching, is nontrivial. In this thesis, we developed a system that supports the implementation of protocols which require frequent switching. Initially, the feasibility of implementing such protocols using currently available wireless interfaces and system software was studied.

Some examples of interface capabilities include the ability to set the channel of operation and data rate on a frequent basis, {{and the ability to}} equip devices with multiple radio interfaces and multiple antennas. It may be possible to significantly improve the performance of wireless networks by exploiting the interface capabilities through carefully designed protocols. However, current operating systems have poor support for implementing protocols that need to use the available interface capabilities. The goal of the Net-X project is to develop operating system support for utilizing interface capabilities.

However, the task of designing multiple access protocols for such networks is fraught with new challenges as the bandwidth independent overheads dominate. We show that even when such overheads are kept at a minimum, the performance of multiple access protocols can be very poor. However, performance can be improved significantly by splitting the given bandwidth into multiple channels and running the multiple access protocol independently on these channels. Taking an 802. 11 -like CSMA/CA (DCF) protocol as an example we show via a modeling exercise how such channelization can improve performance and why {{it needs to be}} adaptive to traffic demand. We develop an Adaptive Multichannel (AMC) protocol and study its performance via simulations. In addition, we also investigate a single-channel Extended-Reservation protocol in a high speed setting. Here, a sender, upon winning the contention, reserves the channel for multiple packet transmissions. We show that the Extended-Reservation protocol performs better than the single channel 802. 11 -like DCF protocol and is comparable to adaptive <b>multichannel</b> <b>protocol</b> (AMC), but it suffers from an inherent unfairness issue due to which many nodes starve for channel access.

These devices need to coexist {{and thus are}} challenged to tolerate their mutual interference. One {{way of dealing with}} this is by using frequency hopping; where the device changes its radio channel periodically. Consequently, communications will not suffer from the same interference each time; instead, it should be fairer and more stable. This thesis investigates the aforementioned problem in the field of low power wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things where Contiki OS is used. We introduce a low-power pseudo-random frequency-hopping MAC protocol which is specifically characterized as a duty cycled asynchronous sender-initiated LPL style protocol. We illustrate two flavors of the protocol; one that does not use any dedicated channel and another which allows dedicated broadcast channels that can implement frequency-hopping as well. We implement the protocol in C for real hardware and extensively test and evaluate it in a simulated environment which runs Contiki. It proved to work with Contiki's IPv 6 stack running RPL (the standardized routing protocol for low power and lossy wireless networks). We compare the performance of the implemented protocol to the singlechannel ContikiMAC with varying levels of interference. Results show a reduction down to 56 % less radio-on time (1. 50 % vs. 3. 4 %) and 85 % less latency (306 ms vs. 2050 ms) in the presence of noise, while keeping a good basecost in noise-free environments with 1. 29 % radio duty cycle when using 9 channels with no dedicated broadcast channels (vs. 0. 80 % for single channel) and 252 ms average latency(vs. 235 ms). Moreover, the results show that the <b>multichannel</b> <b>protocol</b> performance metrics converge to almost the same values regardless of the noise level.

We compare five protocols with respect to these strategies and identify altruistic DISH to be the right choice in general: it 1) conserves 40 - 80 percent of energy, 2) maintains the throughput advantage, and 3) more than doubles the cost efficiency compared to protocols without this strategy.
