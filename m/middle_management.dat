By the time he took power, Fiat's market share in Italy had fallen to 41% from around 62% in 1984.

25|$|The {{effects of}} the Vietnamization effort of 1970 carried over into Laos. An {{expanded}} training program for Lao T-28 pilots was begun. The B Team program was ended on 4 September 1970 as the supply of Lao pilots finally caught up to demand, the Thais having supplied ten drafts of pilots to the RLAF. A Combined Operations Center under Colonel Bouathong Phontivongsa coordinated air activities with the Army General Staff. The RLAF T-28s flew {{a greater proportion of}} their missions under Forward Air Control. However, the RLAF faced some major problems. Pilot mortality was one, with T-28 pilots surviving only an average of 20 months in combat. Also, by August 1970, smuggling had evolved to the point where 70 tons of M16 rifles and other ordnance were exchanged with the Nationalist Chinese for opium at Ban Houayxay. Another weak point, never really solved, was the dearth of qualified Lao maintenance and logistics personnel. An attempt to solve the shortage was made when all the RLAF T-28s were released from U. S. control to the RLAF, with an expanded training program being run, however <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> plus command and control skills were weak in the RLAF. Nevertheless, T-28 combat missions had reached the 30,000 sortie level by year's end. A Rand Corporation study characterized RLAF performance as outstanding, noting that some RLAF pilots had flown over 1,000 combat sorties to date.|$|E
500|$|During Browner's tenure, {{there were}} many reports from African American {{employees}} of racism directed at them from a network of [...] "good old boys" [...] who dominated the agency's <b>middle</b> <b>management.</b> The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000. Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist {{rather than trying to}} clean them up. In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter, Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency's senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo's case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted. Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA's treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.|$|E

The competence models in school management are utilizable in selective procedure concerning filling key management vacancies. The competence model of the specific position is also a tool for a feedback and evaluation.

500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Similar to {{the sticky}} floor, the frozen middle {{describes}} {{the phenomenon of}} women's progress up the corporate ladder slowing, if not halting, {{in the ranks of}} <b>middle</b> <b>management.</b> Originally the term referred to the resistance corporate upper management faced from <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> when issuing directives. Due to a lack of ability or lack of drive in the ranks of <b>middle</b> <b>management</b> these directives do not come into fruition and as a result the company's bottom line suffers.The term was popularized by a Harvard Business Review article titled [...] "Middle Management Excellence". Due to the growing proportion of women to men in the workforce, however, the term [...] "frozen middle" [...] has become more commonly ascribed to the aforementioned slowing of the careers of women in <b>middle</b> <b>management.</b> The 1996 study [...] "A Study of the Career Development and Aspirations of Women in Middle Management" [...] posits that social structures and networks within businesses that favor [...] "good old boys" [...] and norms of masculinity exist based on the experiences of women surveyed. According to the study, women who did not exhibit stereotypical masculine traits, (e.g. aggressiveness, thick skin, lack of emotional expression) and interpersonal communication tendencies are at an inherent disadvantage compared to their male peers. As the ratio of men to women increases in the upper levels of management, women's access to female mentors who could advise them on ways to navigate office politics is limited, further inhibiting upward mobility within a corporation or firm. Furthermore, the frozen middle affects female professionals in western and eastern countries such as the United States and Malaysia, respectively, as well as women in a variety of fields ranging from the aforementioned corporations to STEM fields.|$|E
