25|$|I am {{very proud}} of the 19 wickets I took against the Rest of the World, even though, laughably, they have now been officially deducted from <b>my</b> <b>Test</b> playing record. They were earned the hard way against the best batsmen in the world, each trying to upstage the rest...It was tough, very tough, but the whole {{exercise}} provided ideal practice for the coming tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970-71 were mentally {{the toughest}} English side I played against, and the {{experience}} of playing against them first up in <b>my</b> <b>Test</b> career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket was not for the faint of heart. Illingworth subjected us to a mental intimidation by aggressive field placings, and physical intimidation by constant use of his pace attack, ably led by one of the best fast bowlers of my experience, John Snow. Winning to Illingworth was something he expected of himself and demanded of his team.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on <b>my</b> <b>test</b> debut.|$|E

Waugh called this [...] "probably the most important hundred of <b>my</b> <b>Test</b> career ... word had reached me that if I didn't get runs, then I {{was going to be}} dropped".

[...] He further adds that, [...] "the prospect of playing 100 Tests had enormous appeal too… But, to be perfectly honest, the initial aim was just {{to get back in}} the starting side." [...] Campese was selected for the Australian team for the first eight Tests of their 1996 season, before being dropped following his 100th Test against Italy. He would play one more Test for Australia against Wales in the Wallabies final Test of the year.|$|E
2500|$|Greg Shipperd {{publicly}} {{suggested that}} Ponting could be selected as a reserve wicket-keeper {{for the upcoming}} West Indies tour, despite not keeping-wicket for Tasmania. However, he had kept wicket in pre-season matches and during centre wicket practice. In any case Ponting was selected as a specialist batsman. [...] "...It was like all my birthdays had come at once. I had some reservations about making <b>my</b> <b>Test</b> debut against arguably the best fast bowling attack in the world", Ponting later said. The West Indies had been cricket's powerhouse for close to two decades and teams included many feared fast bowlers. Before the tour, Australian captain Mark Taylor thought the last Test batting vacancy was possibly between Ponting and Justin Langer. [...] "Ricky Ponting is more the stroke player while Justin is the tough man. It depends on what we need at the time but you can probably say Ricky has his neck in front because he's been on this tour [...] ", Taylor said. Rod Marsh believed Ponting's attitude and fearless approach could tear the West Indies apart. Nevertheless, Ponting {{did not expect to}} be selected. Steve Waugh noted that Ponting would [...] "not be intimidated by the West Indians' inevitable waist-to-chin length." [...] During the series, Ponting said the current crop of bowlers were not [...] "of the same high class" [...] that opposition teams had come to expect from the West Indies.|$|E
