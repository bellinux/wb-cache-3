Jon Pareles of The New York Times cited Illmatic as a [...] "milestone in trying to capture the 'street ghetto essence'". The album has been described by a number of writers and critics as [...] "classic". Chris Ryan, writing in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called Illmatic [...] "a portrait of an artist as a hood, loner, tortured soul, juvenile delinquent, and fledgling social critic," [...] and wrote that it [...] "still stands as one of rap's crowning achievements".

500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for <b>me</b> <b>were</b> the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E
