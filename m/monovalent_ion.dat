40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is {{that the effect of}} acceleration by a quaternary salt is greater on the development rate of the divalent ion than on the rate of development of the <b>monovalent</b> <b>ion</b> of hydroquinone. The gross rate of development of a hydroquinone-sulfite developer was determined with and without a quaternary salt for a range of pH values. Comparison of the acceleration of catechol which is active as a <b>monovalent</b> <b>ion</b> with the acceleration of hydroquinone which is active mainly as a divalent ion was hoped to allow the separation of the hydroquinone gross rate into the contributions by the <b>monovalent</b> <b>ion</b> and the divalent ion. The quaternary salt complexed with catechol to form an insoluble salt making comparison of the acceleration effect not possible. Chlorohydroquinone was chosen and the rate of development with and without the quaternary salt was determined for a range of pH values. Separation of the contributions proved not to be possible so the hypothesis could not be tested. Over the pH ranges (9. 25 - 10. 35 for hydroquinone and 8. 33 - 9. 16 for chlorohydroquinone) the gross rate of development showed linearity (on log-log scale) with the <b>monovalent</b> <b>ion</b> and the divalent ion concentrations but was determined to be dependent only upon the divalent ion concentration for both developing agents whether unaccelerated or accelerated developers. Diffusion effects were important with the accelerated developers because of the high rate of development.

40|$|Rat basophilic leukaemia cells (RBL- 2 H 3 -M 1) {{were used}} to study the {{characteristics}} of the store-operated Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + current (ICRAC) and the magnesium-nucleotide-regulated metal cation current (MagNuM) (which is conducted by the LTRPC 7 channel). Pipette solutions containing 10 mm BAPTA and no added ATP induced both currents in the same cell, but the time to half-maximal activation for MagNuM was about two to three times slower than that of ICRAC. Differential suppression of ICRAC was achieved by buffering free [Ca 2 +]i to 90 nm and selective inhibition of MagNuM was accomplished by intracellular solutions containing 6 mm Mg. ATP, 1. 2 mm free [Mg 2 +]i or 100 μm GTP-γ-S, allowing investigations on these currents in relative isolation. Removal of extracellular Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + caused both currents to be carried significantly by <b>monovalent</b> <b>ions.</b> In the absence or presence of free [Mg 2 +]i, ICRAC carried by <b>monovalent</b> <b>ions</b> inactivated more rapidly and more completely than MagNuM carried by <b>monovalent</b> <b>ions.</b> Since several studies have used divalent-free solutions {{on either side of the}} membrane to study selectivity and single-channel behaviour of ICRAC, these experimental conditions would have favoured the contribution of MagNuM to monovalent conductance and call for caution in interpreting results where both ICRAC and MagNuM are activated...|$|R

30|$|It is {{concluded}} that the ion concentration in the filled solution will affect the EOF velocity by altering the zeta potential of EDL as suggested by Equations  1 and 2. A higher ion concentration of the solution results in lower EOF velocity due to the larger capability to balance the negative charges at the channel wall, and thus, the EDL will be narrowed. This character of variation of EDL can also be expressed by the Debye length which {{is closely related to}} the zeta potential as seen in Equation  3. A larger Debye length means a higher zeta potential of EDL and larger EOF velocity. It was reported that the Debye length of silica filled with a 10 μM <b>monovalent</b> <b>ion</b> solution was 100 nm, compared to 0.3 nm when silica was immersed in a 1 M <b>monovalent</b> <b>ion</b> solution[19].|$|E
