Since this time these trace elements are routinely added to fertilizers used in agriculture in this state. Many other soils around the world are deficient in zinc, leading to deficiency in both plants and humans, and zinc fertilizers are widely used to solve this problem.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>deficiencies</b> may be {{classified}} as a primary or a secondary deficiency depending {{on the characteristics of}} their development 1. Primary <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are the result of the consumption of feeds that are naturally low in one or more <b>minerals.</b> These <b>deficiencies</b> usually require {{an extended period of time}} for their development, often a year or more. The lack of supplemental mineral is a common characteristic of primary <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> as they occur rarely under normal well-managed cattle production systems. 2. Secondary <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are by far the most common of the two. Secondary deficiencies are derived from the consumption of one or more mineral antagonists that interfere with the normal metabolism of another mineral.

40|$|Vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiencies</b> {{remain a}} {{significant}} {{public health problem}} {{in many parts of}} the world, particularly in developing countries where deficiencies to vitamin A, iron, iodine and other micronutrients leads to adverse health consequences. These include diminished learning and development capacity of young children and reduced work capacity of adults, both of which contribute to poor socioeconomic condition of populations. The implementation of effective intervention programs to eliminate or reduce the prevalence of vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in populations requires a wide array of activities directed towards ensuring high coverage of interventions.

Periodic cross-sectional surveys are helpful in answering questions such as: What is the current magnitude and distribution of selected vitamin and <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiencies?</b> Has the prevalence of disease changed over time in comparison with previous surveys?

50|$|Concerns {{have also}} been raised that {{applying}} the BCSR methods to low CEC soils could lead to <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{because there are no}} minimum levels defined as meq/100g of soil. Hence, in very low CEC soils the amount of a certain element—though in correct proportion to others—may be too low for the needs of the crop. Another concern is that applications of CaCO3 and CaSO4 can lead to an overestimation of CEC. Aside from these worries, the general consensus is that the only negative effects for farmers using BCSR will be the unnecessary expense which could have been better spent on other sustainable agricultural practices whose benefits are well studied.|$|E

50|$|This {{disease has}} been {{recognized}} for over 150 years but its cause {{has not yet been}} completely defined. Currently the accepted potential causes of KBD include mycotoxins present in grain, trace <b>mineral</b> <b>deficiency</b> in nutrition, and high levels of fulvic acid in drinking water. Selenium and iodine have been considered the most important deficiencies associated with KBD. Mycotoxins produced by fungi can contaminate grain, which may cause KBD because mycotoxins cause the production of free radicals. T-2 is the mycotoxin implicated with KBD, produced by members of several fungal genera. T-2 toxin can cause lesions in hematopoietic, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, and cartilage tissues, especially in physeal cartilage. Fulvic acid present in drinking water damages cartilage cells. Selenium supplementation in selenium deficient areas has been shown to prevent this disease. However, selenium supplementation in some areas showed no significant effect, proving that deficiency of selenium may not be the dominant cause in KBD. Recently a significant association between SNP rs6910140 of COL9A1 and Kashin-Beck disease was discovered genetically, suggesting a role of COL9A1 in the development of Kashin-Beck disease.|$|E
