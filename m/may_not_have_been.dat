5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1828, however, it was {{suspended}} in June 1831 before {{the building has}} risen from its foundations. This may have been because the principal architect Harrison had died the previous year and Boffo working alone <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an option – his alterations to Harrison's plans for the Governor's residence in Odessa had been unfavourably received.|$|E

5|$|Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid {{spent the}} three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon. He {{occasionally}} performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river Humber. The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{allowed to return to}} Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court, but most historians have argued that Wilfrid was at Ripon.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012 the Israeli {{government}} set {{up another}} inquiry {{at the request}} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry.

5|$|On 24 February 1784, (Ash Wednesday), in {{a secret}} and well planned move, Tipu arrested {{a large number of}} Christians across the {{province}} of Canara and other parts of his kingdom.

The latter has facilitated disagreement amongst historians regarding his family and ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{probably}} {{constructed in the}} 12th century but fell out of use soon after. It is first mentioned in 1360 and {{by then it was}} lying derelict.

5|$|William's {{choice of}} Pevensey as a {{defensive}} location <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> entirely due to practical military reasons.

5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E
5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, but they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side}} of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts. Arguing that there was little evidence for how the faith was born, he suggested that the city of Mecca <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the real birthplace of Muhammad and Islam, and– while not clearly disputing Muhammad's existence as a real historical figure– claimed that much of the Islamic origin story was later developed {{in the early years of}} the Arab Empire.|$|E

5|$|After William's {{death the}} Historia was copied and {{circulated}} in the crusader states and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, James of Vitry {{had access to}} a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by Guy of Bazoches, Matthew Paris, and Roger of Wendover in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very widely read in its original form. In England, however, the Historia was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi, and the chronicle of Roger Hoveden; this version was written around 1220.|$|E
5|$|Details on the Mauretanian {{events of}} 39–44 are unclear. Cassius Dio wrote an entire chapter on the {{annexation}} of Mauretania by Caligula, {{but it is}} now lost. Caligula's move seemingly had a strictly personal political motive – fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy – and thus the expansion <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> prompted by pressing military or economic needs. However, the rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province, and it is thus possible that Caligula's expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats.|$|E

Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J.

The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E

The use of persuasive communication techniques, i.e, television and radio advertisements created positive attitude changes amongst shoppers who <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> necessarily <b>been</b> loyal to a particular supermarket, aiding the company to expand their consumer reach and market share. The Little Shopper promotion also created a buzz amongst the younger generations with reports of parents succumbing to the ‘pester-powers’ of their child’s fear of missing out.|$|R

During this same period, Osborn may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's pregnancy and the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were {{prosecuted for}} playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three {{reasons for the}} prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another {{reflected}} concern about church windows which may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> broken; the third was that a little childe had like to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman {{to hit the ball}} twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.|$|E
