5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E

5|$|As the war ended, the Holt {{company was}} left with huge surplus {{inventories}} of heavy-duty tractors ill-suited for the agricultural market, which had been dominated during the war by the Holt Company's primary competitor, C.L.Best.

5|$|Despite the British training, the SLA was {{not large}} enough or {{strong enough to}} enter into combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the British persuaded UNAMSIL to <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> behind the {{advancing}} SLA to defend its recaptured ground. Additional British liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the British facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces in drawing up a campaign plan.|$|E

5|$|Whitehead assumed {{command of}} the Fifth Air Force in June 1944, {{although}} he remained subordinate to Kenney.

The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft does not <b>move</b> <b>forward,</b> but hovers {{in front of}} the boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E
