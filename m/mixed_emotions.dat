40|$|Adults {{report more}} {{sequential}} and simultaneous experiences of <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> when using an analogue emotion scale (AES) than when completing rating scales {{due to the}} temporal dimension of the AES. Research is beginning to show that children experience <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> and report simultaneous experiences increasingly between 5 - 7 years. These reports however may misrepresent the type, and underestimate the frequency of, simultaneous experiences due to {{the limitations of the}} measures. This research piloted the utility of an adapted AES to assess subjective <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> types in childhood. 55 children (23 girls, 22 boys) aged between 4 years 2 months - 6 years 2 months (X= 5 years 3 months) participated in the research. They heard vignettes describing single happy, sad and <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> events in an age and gender matched protagonist and completed AES training and tests measures about the protagonists' experiences. Four different AES <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> types were found highlighting a broader range of <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> experiences than previously found and attesting to the utility of the adapted measure...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} concordance between child reported and adult observed strategies to depict single and <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> {{in the same}} human figure drawings. 205 children (104 boys, 101 girls) aged 6 years 2 months to 8 year 3 months formed two age groups (6 yrs. 2 mo. - 7 yrs. 2 mo. and 7 yrs. - 3 mo. - 8 yrs. - 3 mo.) across two conditions drawing either themselves or another child. They heard vignettes designed to elicit single and <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> and drew a baseline drawing, counterbalanced happy and sad, and a <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> drawing. Categories of children’s verbal reports and adults’ observations were similar with some variation of use by condition, age group and <b>emotion</b> type. <b>Mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> strategies were more similar to those observed and reported in happy drawings. Findings are discussed {{in relation to a}} framework theory of art and social display rules...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of {{simultaneous}} {{experiences of}} <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> {{have been found}} in adulthood using analogue emotion scales (AES) that measure subjective intensity and duration of two emotions in one graph. Children report simultaneous emotions increasingly between 5 and 7 years of age. These reports may underestimate the type of simultaneous experiences. This research piloted an extended interview and AES to assess subjective <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> types in childhood. One hundred and eighty children (91 girls, 89 boys) between 5 years 2 months and 7 years 3 months (M= 6 years 3 months) were allocated to two conditions (self: n= 90, other: n= 90), hearing a vignette describing a <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> event occurring either to another child or to themselves. Loglinear analysis of reported and graphed responses showed simple, sequential, prevalence, inverse, and highly simultaneous emotion experiences. Younger children reported more single and sequential experiences. Older children reported and graphed more simultaneous experiences. <b>Mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> varied by measure type with more prevalence experiences graphed than reported and more inverse experiences reported than graphed. The results indicate the potential for the utility of the adapted AES for use with children...|$|R
5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused <b>mixed</b> <b>emotions</b> amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E
5|$|Schwarzenegger {{remained}} attached, but Fox had <b>mixed</b> <b>emotions</b> with Hamm's script. When Columbus {{dropped out}} in late 1995 {{to work on}} Jingle All the Way, Fox offered the director's position to Roland Emmerich in January 1996. James Cameron was in talks during the filming of Titanic as writer and producer. Cameron's version would have drawn elements from the original film and its sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes. After the financial and critical success of Titanic, Cameron dropped out. After learning about his previous involvement, Chernin and Rothman met with Peter Jackson to learn about his original Renaissance idea. Jackson turned down directing the film with Schwarzenegger and Cameron as his producer, recognizing they would probably conflict over the direction. Schwarzenegger left to work on Eraser. Michael Bay then turned down the director's position. Jackson again turned down the project while facing the possible cancellation of The Lord of the Rings in 1998, because he was unenthusiastic following Roddy McDowall's death. In mid-1999, the Hughes brothers were interested in directing but were committed to From Hell.|$|E

It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences <b>mixed</b> <b>emotions</b> in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E

5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the <b>mixed</b> <b>emotions</b> he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The next season, Ottawa {{would be}} {{challenged}} {{to repeat the}} success they had in 2011–12, due to long-term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson, Jason Spezza, Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson. Despite these injuries, the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean {{would go on to}} win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year. Ottawa would play the second-seeded Montreal Canadiens {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, eventually winning in five games, blowing out Montreal 6–1 in games three and five. The Senators would advance to play the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round, this time losing in five games. During the off-season, the Senators traded veteran defenceman Sergei Gonchar to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2013. July 5, 2013 would be a day of <b>mixed</b> <b>emotions</b> for the city and fans, as long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings, leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain. The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization. The day finished optimistically however, as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and a first-round draft pick in 2014. Murray would also sign free agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two-year contract that same day and would sign free agent defenceman Joe Corvo to a one-year contract three days later on July 8.|$|E

Four log-linear models were performed to explore the association between exposure group and category of answer given in response to different <b>mixed</b> <b>emotion</b> facial stimuli. Model parameters indicated that, compared with nonexposed children, exposed children (a) labeled facial expressions containing anger and sadness significantly more often than expected as anger, and (b) produced fewer correct answers in response to stimuli containing sadness as a target emotion...|$|R

50|$|Simmel conveys how {{cohesion}} {{has played}} a role in distinguishing between a dyad a triad. Three main factors that have led to these diverse groups is justified by 1) Dyads result in less behavioral changes when compared to triads, 2) Bonds that coincide more with triads than dyads, and 3) Emotion plays a bigger role when communicating between two people (dyad) versus a group with three people (triad). The last factor is mainly because communication and trust can be altered when <b>mixing</b> <b>emotions</b> between relationships. While in a group of three people it is less likely because the majority constantly communicate and come to an agreement as to what is best.|$|R
