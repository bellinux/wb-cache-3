You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the <b>man</b> <b>you</b> think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} session, on June 15, five takes {{of the song}} were {{recorded}} in a markedly different style (3/4 waltz time, with Dylan on piano) from the eventual release. The lack of sheet music meant the song had to be played by ear. However, its essence was discovered {{in the course of}} the chaotic session. The musicians did not reach the first chorus until the fourth take, but after the following harmonica fill Dylan interrupted, saying, [...] "My voice is gone, <b>man.</b> <b>You</b> wanna try it again?" [...] This take was subsequently released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991. The session ended shortly afterward.|$|E
500|$|Isaac {{had been}} given letters of {{introduction}} {{to the director of}} the Paris Conservatoire, Luigi Cherubini, but he needed all his eloquence to persuade Cherubini even to give Jacob an audition. The boy's age and nationality were both obstacles to admission. Cherubini had several years earlier refused the 12-year-old Franz Liszt admission on similar grounds, but he eventually agreed to hear the young Offenbach play. He listened to his playing and stopped him, saying, [...] "Enough, young <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> are now a pupil of this Conservatoire." [...] Julius was also admitted. Both brothers adopted French forms of their names, Julius becoming Jules and Jacob becoming Jacques.|$|E
500|$|The anti-gang-violence [...] "Beat It" [...] {{became a}} homage to West Side Story and was Jackson's first {{successful}} rock cross-over piece. Jackson later said of [...] "Beat It", [...] "the point {{is no one}} has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be a <b>man.</b> <b>You</b> don't have to die to prove you're a man". [...] "Human Nature", co-written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto, is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, [...] "Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street".|$|E

500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of remorse}} by Waddle, plus {{reports in the}} Japanese media that Greeneville had {{made no effort to}} assist Ehime Maru survivors as they waited for almost one hour for rescue angered many Japanese citizens, especially the family members of the missing. [...] One Japanese family member publicly referred to Waddle as, [...] "the most terrible criminal of them all." [...] Another family member, referring to Waddle said, [...] "If you're a <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> should fall on your knees and ask for our pardon!" [...] In response, Waddle delivered letters of apology to the Japanese consulate in Hawaii for delivery to the victims' families during the last week of February.|$|E
500|$|On 9 October 1912, {{the driver}} of a horse-drawn {{carriage}} noticed a man crouching near {{the front door of}} the house of Countess Flora Sztaray, located on South Cliff Avenue in Eastbourne. Sztaray was known to possess large amounts of valuable jewellery and to be married to a rich Hungarian nobleman. The driver, who was Sztaray's coachman, informed Sztaray of the man's presence, whereupon Sztaray telephoned the police. Inspector Arthur Walls was sent to investigate. When Walls arrived on the scene, he observed a man lying on the portico above the front door. Walls called out, [...] "Now then, my <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> just come down." [...] The man fired two shots, the first of which struck and killed Walls.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, after scoring hits {{as a solo}} artist such as [...] "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" [...] and [...] "Wichita Lineman", Glen Campbell {{left the}} Wrecking Crew. [...] Carol Kaye, {{exhausted}} from the constant pressure of the L.A. recording scene, went on to other musical endeavors. [...] According to guitarist Bill Pitman, [...] "You leave the house at seven o'clock in the morning, and you're at Universal at nine till noon; now you're at Capitol Records at one, you just got time to get there, then you got a jingle at four, then we're {{on a date with}} somebody at eight, then the Beach Boys at midnight, and you do that five days a week... jeez, <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> get burned out".|$|E

500|$|In August 1964, Dickson {{managed to}} acquire an acetate disc of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", which he felt {{would make an}} {{effective}} cover for the Jet Set. [...] Although the band was initially unimpressed with the song, they began rehearsing it with a rock band arrangement, changing the time signature from 2/4 to a rockier 4/4 configuration in the process. [...] In an attempt to bolster the group's confidence in the song, Dickson invited Dylan himself to [...] World Pacific to hear the band perform [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man". [...] Impressed by the group's rendition, Dylan enthusiastically commented [...] "Wow, <b>man!</b> <b>You</b> can dance to that!", and his ringing endorsement erased any lingering doubts that the band had over the song's suitability.|$|E
500|$|However, Anderson {{conceded that}} Grade [...] "was not a <b>man</b> <b>you</b> could argue with. If he said [...] "No", {{you had to}} accept that he wouldn't change his mind." [...] Of Grade's decision, La Rivière conjectures, [...] "No one knows what was running through [...] mind ... but given {{the ease with which}} the 'Unwinese' element could have been removed [...] the series, it seems {{probable}} that he simply didn't like a lot of what he was seeing." [...] In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the Century 21 base at the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire for the commencement of filming on UFO, the Andersons' first full live-action series.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{aided by}} junior counsel Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, Stevenson defended Ruth Ellis against {{the charge of}} murdering her lover. Stevenson's {{decision}} to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum, and his [...] "near silent performance in court", have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: [...] "Let me make this abundantly plain: {{there is no question}} here but this woman shot this <b>man...</b> <b>You</b> will not hear one word from me– or from the lady herself– questioning that." [...] The jury took 23minutes to find Ellis guilty; she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom. Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1969.|$|E

500|$|Several {{tracks on}} Sir Lucious Left Foot contain humorous skits with {{dialogue}} from additional vocalists, including Chris Carmouche, Dax [...] "Dirty Dr." [...] Rudnak, Big Rube, Henry Welch, and Keisha Atwater. Welch and Carmouche are {{featured in a}} skit {{at the beginning of}} [...] "Be Still", in which they make a reference to [...] "tea bagging". Dax Rudnak concludes [...] "General Patton" [...] with a skit about a sex maneuver called [...] "the David Blaine", which according to the skit is [...] "when you’re making love to someone from behind, then have a friend take over and you run to a window and wave at your partner". In an interview for Time Out Chicago, Big Boi was asked whether he [...] " [...] taking credit for this, or is this something people do?", to which he responded [...] "Yeah, <b>man!</b> <b>You</b> know, man, they do it now!".|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become a <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> understand why." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Meredith, Mugabe {{presented}} himself as [...] "articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory" [...] after his 1980 election victory. Blair noted {{that at this}} period of his career, Mugabe displayed [...] "genuine magnanimity and moral courage" [...] despite his [...] "intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred" [...] toward {{the members of the}} former regime. Following his dealing with Mugabe during the 1979 negotiations, Michael Pallister, head of the British Foreign Office, described Mugabe as having [...] "a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner". The British diplomat Peter Longworth stated that in private, Mugabe was [...] "very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate the <b>man</b> <b>you</b> meet with the man ranting on television". Norman stated that [...] "I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings. He also had a warm side to him which I saw quite clearly sometimes".|$|E

500|$|Betrayal is the {{secondary}} theme of The Wild Bunch. [...] The characters suffer from {{their knowledge of}} having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them ("$10,000 cuts {{an awful lot of}} family ties"). However, Bishop says, [...] "When you side with a <b>man,</b> <b>you</b> stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal." [...] Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton (in flashback) when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery (ostensibly to guard the hostages). Critic David Weddle writes that [...] "like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish." ...|$|E
500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the <b>man</b> <b>you</b> have to know {{what was happening in the}} world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E
500|$|The story {{developed}} from the character of Mark, who {{is based on the}} first boyfriend of Duncan's oldest daughter. Duncan says he [...] "was a very sick young man, and he was the most charming young <b>man</b> <b>you</b> could ever meet" [...] but that it [...] "wasn't until things got very bad that we discovered {{he was the kind of}} guy who would swerve in the road to run over a dog." [...] She began to wonder what might happen if a charismatic teenage psychopath was placed in a high school setting and the young people he would attract as followers. 'Then I thought [...] "What could he make them do?" [...] The book moved from there.' Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful. Duncan wanted the character to be symbolic of a teacher who is not appreciated at the time, but later is.|$|E
