The mould inserts were manufactured usingclean room technologies. The combination of mould insert and <b>mould</b> <b>holder</b> allowed temperature control and vacuum application. Replication was realized using electrical commercially available μ-IM/μ-ICMequipment. In particular, the replication at the micrometric and sub-micrometric scales hasbeen explored. Material characterization {{was conducted to}} estimate the Cross-WLF viscosity model parameters using a nonlinear least square method. A 3 D-thermal study of the heat transfer inside the mould was developed on Comsol Multiphysics to simulate the thermal distribution over the contact surface between mould and mould insert in the μ-IM process. Finally, replication results were analyzed and discussed. Obtained results at microscale show high fidelity between the moulded parts and the mould. The μ-ICM shows better results than μ-IM at the sub-micrometric scale, as the fidelity increased...|$|E
