25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at <b>me.</b> <b>Instead,</b> you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E

In these two cities alone more than four hundred thousand people saw the exhibition. [...] "The river comes to <b>me</b> <b>instead</b> of my going to the river," [...] wrote Longfellow. Whittier, after seeing a panorama, sang of the [...] "new Canaan of our Israel," [...] and Thoreau, who not only viewed a panorama but also made the tour itself, envisaged a coming heroic age in which simple and obscure men, the real heroes of history, would build the foundations of new castles n the West and throw bridges across a [...] "Rhine stream of a different kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of <b>me</b> <b>instead</b> of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E

The audience had been giggling at the absurd plot even before this simian had at me. Now it became hysterical. What did Tallulah do in this crisis? I turned a cartwheel! The audience roared...

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at <b>me</b> <b>instead</b> of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Negotiations for the writer's return {{came to an}} end {{after the}} {{publication}} of his Memoirs (Воспоминания, 1950), full of scathing criticism of Soviet cultural life. Apparently aware of his own negativism, Bunin wrote: [...] "I was born too late. If I had been born earlier, my literary memoirs would have been different. I wouldn't have been a witness to 1905, the First World War, then 1917 and what followed: Lenin, Stalin, Hitler... How can I not be jealous of our forefather Noah. He lived through only one flood in his lifetime". Reportedly, the infamous Zhdanov decree {{was one of the reasons}} for Bunin's change of mind. On 15 September 1947, Bunin wrote to Mark Aldanov: [...] "I have a letter here from Teleshov, written on September 7; 'what a pity (he writes) that you've missed all of this: how your book was set up, how everybody was waiting for you here, in the place where you could have been... rich, feasted, and held in such high honour!' Having read this I spent an hour hair-tearing. Then I suddenly became calm. It just came to me all of a sudden all those other things Zhdanov and Fadeev might have given <b>me</b> <b>instead</b> of feasts, riches and laurels..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying the {{directors}} were skilled at [...] "springing surprises" [...] from the writers' [...] "ingenious" [...] screenplay. Peter Debruge of Variety wrote, [...] "Since villains so often steal the show in animation, Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru." [...] Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "The result is pleasant and diverting, if ultimately forgettable, and it's one of the rare instances in the recent history of 3-D's resurrection as The Savior of Cinema in which the technology doesn't dim the screen or distract the focus." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "The setup is pure Looney Tunes, and indeed, Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery that was a specialty of the Termite Terrace crowd." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Neither as rich in story nor stunning in animation as Pixar offerings, Despicable <b>Me</b> <b>instead</b> settles for simply being goofy good fun, and it hardly seems like settling at all." ...|$|E
