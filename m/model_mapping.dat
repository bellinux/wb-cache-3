40|$|Abstract: <b>Model</b> <b>mapping</b> faces many {{challenging}} {{tasks and}} contemporary work seems {{to focus on}} computational issues. As a result it seems to lack an overarching theoretical framework whereby all aspects of <b>model</b> <b>mapping</b> can be investigated systematically. We maintain that the principles of semiotics may well provide theoretical foundations for developing such a framework. In this chapter we report our preliminary work on using semiotics in investigating mapping determination and creation between two independently created models across heterogeneous data sources. By employing semiotic principles, we develop a novel approach to <b>model</b> <b>mapping</b> as sign exchange. We give {{an analysis of the}} triadic relationship among data, information and knowledge concerning syntactics, semantics and pragmatics of signs. We present a conceptual view of sign interchange and propose an abstract architecture of information flow between two logic covers that is based upon our model of minimal mapping covers. This minimal mapping cover forms the basis of a set of signs participating in determining and establishing a set of correspondences between two disparate models. Our work considers a set of mappings at three semiotic levels and proposes a notion of the information bearing capability of signs. Our work thus far seems to show that semiotics principles do provide insight in tackling the complexity involved in <b>model</b> <b>mapping,</b> in particular the issue of “meaning”.

40|$|The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) {{aimed to}} produce {{applications}} that support multiple platforms using models {{instead of the}} conventional coding with less cost and time. The MDA development process separated to Platform Independent Model (PIM) and Platform Specific Model (PSM). Both, PIM and PSM are standing in different level of abstraction. The PIM focused on the business rules definition with no concern about the platform environment. It is the PSM role to emphasis on the implementation environment of the targeted platform. Although, the PSM models holding some technical implementation details about the targeted platform, but it's still considered too abstract to be executed in a run-time platform environment.

40|$|A <b>model</b> <b>map</b> Q for the Hopf-saddle-node (HSN) {{bifurcation}} {{of fixed}} points of diffeomorphisms is studied. The model is constructed {{to describe the}} dynamics inside an attracting invariant two-torus which occurs due {{to the presence of}} quasi-periodic Hopf bifurcations of an invariant circle, emanating from the central HSN bifurcation. Resonances of the dynamics inside the two-torus attractor yield an intricate structure of gaps in parameter space, the so-called Arnol’d resonance web. Particularly interesting dynamics occurs near the multiple crossings of resonance gaps, where a web of hyperbolic periodic points is expected to occur inside the two-torus attractor. It is conjectured that heteroclinic intersections of the invariant manifolds of the saddle periodic points may give rise to the occurrence of strange attractors contained in the two-torus. This is a concrete route to the Newhouse-Ruelle-Takens scenario. To understand this phenomenon, a simple <b>model</b> <b>map</b> of the standard two-torus is developed and studied and the relations with the starting <b>model</b> <b>map</b> Q are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{solution}} of complex, unstructured problems {{is faced with}} policy controversy and dispute, unused and misused knowledge, project delay and failure, and decline of public trust in governmental decisions. Mental <b>model</b> <b>mapping</b> (also called concept mapping) is a technique to analyse these difficulties on a fundamental cognitive level, which can reveal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, knowledge and subjective beliefs of stakeholders, experts and other actors, and can stimulate communication and learning. This article presents the theoretical framework from which the use of mental <b>model</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques to analyse this type of problems emerges as a promising technique. The framework consists of the problem solving or policy design cycle, the knowledge production or modelling cycle, and the (computer) model as interface between the cycles. Literature attributes difficulties {{in the decision-making process}} to communication gaps between decision makers, stakeholders and scientists, and to the construction of knowledge within different paradigm groups that leads to different interpretation of the problem situation. Analysis of the decision-making process literature indicates that choices, which are made in all steps of the problem solving cycle, are based on an individual decision maker’s frame of perception. This frame, in turn, depends on the mental model residing {{in the mind of the}} individual. Thus we identify three levels of awareness on which the decision process can be analysed. This research focuses on the third level. Mental models can be elicited using mapping techniques. In this way, analysing an individual’s mental model can shed light on decision-making problems. The steps of the knowledge production cycle are, in the same manner, ultimately driven by the mental models of the scientist in a specific discipline. Remnants of this mental model can be found in the resulting computer model. The characteristics of unstructured problems (complexity, uncertainty and disagreement) can be positioned in the framework, as can the communities of knowledge construction and valuation involved in the {{solution of}} these problems (core science, applied science, and professional consultancy, and “post-normal” science). Mental model maps, this research hypothesises, are suitable to analyse the above aspects of the problem. This hypothesis is tested for the case of the Zwolle storm surch barrier. Analysis can aid integration between disciplines, participation of public stakeholders, and can stimulate learning processes. Mental <b>model</b> <b>mapping</b> is recommended to visualise the use of knowledge, to analyse difficulties in problem solving process, and to aid information transfer and communication. Mental <b>model</b> <b>mapping</b> help scientists to shape their new, post-normal responsibilities in a manner that complies with integrity when dealing with unstructured problems in complex, multifunctional systems...|$|E

In {{this paper}} we propose <b>model</b> <b>maps</b> to derive and repre-sent the {{intrinsic}} functional geometry of a brain from {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data for a specific task. <b>Model</b> <b>maps</b> repre-sent the coherence of behavior of individual fMRI-measurements for a set of observations, or a time sequence.
