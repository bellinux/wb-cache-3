40|$|A case of von Recklinghausen's {{disease with}} <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> is {{described}} in which death was caused by intracerebral haemorrhage due to metastatic angiosarcoma. The primary site was a peripheral nerve tumour which, on microscopic examination, showed both angiosarcoma and neurofibrosarcoma with transitional zones between the two. This is interpreted as another example of divergent differentiation in malignant nerve sheath tumours, and the case is compared with the two similar examples found in the literature...|$|E
40|$|<b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>NEUROFIBROMATOSIS</b> {{associated}} with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has been de-scribed in two previous case reports. Crowe, Schull, and Neel (1) reported one patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in their extensive stud-ies on neurofibromatosis. Goodman, Levitsky, and Friedman (2) have reported a kindred in which members of four generations exhibited features of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and three generations were involved by neurofibro-matosis, {{with a total of}} five individuals mani-festing both syndromes. This report deals with several unusual clinical features of an addi-tional case in which each of these rare syn-dromes occurred together in a severely disabling form...|$|E

40|$|Gigantism of {{the lower}} limb can occur because of plexif-orm neurofibromas. This {{condition}} is seen with café au lait patches and <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> in this case of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. We report our patient and review literature of this uncommon condition. Key words: plexiform neurofibroma, lower limb gigantism, von Recklinghausen Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (VRN) is anautosomal dominant disorder characterized by café au lait patches and multiple fibromatoses. We re-port a case of VRN associated with plexiform neurofibromatosis causing lower limb gigantism. In 1956, Crowe et al suggested that 6 café au lait patches, each greater than 1. 5 cm in size, with fibromatoses were essential to make a diagnosis of VRN...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological features of <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (von Recklinghausen's disease) are usually striking and often rather bizarre. It has hence attracted much interest and is well described and illustrated. Recent accounts include those by Willis (1958) and Russell and Rubinstein (1959); a fuller review in German by Schmincke (1956) is mainly {{devoted to the}} description and inter-pretation of the nerve lesions. Of the many earlier reports, that of Preiser and Davenport (1918) retains, perhaps, most of its interest. The disease {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of multiple dysplasic and proliferative changes in nerves, the central nervous system and other tissues. The skin is commonly affected, showing patch...|$|E
40|$|A {{malignant}} {{peripheral nerve}} sheath tumor (MPNST) {{is an extremely}} rare soft tissue tumor in the general population. On the other hand, there is {{a higher incidence of}} MPNST in patients with neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen's disease). The common sites are the extremities, trunk, head and neck. However, an intraabdominal or intrathoracic manifestation is uncommon. This paper reports two patients, a 31 year-old woman with <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> presenting as an intraabdominal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and a 33 year-old woman with an intrathoracic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The patients were treated with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. However, one patient {{died as a result of}} disease progression 21 months after the diagnosis and the other patient is currently being treated with radiotherapy...|$|E
50|$|Chiasmal {{syndrome}} is {{the set of}} signs and symptoms {{that are associated with}} lesions of the optic chiasm, manifesting as various impairments of the sufferer's visual field according to the location of the lesion along the optic nerve. Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause; however, chiasmal syndrome may be caused by cancer, or associated with other medical conditions such as <b>multiple</b> sclerosis and <b>neurofibromatosis.</b>|$|R
40|$|It is a {{very rare}} {{condition}} possibly linked to <b>neurofibromatosis.</b> <b>Multiple</b> large histiocytic fibromas extend to the long bones of one or both lower limbs or to the four limbs with prevalence in {{one side of the}} body and even including the pelvis. Café au lait spots are usually seen. Occasionally, mental retardation, hypogonadism or cryptorchidism, ocular and cardiovascular anomalies, and other skin alterations suggestive of neurofibromatosis are associated...|$|R
40|$|Intracerebral meningiomas and {{cavernous}} hemangiomas (hemangiomas, cavernomas) are entities frequently {{encountered by}} neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons. Even multiple tumors {{can often be}} observed in patients with certain congenital conditions, eg. <b>multiple</b> meningiomas in <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 2 or multiple cavernous hemangiomas in familial cavernous malformations. However, there are only very few reported cases of concurrent meningiomas and cavernous hemangiomas, all but one related to prior radiotherapy. We describe the second case of concurrent multiple meningiomas and cavernous hemangiomas occurring de novo without a history of radiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} 14 {{children}} with <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (von Recklinghausen's disease) {{seen at the}} Lagos University Teaching Hospital within a six-year period (1979 - 1985) has been conducted. Eight patients were boys and six were girls. The youngest was aged 3 months. The cafe-au-lait spots that were observed in all these patients showed poor color contrast, thus making this condition not easily discernible in infancy and an early diagnosis difficult. These spots are perhaps better called “cafe-sans-lait” or blackish-brown spots in the African patient. Hyperpigmented patches were observed in eight (57 percent) patients and multiple, grotesque, soft tissue swellings were observed in ten (71 percent) others. Prolonged follow-up is mandatory in these patients so as {{to provide them with}} a better quality of life...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of pheochromocytoma rests primarily on {{determination of the}} 24 -hour urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. In most cases nephrotomography and selective arteriography or venography, or both, are sufficient to localize the tumour. Selective venous catheterization and the assay of plasma catecholamines should be considered for pheochromocytoma localization in: (a) patients in whom standard techniques fail to localize the tumour; (b) patients who exhibit idiosyncratic reactions to the angiographic contrast materials; (c) young patients or patients with familial pheochromocytoma, including those with <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> or multiple endocrine adenomatosis, type 2; (d) patients with recurrent, malignant, or suspected multicentric or extra-adrenal tumours; and (e) patients excreting only norepinephrine in the urine. The validity of the results is particularly dependent on the skill with which venous catheterization is carried out...|$|E
40|$|Solitary neurofibromas are rare, benign tumours of nonodontogenic origin. The {{presentation}} of a solitary neurofibroma on the tongue is an uncommon occurrence and we present such a case here which was discovered in concomitance with <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 1 (von Recklinghausen’s disease). Such a rare presentation seen {{in this case is}} a diagnostic challenge and often clinched only with the aid of histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. This work also discusses the various differential diagnoses that can be considered in similar cases. The presence of a hypertrichotic “giant” nevus spilus tardivus (Becker’s nevus) is also a rare finding in this particular case. We present such a case which will be of interest to the budding dental practitioner. The lesion was excised and the patient followed up without any evidence of malignant transformation...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{scientific}} teams {{worked in}} the 1970s and 1980s to identify genes and their loci {{as a cause of}} cystic fibrosis. Progress was modest until 1985, when Lap-Chee Tsui and colleagues at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children identified the locus for the gene. [...] It was then determined that a shortcut was needed to speed the process of identification, so Tsui contacted Collins, who agreed to collaborate with the Toronto team and share his chromosome-jumping technique. The gene was identified in June 1989, and the results were published in the journal Science on September 8, 1989. This identification was followed by other genetic discoveries made by Collins and a variety of collaborators. They included isolation of the genes for Huntington's disease, <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> <b>multiple</b> endocrine neoplasia type 1, inv(16) AML and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Characteristic skin {{neoplasms}} {{are associated}} with a large number of hereditary tumor syndromes and their knowledge and early detection may facilitate the diagnosis of the underlying malignancies. We will review the clinical and dermatopathological aspects of cutaneous and visceral lesions and the recent progresses in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis and therapies of selected tumor syndromes. The skin neoplasms we chose to consider are <b>multiple</b> neurofibromas in <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> cylindromas and trichoepitheliomas in Broke-Spiegler syndrome, sebaceous tumors and keratoacanthomas in Muir-Torre syndrome, Gardner fibromas in Gardner syndrome, multiple basal cell carcinomas in nevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin) syndrome, multiple tricholemmomas in Cowden syndrome, multiple fibrofolliculomas in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and multiple leiomyomas in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Hereditary cancers have distinct biological and clinical features as compared to their sporadic counterparts; for this reason, we are now able to experiment new treatment approaches involving not only tumor detection and prevention, but also tailored therapeutic strategies focusing on the peculiar druggable molecular targets...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{studies in}} the recent decades lead to the {{identification}} of new genetic mutations that {{have been shown to}} play detrimental roles in the formation of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. The majority of these genetic mutations detected affect two major cellular pathways – pseudo hypoxic pathway and kinase signalling pathway. Genetic mutations also resulted in syndromes related to paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. The classical syndromes comprise - <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> <b>multiple</b> neuroendocrine neoplasia (MEN) (II and III) syndromes and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Also, mutations in succinate dehydrogenase genes contribute to the understanding of hereditary paragangliomapheochromocytoma syndromes, Carney’s triad and Carney- Stratakis syndrome. Lesions newly known {{to be associated with the}} genetic mutations in pheochromocytoma/ paraganglioma include gastrointestinal stromal tumour and renal cell carcinoma. Pathological features, proliferative index, genetic and biochemical parameters could help to predict the malignant potential of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. Different predictive systems have been proposed and with the help of immunochemical studies. Pathologist should be aware of the advances in knowledge and contribute to the validation of the pathological features and markers for prediction of malignant potential of this group of tumours.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of adrenal {{pheochromocytoma}} in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). A 65 -year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital for examination of a right adrenal mass. The adrenal tumor was incidentally discovered by abdominal computed tomography during examination for hypertension in another hospital. She had large multiple neurofibromatous lesions and café-au-lait spots on the trunk. We {{thought that it was}} difficult to make a skin incision on normal skin. Serum and urinary catecholamines were markedly increased. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid round tumor 3 cm in diameter, located in the right adrenal gland. Laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed. Serum and urinary catecholamines returned to the normal range on post-operative day 10. Laparoscopic surgery may be a good option for NF 1 patients with pheochromocytoma, especially those who had <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> on the trunk...|$|E
40|$|Duedonal diverticulosis {{is common}} in {{clinical}} practice. Most of duedonal diverticulosis {{is located at the}} second part of duodenum; incidence is reported as 67 %, incidence of third and forth part is % 20. Multiple diverticulosis of {{the first part of the}} duodenum is a rare case. There is not any knowledge togetherness of neurofibromatosis type 1 and duedonal diverticulosis. Here we reported incidentally diagnosed multiple diverticulosis of duodenum that is located in the first part in a neurofibromatosis type 1 patient with <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> nodules. Neurofibromatosis could affect various organs. Along the digestive system carcinoid tumors and neuroendocrine tumors are more encountered diseases. Endoscopic examinations and abdominal imaging may be useful for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal coexisting disease in neurofibromatosis type 1. In conclusion neurofibromatosis type 1 could affect multiple systems and it should evaluate carefully...|$|E
40|$|Fibromas present very {{frequent}} skin neoplasms {{in different}} species of wild game of the family Cervidae. Viral etiology of skin neoplasms was proven in certain species of wild game from this family, with the most frequent diagnoses being: fibromas, ossifying fibromas, fibrosarcomas, <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> fibropapillomas, and papillomas. The diagnozed tumor in the roe deer had the histological characteristics of a polimorphous fibroblast, {{which is not the}} case with domestic animals. This finding can be considered as a characteristic of fibromas in animals of the family Cervidae. Solitary fibroma or multiple fibroma (fibromatosis) does not present a significant cause of deer deaths, but they cause concern among hunters who are in direct contact with them. Although fibromas do not lead to spoilage of game meat, they are esthetically repellent and people are reluctant to consume meat of such game...|$|E
40|$|Extreme {{physical}} {{size and}} stature (gigantism) {{is a rare}} condition in childhood, {{and when it is}} present it is rarely due to growth hormone (GH) excess, but more frequently of genetic etiology (familial tall stature, Klinefelter syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, etc.). GH hypersecretion is usually by pituitary adenomas, even though other cases such as somatotroph hyperplasia may be involved. Endocrine gigantism typically occurs as an isolated disorder, but it may also be a feature of some syndromes such as <b>neurofibromatosis,</b> <b>multiple</b> endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) or McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). In its classic form, MAS is characterised by precocious puberty, cafè-au-lait skin spots, and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. An unusual form of this complex, heterogeneous disorder may arise in conjunction with GH excess and/or other endocrinopathies and abnormalities. In the literature there are very few case reports of MAS associated with GH excess that are caused by secreting pituitary adenomas. Most are reported as acromegaly since they are diagnosed in the third decade of life. Paediatric reports are even more uncommon. Herein we describe the case of an 11 year-old boy with GH hypersecretion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} prevalence, geographic distribution and mutation spectrum of genetic skeletal disorders (GSDs) in China. This study systematically reviewed GSDs as defined in “Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders (2010 version) ” using Chinese biomedical literature published over the past 34 years from 1978 to 2012. In total, 16, 099 GSDs have been reported. The most frequently reported disorders were Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, mucopolysaccharidosis, <b>multiple</b> cartilaginous exostoses, <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 1 (NF 1), osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, enchondromatosis (Ollier), and osteopoikilosis, accounting for 76. 5 % (12, 312 cases) of the total cases. Five groups (group 8, 12, 14, 18, 21) defined by “Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders” have not been reported in the Chinese biomedical literature. Gene mutation testing was performed in only a minor portion of the 16, 099 cases of GSDs (187 cases, 1. 16 %). In total, 37 genes for 41 different GSDs were reported in Chinese biomedical literature, including 43 novel mutations. This review revealed a significant imbalance in rare disease identification in terms of geographic regions and hospital levels, suggesting the need to create a national multi-level network to meet the specific challenge of care for rare diseases in China. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Meningiomas {{may occur}} either as {{familial}} tumors in two distinct disorders, familial <b>multiple</b> meningioma and <b>neurofibromatosis</b> 2 (NF 2), or sporadically, as either single or multiple tumors in individuals with no family history. Meningiomas in NF 2 and approximately 60 % of sporadic meningiomas involve inactivation of the NF 2 locus, encoding the tumor suppressor merlin on chromosome 22 q. This study was undertaken to establish whether genomic profiling could distinguish familial multiple meningiomas from sporadic solitary and sporadic multiple meningiomas. Methods We compared 73 meningiomas presenting as sporadic solitary (64), sporadic multiple (5) and familial multiple (4) tumors using genomic profiling by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). Results Sporadic solitary meningiomas revealed genomic rearrangements consistent {{with at least}} two mechanisms of tumor initiation, as unsupervised cluster analysis readily distinguished tumors with chromosome 22 deletion (associated with loss of the NF 2 tumor suppressor) from those without chromosome 22 deletion. Whereas sporadic meningiomas without chromosome 22 loss exhibited fewer chromosomal imbalance events overall, tumors with chromosome 22 deletion further clustered into two major groups that largely, though not perfectly, matched with their benign (WHO Grade I) or advanced (WHO Grades II and III) histological grade, with the latter exhibiting a significantly greater degree of genomic imbalance (P Conclusion Genomic profiling can provide an unbiased adjunct to traditional meningioma classification and provides a basis for exploring the different genetic underpinnings of tumor initiation and progression. Most importantly, the striking difference observed between sporadic and familial multiple meningiomas indicates that genomic profiling can provide valuable information for differential diagnosis of subjects with multiple meningiomas and for considering the risk for tumor occurrence in their family members. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen {{cases of}} {{malignant}} peripheral nerve tumors that {{were recorded in}} the files of the Department of Orthopedics, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, between 1972 —July 1983 were studied clinicopathologically.

Histologically, in 13 cases of nerve sheath tumors the tumors were spindle-cell type, two of these patients had manifestation of <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (von Recklinghausen's disease). One malignant epithelioid schwannoma was found to arise from the tibial nerve. Other two cases were of primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors (primary malignant peripheral neuroblastoma) which showed rosette formation. The common primary symptoms in all patients were a notice-able mass which increased in size over a variable period of time, with or without associated pain and tenderness.

40|$|Background: There {{are four}} major lesions which may {{arise in the}} {{peripheral}} nerve, namely neuroma, schwannoma, neurofibroma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Objective: In the present study we look into the spectrum of peripheral neural tumors including their age distribution site distribution and histopathology. Materials and methods: This is retrospective study conducted in the Dept of Pathology, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara. All histopathologically diagnosed cases of primary lesions of peripheral nerve during the period Jan 2000 to Nov 2009 were reviewed and the data were analysed. Result: A total of 114 cases of peripheral neural lesions were reported in the same period. Total number of nonmalignant cases was 106 (93 %) while malignant cases were 8 (7 %). Among the nonmalignant cases neurofiboma was the commonest (51 cases, 45 % of all) closely followed by schwannoma (39 cases, 34 % of all). Among the neurofibroma cases only 2 cases had <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> while others were solitary. Among the schwannoma cases 4 were diagnosed as ancient schwannoma with presence of bizarre cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. The commonest site involved for both schwannoma and neurofibroma was scalp-face-neck followed by back. The age range for schwannoma was 16 to 75 years whereas {{the same for the}} neurofibroma cases was 2 to 82 years. MPNST cases were seen in the age range of 40 t...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A case is {{reported}} {{of the rare}} lesion occult intrasacral meningocoele in a 27 -year-old woman who developed symptoms {{for the first time}} shortly after the birth of her fourth child. The terminology of the condition is discussed and its pathogenesis, mode of presentation, and treatment reviewed. The term 'occult intrasacral meningocoele ' first used by Enderle (1932) describes the condition of ab-normal dilatation of the meninges {{within the confines of the}} sacral spinal canal. Various workers have pointed out that this term is not strictly accurate in that a meningocoele implies a hernial protrusion of the meninges through a defect in the skull or verte-bral column. Thus, Howieson, Norrell, and Wilson (1968) prefer to speak of 'expansion of the subarach-noid space in the lumbosacral region'. In two of their cases the expanded thecal sac terminated at the normal level, with <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> as an associated feature. It would seem better to reserve the description of Howieson and colleagues for these latter cases. The prolongation of the subarachnoid space beyond the normal level is probably better described as a caudal diverticulum of the thecal sac. In practice, there is much in favour of retaining the designation 'occult intrasacral meningocoele ' if the original idea of an abnormal prolongation of the meninges within the sacral spinal canal is respected. This would remove the confusion in nomenclature caused by the inclusion of such entities as perineural cysts, meningeal cysts, spinal extradural cysts, and anterior sacral meningocoele...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{malignant}} {{peripheral nerve}} sheath tumor (MPNST) {{is a rare}} sarcoma, characterized by an aggressive course and forms a diagnostic challenge, in view of its varied histomorphology. The present study is a comprehensive analysis, including histopathological spectrum of 63 MPNSTs that forms a substantial study from an Indian perspective. Materials and Methods: Clinicopathological features of 63 MPNSTs, diagnosed during a period from January 2002 to December 2006, at a tertiary cancer referral center in Mumbai, India, were analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS (version 14) and STRATA. Difference in events was noted in 50 cases with selected variables. Disease free survival (DFS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meir analysis {{at the end of}} 1 year. Results: More cases were identified in > 30 years age (36 cases, 57. 14 &#x 0025;) group; in men (46 cases, 73 &#x 0025;), and were deep-seated (38, 60. 3 &#x 0025;). Ten cases (15. 9 &#x 0025;) showed stigmata of <b>multiple</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> type 1. Average tumor (T) size was 9. 9 cm, with 72. 9 &#x 0025; cases having T size > 5 cm. More cases were of high grade (56, 88. 8 &#x 0025;) and high stage (22, 34. 9 &#x 0025;). Histopathologically, most cases showed hypo- and hypercellular areas (marbleized appearance) of doubly indented spindle cells. Two cases showed epithelioid differentiation. Heterologous elements in the form of osteoid, chondroid, pigmented neuroectodermal (1 case), glandular (1 case) and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation (1 case) were identified in 14 cases (22. 2 &#x 0025;). S- 100 protein positivity was noted in 38 / 54 cases (70. 3 &#x 0025;). Maximum cases (45, 71. 4 &#x 0025;) underwent surgery, including wide excisions and amputations (R 0) in 20 cases, marginal excisions (R 1) in 4, and intracapsular excision (R 2) in 1 case. Nineteen cases underwent adjuvant treatment. A total of 29 cases (46 &#x 0025;) showed recurrences and 22 (34. 9 &#x 0025;) showed multifocality and/or metastasis. Four patients succumbed to the disease in 1 year. The DFS was 53. 1 &#x 0025;. Cases &# 8804; 30 years of age (P - value = 0. 007), T size > 5 cm, and with high grade (P = 0. 18) and stage (P = 0. 00) showed more recurrences, metastasis, and death. Conclusions: A MPNST has multifaceted histomorphology. Its objective identification necessitates the incorporation of clinicopathological features and IHC with S- 100 protein. Younger age, high grade and stage, and increased T size significantly relate to aggressive disease. Wide excision forms the optimal treatment with options of adjuvant CT/RT in individual cases...|$|E
