5|$|Kanō also {{oversaw the}} {{development}} and growth of his judo organization, the Kodokan. This was a remarkable effort in itself, as the Kodokan's enrollment grew from {{fewer than a dozen}} students in 1882 to more than a thousand dan-graded <b>members</b> <b>by</b> 1911.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family <b>members</b> <b>by</b> putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E

5|$|Eddy and 26 {{followers}} {{were granted}} a charter in 1879 to found the Church of Christ, Scientist, and in 1894 the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, {{was built in}} Boston, Massachusetts. Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 <b>members</b> <b>by</b> 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000. The church {{is known for its}} newspaper, the Christian Science Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its Reading Rooms, which {{are open to the public}} in around 1,200 cities.|$|E
5|$|IABC had {{financial}} {{troubles in}} 2000 after losing $1 million in an e-business initiative called TalkingBusinessNow. In 2001 a grass-roots initiative was started within IABC's membership that eventually developed into the Gift of Communication program, whereby members donated their professional services to local charities. Membership grew 79 percent {{each year in}} the 2000s due to an increasing number of practitioners in the field of internal communications. IABC hosted its first annual world conference in 2005 and grew to more than 16,000 <b>members</b> <b>by</b> 2008.

5|$|In 1962, Arafat and {{his closest}} companions {{migrated}} to Syria—a country sharing a border with Israel—which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt. Fatah had approximately three hundred <b>members</b> <b>by</b> this time, but none were fighters. In Syria, {{he managed to}} recruit <b>members</b> <b>by</b> offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), the regular military force of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which {{was created by the}} Arab League in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from al-Assifa, Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions. Arafat often led these incursions personally.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, three Avro 748s were {{in service}} {{and two of}} Skyways Coach-Air's Dakotas were {{converted}} to freighters. During the winter of 1962–63, the 748s continued to operate a normal service out of Lympne. In October 1964, Skyways Coach-Air moved out of its London offices and all operations were now at Lympne, although a sales office was retained in London. The Cinque Ports Flying Club was restarted in 1964 by Barry Damon and had 120 <b>members</b> <b>by</b> 1968. The club aircraft were a Beechcraft Bonanza, Beechcraft Musketeers and a Bölkow Monsun.|$|E
5|$|Initially a {{force of}} a dozen men {{under the auspices of}} the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) grew to become one of the largest and most {{powerful}} groups in Nazi Germany. Led by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler from 1929, the SS had over a quarter million <b>members</b> <b>by</b> 1938 and continued to grow. Himmler envisioned the SS as being an elite group of guards, Hitler's last line of defence. The Waffen-SS, the military branch of the SS, became a de facto fourth branch of the Wehrmacht.|$|E

5|$|Punk {{then used}} {{the group to}} attack Randy Orton, blaming him for prematurely ending Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008. Punk and The Nexus cost Orton his match with The Miz for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble in January 2011. Orton, in turn, responded by taking {{out all of the}} New Nexus <b>members</b> <b>by</b> punting them in the head, leaving Punk alone as the sole {{surviving}} member of the group. This led to a WrestleMania XXVII match and a Last Man Standing match at Extreme Rules, both of which Punk lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{colliery}} {{became known}} as the Bradford Colliery Company, and by 1896 employed 404 underground and 125 surface workers producing house coal and coal for manufacturing from the Parker mine. The high price of coal {{at the end of the}} 19th century persuaded the newly created Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association to mitigate the effects on its <b>members</b> <b>by</b> purchasing the colliery in 1900, thus ensuring a cheap supply of fuel for their steam-powered mills.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among <b>members</b> <b>by</b> the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although the Nazis won the {{greatest}} {{share of the}} popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority and therefore Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party. Under pressure from politicians, industrialists and the business community, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung ("seizure of power"). In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung ("co-ordination") to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party <b>members.</b> <b>By</b> June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event {{was held at the}} Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest {{worldwide}} statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27percent of the world's glider pilots, and the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new <b>members</b> <b>by</b> giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.|$|E
5|$|By early 1938 the Group {{had made}} their static rocket motor, which {{originally}} burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist {{to become involved in}} the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the People's Daily World and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding <b>members</b> <b>by</b> late 1938.|$|E
5|$|In September 1968, Barthol {{left the}} band, {{just prior to}} their fourth album. His {{departure}} {{was due to the}} rest of the band's unwillingness to partake in the Festival for Life, an event established by the Youth International Party in Chicago that was intended to have the participation of several well-known musicians attract thousands of spectators for the 1968 Democratic National Convention. However, the city refused to issue any permits, and the band <b>members,</b> <b>by</b> majority vote, decided to withdraw out of fear that their equipment would be damaged. After the festival resulted in riots and violent clashes between demonstrators and the police, Barthol's conviction that Country Joe and the Fish should have held a larger role precipitated his departure from the group and move to England.|$|E
