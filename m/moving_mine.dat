A weapon which is a floating and <b>moving</b> <b>mine,</b> capable up to a certain point of being directed on its course, invisible or very hard to trace, and able to deliver its blow beneath the water-line, was so complete a novelty that its action was hard to foresee. The new weapon scored its first success in the 1891 Chilean Civil War, when the old Congressional battleship [...] "Blanco Encalada" [...] was sunk at anchor by the Balmacedist torpedo gunboat [...] "Almirante Lynch" [...] in the Battle of Caldera Bay.|$|E
40|$|The {{position}} of a division site in the rod-shaped bacterium E. coli is partially determined by pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min-family of proteins—MinC, MinD, and MinE. Furthermore, experiments reveal that MinD protein polymerizes on the membrane into filaments and that MinE protein forms an oscillating ring. We assume that MinD filaments are single-stranded (two-stranded hypothesis has been already tested in our previous paper [20]). In the filamentous cells zebra-striped MinD oscillation pattern, fully formed oscillating MinE rings, and weakly fluorescent, rapidly <b>moving</b> <b>MinE</b> rings are experimentally observed. All these phenomena are reproduced by our threedimensional off-lattice stochastic reaction-diffusion model. An algorithm with adaptive time steps is implemented in order {{to speed up the}} time-consuming process of tracking each protein in the computer simulation...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal ice {{and winter}} roads are a {{historically}} {{important part of}} the Canadian arctic transportation network. Constructed over frozen lakes, rivers, permafrost zones, and seasonally frozen ground, the roads service rural and aboriginal communities and resource extraction projects which are otherwise fly-in only {{for the rest of the}} year. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR) is one of the most economically significant and heavily used roads, running from outside of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, to Contwoyto Lake, Nunavut, connecting three of Canada’s largest diamond mines, with a fourth project set to open on route by 2017. The TCWR has been constructed annually since 1982 as a joint venture between mine operators Diavik Diamond Mines Inc., BHB Billiton Diamonds Inc., and DeBeers Canada Inc., and requires a minimum ice thickness of 0. 7 m to begin operations, with an average open season of 67 days. Current projections suggest an arctic amplification of the global climate warming signal, as well as changes to arctic precipitation patterns. Both have the potential to alter lake ice conditions, with economic impacts for the long-term viability of ice roads for <b>moving</b> <b>mine</b> supplies north via land. This thesis uses a one-dimensional thermodynamic lake ice model (Canadian Lake Ice Model – CLIMo), forced with atmospheric reanalysis data (ERA-Interim) to simulate historical ice conditions, as well as regional climate model outputs (Canadian Regional Climate Model – CRCM 4. 2. 0), to make near-future projections for ice phenology and thickness trends. Using road opening and closing dates provided by road managers, we model the historical variability in ice phenologies for the known operations period 1982 - 2011, as well as future conditions for the period 2041 - 2070 compared against a 1961 - 1990 baseline for a future climate scenario based on IPCC SRES scenario A 2. Model runs suggest that climatic changes in the arctic, primarily warming surface air temperatures, could pose a threat to continued operations of the TCWR. A Mann-Kendall test is paired with the Sen’s Slope method for analysis on the historical data, finding that the ice cover season may have decreased by as much as 10 days between 1982 and 2011 (significant at the 0. 05 level), and mean maximum ice thickness may have decreased by as much as 0. 17 m over the same period (significant at the 0. 05 level). CLIMo simulations for future climate scenarios project later ice-on dates by up to 11 days later in the calendar year, ice-off events occurring up to 14 days earlier in the spring, and a net decrease in the ice cover season by up to 25 days (after rounding), when computed as the difference between the 1961 - 1990 baseline and 2041 - 2070 future period. Mean maximum ice thickness is projected to decrease by up to 0. 30 m over the same period. While winter ice cover is unlikely to disappear entirely in the near future, the number of days where the ice surface is consistently above the 0. 7 m threshold for safe operations may decrease to the point where it no longer becomes economically feasible to build the road and transport materials via land...|$|E

Analyzing such data has deep implications in many applications, e. g., ecological study, traffic control, mobile communication management, and climatological forecast. In this paper, we focus our study on animal movement data analysis and examine advanced data mining methods for discovery of various animal movement patterns. In particular, we introduce a <b>moving</b> object data <b>mining</b> system, MoveMine, which integrates multiple data mining functions, including sophisticated pattern mining and trajectory analysis. In this system, two interesting <b>moving</b> object pattern <b>mining</b> functions are newly developed: (1) periodic behavior mining and (2) swarm pattern mining. For mining periodic behaviors, a reference location-based method is developed, which first detects the reference locations, discovers the periods in complex movements, and then finds periodic patterns by hierarchical clustering. For mining swarm patterns, an efficient method is developed to uncover flexible moving object clusters by relaxing the popularly-enforced collective movement constraints.

Ana-lyzing such data has broad applications, e. g., in ecological study, vehicle control, mobile communication management, and climatological forecast.

Our system, MoveMine, is de-signed for sophisticated <b>moving</b> object data <b>mining</b> by inte-grating several attractive functions including <b>moving</b> object pattern <b>mining</b> and trajectory mining.

A user-friendly interface is provided to fa-cilitate interactive exploration of mining results and flexible tuning of the underlying methods. Since MoveMine is tested on multiple kinds of real data sets, it will benefit users to carry out versatile analysis on these kinds of data.

40|$|Compression {{technology}} is an {{efficient way to}} reserve useful and valuable data as well as remove redundant and inessential data from datasets. With the development of RFID and GPS devices, more and more moving objects can be traced and their trajectories can be recorded. However, the exponential increase in the amount of such trajectory data has caused a series of problems in the storage, processing, and analysis of data. Therefore, moving object trajectory compression undoubtedly becomes one of the hotspots in <b>moving</b> object data <b>mining.</b> To provide an overview, we survey and summarize the development and trend of moving object compression and analyze typical moving object compression algorithms presented in recent years. In this paper, we firstly summarize the strategies and implementation processes of classical moving object compression algorithms. Secondly, the related definitions about moving objects and their trajectories are discussed. Thirdly, the validation criteria are introduced for evaluating the performance and efficiency of compression algorithms. Finally, some application scenarios are also summarized to point out the potential application in the future.

40|$|Abstract. Advances in {{wireless}} {{and mobile}} technology flood us with amounts of moving object data that preclude all means of manual data processing. The {{volume of data}} gathered from position sensors of mobile phones, PDAs, or vehicles, defies human ability to analyze the stream of input data. On the other hand, vast amounts of gathered data hide interesting and valuable knowledge patterns describing the behavior of moving objects. Thus, new algorithms for <b>mining</b> <b>moving</b> object data are required to unearth this knowledge. An important function of the mobile objects management system is the prediction of the unknown location of an object. In this paper we introduce a data mining approach {{to the problem of}} predicting the location of a <b>moving</b> object. We <b>mine</b> the database of moving object locations to discover frequent trajectories and movement rules. Then, we match the trajectory of a moving object with the database of movement rules to build a probabilistic model of object location. Experimental evaluation of the proposal reveals prediction accuracy close to 80 %. Our original contribution includes the elaboration on the location prediction model, the design of an efficient mining algorithm, introduction of movement rule matching strategies, and a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed model. ...|$|R
