50|$|Since {{tetrapods}} (first reptiles, later mammals) {{returned to}} the sea in the Late Permian, they have dominated the top end of the <b>marine</b> <b>body</b> size range, due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs. The ancestors of cetaceans {{are believed to have}} been the semiaquatic pakicetids, no larger than wolves, of about 53 million years (Ma) ago. By 40 Ma ago, cetaceans had attained a length of 20 m or more in Basilosaurus, an elongated, serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them. Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt, and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the Oligocene) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in body mass0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals. This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern blue whale. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer biomechanical constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with swimming movements as opposed to terrestrial locomotion. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulatory advantage of large body size in marine endotherms, although diminishing returns apply.|$|E
40|$|Sequential {{extraction}} {{was used}} to study the operationally determined chemical forms of four heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Ni and Co) and their spatial distribution in the sediments of the Pearl River Estuary. It {{was found that the}} residual fraction was the most important phase for the four metals in these sediments. Among non-residual fractions, Zn, Ni and Co were mainly associated with the Fe-Mn oxide fraction while Cu was associated with the organic fraction. The Zn bound to the Fe-Mn oxide fraction had significant relationships with reducible Mn and reducible Fe concentrations (Fe-Mn oxides), suggesting that Fe-Mn oxides may be the main carriers of Zn from the fluvial environment to the <b>marine</b> <b>body.</b> There was a significant relationship between Cu bound to the organic fraction and sediment organic contents. The Zn bound to the Fe-Mn oxide fraction and Cu bound to the organic fraction showed general distinctive decrease from the west side to {{the east side of the}} estuary, and from upstream in the north to the sea in the south. This was in the same trend with the total Zn and Cu concentrations in these sediments. The results may reflect the anthropogenic inputs of heavy metals to the top sediments from recent rapid industrial development and urbanisation in the surrounding area.

40|$|International audienceAlong the {{southern}} coast of the Gulf of Corinth, interactions between Pleistocene to Recent normal faults {{and a number of}} syn-rift Gilbert-type delta systems can be studied. These relationships are exemplified in the Vouraikos Gilbert delta, which has a complex internal sedimentary and structural geometry that was influenced by basin-forming and intra-deltaic planar and listric syn-sedimentary normal faults, as well as by later planar (second-order) extension faults. A thick alluvial succession, well exposed to the east of the Vouraikos delta, predates the delta system. Preliminary biostratigraphical (palynological) data indicate that the Vouraikos delta was deposited during the Early Pleistocene, and built out into a <b>marine</b> <b>body</b> of water, based on the presence of a newly observed shallow marine limestone, which is associated with distinctive coastal facies conglomerates and sandstones. Accommodation space for the > 800 m thick Vouraikos delta was mainly created by up to 1000 m of vertical displacement on the north-dipping Pirgaki–Mamoussia Fault. The delta has a grossly concave-upward basal (diachronous) surface in transverse section, thought to be generated by the fixed location of the principal fluvial gravel input to the system. The largest foresets observed in the delta indicate building into a water-filled basin of 300 – 400 m depth, and a crudely radial form to the delta, shown by NW- and NE-inclined surfaces. The latest sediments of the delta are flat-lying topsets, which are overlain by thick, highly reddened soil sequences exposed in a number of plateaux.

40|$|The {{exposed and}} gulf-stream warmed {{south-west}} coast of Ireland has a Lusitanean fauna composed of {{elements of the}} colder waters {{to the north and}} east, and others from the warmer Mediterranean Sea. Lough Hyne, a small <b>marine</b> <b>body,</b> is unusual on this coast in being very sheltered, but also in being characterised by many different niches within a small space (1 km 2). Sponges are particularly abundant, morphologically varied and more than 100 species have been described. Species diversity was measured at 6 m intervals on vertical and inclined profiles (to a maximum of 30 m) at six sites, spanning a range of flow rate and sedimentation regimes. Diversity, richness, evenness and density varied significantly with both flow regime and depth, but was much lower on the surrounding Atlantic coast. Four different sponge communities were differentiated on the basis of sponge species assemblages which correlated with different environmental conditions. At sites of turbulent and fast flow conditions, sponge diversity and richness were lowest, with the highest values being found at the sites of moderate and high sedimenta-tion. Significant differences were observed in all four ecological variables with respect to substratum angle {{with the exception of the}} site experiencing the most turbulent flow conditions. Lough Hyne was found to possess the second highest sponge species diversity (H= 3. 626) and richness (77 species) of all available figures from temperate, polar and tropical areas (of similar sized sampling area).

40|$|The Italian natural philosopher Antonio Vallisneri (1661 – 1730), {{who held}} {{a number of}} chairs in {{medicine}} at the University of Padua from 1700 to 1730, wrote {{on a wide variety}} of topics, including medicine, anatomy, and insect generation. In this dissertation I have focused on his writings about natural history, in particular those on geology, entitled the Origin of the Fountains (1715) and Of <b>marine</b> <b>Bodies</b> found on Mountaintops (1721). Both of these works are good examples of Vallisneri 2 ̆ 7 s “modern” method, which emphasized observing nature in an attempt to understand its laws, without recourse to miracles or divine intervention. As a “modern” he helped to revive the University of Padua 2 ̆ 7 s flagging reputation, which had been excellent in the early seventeenth century but had declined as the century wore on. Vallisneri 2 ̆ 7 s work also illustrates the continuing vitality of Italian science in an era that many historians of science have described in terms of decline relative to England and France. ^ The question of the fossils, which Vallisneri addressed in Of <b>marine</b> <b>Bodies</b> found on Mountaintops, had great implications not only for natural history, but for theology and human history. In most contemporary accounts, the universal Noachian Flood played a significant role in natural history, but Vallisneri considered it a local event, arguing that it played no role in the placement of the fossils. His approach focused on natural, incremental forces such as successive inundations and recessions of the waters in the northern Italian plain. ^ Of <b>marine</b> <b>Bodies</b> found on Mountaintops is a collection of letters and it reflects Vallisneri 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the international network of scientific exchange and the Republic of Letters. He was an active participation in the circulation of knowledge and natural objects across political and cultural borders; he had an extensive network of correspondents throughout Europe with whom he exchanged letters, books, and curiosities. The act of corresponding with other natural philosophers constituted the frame of reference for his worldview, and the Republic of Letters was a fundamental source of status and legitimacy for his scholarly work. ...|$|R

40|$|Theory {{indicates}} that compliant materials {{are able to}} reduce the frictional drag of a <b>marine</b> <b>body</b> by delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Recent experimentation on relatively small samples of compliant material suggest that correctly designed compliant materials are able to damp instabilities in the boundary layer and delay transition. In this research the challenge was to design a device {{that could be used}} to test relatively large panels of complaint material and subsequently use the device to make an experimental comparison between the drag of complaint material and a standard non-compliant surface. In particular, the principal requirement of the test device was that laminar flow persisted over the leading edge and was incident on the compliant material surface over the desired test speed range. A drag-plate with a laminar flow nose section was designed for this purpose. In the first part of this thesis basic drag assessments are made using engineering formulae followed by a rigorous computational assessment of fluid flow, boundary layer properties and transition prediction for alternative laminar flow drag-plates. An optimum geometry is established for the laminar flow nose and other practical design requirements are assessed, resulting in the final design of the laminar flow drag-plate. In addition a suitable dynamometer with associated fixtures is designed. In the second part of this thesis, the experimental facility is characterised and experimental procedures established. The drag of a compliant material is compared to a standard non-compliant material. No drag reduction was evident, although the compliant material (supplied from an external source) had inconsistencies in manufacture. A number of different demonstrations of the laminar flow performance of the drag-plate are presented. These include a novel practical transition detection method and flow visualisation. It is demonstrated that the design challenge of producing a laminar flow device has been achieved despite the fact that the drag-plate exhibits a degree of roughening over the experimental period.

40|$|The Lower Permian (Artinskian to Sakmarian) Pebbley Beach Formation of {{the southernmost}} Sydney Basin in New South Wales, Australia, records {{sediment}} accumulation in shallow marine to coastal environments {{at the close}} of the Late Palaeozoic Gondwanan ice age. This paper presents a sequence stratigraphic re-evaluation of the upper half of the unit based on the integration of sedimentology and ichnology. Ten facies are recognized, separated into two facies associations. Facies Association A (7 facies) comprises variably bioturbated siltstones and sandstones with <b>marine</b> <b>body</b> fossils, interpreted to record sediment accumulation in open marine environments ranging from lower offshore to middle shoreface water depths. Evidence of deltaic influence is seen in several Association A facies. Facies Association B (3 facies) comprises mainly heterolithic, interlaminated and thinly interbedded sandstone and siltstone with some thicker intervals of dark grey, organic-rich mudstone, some units clearly filling incised channel forms. These facies are interpreted as the deposits of estuarine channels and basins. Throughout the upper half of the formation, erosion surfaces with several metres relief abruptly separate open marine facies of Association A (below) from estuarine facies of Association B (above). Vertical facies changes imply significant basinward shift of environment across these surfaces, and lowering of relative sea level on the order of 50 metres. These surfaces can be traced over several kilometres along depositional strike, and are defined as sequence boundaries. On this basis, at least nine sequences have been recognized in the upper half of the formation, each of which is 3 ̆c 10 m thick, condensed, incomplete and top-truncated. Sequences contain little if any record of the lowstand systems tract, a more substantial transgressive systems tract and a highstand systems tract that is erosionally truncated (or in some cases, missing). This distinctive stacking pattern (which suggests a dominance of retrogradation and progradation over aggradation) and 3 the implied relative sea-level drop across sequence boundaries of tens of metres are remarkably similar to some other studies of continental margin successions formed under the Neogene icehouse climatic regime. Accordingly, it is suggested that the stratigraphic architecture of the Pebbley Beach Formation was a result of an Icehouse climate regime characterised by repeated, high-amplitude cycles of relative sea-level change...|$|E
