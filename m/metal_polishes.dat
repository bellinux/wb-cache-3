50|$|At {{the time}} of {{research}} the authors found that the United States published 11,000 product specifications to guide manufacturing and that private industries had developed many more. These specifications covered {{a wide range of}} products including “foodstuffs, soaps, <b>metal</b> <b>polishes,</b> hooks and eyes, motorboat engines … and so on indefinitely.” Despite the specifications existing, the authors claimed that manufacturers did not follow safety specifications and additionally were more interested in selling products than meeting the needs of consumers. The authors assert that market forces alone are not producing a market which serves consumers' best interests.|$|E

25|$|The {{removal of}} {{oxidization}} (tarnish) from metal objects is accomplished using a <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> or tarnish remover; {{this is also}} called polishing. To prevent further unwanted oxidization, <b>polished</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces may be coated with wax, oil, or lacquer. This is of particular concern for copper alloy products such as brass and bronze.|$|R
50|$|In the pre-First World War {{years of}} the 20th century the company {{expanded}} by acquisition, {{as well as by}} organic growth. The Brasso <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> product was introduced in 1905, and an additional factory established on Dansom Lane for its manufacture; rival polishes-Bluebell, Shinio and Mepo were acquired in the early 1900s, along with a number of stove, boot and <b>metal</b> <b>polish</b> brands, and blue manufacturers. The Chiswick Polish Company was founded in 1913 as a joint venture. The company expanded by acquiring related manufacturing and raw material concerns, cutting costs: Wilson's Canister Works in Stoneferry was acquired, and carbon black manufacturers were acquired. The acquisitions increased Reckitt's employees from 3,025 in 1909 to 5,339 in 1913.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the fundamental surface processes associated with the chemical mechanical planarization ~CMP! of metals, we have developed an experimental tool that combines the high resolution mass sensing capabilities of the quartz crystal microbalance ~QCM! with a triboelectrochemical testing system. A electrochemical QCM is combined with a polishing tool and force sensor in order to perform controlled surface abrasion while simultaneously monitoring mass changes and electrochemical signals at the metal/solution interface. This system can be used to simulate a <b>metal</b> <b>polishing</b> process with in situ surface measurement capabilities. Typical parameters that can be measured include etch rates, polishing rates, and repassivation kinetics via changes in the resonance frequency of the quartz crystal before, during, and after polishing. Simultaneous measurements of electrochemical parameters, such as the electrode current or open circuit potential, provide a direct correlation between polishing parameters and electrochemical signals. The behavior of copper in various solutions illustrates the capabilities of this technique and highlights the complexities of the <b>metal</b> <b>polishing</b> process. The influence of pH, benzotriazole, peroxide, and several slurry chemistries are examined...|$|R

Liquid forms of cyanide can be absorbed through the skin. Cyanide ions interfere with cellular respiration resulting in the body's tissues being unable to use oxygen.|$|R
