Fourteen years later, Salim returns as a {{distinguished}} soldier (Dilip Kumar) and {{falls in love with}} court dancer Nadira, whom the emperor has renamed Anarkali (Madhubala), meaning pomegranate blossom. The relationship is discovered by the jealous Bahar (Nigar Sultana), a dancer of a higher rank, who wants the prince to love her so that she <b>may</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> become queen. Unsuccessful in winning Salim's love, she exposes his forbidden relationship with Anarkali. Salim pleads to marry Anarkali, but his father refuses, and imprisons her.

25|$|In 1926, the Santa Ana River dam failed, and flash-flooded {{its entire}} delta. The {{southern}} oceanic terminus of this delta {{is now a}} settled area of Huntington Beach. The distant dam is still functional, but silting up, {{which is expected to}} reduce its storage volume, and therefore its effectiveness at flood-prevention. The flood and dam-endangered areas are protected by a levee, but lenders require expensive flood insurance in the delta. There have been serious discussions to eliminate the need for flood insurance and this requirement has already been waived in some areas and <b>may</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> no longer be considered a credible threat.|$|E

25|$|For some people, sensations {{from the}} {{previous}} night's dreams are sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep. However they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall. At least 95% of all dreams are not remembered. Certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during REM sleep. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, {{the content of the}} dream is not remembered. Recording or reconstructing dreams <b>may</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> assist with dream recall. Using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electromyography (EMG), researchers have been able to record basic dream imagery, dream speech activity and dream motor behavior (such as walking and hand movements).|$|E

25|$|The most {{successful}} ribavirin derivative {{to date is}} the 3-carboxamidine derivative of the parent 3-carboxamide, first reported in 1973 by J.T.Witkowski et al., and now called taribavirin (former names viramidine and ribamidine). This drug shows a similar spectrum of antiviral activity to ribavirin, which is not surprising {{as it is now}} known to be a pro-drug for ribavirin. Viramidine, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than ribavirin. The first property is due to viramidine's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide, in liver tissue. Viramidine is in phase III human trials and <b>may</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> be used in place of ribavirin, at least against certain kinds of viral hepatitis. Viramidine's slightly superior toxicological properties may eventually cause it to replace ribavirin in all uses of ribavirin.|$|E
25|$|The Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project, {{based in}} the European Union and {{included}} sites in Asia and the United States, was a follow-up project to the European DataGrid (EDG) and evolved into the European Grid Infrastructure.

A list of active sites participating within LCG can be found online as can real time monitoring of the EGEE infrastructure. The relevant software and documentation is also publicly accessible. There is speculation that dedicated fiber optic links, such as those installed by CERN to address the LCG's data-intensive needs, <b>may</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> be available to home users thereby providing internet services at speeds up to 10,000 times faster than a traditional broadband connection.

It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed in the early part of the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but it does seem likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 <b>may</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> be achieved.
