5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the noun phrase is {{characterized}} by a rigid order where the head of the phrase precedes any <b>modifiers</b> and the possessor precedes the possessum.|$|E
5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and <b>modifiers</b> follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include <b>modifiers</b> such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and <b>modifiers).</b> Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 3rd Edition, each score has a {{corresponding}} ability <b>modifier,</b> where <b>Modifier</b> = (Score − 10)/2, rounded down. This <b>modifier</b> {{is added to}} the appropriate dice rolls. For example, the strength <b>modifier</b> would be added to the damage dealt by a sword, the dexterity <b>modifier</b> to Armor Class (see below) as the character's ability to dodge attacks, and the charisma <b>modifier</b> to an attempt to smooth-talk a merchant.|$|R
50|$|XKB {{allows a}} <b>modifier</b> {{to be locked}} or latched, other than being in its regular state. Normally, a <b>modifier</b> is active exactly when it is pressed, like the Shift. However, a <b>modifier</b> may also be locked, like the Caps Lock <b>modifier.</b> When a <b>modifier</b> is locked, it remains active until it is {{explicitly}} deactivated. An intermediate condition between regular and locked is the latched state: When a <b>modifier</b> is latched, it remains active, but only until the next non-modifier key is pressed.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT：Impact <b>modifier</b> {{reinforced}} polymers {{are frequently}} used. In this study, Izod impact test has been simulated {{to analyze the}} mechanism of impact reinforcement of Nylon 6 which contains impact <b>modifier.</b> The modeling of rubber particles added to Nylon 6 as an impact <b>modifier</b> has been attempted. Based on the modeling, simulation of Izod impact test has been performed to observe the distribution and direction of stress at the cross-section of impact specimen. Three computer simulation models for Nylon 6 were investigated. Those were without impact <b>modifier,</b> containing impact <b>modifier</b> without surface treatment, and containing impact <b>modifier</b> with surface treatment in the Nylon 6. Simulation {{results showed that the}} stress which originated at the notch surface propergated to the inside of specimen round a impact <b>modifier.</b> In addition to that, impact <b>modifier</b> reinforced Nylon 6 specimen showed low stress ditribution in the cross-section specially at notch surface.

5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb {{comes at}} the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and <b>modifiers</b> precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant {{inheritance}} and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk {{factor is the}} inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 allele. The APOEε4 allele {{increases the risk of}} the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic <b>modifiers</b> result in incomplete penetrance. For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: CASS4, CELF1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SORL1, ZCWPW1, SlC24A4, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP.|$|E
5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows the goat to restart the game with various <b>modifiers</b> in play, such as {{changing}} the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E

30|$|In this review, we have {{presented}} {{the examples of}} <b>modifier</b> genes for human mitochondrial disorders. While chromosomal location of some <b>modifier</b> effects has been identified, cloning of <b>modifier</b> genes still remains to be difficult. Studies of the mitochondrial retrograde signaling will provide insight into mechanisms of genetic interactions and facilitate the identification of potential <b>modifier</b> genes. Finally, the elucidation of <b>modifier</b> genes associated with the suppression of mitochondrial defects could be useful in designing new therapeutics, improving prediction of risk factors for susceptibility, and eventual prevention of disease manifestation.|$|R

50|$|In grammar, a <b>modifier</b> is an {{optional}} element in phrase structure or clause structure. A <b>modifier</b> is so called {{because it is}} said to modify (change the meaning of) another element in the structure, on which it is dependent. Typically the <b>modifier</b> can be removed without affecting the grammar of the sentence. For example, in the English sentence This is a red ball, the adjective red is a <b>modifier,</b> modifying the noun ball. Removal of the <b>modifier</b> would leave This is a ball, which is grammatically correct and equivalent in structure to the original sentence.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{sentence}} {{begins with the}} subject, followed by a verb, and then {{the object of the}} verb. This is then followed by a <b>modifier</b> that more closely defines the object, and this <b>modifier</b> is itself modified by a subsequent <b>modifier.</b>|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of a year, special “season” event cards are {{randomly}} chosen from a deck. All players learn the <b>modifiers</b> these cards may have on the game. These four cards are then shuffled and placed face down on the season track. The first three seasons, a card is revealed and its <b>modifiers</b> applied to the game. During the last season (Winter), the <b>modifiers</b> are ignored, but a number on the card reveals the extent of grain shortage for that year. This element allows players a certain level of planning, but an uncertainty of when (or even if) the season event will happen.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} classes of {{components}} for oxide glasses: network formers, intermediates, and <b>modifiers.</b> The network formers (silicon, boron, germanium) form a highly cross-linked network of chemical bonds. The intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) {{can act as}} both network formers and <b>modifiers,</b> according to the glass composition. The <b>modifiers</b> (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one negative charge {{to compensate for the}} positive ion nearby. Some elements can play multiple roles; e.g. lead can act both as a network former (Pb4+ replacing Si4+), or as a modifier.|$|E
