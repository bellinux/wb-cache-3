5|$|In October 1990, Tech {{opened its}} first {{overseas}} campus, Georgia Tech Lorraine (GTL). A non-profit corporation operating under French law, GTL primarily focuses on graduate education, sponsored research, and an undergraduate summer program. In 1997 GTL was sued {{on the grounds}} that the course descriptions on its internet site did not comply with the Toubon Law, which requires that advertisements <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> in French. The case was dismissed on a technicality; the GTL site subsequently offers course descriptions in English, French and German.|$|E

Despite the use of some rainwater, Cruachan is not a net generator of electricity: it uses more energy for pumping water and spinning its turbines than it generates.|$|E

5|$|The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), a {{component}} of the USDA, provides the funds to the Puerto Rican government's Department of the Family to operate the program through an annual block grant, which covers the full cost of the benefits to participants, as well as fifty percent (50%) of the costs required to administer the program (the remaining 50% <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> by the Puerto Rican government). Although federal regulations require Puerto Rico to pay the benefits during the year for which the annual block grant was awarded, since 2002 the federal government has allowed Puerto Rico to use 2% of an annual surplus for benefits in future years.|$|E
5|$|Those who are {{descended from}} the {{citizens}} loyal to the British Crown who fled the United States during and shortly after the revolution are known in Canada as United Empire Loyalists, and are entitled {{to the use of}} special coronets within their arms, if arms are granted to them. There are two versions of the Loyalist coronet: the civil, which is made up of alternating oak and maple leaves, and the military, made up of maple leaves alternating with crossed swords; the latter is reserved for use by the families of those who served in the British military during the revolution. Proof of Loyalist heritage <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> to the Canadian Heraldic Authority before permission is granted to use the coronet in arms. Unlike the common use of coronets in heraldry, the Loyalist coronet denotes no rank of nobility or royalty, but instead alludes to ancestral allegiance.|$|E

Schools of the future <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E

5|$|With large {{metallic}} red inflorescences {{and attractive}} feathery leaves that {{are perhaps the}} softest of all Banksia species, B.brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour {{as soon as they}} open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may be partly hidden by foliage.|$|E

Functional impacts of individual must yeasts in artificially assembled communities were calculated using a "keystone index," developed for “Species richness influences wine ecosystem function through a dominant species” [1].
