40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} thermal protection and moisture transmission of firefighter clothing and how combinations of materials influence the thermal protection and moisture transmission. An orthogonal design is applied for planning the experiment. Eight different material combinations, which simulate three-layer firefighter protective clothing system, are studied. The thermal protective performance (TPP) and water vapor transmission rate of combinations are tested. The experiment data are discussed by analysis of range and variance. Meanwhile, influence of each layer on clothing performance is also studied. Results show that outer shell fabric and <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> have significant effects on TPP and moisture transmission property, respectively.

30|$|Most of the FFPPC contain <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> {{to improve}} the heat {{resistance}} and more importantly prevent penetration of chemical spillage and reduce steam burn (Song et al. [2008]). However, this layer is semi permeable or impermeable to water vapour, which causes considerable discomfort as {{it is impossible to}} expel high quantity of sweat from the clothing system. Heat and moisture transfer through clothing involves complex process and is coupled with evaporation, condensation, absorption and desorption of moisture. When these parameters are not balanced, the sweat can accumulate on the skin and inner layer of the clothing system and result in saturation of undergarment microclimate. The high humidity content of undergarment microclimate can lead to the sensation of wetness and increase wearer discomfort.|$|E

The experimental relations and empirical equations for the seam strength and resistance to water penetration determined in this research can be used to predict efficiency of seams quality applying different parameters of seam sealing process.

For the research different types of multilayer systems consisting of outer shell, thermal and <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> and lining were formed. After testing of fabrics mechanical and physical characteristics {{it was revealed that}} the structure of a separate fabric layer had a direct influence on protective and comfort properties of a multilayer system of firefighter’s garment. In order to decrease a total weight of the protective garment, multilayer systems formed of lower area density fabrics having relief surface were compared to the systems having flat relief.

40|$|Water {{permeation}} in inorganic <b>moisture</b> permeation <b>barriers</b> occurs through macroscale defects/pinholes and nanopores, {{the latter}} with size approaching the water kinetic diameter (0. 27 nm). Both permeation paths {{can be identified}} by the calcium test, i. e., a time-consuming and expensive optical method for determining the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) through <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> Recently, we have shown that ellipsometric porosimetry (i. e., a combination of spectroscopic ellipsometry and isothermal adsorption studies) is a valid method to classify and quantify the nanoporosity and correlate it with the WVTR values. Nevertheless, no information is obtained about the macroscale defects or the kinetics of water permeation through the barrier, both essential in assessing {{the quality of the}} <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is shown as a sensitive and versatile method to obtain information on nanoporosity and macroscale defects, water permeation, and diffusivity of <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layers,</b> complementing the <b>barrier</b> property characterization obtained by means of EP and calcium test. EIS is performed on thin SiO 2 <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> deposited by plasma enhanced-CVD. It allows the determination of the relative water uptake in the SiO 2 layers, found to be in agreement with the nanoporosity content inferred by EP. Furthermore, the kinetics of water permeation is followed by EIS, and the diffusivity (D) is determined and found to be in accordance with literature values. Moreover, differently from EP, EIS data are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of local macrodefects, correlated with the barrier failure during the calcium test...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we produce {{and study the}} {{flexible}} organic–inorganic hybrid <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> {{for the protection of}} air sensitive organic opto-electronic devices. The inorganic amorphous silicon nitride layer (SiNx:H) and the organic PMMA [poly (methyl methacrylate) ] layer are deposited alternatingly by using hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HW-CVD) and spin-coating techniques, respectively. The effect of organic–inorganic hybrid interfaces is analyzed for increasing number of interfaces. We produce highly transparent (∼ 80 % in the visible region) hybrid structures. The morphological properties are analysed providing a good basis for understanding the variation of the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) values. A minimum WVTR of 4. 5 × 10 − 5 g/m 2 day is reported at the ambient atmospheric conditions for 7 organic/inorganic interfaces. The hybrid barriers show superb mechanical flexibility which confirms their high potential for flexible applications. The {{authors would like to thank}} Dr. J. C.

40|$|Flexible and {{thermally}} stable, freestanding hybrid organic/inorganic based polymer-composite {{films have}} been fabricated using {{a simple solution}} casting method. Polyvinylbutyral and amine functionalized mesoporous silica were used to synthesize the composite. An additional polyol-''tripentaerythritol''-component was also used to increase the -OH group content in the composite matrix. The moisture permeability of the composites was investigated by following a calcium degradation test protocol. This showed {{a reduction in the}} moisture permeability with the increase in functionalized silica loadings in the matrix. A reduction in permeability was observed for the composites as compared to the neat polymer film. The thermal and mechanical properties of these composites were also investigated by various techniques like thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, tensile experiments, and dynamic mechanical analysis. It was observed that these properties detonate with the increase in the functionalized silica content and hence an optimized loading is required in order to retain critical properties. This deterioration is due to the aggregation of the fillers in the matrix. Furthermore, the films were used to encapsulate P 3 HT (poly 3 hexyl thiophene) based organic Schottky structured diodes, and the diode characteristics under accelerated aging conditions were studied. The weathered diodes, encapsulated with composite film showed an improvement in the lifetime as compared to neat polymer film. The initial investigation of these films suggests that they {{can be used as a}} <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> for organic electronics encapsulation application...|$|E

40|$|The quality {{assessment}} of <b>moisture</b> permeation <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> needs to include both water permeation pathways, namely through bulk nanoporosity and local macroscale defects. Ellipsometric porosimetry (EP) has been already demonstrated {{a valuable tool}} for the identification of nanoporosity in inorganic thin film barriers, but the intrinsic lack of sensitivity toward the detection of macroscale defects prevents the overall barrier characterization. In this contribution, dynamic EP measurements are reported and shown {{to be sensitive to}} the detection of macroscale defects in SiO 2 layers on polyethylene naphthalate substrate. In detail, the infiltration of probe molecules, leading to changes in optical properties of the polymeric substrate, is followed in time and related to permeation through macroscale defects...|$|R
50|$|The usual {{clothing}} for Arctic or mountain regions is a parka and heavy insulated mittens with long gauntlets {{to protect the}} wrist, gaiters to keep snow and moisture {{out of the top}} of the boots, and wool-felt or down-insulated booties. In high wind-chills, these garments may be supplemented by a mask, usually of oiled wool. In Arctic areas, the typical modern insulation is very fine hydrophobic polyester fiber batting sewn in laps between a nylon shell. The sewing must not compress or quilt the insulation, because the heat leaks out through the thin spots. Most designers now include a <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> on the inner side to prevent condensation from a body's moisture from condensing and freezing in the insulation. Sometimes the <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier</b> has several <b>layers</b> of aluminized plastic film to reflect infrared back to the body. If plastic film is near the skin, usually some lightweight absorbent cloth is between the skin and the film, for comfort.|$|R
40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs, both small molecule and polymer LEDs) require excellent gas and <b>moisture</b> permeation <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> to increase their lifetime. The quality of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> is ultimately controlled {{by the presence of}} defects in the <b>layer.</b> Although a <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> may be intrinsically excellent (water vapor transmission rate, WVTR = 10 - 6 g·m- 2 ·day- 1) the protected device may fail in the presence of defects that lead to preferential diffusion pathways for H 2 O (e. g., defects caused by particles from the environment and/or production process). The state-of-the-art barrier coatings are micrometer-thick multi-layer structure, in which organic interlayers are alternated with inorganic <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> with the purpose of decoupling the above-mentioned defects. Recently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been successfully tested for the deposition of very thin (2 ̆ 6 lt; 50 nm) single <b>layer</b> permeation <b>barriers</b> on pristine polymer substrates [1, 2], showing the potential of this highly uniform and conformal deposition technique in the field of <b>moisture</b> permeation <b>barriers.</b> In this contribution the encapsulation of OLEDs by plasma-assisted ALD of thin (20 - 40 nm) Al 2 O 3 layers is addressed. The layers are synthesized at room temperature by sequentially exposing the substrate to Al(CH 3) 3 vapor and a remote inductively coupled O 2 plasma in Oxford Instruments FlexALTM and OpALTM reactors. The intrinsic quality of the deposited ALD layers was determined by monitoring the oxidation of a Ca film encapsulated by the Al 2 O 3 film: WVTR values as low as 2 · 10 - 6 g·m- 2 ·day- 1 have been measured. The potential of ALD layers in encapsulating OLEDs, and therefore in successfully covering the defects present on the device, has been investigated by means of electroluminescence measurements of polymer-LEDs (effective emitting area of 5. 8 cm 2).

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} the {{diffusion}} barrier coating system (DBC system) is summarized and the latest results are presented. The DBC system is comprised of alloy substrate/diffusion barrier/Al-reservoir/an external scale. Diffusion flux (JAl) of Al through the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be given approximately by JAl = DAl x SAl x (CAl/x), where DAl and SAl are the diffusion coefficient and solubility limit of Al in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> respectively as well as CAl / x is driving force given by the concentration difference across the barrier (CAl) divided by {{the thickness of the}} <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> (x). A slow diffusion flux can be obtained by using low values of DAl, SAl, or (CAl / x). Accordingly, a selection of a <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> with lower DAl and SAl is essential. A low driving force is also an important factor, and can be achieved by using lower CAl with a constant <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness x. At higher temperatures, however, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> can react with the alloy substrate and Al-reservoir layer, resulting in gradual degradation of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> This means that the thickness x of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> tends to decrease and may finally disappear. With decreasing thickness of the diffusion <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> the driving force (CAl/x) will increase, and the effectiveness of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be eliminated. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a constant thickness of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> for long exposure time. Several types of the DBC system are proposed, a single <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> and triple-layers with + ‟ and ‟ inserted among these <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> 1...|$|R

Moisture fluctuations in expansive clay subgrades in response to rainfall and evapotranspiration cause volume changes that in turn cause excessive damage to pavements resting on such subgrades. The Texas Department of Transportation is installing vertical <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers</b> on pavements in order to stabilize the moisture condition under the pavements and thus reduce the development of roughness on these pavements. A total of eleven pavement sections in three of the seven climatic zones in Texas were chosen for this study in order to study the effectiveness of vertical <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers</b> in controlling the development of roughness. The moisture condition (suction) in the subgrade soils was measured using either thermal moisture sensors or thermocouple psychrometers. In addition, the surface profiles of the pavements were measured with the GM profilometer. Samples of the soil were taken and laboratory tests of the Atterberg limits, grain size distribution and suction vs. water content relations were made. A finite element program, FLODEF, which couples moisture flow and elasticity was calibrated to reproduce the field observations of the suction in each of the locations. The program was then used to perform a study of the effects of climatic zone, degree of cracking in the soil, depth of the <b>moisture</b> <b>barrier,</b> and lateral drainage condition on the rate of increase of pavement roughness. The program shows the conditions under which <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers</b> will be effective and other conditions in which <b>moisture</b> <b>barriers</b> will have little effect.

Three main hypotheses have been reported in literature so far, although consistently applied to the case of a liquid-phase polymerization process of the organic layer: smoothening of the polymeric substrate surface by the organic layer; decoupling, by means of a tortuous path, of the defects present in two adjacent inorganic barrier layers; filling of the nano-defects present in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> during the (liquid phase) polymerization of the organic layer.
