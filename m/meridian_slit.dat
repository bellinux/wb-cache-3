40|$|A {{custom made}} five panel filter mosaic window was designed, {{installed}} and operated with the HiTIES (High Throughput Imaging Echelle Spectrograph) at the Nordlysstasjonen in Svalbard, Norway (78. 2025 N and 15. 829 E). The filter provides {{images of the}} resonant scattered spectra of N+ 2 1 N (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) bands and a neutral N 2 2 P (0, 3) band. Ab initio models were created for describing the populations of vibrational and rotational energy levels in both excited and ionised N 2 molecules in the ionosphere. In the rotational profiles the species are treated to be in thermal equilibrium, whereas the vibrational levels assume a non-thermal steady state time independent model. Rotational temperatures were evaluated for different auroral forms for the N+ 2 (0, 2) band from the magnetic zenith and along the <b>meridian</b> <b>slit</b> in HiTIES data from winter. A clear trend in neutral temperature is found, with higher values for times of lower energy precipitation. The relationship between resonant scattering of solar photons via N+ 2 and direct emission from electron impact on N 2 was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with HiTIES data from January-March 2007. A relationship was found that clearly indicates the emission profiles are a function of primary electron energy and solar shadow height when auroral arcs are partially sunlit during events of electron precipitation. <br/...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{spectral data}} {{are used to}} estimate neutral temperatures at auroral heights. The data are from the High Throughput Imaging Echelle Spectrograph (HiTIES) which forms part of the Spectrographic Imaging Facility (SIF), located at Longyearbyen, Svalbard in Norway. The platform also contains photometers and a narrow angle auroral imager. Quantum molecular spectroscopy is used for modelling N 2 + 1 NG (0, 2), {{which serves as a}} diagnostic tool for neutral temperature and emission height variations. The theoretical spectra are convolved with the instrument function and fitted to measured rotational transition lines as a function of temperature. Measurements were made in the magnetic zenith, and along a <b>meridian</b> <b>slit</b> centred on the magnetic zenith. In the results described, the high spectral resolution of the data (0. 08 nm) allows an error analysis to be performed more thoroughly than previous findings, with particular attention paid to the correct subtraction of background, and to precise wavelength calibration. Supporting measurements were made with the Svalbard Eiscat Radar (ESR). Estimates were made from both optical and radar observations of the average energy of precipitating electrons in different types of aurora. These provide confirmation that the spectral results are in agreement with the variations observed in radar profiles. In rayed aurora the neutral temperature was highest (800 K) and the energy lowest (1 keV). In a bright curling arc, the temperature at the lower border was about 550 K, corresponding to energies of 2 keV. The radar and modelling results confirm that these average values are a lower limit for an estimation of the characteristic energy. In each event the energy distribution is clearly made up of more than one spectral shape. This work emphasises the need for high time resolution as well as high spectral resolution. The present work is the first to provide rotational temperatures using a method which pays particular attention to errors in measurement and fitting, and background subtraction. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Jupiter's {{reflectivity}} {{was measured}} {{as a function}} of wavelength between 3000 and 10, 500 Angstrom for two nights during the 1979 apparition. The spectra obtained were used to calibrate the wavelength response of Voyager images and to establish differences from previous apparitions. The observations were taken in the prominent belts and zones and both polar caps along the central <b>meridian</b> using a <b>slit</b> of dimensions 2. 33 x 2. 5 sq arcsec. The equivalent widths of the 6190 and 7270 Angstrom CH 4 bands were measured; compared to the 1976 apparition, there was significantly less CH 4 absorption in the north tropical zone. Such equivalent-width decreases are said to result from either a reduction in particle albedo or a decrease in the scattering mean free path owing to a greater concentration of aerosol particles in the NTrZ...|$|R
