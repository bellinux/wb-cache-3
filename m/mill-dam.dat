They immediately took up residence {{in a part of}} the brick house that was Patty's mother's. In 1806 their first child was born, William Jr. Two years later they moved to a part of the building where the shop was where he was working as a clockcase-maker. Munroe also made some furniture, besides clockcases, which he took to Boston to sell. In 1810 he traded some clocks in Norfolk for some corn and flour. He traded the flour to a Mr. Prescott, a baker in Concord, in a round about way for a shop at the Concord <b>Mill-Dam</b> Company that Mr. Prescott owned. There was a credit crunch in the economy at this time and Mr. Prescott didn't have cash to pay for the flour. In 1811 Munroe moved his family to a small house closer to his shop.|$|E

5000|$|Sharrow Ward was {{urbanized}} between 1830 and 1850 when Little Sheffield, {{a village}} and adjunct {{to the main}} town of Sheffield was redeveloped {{to cope with the}} rapidly increasing growth in population. Separated from Sheffield town by the [...] "uninhabited, barren, gorse-covered, Sheffield Moor". Industry here was based on water-power provided by Porter Brook with water-wheels at Sharrow Mill (Sharrow Vale Road), Sharrow Forge (Napier Street), and Bennetts’ Wheel (Vulcan Works). The latter two <b>mill-dams</b> and Broomhall Cornmill dam off Ecclesall Road were drained and filled-in around 1870 providing land for houses, schools, and new industries.|$|R

50|$|According to the 1689 deed from John Pell to Jacob Leisler, {{representing}} the Huguenot purchasers of New Rochelle, the area originally {{came under the}} ownership of John Jefferd. Jefferd was first to use the water power of this stream, operating a saw-mill and corn-mill {{until his death in}} the early eighteenth century. The land later came under the ownership of Jacob Leisler who made a number of improvements to the lake including the construction of a pool to supply an overshot wheel at the mill. The construction required Leisler to alter the route of the Boston Post Road, an action which he was later indicted for in 1711. This pool was located south of and beside the lake itself, and required the erection of several new <b>mill-dams</b> and the shifting of the road to a new route over the lower dam. It was at this point that the level of the lake was raised and a larger area flooded than had been covered by the natural lake.|$|R

60|$|It was afternoon, {{twilight}} yet out of doors--starless and moonless twilight; for though keenly freezing with a dry, black frost, heaven wore a mask {{of clouds}} congealed and fast locked.

He is a plain country squire, with a good figure, but with rather a heavy brow; a rough complexion; a gait stiff, and a general rigidity of manner, something {{like that of a}} schoolmaster. He originated in a country town, and is a self-educated man. As he walked down the gravel-path to-day, after dinner, he took up a scythe, which one of the mowers had left on the sward, and began to mow, with quite a scientific swing. On the coming of the mower, he laid it down, perhaps a little ashamed of his amusement. I was interested in this; to see a man, after twenty-five years of scientific occupation, thus trying whether his arms retained their strength and skill for the labors of his youth,-- mindful of the day when he wore striped trousers, and toiled in his shirt-sleeves,--and now tasting again, for pastime, this drudgery beneath a fervid sun. He stood awhile, looking at the workmen, and then went to oversee the laborers at the <b>mill-dam.</b>|$|E

60|$|The gray but {{transparent}} evening rather shaded than {{obscured the}} scene, leaving its stronger features visible, and even improved by the medium through which I beheld them. The volume {{of water is}} not very great, nor the roar deep enough to be termed grand, though such praise might have been appropriate before the good people of Rochester had abstracted {{a part of the}} unprofitable sublimity of the cascade. The Genesee has contributed so bountifully to their canals and <b>mill-dams,</b> that it approaches the precipice with diminished pomp, and rushes over it in foamy streams of various width, leaving a broad face of the rock insulated and unwashed, between the two main branches of the falling river. Still it was an impressive sight, to one who had not seen Niagara. I confess, however, that my chief interest arose from a legend, connected with these falls, which will become poetical in the lapse of years, and was already so to me as I pictured the catastrophe out of dusk and solitude. It was from a platform, raised over the naked island of the cliff, {{in the middle of the}} cataract that Sam Patch took his last leap, and alighted in the other world. Strange as it may appear,--that any uncertainty should rest upon his fate which was consummated in the sight of thousands,--many will tell you that the illustrious Patch concealed himself in a cave under the falls, and has continued to enjoy posthumous renown, without foregoing the comforts of this present life. But the poor fellow prized the shout of the multitude too much not to have claimed it at the instant, had he survived. He will not be seen again, unless his ghost, in such a twilight as when I was there, should emerge from the foam, and vanish among the shadows that fall from cliff to cliff.|$|R

60|$|Mr. William Sharp takes himself {{very seriously}} {{and has written}} a preface to his Romantic Ballads and Poems of Phantasy, which is, on the whole, the most {{interesting}} part of his volume. We are all, it seems, far too cultured, and lack robustness. 'There are those amongst us,' says Mr. Sharp, 'who would prefer a dexterously-turned triolet to such apparently uncouth measures as Thomas the Rhymer, or the ballad of Clerk Saunders: who would rather listen to the drawing-room music of the Villanelle than to the wild harp-playing by the <b>mill-dams</b> o' Binnorie, or the sough of the night-wind o'er drumly Annan water.' Such an expression as 'the drawing-room music of the Villanelle' is not very happy, and I cannot imagine any one with the smallest pretensions to culture preferring a dexterously turned triolet to a fine imaginative ballad, as {{it is only the}} Philistine who ever dreams of comparing works of art that are absolutely different in motive, in treatment, and in form. If English Poetry is in danger--and, according to Mr. Sharp, the poor nymph is in a very critical state--what she has to fear is not the fascination of dainty metre or delicate form, but the predominance of the intellectual spirit over the spirit of beauty. Lord Tennyson dethroned Wordsworth as a literary influence, and later on Mr. Swinburne filled all the mountain valleys with echoes of his own song. The influence to-day is that of Mr. Browning. And as for the triolets, and the rondels, and the careful study of metrical subtleties, these things are merely the signs of a desire for perfection in small things and of the recognition of poetry as an art. They have had certainly one good result--they have made our minor poets readable, and have not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses.|$|R

When she had struck first, it had been bows-on, so that the stern had hitherto been lowest.

60|$|At length {{we began}} to go down into the valley where Chouteau's pond was, and we caught glimpses of the shimmering of its waters through the trees, ay, and {{presently}} heard them tumbling lightly over the <b>mill-dam.</b> The spot was made for romance,--a sequestered vale, clad with forest trees, cleared a little by the water-side, where Monsieur Lenoir raised his maize and his vegetables. Below the mill, so Monsieur Gratiot told me, where the creek lay in pools on its limestone bed, the village washing was done; and every Monday morning bare-legged negresses strode up this road, the bundles of clothes balanced on their heads, the paddles in their hands, followed by a stream of black urchins who tempted Providence to drown them.|$|E

Dick"s experience of the sordid misery of want had entered into the deeps of him, and, lest he might find virtue too easy, that memory stood behind him, tempting to shame, when dealers came to buy his wares. As the Nilghai quaked against his will at the still green water of a lake or a <b>mill-dam,</b> as Torpenhow flinched before any white arm that could cut or stab and loathed himself for flinching, Dick feared the poverty he had once tasted half in jest.

There was a bridge and <b>mill-dam,</b> and the creek might be forded at low water, but no time was to be lost, for the tide was rising. Leaving part of his men to keep face toward General Grant, he advanced with the rest to pass the creek, but was suddenly checked by the appearance of Cornwallis and his grenadiers.|$|E
60|$|I think I should {{soon become}} {{strongly}} attached to {{our way of}} life, so independent and untroubled by the forms and restrictions of society. The house is very pleasantly situated,--half a mile distant from where the town begins to be thickly settled, and on a swell of land, with the road running {{at a distance of}} fifty yards, and a grassy tract and a gravel-walk between. Beyond the road rolls the Kennebec, here two or three hundred yards wide. Putting my head out of the window, I can see it flowing steadily along straightway between wooded banks; but arriving nearly opposite the house, there is a large and level sand island {{in the middle of the}} stream; and just below the island the current is further interrupted by the works of the <b>mill-dam,</b> which is perhaps half finished, yet still in so rude a state that it looks as much like the ruins of a dam destroyed by the spring freshets as like the foundations of a dam yet to be. Irishmen and Canadians toil at work on it, and the echoes of their hammering and of the voices come across the river and up to this window. Then there is a sound of the wind among the trees round the house; and, when that is silent, the calm, full, distant voice of the river becomes audible. Looking downward thither, I see the rush of the current, and mark the different eddies, with here and there white specks or streaks of foam; and often a log comes floating on, glistening in the sun, as it rolls over among the eddies, having voyaged, for aught I know, hundreds of miles from the wild upper sources of the river, passing down, down, between lines of forest, and sometimes a rough clearing, till here it floats by cultivated banks, and will soon pass by the village. Sometimes a long raft of boards comes along, requiring the nicest skill in navigating it through the narrow passage left by the <b>mill-dam.</b> Chaises and wagons occasionally go over the road, the riders all giving a passing glance at the dam, or perhaps alighting to examine it more fully, and at last departing with ominous shakes of the head as to the result of the enterprise. My position is so far retired from the river and <b>mill-dam,</b> that, though the latter is really rather a scene, yet a sort of quiet seems to be diffused over the whole. Two or three times a day this quiet is broken by the sudden thunder from a quarry, where the workmen are blasting rocks; and a peal of thunder sounds strangely in such a green, sunny, and quiet landscape, with the blue sky brightening the river.|$|E
60|$|I was {{now going}} at {{what seemed like}} a speed of ninety or a hundred miles an hour, with the wind rushing in between my teeth like water over a <b>mill-dam,</b> and I felt sure that if I kept on going down that hill I should soon be {{whirling}} through space like a comet. The only way I could think of to save myself was to turn into some level place where the thing would stop, but not a crossroad did I pass; but presently I saw a little house standing back from the road, which seemed to hump itself a little at that place so as to be nearly level, and {{over the edge of the}} hump it dipped so suddenly that I could not see the rest of the road at all.|$|E
60|$|Thursday, July 13th.--Two small Canadian boys came to {{our house}} yesterday, with {{strawberries}} to sell. It sounds strangely to hear children bargaining in French on the borders of Yankee-land. Among other languages spoken hereabouts must be reckoned the wild Irish. Some of the laborers on the <b>mill-dam</b> can speak nothing else. The intermixture of foreigners sometimes gives rise to quarrels {{between them and the}} natives. As we were going to the village yesterday afternoon, we witnessed the beginning of a quarrel between a Canadian and a Yankee,--the latter accusing the former of striking his oxen. B------ thrust himself between and parted them; but they afterwards renewed their fray, and the Canadian, I believe, thrashed the Yankee soundly,--for which he had to pay twelve dollars. Yet he was but a little fellow.|$|E
6000|$|But Tom, you perceive, {{was rather}} a Rhadamanthine personage, {{having more than}} the usual share of boy's justice in him,--the justice that desires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and is troubled with no doubts {{concerning}} the exact amount of their deserts. Maggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home, which checked her joy at his coming so much sooner than she had expected, and she dared hardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small gravel-stones into the <b>mill-dam.</b> It is not pleasant to give up a rat-catching when you have set your mind on it.

60|$|I came {{to myself}} in darkness, in great pain, bound hand and foot, and {{deafened}} by many unfamiliar noises. There sounded {{in my ears}} a roaring of water as of a huge <b>mill-dam,</b> the thrashing of heavy sprays, the thundering of the sails, and the shrill cries of seamen. The whole world now heaved giddily up, and now rushed giddily downward; and so sick and hurt was I in body, and my mind so much confounded, that {{it took me a}} long while, chasing my thoughts up and down, and ever stunned again by a fresh stab of pain, to realise that I must be lying somewhere bound in the belly of that unlucky ship, and that the wind must have strengthened to a gale. With the clear perception of my plight, there fell upon me a blackness of despair, a horror of remorse at my own folly, and a passion of anger at my uncle, that once more bereft me of my senses.|$|E
60|$|Before the humour came I had two {{or three}} long visits. Drummond Hay, the antiquary and lyon-herald, came in.[148] I do not know {{anything}} which relieves the mind so much from the sullens as trifling discussion about antiquarian old-womanries. It is like knitting a stocking, diverting the mind without occupying it; or it is like, by Our Lady, a <b>mill-dam,</b> which leads one's thoughts gently and imperceptibly out of the channel {{in which they are}} chafing and boiling. To be sure, it is only conducting them to turn a child's mill; what signifies that?--the diversion is a relief, though the object is of little importance. I cannot tell what we talked of; but I remember we concluded with a lamentation on the unlikelihood that Government would give the Museum £2000 to purchase the bronze Apollo lately discovered in France, although the God of Delos stands six feet two in his stocking-soles, and is perfectly entire, saving that on the right side he wants half a hip, and the leg from the knee, and that on the left his heel is much damaged.

Thus stands this curious affair. When the doctor's story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks {{of those who had}} been actively in search for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and some furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always knew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's <b>mill-dam,</b> and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully woebegone: he seemed the [...] "victim of unrequited affection," [...] as represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the little drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad to have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.|$|E
