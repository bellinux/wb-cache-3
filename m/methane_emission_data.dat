40|$|Methane is {{the second}} most serious {{greenhouse}} gas next to carbon dioxide contributing to global warming and climate change. As part of the national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> <b>data</b> have to be reported to the European Union (EU) and to the UN Climate Secretariat. Until 2004 the methane emissions from gas distribution in the Netherlands were quantified by a gas consumption based average emission factor approach, a so-called IPCC Tier 1 method. The gas distribution utilities in the Netherlands have had several objections against the IPCC Tier 1 method for principal reasons. The IPCC Tier 1 method was based on the amount of gas consumption and was not source-specific. Instead, a IPCC Tier 3 method was proposed, a rigorous source-specific approach. The IPCC Tier 3 method is composed of detailed inventories of the amount and types of process infrastructure and typical design and operating practices. The consolidated emissions are assessed by applying appropriate emission factors based on field measurements. The assessment is carried out by acquiring the following data: • Grid length per material and pressure rang...|$|E
40|$|Methane {{stored in}} seabed {{reservoirs}} such as methane hydrates {{can reach the}} atmosphere in the form of bubbles or dissolved in water. Hydrates could destabilize with rising temperature further increasing greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate. To assess the impact of oceanic emissions from the area west of Svalbard, where methane hydrates are abundant, we used measurements collected with a research aircraft (Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements) and a ship (Helmer Hansen) during the Summer 2014 and for Zeppelin Observatory for the full year. We present a model-supported analysis of the atmospheric CH$_{ 4 }$mixing ratios measured by the different platforms. To address uncertainty about where CH$_{ 4 }$ emissions actually occur, we explored three scenarios: areas with known seeps, a hydrate stability model, and an ocean depth criterion. We then used a budget analysis and a Lagrangian particle dispersion model to compare measurements taken upwind and downwind of the potential CH$_{ 4 }$ emission areas. We found small differences between the CH$_{ 4 }$ mixing ratios measured upwind and downwind of the potential emission areas during the campaign. By taking into account measurement and sampling uncertainties and by determining the sensitivity of the measured mixing ratios to potential oceanic emissions, we provide upper limits for the CH$_{ 4 }$ fluxes. The CH$_{ 4 }$ flux during the campaign was small, with an upper limit of 2. 5 nmol m$^{- 2 }$ s$^{- 1 }$ in the stability model scenario. The Zeppelin Observatory data for 2014 suggest CH$_{ 4 }$ fluxes from the Svalbard continental platform below 0. 2 Tg yr$^{- 1 }$. All estimates are in the lower range of values previously reported.

40|$|Over the anthropocene methane has {{increased}} dramatically. Wetlands {{are one of}} the major sources of methane to the atmosphere, but the role of changes in wetland emissions is not well understood. The Community Land Model (CLM) of the Community Earth System Models contains a module to estimate methane emissions from natural wetlands and rice paddies. Our comparison of CH 4 emission observations at 16 sites around the planet reveals, however, that there are large discrepancies between the CLM predictions and the observations. The goal of our study is to adjust the model parameters in order to minimize the root mean squared error (RMSE) between model predictions and observations. These parameters have been selected based on a sensitivity analysis. Because of the cost associated with running the CLM simulation (15 to 30 min on the Yellowstone Supercomputing Facility), only relatively few simulations can be allowed in order to find a near-optimal solution within an acceptable time. Our results indicate that the parameter estimation problem has multiple local minima. Hence, we use a computationally efficient global optimization algorithm that uses a radial basis function (RBF) surrogate model to approximate the objective function. We use the information from the RBF to select parameter values that are most promising with respect to improving the objective function value. We show with pseudo data that our optimization algorithm is able to make excellent progress with respect to decreasing the RMSE. Using the true CH 4 emission observations for optimizing the parameters, we are able to significantly reduce the overall RMSE between observations and model predictions by about 50 %. The methane emission predictions of the CLM using the optimized parameters agree better with the observed <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> <b>data</b> in northern and tropical latitudes. With the optimized parameters, the methane emission predictions are higher in northern latitudes than when the default parameters are used. For the tropics, the optimized parameters lead to lower emission predictions than the default parameters...|$|E
40|$|Dairy {{production}} is pointed out for its large methane emission. Therefore, currently studies of factors affecting emission and methods to abate methane emission are numerous. However, {{an important issue}} {{is the development of}} easily obtainable indicators, because they would also allow estimating animal genetic variability of methane emission. Recently methane indicators were proposed using gas chromatrography based milk fatty acid composition. We derived these published methane indicators using 1100 calibration samples directly from mid-infrared (MIR). For the published indicator showing the highest relationship (R 2 = 0. 88) with Sulfur Hexafluoride 6 <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> <b>data,</b> genetic parameters for this MIR based indicator were estimated by single trait random regression test-day models from 619, 272 records collected from 2007 to 2011 on 71, 188 Holstein cows in their first three lactations at Walloon region of Belgium. The average daily heritability was 0. 35 ± 0. 01, 0. 35 ± 0. 02 and 0. 32 ± 0. 02 for the first three lactations, respectively. Similarly, the lactation heritability was 0. 67 ± 0. 02, 0. 72 ± 0. 03 and 0. 62 ± 0. 03. As expected, methane production was higher during the peak milk production depicting the normal lactation curve. The largest differences between estimated breeding values (EBV) of sires having cows in production eructing the highest and the lowest methane content was 21. 80, 22. 75 and 24. 89 kg per lactation for the first three parities, the variances of the EBV of the sires with daughters were 10. 67, 12. 46, 12. 18 kg 2. Results were similar for other indicators. This study suggested that methane indicator traits can be predicted by MIR. Genetic parameters also indicated a rather high heritability and genetic variability exist for these published indicators and consequently a potential high genetic variability of methane eructation by dairy cows. Therefore, these first finding might open new opportunities for animal selection programs that include the reduction of methane emission. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This study performed leak detection and measurement on 96 km of gathering pipeline and the associated 56 pigging facilities and 39 block valves. The study found one underground leak accounting for 83 % (4. 0 kg CH 4 /hr) of total measured <b>emissions.</b> <b>Methane</b> <b>emissions</b> for the 4684 km of gathering pipeline {{in the study area}} were estimated at 402 kg CH 4 /hr [95 to 1065 kg CH 4 /hr, 95 % CI], or 1 % [0. 2 % to 2. 6 %] of all <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> measured during a prior aircraft study of the same area. Emissions estimated by this study fall within the uncertainty range of emissions estimated using emission factors from EPA’s 2015 Greenhouse Inventory and study activity estimates. While EPA’s current inventory is based upon emission factors from distribution mains measured in the 1990 s, this study indicates that using emission factors from more recent distribution studies could significantly underestimate emissions from gathering pipelines. To guide broader studies of pipeline emissions, we also estimate the fraction of the pipeline length within a basin that must be measured to constrain uncertainty of pipeline emissions estimates to within 1 % of total basin emissions.

As widespread measurement of <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> is precluded by current in vivo methods, {{the development of an}} easily measured proxy is desirable.

The main goals of this study were to improve the prediction equation for <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from milk MIR spectra and to illustrate its already available usefulness as a high throughput phenotypic screening tool. A total of 532 methane measurements considered as reference data (430 ± 129 g of methane/day) linked with milk MIR spectra were obtained from 165 cows using the SF 6 technique. A first derivative was applied to the MIR spectra. Constant (P 0), linear (P 1) and quadratic (P 2) modified Legendre polynomials were computed from each cows stage of lactation (days in milk), at the day of SF 6 methane measurement. The calibration model was developed using a modified partial least-squares regression on first derivative MIR data points × P 0, first derivative MIR data points × P 1, and first derivative MIR data points × P 2 as variables. The MIR-predicted <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> (g/day) showed a calibration coefficient of determination of 0. 74, a cross-validation coefficient of determination of 0. 70 and a standard error of calibration of 66 g/day.

40|$|Methane is {{the second}} most {{important}} greenhouse gas contributing to climate warming. The open ocean is a minor source of methane to the atmosphere. We report intense <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from the near-shore southern region of the North Sea characterized by the presence of extensive areas with gassy sediments. The average flux intensities (~ 130 µmol m - 2 d - 1) are one order of magnitude higher than values characteristic of continental shelves (~ 30 µmol m - 2 d - 1) and three orders of magnitude higher than values characteristic of the open ocean (~ 0. 4 µmol m - 2 d - 1). The high methane concentrations (up to 1, 128 nmol L - 1) that sustain these fluxes are related to the shallow and well-mixed water column that allows an efficient transfer of methane from the seafloor to surface waters. This differs from deeper and stratified seep areas where there is a large decrease of methane between bottom and surface by microbial oxidation or physical transport.

At {{the same time we}} measured the leaf mass per area (LMA), water content, and concentrations of carbon and nitrogen. There was no correlation between the leaf nitrogen concentration and the <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate. This is consistent with previous findings that enzymatic processes do not influence <b>methane</b> <b>emission.</b> We found a significant negative correlation between LMA and the <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate. Our results suggest that leaf structure is primarily responsible for differences in the rates of aerobic <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from leaves of different species...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether measurement of <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> by individual dairy cows during milking could provide a useful technique for monitoring on-farm <b>methane</b> <b>emissions.</b> To quantify <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from individual cows on farm, we developed a novel technique based on sampling air released by eructation during milking. Eructation frequency and methane released per eructation were used to estimate <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate. For 82 cows, <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate during milking increased with daily milk yield (r= 0. 71), but varied between individuals with the same milk yield and fed the same diet. For 12 cows, <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate recorded during milking on farm showed a linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 79) with daily methane output by the same cows when housed subsequently in respiration chambers. For 42 cows, the <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate during milking was greater on a feeding regimen designed to produce high <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> and the increase compared with a control regimen was similar to that observed for cows in respiration chambers. It was concluded that, with further validation, on-farm monitoring of <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate during milking could provide a low-cost reliable method to estimate daily methane output by individual dairy cows, which could be used to study variation in methane, to identify cows with low emissions, and to test outcomes of mitigation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Methane {{accounts}} for 14 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, {{second only to}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a GHG resulting from human activities.

40|$|This {{experiment}} encompassed three treatments {{with varying}} water regimes representing irrigated rice with assured flooding and two types of rainfed rice a ffected by droughts. <b>Methane</b> <b>emission</b> was recorded by an automatic closed chamber system facilitating continuous measurements over the entire dry and wet season of 1994. The <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rates in the dry season were generally {{higher than in the}} wet season; the seasonal patterns of <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> in the individual treatments showed a high degree of similarity in both seasons. Mid-tillering drainage prompted a pronounced decrease in <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rates which was attributed to the influx of oxygen into the soil. Low methane fluxes prevailed even after the field was reflooded. In the other treatments, which were kept flooded during tillering stage, <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rates stayed relatively constant. Drainage at 14 days before harvest prompted a short-term increase of <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> rate which was attributed to a degassing of soi l entrapped methane. In the field that was flooded throughout the growing season, the process of harvesting was also associated with the short-term release of large amounts of methane. The results of this experiment demonstrate that 1) rainfed rice has a lower emission potential than irrigated rice, 2) the impact of droughts on <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> depends on the actual growing stage the drought occurs, 3) <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from rainfed rice will increase with advances gained in water supply, and 4) temporary drainage can be an effective measure to reduce <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from rice...|$|R

EPA expects <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from livestock enteric fermentation to increase through 2020 as livestock populations grow to meet domestic and international demand for U.

When estimating <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from livestock enteric fermentation, EPA categorizes livestock populations, collects population <b>data,</b> and develops <b>emission</b> factors that account for the diversity of feed and animal character-istics throughout the U.

The greatest opportunity for reducing <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from cattle is to increase pro-duction efficiency through improved management techniques. This chapter describes <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from livestock enteric fermentation, the methodology used to estimate <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> and the approaches underway to reduce emissions from cattle. Cost-effective management practices and techniques can be used to improve animal health and nutrition, increase production efficiency, and reduce <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> per unit of product.

40|$|Methane {{production}} and transport processes in peatlands are fairly well understood, but growing evidence for <b>emission</b> of <b>methane</b> through trees has highlighted {{the need to}} revisit methane transport processes. In wetland trees, morphological adaptations such as development of hypertrophied lenticels, aerenchyma and adventitious roots in response to soil anoxia mediates gas transport, transporting both oxygen from the atmosphere to oxygen-deprived roots and soil-produced methane from the root-zone to the atmosphere. Although, tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from temperate tree species have been confirmed, <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from tropical tree species and processes that control tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> remain unclear. This study explains the role of trees in transporting soil-produced methane to the atmosphere and uncovers the principal mechanisms of tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions.</b> <b>Methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from eight tropical tree species and two temperate tree species were studied in situ. The mechanisms and controls on tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> were investigated using three year old common alder (Alnus glutinosa; 50 trees) grown under two artificially controlled water-table positions. Methane fluxes from whole mesocosms, the soil surface and tree stems were measured using static closed chambers. Both temperate and tropical tree species released significant quantities of methane, with tropical trees dominating ecosystem level methane fluxes. In temperate peatlands, both the methane gas transport mechanism and quantity of methane emitted from stems is tree-species dependent. In Alnus glutinosa, no correlations were observed between stomatal behaviour and tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions,</b> however, stem <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> were positively correlated with both stem lenticel density and dissolved soil methane concentration. In Alnus glutinosa, no emissions were observed from leaf surfaces. The results demonstrate that exclusion of tree-mediated <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> from flux measurement campaigns in forested peatlands will lead to an underestimation of ecosystem-wide <b>methane</b> <b>emissions.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A large {{seasonal}} variation in <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from Texas rice fields {{was observed in}} most of the growing seasons from 1989 through 1997. In general, the pattern showed small fluxes in the early season of cultivation and reached maximum at post-heading time, then declined and stopped after fields were drained. The amount of <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> positively relates to the aboveground biomass, the number of effective stems and tillers, and nitrogen addition. The day-to-day pattern of <b>methane</b> <b>emissions</b> was similar among all cultivars. The seasonal total <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> shows a significant positive correlation with post-heading plant height. The total <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from Texas rice fields was estimated as 33. 25 x 109 g in 1993, ranging from 25. 85 x 109 g/yr to 40. 65 x 109 g/yr. A mitigation technique was developed to obtain both high yield and less <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from Texas rice fields. A new approach was also developed to evaluate regional to large-scale <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from irrigated rice paddies. By combining modeling, ground truth information and remote sensing into a Geographic Information System (GIS) [...] -a computer based system, the seasonal <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from a large area can be calculated efficiently and more accurately. The methodology was tested at the Richmond Irrigation District (RID) site in Texas. The average daily <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> varied from field to field and even within a single field. The calculated seasonal total <b>methane</b> <b>emission</b> from RID rice fields was as low as 3. 34 x 108 g CH 4 in 1996 and as high as 7. 80 x 108 g CH 4 in 1998. To support the application of the estimation method in a worldwide study, an algorithm describing the mapping of irrigated rice paddies from Landsat TM data was demonstrated. The accuracy in 1998 -supervised classification approached 95 % when cloud cover was taken into account. Model uncertainty and data availability are the two major potential problems in worldwide application of the new approach.
