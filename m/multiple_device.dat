40|$|Nowadays, people {{increasingly}} use <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> {{to manage}} and share information anywhere anytime. Users are increasingly spreading large sets of files and folders among several devices. Since users cannot know at one device which files/folders are stored by other devices, data management across <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> has become a very difficult task. For instance, when one user needs an object that is not stored on the device being used, he/she needs to manually explore the entire object collection, which is spread across <b>multiple</b> <b>devices.</b> Additionally, different versions of files are created on <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> raising a consistency problem. Most current solutions ensure data management and consistency across devices through central servers or Internet services. Since portable devices have intermittent network connection or no connection at all to access these services, {{it is essential to}} take advantage of proximity between devices to synchronize data among them. This paper introduces MultiRep, a single-user file synchronizer middleware that provides the user with information about the location of files and folders stored on <b>multiple</b> <b>devices.</b> MultiRep is a totally decentralized system based on optimistic replication. It ensures eventual consistency among <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> through pairwise interactions, reporting all relevant information about conflicts to the users...|$|R

The communication among <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> with the IP is fully complied with the Standard SPI protocol. And it could automatically identify the master/slave devices and accomplish that multi-master devices could use TSM technology to control the same slave device. The SPI interface IP for <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> thus could overcome disadvantage during communication among <b>multiple</b> <b>devices,</b> including applying non-standard SPI interface and ingle-master communication protocol. ? 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{knowledge}} workers are increasingly using <b>multiple</b> <b>devices,</b> such as notebooks, tablets and smartphones to interact with different types of information that are part of their daily activities. Using <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> introduces a configuration overhead as users have to manually reconfigure all devices according to ongoing activities. Especially in an environment such as an office, where the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> is more common, the process of configuring them in context of ongoing activities is cumbersome. In this paper, we present the initial explorations of the ActivityDesk system, an interactive desk that supports multi-device configuration work and workspace aggregation into a personal ad hoc smart space for knowledge workers. The main goal of ActivityDesk is to reduce the configuration work required to use <b>multiple</b> <b>devices</b> at the same time by using an interactive desk as a configuration space...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to automated devices: they allow rescuers {{to focus on}} performing other interventions; they do not fatigue and begin to perform less effective compressions, as humans do; {{they are able to}} perform effective compressions in limited-space environments such as air ambulances, where manual compressions are difficult, and they allow ambulance workers to be strapped in safely rather than standing over a patient in a speeding vehicle. However the disadvantages are cost to purchase, time to train emergency personnel to use them, interruption to CPR to implement, potential for incorrect application and the need for <b>multiple</b> <b>device</b> sizes.|$|E
