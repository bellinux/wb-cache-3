25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the {{southbound}} express track was extended from south of Dyre Avenue {{and connected to}} the stub end track at Pelham Parkway. The southbound track at Dyre Avenue is {{in the position of}} the southbound express track, as the southbound local track is no longer present. The current platform is built over the northbound express track. Small portions of the original side platforms remain on both sides of Dyre Avenue station.

25|$|Another variation, {{especially}} against batsmen {{who have}} settled at the wicket and {{are starting to}} score more freely, is to switch the line of attack from the area just outside the off stump to bowling directly at leg stump. The batsman has to react to these balls as he otherwise runs {{a high risk of}} being bowled or trapped LBW but as he or she does so his or her bat <b>moves</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the leg side, leaving the off side vulnerable. If the bowler can induce enough movement to the off side with swing or seam techniques it will often catch the outside edge of the bat offering a catch or strike the stumps directly.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the scholar}} Shane White, English people {{had heard of}} the African Theatre because of British actor and comedian Charles Mathews, so Aldridge {{associated}} himself with that. Bernth Lindfors says:When Aldridge starts appearing on the stage at the Royalty Theatre, he's just called a gentleman of color. But when he <b>moves</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Coburg, he's advertised in the first playbill as the American Tragedian from the African Theater New York City. The second playbill refers to him as 'The African Tragedian'. So everybody goes to the theater expecting to laugh because this is the man they think Mathews saw in New York City.|$|E
