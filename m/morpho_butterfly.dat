50|$|The {{brilliant}} blue {{color in the}} butterfly's wings {{is caused by the}} diffraction of the light from millions of tiny scales on its wings. It uses this to frighten away predators, by flashing its wings rapidly. The wingspan of the blue <b>morpho</b> <b>butterfly</b> ranges from 7.5 - 20 cm. The entire blue <b>morpho</b> <b>butterfly</b> life cycle, from egg to adult is only 115 days. Known larval food plants are Leguminosae (Arachis hypogaea, Dioclea wilsonii, Inga species, Lonchocarpus, Machaerium cobanense, Machaerium salvadorense, Machaerium seemannii, Medicago sativa, Mucuna mutisiana, Pithecellobium, Pterocarpus rohrii, Mucuna urens) and Bignoniaceae (Paragonia pyramidata).Morpho peleides drinks the juices from rotting fruits for food. Its favorites in captivity are mango, kiwi, and lychee. Morpho peleides butterflies live in the rainforests of South America, and can be found in Mexico and Central America.|$|E

40|$|Two phylogenies of <b>Morpho</b> <b>butterflies</b> were {{previously}} published, founded on morphological data analysis. These phylogenies shared similarities but also several differences. In {{the present study}} we used partial sequences of the CO 1 and Cyt b mitochondrial genes to infer the phylogenetic relationships between the subgenera. From the ten subgenera previously described, seven are shown to be monophyletic: lphimedeia, Laurschwartzia, lphixibia, Megamede, Grasseia, Balachowskyna and Deyrollia. Although no consensus came out about the deepest relationships between the subgenera, {{it seems that the}} clade (Laurschwartzia, lphimedeia) diverged very early from the other <b>Morpho</b> <b>butterflies.</b> The results also consolidated the recent creation of the subgenus Deyrollia for two species previously included into the subgenus Cythefitis. The subgenus Balachowskyna may be included in Cytheritis but the unclear position of M. zephyritis make difficult to affirm it. Morphological and molecular data, considered together, suggest that the Brazilian Pessonia species could be included in the subgenus Morpho...|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} iridescent, electrifying colors in {{animals such as}} <b>morpho</b> <b>butterfly</b> wings, the intense color in bird {{feathers}} comes not from pigments in the feather itself, but from the way light is bent and reflected back out, much like a prism breaks white light into its spectrum of rainbow colors. These microscopic structures in feathers are called photonic crystals.|$|E

50|$|In 1925, Ernest Merritt, in {{his paper}} A Spectrophotometric Study of Certain Cases of Structural Color, first {{described}} {{the process of}} thin-film interference as {{an explanation for the}} iridescence.
