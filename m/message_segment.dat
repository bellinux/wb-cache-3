5000|$|The new TCP/IP stack also {{supports}} Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to keep throughput hit due to network congestion {{as low as}} possible. Without ECN, a TCP <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> is dropped by some router when its buffer is full. Hosts get no notice of building congestion until packets start being dropped. The sender detects the segment did not reach the destination; but {{due to lack of}} feedback from the congested router, it has no information on the extent of reduction in transmission rate it needs to make. Standard TCP implementations detect this drop when they time out waiting for acknowledgement from the receiver. The sender then reduces the size of its congestion window, which is the limit on the amount of data in flight at any time. Multiple packet drops can even result in a reset of the congestion window, to TCP's Maximum Segment Size, and a TCP Slow Start. Exponential backoff and only additive increase produce stable network behaviour, letting routers recover from congestion. However, the dropping of packets has noticeable impacts on time-sensitive streams like streaming media, because it takes time for the drop to be noticed and retransmitted. With ECN support enabled, the router sets two bits in the data packets that indicate to the receiver it is experiencing congestion (but not yet fully choked). The receiver in turn lets the sender know that a router is facing congestion and then the sender lowers its transmission rate by some amount. If the router is still congested, it will set the bits again, and eventually the sender will slow down even more. The advantage of this approach is that the router does not get full enough to drop packets, and thus the sender does not have to lower the transmission rate significantly to cause serious delays in time-sensitive streams; nor does it risk severe under-utilization of bandwidth. Without ECN, the only way routers can tell hosts anything is by dropping packets. ECN is like Random Early Drop, except that the packets are marked instead of dropped. The only caveat is that both sender and receiver, as well as all intermediate routers, have to be ECN-friendly. Any router along the way can prevent the use of ECN if it considers ECN-marked packets invalid and drops them (or more typically the whole connection setup fails because of a piece of network equipment that drops connection setup packets with ECN flags set). Routers that don't know about ECN can still drop packets normally, but there is some ECN-hostile network equipment on the Internet. For this reason, ECN is disabled by default. It can be enabled via the [...] command.|$|E

40|$|Improved {{procedures}} for the glycosylation of serine and threonine utilizing Schiff base activation are reported. The procedures are less expensive and more efficient alternatives to previously published methods. The Schiff bases exhibited ring-chain tautomerism in CDCl₃ as shown by ¹H NMR. Acting as glycosyl acceptors, the Schiff bases reacted at RT with simple sugar peracetate donors with BF₃•OEt₂ promotion to provide the corresponding protected amino acid glycosides in good yields. With microwave irradiation, the reactions were complete in 2 - 5 minutes. Glycosylation with the dipeptide Schiff base shows the potential of this method {{in the preparation of}} peptide building blocks. To investigate this reaction further, direct glycosylation of sugar acetates with FMOC-Ser-OH/OBZl under BF₃•OEt₂ promotion in a microwave provided glycosides in high yield. In addition to the expected glycoside products acetylated side products resulting from acetate migration were isolated, suggesting that activation of the anomeric sugar acetates with a Lewis acid such BF₃•OEt₂ led to an oxocarbenium ion, which rearranged to a 1, 2 -dioxocarbenium ion because of the acetate participating group at C- 2. Solvent participation was also illustrated with acetate migration being more pronounced when CH₃CN was used as a solvent and resulted in less product yield and higher amounts of the acetylated product. The acyl transfer products in these reactions where sugar acetates serve as glycosyl donors is reported for the first time, which also implies that ortho-ester like intermediates are important in the reaction mechanism. Keeping the <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> constant in the sequence H-Tyr-DThr-Gly-Phe-Leu- Ser-CO-NH₂ and modification of the address segment with different carbohydrate moieties had little effect on selectivity for binding at the μ, δ, or κ-opiod receptors. However, substitution of D-threonine with D-serine or the less polar D-alanine in the <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> resulted in a loss of κ-receptor affinity. Further replacement of D-threonine with the more hydrophobic D-valine resulted in complete loss of κ-binding affinity generating pure μ-δ agonists. These data suggests that changes in the <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> of the pharmacophore results in the glycopeptide adopting a conformation that is less favorable for 1 ̆ 00001 -binding receptor activity. Finally, the peripheral administration and i. c. v. tests of the drugs suggest that modifications in the <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> of the pharmacophore influences the potency of these compounds...|$|E

40|$|Short {{message service}} (SMS) {{has been a}} very {{important}} tool in mobile communication for years, and the usage is still growing. The difficulty in editing messages on handset devices can be overcome by sending SMS messages through Internet-connected gateways. Furthermore, we can adopt such mechanisms to integrate mobile-computing ability to many existing information systems. However, it’s easy to send a message in which the length of content exceeds the limit allowed by the SMS specification. Therefore, splitting one message into several segments before passing the message to the SMS gateway is necessary if the original message is lengthy. Due to the specification of SMS, the length of a <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> is determined by the content and may vary in different segments. In this paper, we compare two approaches of segmentation. Proof of optimality for the greedy approach proposed in this paper is an open issue for further research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Modern {{computing}} {{systems are}} instrumented to generate {{huge amounts of}} system logs and these data can be utilized for understanding and complex system behaviors. One main fundamental challenge in automated log analysis is the generation of system events from raw textual logs. Recent works apply clustering techniques to translate the raw log messages into system events using only the word/term information. In this paper, we first illustrate the drawbacks of existing techniques for event generation from system logs. We then propose LogTree, a novel and algorithm-independent framework for events generation from raw system log messages. LogTree utilizes the format and structural information of the raw logs in the clustering process to generate system events with better accuracy. In addition, an indexing data structure, <b>Message</b> <b>Segment</b> Table, is proposed in LogTree to significantly improve the efficiency of events generation. Extensive experiments on real system logs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LogTree. Keywords-event generation; mining system log data; LogTree; log message clustering. I...|$|E

This affinity is slightly better than the neurotensin 8 – 13 fragment, the <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> of the derivatives.

40|$|Three new analogues of the neuropeptide {{substance}} P (SP) were synthesized. The C-terminal <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> {{was made}} more hydrophilic in (Arg 9) SP or more hydrophobic in (Nle 9) SP. In (AcPro 2, Arg 9) SP the charge at the N-terminal address segment was reduced, while {{that of the}} <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> was increased. The rationale underlying these substitutions was to correlate the physical-chemical properties of the SP-analogues, in particular their lipid-induced conformation and membrane-binding affinity, with receptor binding and functional activity. In solution, all three analogues exhibited random coil conformations as evidenced by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Addition of SDS micelles induced partially alpha-helical structures. The same structure was also produced by negatively charged lipid vesicles for (AcPro 2, Arg 9) SP and (Arg 9) SP whereas both alpha-helix-like structures and beta-sheet structures were observed for SP and (Nle 9) SP. The measurement of the Gibbs adsorption isotherms and monolayer expansion studies provided quantitative data on the surface area requirement and on the membrane penetration area of the SP analogues. The thermodynamic parameters for lipid binding were determined with monolayer expansion for measurements and high-sensitivity titration calorimetry. The apparent binding constants, Kapp, for membranes containing 100 % POPG were {{of the order of}} 10 (3) - 10 (5) M(- 1). The binding was due to electrostatic attraction of the cationic peptides to the negatively charged membrane surface. The intrinsic (hydrophobic) binding constants, obtained after correcting for electrostatic effects, were much smaller with Kp= 10 +/- 1 M(- 1) for (Arg 9) SP, 9 +/- 1 M(- 1) for (AcPro 2, Arg 9) SP, and 39 +/- 3 M(- 1) for (Nle 9) SP. The measurement of the binding affinities to the NK- 1 receptor and of the in vitro activities showed that all three peptides behaved as agonists. Their binding affinity to the neurokinin- 1 receptor decreased with the size of the side chains at position 9 of the amino acid sequence but was independent of the cationic charge of the peptides. The fact that even the highly charged (Arg 9) SP has agonistic activity provides evidence that the binding epitope at the receptor is in a rather hydrophilic environment. This finding is in agreement with the low hydrophobic binding constants and the weak penetration of the three peptides into negatively charged membranes. It argues against a membrane mediated receptor mechanism and suggests that the agonist approaches the receptor binding, site from the aqueous phase...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{observed}} membrane structures of substance P, physalaemin, and eledoisin, preferred conformations, orientations and accumulations of 13 mammalian neurokinins and non-mammalian tachykinins were estimated and compared with pharmacologic and selective binding data {{taken from the}} literature. Principal site affinities and relative affinities supported the view that neurokinins bind to three principal mammalian sites: the NK- 1 (preferring substance P), the NK- 2 (preferring neurokinin A), and the NK- 3 site (preferring neurokinin B). Strong hydrophobic membrane interaction of the C-terminal <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> as a perpendicularly oriented alpha-helical domain correlated with NK- 1 selection. Electrostatic accumulation of the peptide at the anionic fixed charge layer of the membrane without hydrophobic interaction through a helix correlated with NK- 2 preference. Electrostatic repulsion by the anionic fixed charge layer correlated with NK- 3 selection. Thus, neurokinin receptor selection is guided by the same principles as opioid receptor selection.

40|$|Structure-activity {{relationships}} (SAR) of opioid peptide analogues {{related to}} endorphin or dynorphin have provided rational and powerful approaches toward {{the design of}} peptide therapeutics. A series of glycosylated β-endorphin analogues were designed by modifying the N-terminal “message domain,” the C-terminal “address domain,” and the “linkage domain” between the two, and by altering the intrinsic helix stability of the amphipathic helix that comprises the “address domain. ” Further changes were accomplished by altering the charged groups on the side chains of the “address region. ” The unglycosylated peptide homologues and variations of the saccharide moieties (monosaccharides vs disaccharides) were also studied. The β- endorphin glycopeptide analogue ¹Tyr- ᵐD-Thr- ³Gly- ⁴Phe- ⁵Leu- ᴸPro- ⁷Asn- ⁸Leu- ʰAib ᶜGlu- ᶜLys- ʰAla- ¹³Leu- ᶜLys-¹⁵Ser[β-O-Glucose]- ¹⁶Leu-NH 2, was modified at the indicated positions (m, h, c), and {{in collaboration with the}} Bidlack Lab at the Rochester Medical Center, binding affinities Kᵢ were measured using human opioid receptors expressed in CHO cells. All the peptides and glycopeptides were panagonists, showing low nanomolar affinity for the μ, δ and κ-opioid receptors. Helix stability was varied by substituting ʰAib, ʰAla, and ʰGly, which altered membrane affinity, which was correlated with helix stability. Charges on the address side chains were varied by substituting ᶜAsn, ᶜGlu, and ᶜLys. The 15 Ser residue bore either a β- Lactoside, a β-D-glucoside or was unglycosylated. These peptides and glycopeptides were studied by circular dichroism (CD) and by 2 D-NMR in H₂O buffer (pH = 5. 5), in 30 % trifluoroethanol in H₂O, and in H₂O containing SDS micelles as a model for biological membranes. In H₂O the glycopeptides and peptides showed only nascent helix behavior and random coil conformations. Chemical Shift Indices (CSI) and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) confirmed the helical nature of the “address domains” in the presence of SDS micelles (membrane mimics). Detailed backbone conformations were determined using distance constraints provided by NOE volumes. Based on the CD experiments, most of the β-endorphin analogues showed substantial amounts of helicity in the presence of membrane bilayer models. Several glycopeptides demonstrated penetration of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), and produced potent antinociceptive effects in mice after intravenous (i. v.) injection. The amphipathic address domain {{played a major role in}} BBB penetration, as reflected by the i. v. activities. The linker also had profound effects on the SAR, and it was possible to produce antinociceptive glycopeptides. In summary, we suggest that this biousian nature is essential for glycopeptides to maintain bioactivities, and the longer, more flexible linkages GABA and DAVA were able to mediate two interactions having lower energy, one interaction between the <b>message</b> <b>segment</b> and opioid receptor’s binding pocket, and another one between the address segment and the cell membrane, to result in higher binding affinities to all three opioid receptors, and significantly increasing analgesia after both i. c. v and i. v. administration.

It considers a realistic situation where a single message may be too large to be sent in over a single connection and hence might require to be transmitted in segments. In specific, we look into the push and pull message transfer techniques and investigate in details their effect on broadcast {{time as well as}} total number of redundant contacts incurred during the transmission of segmented messages. For such segmentation and a complete graph topology with n nodes, we observe that the time required for broadcast scales as n k− 1 k (assuming there are k packets in one <b>message</b> <b>segment)</b> as opposed to logn in the single message epidemic case (k = 1). In order to improve broadcast time and reduce the number of useless contacts we propose different variants of the push and pull message transfer techniques. In this regard we introduce the concept of giveup, which allows a node to terminate broadcast on sensing its neighborhood has received the message. We further study the effect of message segmentation on various types of topologies like d-regular graph, random graph etc. and observe that even for simple push technique, there exists an optimal d for which the dynamics becomes fast. We also simulate our results on real traces and finally provide some suggestions for network designers which we believe will help in faster message dissemination and lesser wastage, especially in case of dynamic networks.

The prime example is Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) that are subject to a growing body of research. These networks support applications used by the military and first responders, especially in emergency situations. Securing a DTN is not a trivial undertaking due to node mobility and the ADHOC method in which nodes communicate. Here, we propose a distributed trust management scheme to secure this class of networks with many of the underlying principles appli-cable to the larger class of Mobile ADHOC Networks (MANET). The scheme employs erasure coding not only to increase delivery rate in a DTN but also to infer the trustworthiness of the nodes along all paths that deliver a <b>message</b> <b>segments</b> to the destination. The proposed approach enables us to decide when the destination node should stop waiting for additional segments and instead request message retransmission.
