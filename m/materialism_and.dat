5|$|Jacob L. Beilhart (March 4, 1867 – November 24, 1908) was {{the founder}} and leader of a communitarian group known as the Spirit Fruit Society. Beilhart {{believed}} that jealousy, <b>materialism,</b> <b>and</b> the fear of losing another's love were {{at the root of}} much of the illness in the world. Under his direction, the Spirit Fruit Society sought to model and practice those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's Système de la Nature (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that <b>materialism</b> <b>and</b> determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.|$|E
5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. More importantly, {{he laid out}} his belief in Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his <b>materialism</b> <b>and</b> necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E

5|$|These views {{informed}} {{his novel}} Quo Vadis (1896). This story of early Christianity in Rome, with protagonists struggling against the Emperor Nero's regime, draws parallels between repressed early Christians and contemporary Poles; and, {{due to its}} focus on Christianity, it became widely popular in the Christian West. The triumph of spiritual Christianity over materialist Rome was a critique of <b>materialism</b> <b>and</b> decadence, and also an allegory for {{the strength of the}} Polish spirit.|$|E
5|$|Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) was {{a philosopher}} and theologian born in Roman Africa (present-day Algeria). He {{followed}} the Manichaean religion during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, Confessions and City of God, develop key ideas regarding {{his response to}} suffering. In Confessions, Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by <b>materialism</b> <b>and</b> that reading Plato's works enabled him to consider {{the existence of a}} non-physical substance. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective, based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of Genesis and the writings of Paul the Apostle. In City of God, Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Dylan, a 28 year-old grad student, is {{depressed}} {{because he}} {{is in love with}} his best friend, Kira, but she is dating Dylan's roommate, Mason. He has a cynical worldview and criticizes the world for its <b>materialism,</b> <b>and</b> at the same time wishes he could connect better with the people in it. When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick {{as the end of the}} month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He settles on a brothel run by a Russian mob. He murders one of the men, but is violently beaten by one of the sex workers before he escapes. His unexplained injuries lead Kira to end their secret romance, although they remain friends. Dylan begins taking boxing lessons and stalking a corrupt businessman. A detective, Lily Sharpe, begins to connect the dots between Dylan's murders; the Russian mob begins to hunt for Dylan.|$|E
50|$|Jamal Khwaja’s basic {{approach}} to philosophy and religion is irenic rather than polemical, and {{he attempts to}} transcend the traditional polarities of Rationalism and Empiricism, Idealism <b>and</b> <b>Materialism,</b> Theism <b>and</b> Atheism. This irenic approach flows from a critical methodology of philosophy.|$|R

50|$|The {{repetitive}} rhyme scheme ABBAABBA, {{and the use}} of word pairs such as “getting and spending” and “late and soon” emphasises the monotonous {{nature of}} modern life <b>and</b> <b>materialism.</b> Getting <b>and</b> spending is a cluster of longer emphasised words with many consonants, also possibly emphasising this view.|$|R

25|$|Bryan {{also read}} The Science of Power (1918) by British social theorist Benjamin Kidd, which {{credited}} {{the philosophy of}} Friedrich Nietzsche with German nationalism, <b>materialism,</b> <b>and</b> militarism.

25|$|Later, Vladimir Lenin {{outlined}} philosophical materialism in {{his book}} <b>Materialism</b> <b>and</b> Empiriocriticism, which connected the political conceptions put forth by his opponents to their anti-materialist philosophies.

25|$|Ann Scott (born 3 November 1965 in Paris, France) is a French novelist.

25|$|Fascists accuse {{liberalism}} of <b>materialism</b> <b>and</b> a lack {{of spiritual}} values. In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its materialism, rationalism, individualism and utilitarianism. Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness, but many fascists agree with liberals in their support of private property rights and a market economy.|$|E
500|$|Although Priestley's {{philosophical}} {{work has}} been characterised as [...] "audacious and original", it partakes of older philosophical traditions {{on the problems of}} free will, determinism, <b>and</b> <b>materialism.</b> For example, the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza argued for absolute determinism <b>and</b> absolute <b>materialism.</b> Like Spinoza <b>and</b> Priestley, ...|$|R

25|$|The Soviet Union, {{formally}} {{created in}} December 1922, {{was the first}} state to have elimination of religion as an ideological objective espoused by the country′s ruling political party.

Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed.|$|E
25|$|The major {{difference}} between Machiavelli and the Socratics, according to Strauss, is Machiavelli's <b>materialism</b> <b>and</b> therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature, and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their teleological understanding of things, Socratics argued that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli emphasized that such things happen by blind chance, or human action.|$|E
