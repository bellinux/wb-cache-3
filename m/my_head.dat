5|$|On May 19, 2004, Rollins began {{hosting a}} weekly radio show, Harmony in <b>My</b> <b>Head,</b> on Indie 103.1 radio in Los Angeles. The show aired every Monday evening, with Rollins playing music ranging from early rock and jump blues to hard rock, blues rock, folk rock, punk rock, heavy metal and rockabilly, and {{touching}} on hip hop, jazz, world music, reggae, classical music and more. Harmony in <b>my</b> <b>Head</b> often emphasizes B-sides, live bootlegs and other rarities, and nearly every episode has featured a song {{either by the}} Beastie Boys or British group The Fall.|$|E
5|$|Farrell and British-American writer Emma Forrest dated {{for over}} a year, an {{experience}} she discusses in depth in her memoir Your Voice in <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (focusing on {{her relationship with her}} therapist, who died unexpectedly); it is a planned film starring either Emily Blunt or Emma Watson, and Stanley Tucci, and directed by Francesca Gregorini. According to Forrest, she and Farrell planned to have a child together before he ended the relationship.|$|E
5|$|I {{had it in}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E

It seemed all right to me as far as I could see; but p'r'aps the pint didn't clear <b>my</b> <b>'ead</b> enough--p'r'aps I ought to 'ave 'ad two pints.|$|R

5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. I told him the feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' off the top of <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff out of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about {{the right amount of}} blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

5|$|Johansson {{shifted to}} adult roles in 2003 with her {{performances}} in Lost in Translation (for which {{she won a}} BAFTA Award for Best Actress) and Girl with a Pearl Earring. She was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards for these films, and for playing an estranged teenager in the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004), and a seductress in the psychological thriller Match Point (2005). Other films during this period include the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006) and the comedy-drama Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). She also released two albums: Anywhere I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> (2008) and Break Up (2009), both of which charted on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|Since Black Flag disbanded, Rollins {{has hosted}} {{numerous}} radio shows, such as Harmony in <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> on Indie 103, {{and television shows}} such as The Henry Rollins Show, MTV's 120 Minutes, and Jackass. He had recurring dramatic roles in the second season of Sons of Anarchy, in the final seasons of the animated series The Legend of Korra as Zaheer, and has also had roles in several films. Rollins has campaigned for various political causes in the United States, including promoting LGBT rights, World Hunger Relief, the West Memphis Three {{and an end to}} war in particular.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept <b>my</b> <b>head</b> clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the back of <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E
