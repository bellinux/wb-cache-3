50|$|Financial Security Assurance (FSA) is a {{financial}} guaranty (or <b>monoline)</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>company.</b> In 2007, before the 2008 financial crisis, FSA was ranked number four among global monoline credit insurers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>monoline</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> got {{involved}} with writing credit default swaps on mortgage-backed CDOs. Some media reports have claimed this was a contributing factor to the downfall {{of some of the}} monolines. In 2009 one of the monolines, MBIA, sued Merrill Lynch, claiming that Merrill had misrepresented some of its CDOs to MBIA in order to persuade MBIA to write CDS protection for those CDOs.|$|R
50|$|A wrapped {{security}} is insured or guaranteed {{by a third}} party. A third party or, in some cases, {{the parent company of}} the ABS issuer may provide a promise to reimburse the trust for losses up to a specified amount. Deals can also include agreements to advance principal and interest or to buy back any defaulted loans. The third-party guarantees are typically provided by AAA-rated financial guarantors or <b>monoline</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>monoline</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> (AMBAC, MBIA, ACA, &c) {{have written}} vast {{quantities}} of insurance against the failure of CDO tranches. Those tranches now begin to fail by the hundreds. The credit ratings agencies downgrade the monolines from AAA, but the monolines have a unique business model. If they don't have a AAA rating, then their main line of business (municipal bond insurance for city infrastructure projects) becomes {{impossible for them to}} perform. By 2009, the monolines have all crashed.|$|R
50|$|Like all swaps {{and other}} {{financial}} derivatives, CDS may either be used to hedge risks (specifically, to insure creditors against default) or to profit from speculation. The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008, with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts, as of November 2008, ranging from US$33 to $47 trillion. CDS are lightly regulated, {{largely because of the}} Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. As of 2008, there was no central clearing house to honor CDS in the event a party to a CDS proved unable to perform his obligations under the CDS contract. Required disclosure of CDS-related obligations has been criticized as inadequate. <b>Insurance</b> <b>companies</b> such as American International Group (AIG), MBIA, and Ambac faced ratings downgrades because widespread mortgage defaults increased their potential exposure to CDS losses. These firms had to obtain additional funds (capital) to offset this exposure. AIG's having CDSs insuring $440 billion of MBS resulted in its seeking and obtaining a Federal government bailout. The <b>monoline</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> went out of business in 2008-2009.|$|R
50|$|Credit default swap markets quoted {{rates for}} {{monoline}} default protection more typical for below-investment-grade credits. Structured credit issuance ceased, and many municipal bond issuers spurned bond insurance, {{as the market}} was no longer {{willing to pay the}} traditional premium for monoline-backed paper. New players such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Assurance entered the market. By January 2008, many municipal and institutional bonds were trading at prices as if they were uninsured, effectively discounting <b>monoline</b> <b>insurance</b> completely. The slow reaction of the ratings agencies in formalizing this situation echoed their slow downgrading of subprime mortgage debt a year earlier.|$|R

50|$|In 1995, the New York State Insurance Department (the “NYID”) {{enabled the}} <b>monolines</b> to write <b>insurance</b> on {{guaranteed}} investment contracts (“GICs”). GICs were envisioned as “stable,” highly rated investments sold by <b>insurance</b> <b>companies,</b> largely to pension {{funds in the}} 1970s and 1980s. With an insured GIC, the monoline would pay out in the event the original insurer failed.In 1999, the NYID issued guidance regarding insurance of obligations under credit default swaps, which facilitated the participation by financial guaranty insurers in the CDS market. The NYID guidance was subsequently codified by amendments to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law.|$|R
