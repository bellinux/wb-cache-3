5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|FreeStyleGames {{teamed up}} with London based music {{production}} company Crossfade Cartel owned by Ofei Sakyi and Dan Neil to ensure {{the overall quality of}} the soundtrack. The 16 man music production team used a combination of MIDI software along with the music sequencer program, Ableton Live; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software. Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> meet certain gameplay goals, taking only a few minutes to complete, compared with the development of songs for Guitar Hero.|$|E

40|$|Notions of {{weak and}} uniformly weak <b>mixing</b> (<b>to</b> zero) are defined for bounded {{sequences}} in arbitrary Banach spaces.

5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, {{but some of the}} clays may have been collected {{from the base of the}} cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special game controller that includes a turntable surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the turntable controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions scroll down on screen towards the player in time with the music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each <b>mix)</b> <b>to</b> unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to Expert), with higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E

25|$|Gain pumping, where {{a regular}} {{amplitude}} peak (such as a kick drum) causes {{the rest of}} the <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> change in volume due to the compressor, is generally avoided in music production. However, many dance and hip-hop musicians purposefully use this phenomenon, causing the <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> alter in volume rhythmically in time with the beat.|$|E

25|$|Research in the United Kingdom {{under the}} SPARCS (Self-Pressurising-Air Rotor Cooling System) project, found that idle {{stability}} and economy {{was obtained by}} supplying an ignitable <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> only one rotor in a multi-rotor engine in a forced-air cooled rotor, similar to the Norton air-cooled designs.|$|E
25|$|These gas mixes {{can also}} lower {{the level of}} oxygen in the <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> reduce the danger of oxygen toxicity. Once the oxygen is reduced below about 18% the mix {{is known as a}} hypoxic mix as it does not contain enough oxygen to be used safely at the surface.|$|E

Patrick Gleeson was eventually added to the <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> play and program the synthesizers.|$|E

25|$|To avoid oxygen {{toxicity}} and narcosis, the diver {{needs to}} plan the required <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> be blended and to check the proportions of oxygen and inert gases in the blended mix before diving. Generally the tolerance of each final component gas fraction should be within +/-1% of the required fraction. Analysis instruments commonly used by recreational/technical diving gas blenders are typically capable of a resolution of 0.1% for both oxygen and helium.|$|E
25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} exhaust stream, emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This problem may be overcome by implementing direct fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both intake and exhaust side ports, suppressed the loss of unburned <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> exhaust formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E
25|$|The hotspot is {{believed}} to be over 20 million years old and in that time there has been interaction between the hotspot, both of these plates, and the divergent plate boundary, at the Galapagos Spreading Centre. Lavas from the hotspot do not exhibit the homogeneous nature of many hotspots; instead there is evidence of four major reservoirs feeding the hotspot. These <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> varying degrees at different locations on the archipelago and also within the Galapagos Spreading Centre.|$|E

25|$|In {{humans and}} other complex life forms, blood and lymph {{circulate}} {{in two different}} systems, the circulatory system and lymphatic system, which are enclosed by systems of capillaries, veins, arteries, and nodes. This {{is known as a}} closed circulatory system. Insects, however, have an open circulatory system in which blood and lymph circulate unenclosed, and <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> form a substance called hemolymph. All organs of the insect are bathed in hemolymph, which provides oxygen and nutrients to all of the insect's organs.|$|E
25|$|As a soil conditioner: Where {{the native}} soil is heavy or sticky, gentle mixing of {{vermiculite}} - up to one-half {{the volume of}} the soil - is recommended. This creates air channels and allows the soil <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> breathe. Mixing vermiculite in flower and vegetable gardens or in potted plants will provide the necessary air to maintain vigorous plant growth. Where soils are sandy, mixing of vermiculite into the soil will allow the soil to hold the water and air needed for growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} mixing a known nitrox mix with helium allows {{analysis}} of the fractions of each gas using only an oxygen analyser, since {{the ratio of the}} oxygen fraction in the final <b>mix</b> <b>to</b> the oxygen fraction in the initial nitrox gives the fraction of nitrox in the final mix, hence the fractions of the three components are easily calculated. It is demonstrably true that the END of a nitrox-helium mixture at its maximum operating depth (MOD) is equal to the MOD of the nitrox alone.|$|E
