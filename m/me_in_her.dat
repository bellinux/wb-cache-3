500|$|The {{reference}} to basketball player Steve Nash in the song's lyrics led to speculation {{that he and}} Furtado were romantically involved, but both deny the link with Nash commenting, [...] "I'm flattered that she put <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> song, but I'm completely {{in love with my}} wife and two little baby girls". Furtado decided to include him because she and Nash are both from Victoria, British Columbia, and due to frequent citations of basketballers in songs, she decided to [...] "give him the props". In one of the verses Timbaland introduces himself as Thomas Crown. The Thomas Crown Affair is a film about wealthy businessman who plays a cat-and-mouse/flirting game with an insurance investigator. Timbaland only performed the song live on special occasions, such as Furtado's appearance on Saturday Night Live, and the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards. Starting with Furtado's show at the 94th Grey Cup on 19 November 2006, and extending into the Get Loose Tour, Timbaland's part is filled in by Canadian rapper Saukrates.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this first}} visit, Schieble told Jobs {{that he had}} a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother. Schieble then {{arranged}} for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that [...] "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy." [...] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk {{to get to know each}} other. Jobs later told his biographer that [...] "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me [...] [...] [...] [...] As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{was the way}} {{she always}} talked when she'd got <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>'er</b> power. She took two-and-tenpence--all I'd got--and then she ordered me to go and get a cab.|$|R

2500|$|After Jobs' adoptive mother, Clara, died of {{lung cancer}} in 1986, he met with Schieble (whom he had already found through an {{extensive}} search) for the first time. He then discovered that not only was Simpson his sister but that she also had no idea an older brother had been given up for adoption. Schieble then arranged for Jobs and Simpson to meet in New York where Simpson worked. She states that her first impression of Jobs was that “he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy." [...] Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk {{in order to get to}} know each other.

2500|$|In 1633 Maria Eleonora {{returned}} to Sweden with the embalmed body of her husband. In Nyköping, 7-year-old Queen Christina came in solemn procession {{to the ship}} to receive her mother. Later she wrote: [...] "I embraced the queen my mother, she drowned me with her tears and practically smothered <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms." [...] For {{more than a year}} Maria Eleonora condemned the active, spirited little Queen to an appalling mourning seclusion in rooms draped with black and lit by candles day and night, from which every ray of light was excluded. She made her daughter sleep with her in a bed over which her father's heart was hung in a golden casket. Things were made worse by Maria Eleonora's continual weeping. Christina, who was herself somewhat malformed with one shoulder higher than the other, also detested her mother's dwarfs and buffoons. She became seriously ill; an ulcer appeared on her left breast, causing her terrible pain and a high fever until it burst. In the summer of 1634 the funeral procession finally wound its way to Stockholm. Queen Christina later wrote about her mother: [...] "She carried out her role of mourning to perfection." ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{came out}} triumphant, Euphemia seized <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms and kissed me.|$|E
60|$|Sweeping by the lank young man, Miss Sellars {{opened the}} parlour door, and towing <b>me</b> <b>in</b> behind <b>her,</b> shut it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Heer Allan"--she {{had never}} called <b>me</b> Heer <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life before--"I am {{so glad to}} find you out! How have you been getting on?" ...|$|R
50|$|I went to {{the house}} {{on the top of the}} hill When the moon was shining dearly,She arose to let <b>me</b> <b>in,</b> But <b>her</b> mother chanced to hear her.|$|R
60|$|It was as I had expected--she {{knew nothing}} of Wright's {{discharging}} <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> name.|$|E
60|$|Her hand stopped now. She clasped <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms, and I {{clasped her}} in mine.|$|E
60|$|Instantly Euphemia had <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> arms, and we {{came very}} near going off the roof together.|$|E
60|$|The {{chair was}} still there, but the wizard was gone. Leonora turned to <b>me,</b> horror <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes, her golden curls {{changed to a}} pale German silver.|$|R
6000|$|Ithers seek they ken na what, [...] Features, carriage, and a' that; [...] Gie <b>me</b> love <b>in</b> <b>her</b> I court, [...] Love to love maks a' the sport.|$|R
6000|$|After this, need I {{say that}} the most amiable of women took <b>me</b> out <b>in</b> <b>her</b> carriage, and {{introduced}} me {{to some of the}} best society in England? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{continued}} to muse at <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> queer, sightless fashion, {{almost as if}} she were looking for help.|$|E
6000|$|Abbess. But tell <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{confession}} Was {{there no}} holy shame--no self-abhorrence For the vile pleasures of her carnal wedlock? ...|$|E
60|$|She made a dive at me, {{and before}} I could escape caught <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> strong young arms and hugged me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{have you}} been, {{and what have}} you been doing?" [...] asked Norah. She still {{retained}} her grip upon <b>me,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> grey eyes was quiet determination.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} looked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the eyes. <b>Her</b> gaze was unfaltering, but soft.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head towards <b>me,</b> and {{answered}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> gayest tones.|$|R
60|$|Cam. But Violetta desired <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> note, {{to bring}} him, on purpose {{to pass the}} time with her woman, Beatrix.|$|E

60|$|Celia {{interrupted}} <b>me.</b> The woman <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{made her}} revolt against this well-intentioned subterfuge.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the face. <b>Her</b> tired {{eyes lit}} with a gleam {{of her former}} humor.|$|R
60|$|She took <b>me</b> up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> milk-white hand, And she straik'd {{me three}} times o'er her knee; She chang'd me again to my ain proper shape, And nae mair do I toddle about the tree.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right! How are you right? Have {{you been}} {{suggesting}} that, my dear?" [...] demanded my wife, {{with a gentle}} despair of <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> voice.|$|E
6000|$|She'd half forgot <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> change; [...] "Who are you? Won't you say Who you may be, you man so strange, [...] Following since yesterday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{this again}} they talked, but {{in quite a}} {{different}} tone and manner. Then the Glittering Lady said to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> slow and archaic Orofenan: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{paused a}} moment. Our horses were moving slowly, for the tale engrossed us both, <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the telling, <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the hearing. Presently-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw man!" [...] {{rejoined the}} other {{not without a}} tone of bitterness, [...] "what matters what my {{reputation}} is <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sight? She despises me so utterly already that a few sins more or less cannot lower <b>me</b> further <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sight." ...|$|R
