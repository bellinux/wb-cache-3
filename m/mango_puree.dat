ChambersFresh mangoes {{are highly}} perishable, and therefore, {{they are often}} {{processed}} to extend shelf-life and facilitate exportation. Studying the transformation that mango cultivars undergo throughout processing can aid in selecting appropriate varieties for products. In the 1 st part of this study, the flavor and texture properties of 4 mango cultivars available in the United States (U. S.) were analyzed. Highly trained descriptive panelists in the U. S. evaluated fresh, purée, and sorbet samples prepared from each cultivar. Purées were made by pulverizing mango flesh, passing it through a china cap, and heating it to 85 °C for 15 s. For the sorbets, purées were diluted with water (1 : 1), sucrose was added, and the bases were frozen in a batch ice cream freezer. Much of the texture variation among cultivars was lost after fresh samples were transformed into purées, whereas much of the flavor and texture variation among cultivars was lost once fresh <b>mangoes</b> and <b>mango</b> <b>purées</b> were transformed into sorbets. Compared to the other cultivars, Haden and Tommy Atkins underwent greater transformations in flavor throughout sorbet preparation, and processing reduced the intensities of some unpleasant flavors in these cultivars. Tommy Atkins was the only cultivar that had flavor differences from other cultivars when it was in sorbet. Results suggest that cultivar variation is generally not detectable in mango sorbet unless the cultivar has a distinct initial flavor. In the 2 nd part of this study, descriptive panelists in Thailand evaluated the flavor and texture properties of fresh samples and purées prepared from 6 cultivars grown in Thailand. Thermal processing had unique effects on the flavor of each cultivar, especially Nam Dok Mai and Chok Anun; Nam Dok Mai significantly decreased in mango identity and peach flavors after processing, whereas Chok Anun significantly increased in sweet, mango identity, and pineapple flavors. Although a slight amount of flavor variation among cultivars was lost because of thermal processing, most of the texture variation was eliminated. Because of significant changes in flavor and texture after heat treatment of mango cultivars, manufacturers should select cultivars for <b>mango</b> <b>purées</b> based on their properties after thermal processing...|$|R

Product from four processors was tested on two occasions. The retail packs of cheeks-in-puree having the highest coliform counts were those in which raw puree was added to the cheeks. Coliform counts in these samples ranged between 1. 4 × 103 and 5. 4 × 104 cfu/g. Pasteurisation reduced the coliform count of raw puree to < 5 cfu/g. Forty-seven percent of the 73 colonies, isolated as coliforms on the basis of their colony morphology on violet red bile agar, were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae using the ATB 32 E Identification System. Klebsiella strains were tested for growth at 10 °C, faecal coliform response, and fermentation of -melizitose, to differentiate the three phenotypically similar strains, K. pneumoniae, K. terrigena and K planticola.

More particularly, a technical manual was prepared on the range of indigenous products suitable for small-scale processing. Thirty-four participants attended the project's training course from February to April 1991, where weekly sessions concentrated on food processing and preservation techniques, in particular the use of dehydration, heat sterilization, vinegar, salt, sugar and oil. Products included cucumber and beet pickles, mango nectar and <b>mango</b> chutney, tomato <b>puree,</b> peeled tomatoes, bajan sauce made of tomatoes and okra, mango and guava leather, guava jelly, sorrel jam and sorrel drink, and eggplant preserved in oil. The course also focused on economic questions and how to set up feasibility studies.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} mango endogenous pectinases to change the viscosity of <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> Hereto, the structure of pectic polysaccharide and the presence of sufficiently active endogenous enzymes of ripe mango were determined. Pectin of mango flesh had a high molecular weight and was highly methoxylated. Pectin methylesterase showed a negligible activity which is related to the confirmed presence of a pectin methylesterase inhibitor. Pectin contained relatively high amounts of galactose and considerable β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity was observed. The possibility of stimulating β-Gal activity during processing (temperature/pressure, time) was investigated. β-Gal of mango was rather temperature labile but pressure stable relatively to the temperature and pressure levels used to inactivate destructive enzymes in industry.

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are acknowledged for their wide range of health benefits such as prevention of chronic disease, and reduction of food intake by increasing the satiety. However they are perishable, often season dependent and for many, cultivation is limited to specific climate and regions. Therefore processing to produce intermediate ingredients such as purée is a common solution to facilitate their consumption, increase their shelf-life and year-round availability. Owing to their convenience next to their perception of year-round available natural products, fruit purées {{are becoming more and}} more popular. In fruit and vegetable based products, the cell wall polysaccharide pectin is an important polymeric component partially defining the functional and flow properties of such systems. Mango, accounting for almost 39 % of the world’s tropical fruit production (82. 2 million tons in 2009), is one of the most popular fruits in western countries (FAO, 2011). <b>Mango</b> <b>purée</b> obtained from fruit disintegration has an extremely high consistency leading to many limitations for further purée processing and manipulation. A common practice in industry to handle this problem is by diluting purée with water for which flavor reconstitution and sugar addition are required. However such process is not preferred due to the addition of sugar and sensorial drawbacks. The present drawbacks for the current solution incited us to formulate one of the aims of this work which was based on the intimate relation between pectin nanostructure and function. The aim was to utilize different naturally-present pectin modifying enzymes (i. e. pectinases) to tailor the flow properties of <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> by alteration of pectin nanostructure. To reach the aim, in the first approach, the possibility of using endogenous pectin-degrading enzymes to influence the high consistency of <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> was investigated. In the second approach, exogenous enzymes (single enzyme and mixtures) with and without an additional application of intensive mechanical disintegration were used. It was shown that the most active endogenous pectin-degrading enzyme, β-galactosidase, being temperature labile but pressure stable, was not able to significantly decrease <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> consistency. It was observed that the high consistency of <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> can not be solely related to pectin polymers and their modification. Other polymers such as starch and cellulose also contribute to the high consistency observed whether directly (starch) or indirectly (cellulose). We also observed that the enzymatic treatment significantly changed particle morphology. Our results suggest that particle morphology is an important factor in consistency changes in <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> The sequence of the enzymatic and mechanical treatments was found to be crucial to the final consistency observed. In general, the amount of serum is the main parameter having a strong and positive correlation with Bostwick consistency index, meaning that release of water and most likely with some degraded polymers into the serum by the enzymatic treatments decreased the consistency. Although mango processing increases the ease of consumption and mango year round availability, large amounts of mango peel is produced as one of the waste streams of mango processing. It should come as no surprise that currently wasted mango peel has to receive proper attention to sustain mango processing by decreasing downstream concerns. Escaping from the existing environmental limitations imposed by classical pectin extraction using mineral acids, the second aim of this work was to obtain a high quality pectin with a commercial valuable functionality from mango peel. A method of acidic-chelator-assisted pectin extraction isolated, with a higher yield compared to the common extraction technique, a pectin with unique chemical characteristics. The citric acid extracted mango peel pectin was compared with apple pectin in terms of chemical structure and some valuable industrial functional properties to evaluate the functionality as related to pre-determined pectin nanostructure. Despite the high molecular weight of the extracted pectin, a high ratio of neutral sugar branches limited the pectin gelation capacity but contributed to noticeable emulsification properties. The present work showed the potential of a well-known cocktail of exogenous enzymes to tailor <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> consistency especially when such treatment was combined in a specific sequence with high pressure homogenization. Additionally, a sustainable way of pectin extraction was introduced, by which pectin with valuable functionality was obtained from currently wasted low cost mango peel. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: During the {{therapeutic}} videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing, gradation of bolus volume, texture, and viscosity {{can be implemented}} to determine the optimal bolus characteristics in that particular patient. When a thickened liquid is given to a dysphagic patient it is served at room temperature. However, in these patients with a delayed oral and/or pharyngeal stage of swallow, the bolus is held {{for a long time}} in the oral cavity. The temperature of the thickened liquid thereby increases. PURPOSE: To study the rheological exploration (variation of viscosity with temperature) of thickened food used for radiologic swallowing examinations in patients with oral and pharyngeal dysfunction, in particular in mixtures of barium sulfate suspensions and in iodine solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Deep-frozen <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> was thawed at room temperature. It was then mixed with barium sulfate contrast medium to a density of 25 % w/w. Resorce Thicken Up was mixed at room temperature at two concentrations: 4. 3 % w/w (4. 5 g thickener + 100 g distilled water) and 6. 0 % w/w (4. 5 g thickener + 70 g distilled water). The thickener consisted of modified corn starch. Resorce Thicken Up was also mixed at room temperature with two concentrations of an iodine contrast material, iohexol (Omnipaque, 350 mg I/ml). The two concentrations were: 4. 3 % w/w (4. 5 g thickener + 100 g iohexol) and 6 % w/w (6 g thickener + 100 g iohexol). Measurements were carried out from 20 degrees C to 37 degrees C using a Stresstech HR rheometer. The rheometer was equipped with a concentric cylinder measuring system (inner cylinder 15 mm). RESULTS: The samples containing thickener in water as well as in iohexol showed a dependence on thickener concentration and temperature. The <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> with barium sulfate displayed very small temperature dependence. The thickener solutions in iohexol had significantly higher viscosity compared with the other thickener solutions and the <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> The relative decrease shows that <b>mango</b> <b>purée,</b> the 6 % thickener solution in water, and solutions with iohexol exhibited similar relative viscosity change at different temperatures. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is therefore that it is important always to make the solution with high precision. It is also of importance to observe how long the patient keeps the bolus in the mouth. This might vary and actually it may not be possible to influence this factor. When different types of thickeners are compared, it is important to take into account the temperature at which the thickener is observed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{parameters}} {{are important in}} product quality control and process design: thermo-physical and rheological properties. Reliable estimates of thermal properties (thermal conductivity, diffusivity, density, specific heat, and glass transition temperature) are needed to model {{the rate of heat}} transfer during food processing. Measurements of rheological parameters like viscosity and elasticity have been recognized as important tools to provide fundamental insights on structural organization of the food. Small amplitude oscillatory testing is useful in evaluation of gel characteristics and texture development in different food products. Proper design of industrial plants, modeling and automation in food process industry require data on these properties for better quality control and improve the shelf life. Thermal processing has been a traditionally accepted method for developing safe and shelf-stable products. However, a disadvantage of thermal treatment is the reduced sensory and nutritional qualities. High pressure (HP) treatment, a novel non-thermal preservation technique, is used for producing high quality products. HP processing {{can also be used to}} achieve products with better textural properties and improved nutrition when supplemented with proteins. This research was carried out in two parts. In first part, experiments with mango pulp were carried out at four temperatures (20, 40, 60 and 80 °C) and total soluble solids concentrations (15, 20, 30 and 40 °Brix) and their rheological and thermo-physical properties were evaluated and modeled. Thermal properties of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> were primarily dependent on the moisture content of the sample, and increased with temperature and decreased with concentration. Density showed a reverse trend. Glass transition temperatures increased with an increase in concentration indicating better stability. Separate models were developed for each thermal property as a function of temperature and concentration (R 2 > 0. 90). <b>Mango</b> <b>puree</b> exhibited pseudoplaticity during steady shear measurements, and the power law model well described their flow behavior. Consistency coefficient increased with concentration and decreased with temperature. The flow behavior index decreased with concentration and generally increased with temperature beyond 40 °C. Dynamic oscillation shear measurements revealed that <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> behaved like a weak gel and demonstrated visco-elastic properties. In the second part, experiments were divided in to two parts. In first part, the original soluble solids in <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> (28 °Brix) was lowered to 20, 23 and 26 °Brix and each was supplemented with 2, 5 and 8 % of whey protein. Effect of HP treatment at 425, 500, and 575 MPa with 0, 3 and 6 min holding times on rheological properties were evaluated. Pressure treatment resulted in a positive effect on elastic (G') and viscous modulii (G") as well as complex viscosity (eta*). Values of G' were higher than G" demonstrating the product to behave more and more like a gel. The changes in rheological parameters at 500 MPa were modeled based on soluble solids and protein content. In the second part of the experiments, the protein (P) and soluble solids concentrations (S) were simultaneously varied maintaining a total solids content at 28 % (same as in the original <b>mango</b> <b>puree)</b> and their combined influence (P/S: 2 / 26, 3 / 25, 5 / 23, 7 / 21 and 8 / 20) on the rheology of the product after selected HP treatments (425 - 575 MPa, 0 - 6 min) were evaluated. The effects of holding time and pressure level were similar to those observed previously in first part of this study. However, the positive effect of added protein was over dominated by negative effect of the simultaneous decrease in the soluble solids concentration, resulting in an overall decreasing effect as protein content increased (with a same magnitude decrease in soluble solids content). Developed models well predicted the combined influence of protein and soluble solids concentration on rheological parameters (R 2 > 0. 85). Sensory evaluation of <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> supplemented with protein (2, 5 and 8 %) was performed before and after high pressure treatment (500 MPa/ 3 min) using a nine point hedonic scale.

The NIRSystem 6500 was used to scan the spectra in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 1100 nm. The partial least square regression (PLSR) was used to develop a model for each component. The result was a wavelength that corresponds to each component. It was found that the second derivative spectra of glucose, sucrose, citric acid, malic acid, starch and cellulose mixtures showed the best PLSR result. The mango cultivar had no effect on wavelength selection by PLSR model. The coefficient of determination (R 2) of all models was 0. 99.

In this part, the kinetics of the shelf-life markers selected from the multivariate fingerprinting approach were modelled. Changes in selected targeted parameters could be best described by a zero-order (colour values, °Brix, furfural, HMF), a first-order (ascorbic acid), a fractional conversion (fructose, glucose, oxygen) and a second-order model (sucrose). Differences in the rate constant were observed, with faster ascorbic acid degradation and furfural formation in AA-enriched samples and faster hydrolysis of sugars and HMF formation in CA-enriched samples compared to control samples. To describe changes in selected volatiles (terpenes, sulphur compounds, acids, ketones and esters), different kinetic models were selected. Two trends were observed: changes as affected by different mango juice formulations (e. g., faster reaction in CA-enriched samples or in a lower pH condition) and changes irrespective of the formulations. Referring to the literature, in general, acid-catalysed reactions, ascorbic acid degradation and oxidation reactions are the main reactions responsible for the observed quality changes in stored mango juice. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Studies for the {{development}} of a novel convenient fruit product based on <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> and gellan gum were carried out. Two gellan types (low acyl-L and high acyl-H) used in specific L/H ratios (75 / 25, 50 / 50, 25 / 75) for an overall concentration of 1 g of gellan/ 100 g of puree were tested, in order to design different mango bars. The influence of the L/H gellan ratio on their texture properties (TPA and SR tests), microstructure (Cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy) and texture sensory acceptance (Preference- Ranking test) was studied. The results obtained enabled to separate the bars in two groups: the ones showing greater hardness and brittleness (only L gellan, and L/H at the ratios of 75 / 25 and 50 / 50); and those presenting a softer structure with higher cohesiveness and springiness values (L/H of 25 / 75 and only H gellan). The microstructure of mango bars was consistent with the texture results. Those presenting higher hardness have shown a microstructure composed of a denser biopolymer network with lower pore size; while for softer bars with higher springiness, larger pores and thin strings were observed. From the Preference-Ranking test, the most appreciated mango bar in terms of texture was the one prepared with a L/H ratio of 25 / 75. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

The processed CF contained germinated, autoclaved, and dried finger millet (65. 2 %), kidney beans (19. 1 %), roasted-peanuts (8 %), and <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> (7. 7 %). The same blend, but not processed, served as the placebo. Processing increased iron solubility and energy density without affecting viscosity. Mean length for age, weight for age, hemoglobin, and zinc protoporphyrin at 6 and 12 mo did not differ between the 2 groups. The {{results show that the}} processed food did not differ from the unprocessed placebo in improving growth, hemoglobin, and iron status of infants when given under the study conditions. The control group consumed equal amounts of macronutrients, and the higher energy density in this study did not seem to have any benefits. In our study, there was a very intensive follow-up; at every encounter with mothers, giving the required amounts and adding extra lipids was strongly reinforced. Under those conditions, a well-balanced complementary food with additional lipids can meet the energy needs of young children.

40|$|Table mango {{varieties}} discarded by {{the export}} market {{are generally not}} considered suitable for processing mainly because they yield too viscous fruit purées. The objective {{of this study was}} determining if appropriate enzymatic treatment can overcome this barrier. Cell-wall polysaccharides from mesocarp and pericarp of fully ripe table mangoes were characterized analyzing the alcohol-insoluble residues (AIR). Content of celluloses, hemicelluloses, lignin and soluble and insoluble pectin were assessed after selective extraction. After hydrolysis of main fractions, neutral sugars were determined by gas chromatography showing that xylose prevails (12 - 14 %) in the non-cellulosic fraction of insoluble cell walls from mesocarp, indicating predominance with cellulose, of xilan-type polysaccharides in mango flesh. Water insoluble AIR (WAIR) was incubated with commercial preparations, characterized for their main enzymatic activities and comprising balanced proportion of pectinases and cellulases with other different secondary activities. At equivalent 500 ?l per kilogram of purée and at 45 °C, solubilisation rates of uronids and neutral sugars reach respectively 100 and 90 % only when xylanase activities were present. Then, a commercial enzyme preparation containing pectinases, cellulases and high xylanase activities was applied to native <b>mango</b> <b>purée</b> varying enzyme concentration and incubation time according to a central composite rotatable design. It was shown that percent of final suspended insoluble solids and Bostwick consistency could be considerably reduced in minutes, using a relatively low amount of enzyme preparation (150 ?l. L- 1). Rheological properties of mango purées can be modulated easily according to incubation time and concentration of enzymatic solution to fit the needs of food industries. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Australian food {{products}} {{have a reputation}} for exceptional quality and are valued for by consumers for high safety standards. Recently, there have been several high profile incidents where Australian products “made from local and imported ingredients” have resulted in negative health outcomes which were traced back to produce that was not locally sourced. Local processing company Tropico Fruits produces an extensive range of fruit based products and list an Australian Kensington Pride <b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> among their flagship products. In light of the recent health issues arising from composite products using imported ingredients, the ability to test a processed product and identify the country of origin of it constituents is of great value to commercial enterprises that promote their products as locally sourced. Processed mango products are great candidates for assessing the feasibility of applying DNA-based identification methodologies for a number of reasons. DNA profiles have been determined for over 300 mango accession sourced from around the globe, including all the major domestic and overseas commercial varieties. Within all the commercial varieties, unique combinations of DNA markers exist such that a specific DNA profile {{can be traced back to}} the source variety. This means that even in composite purees, the major constituent varieties would be detected. To this end, four commercially produced mango purees were provided by Tropico Fruits and samples were subjected to a number of DNA extraction methodologies. While several of the methods produced workable quantities of highly degraded DNA, none of the extracted samples produced any results in the DNA fingerprinting steps. The objective of this project was to produce a set of reliable protocols that could determine the constituents of a processed product on the basis of a DNA profile. Unfortunately, while DNA was isolated using several techniques, the level of DNA degradation arising from the pureeing and sterilisation processes meant that DNA profiles could not be generate...|$|E
40|$|Mango (Mangifera indica L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tropical fruits commercialized and consumed worldwide, and an excellent source of fibre, bioactive compounds such as pro-vitamin A carotenoids, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and phenolics. Mango was used in this thesis as a model fruit of fruits and vegetables that are rich sources of nutrients. They are highly perishable, prone to progressive undesired changes if stored untreated. As a result, large amounts of mango are lost annually in many areas of the world including Mozambique. To reduce postharvest losses of fruits, processing is recommended since it extends the shelf life and enable the availability off-season, and the promotion of consumption is a potential health enhancing strategy. However, processing of fruits and vegetables must be carefully designed to achieve a high sensory and nutritional quality of the final products. The aim of the present thesis was thus to evaluate the effect of conventional and novel processing techniques on the retention of vitamin C and β-carotene, two major bioactive compounds, in minimally processed or dried mango products. The effect of osmotic dehydration (OD) with or without vitamin C or calcium prior to hot air-drying was evaluated in terms of the retention of vitamin C and β-carotene in dried mango. Fortification of OD solutions with either calcium or vitamin C was shown to be an efficient way to improve the retention of vitamin C and carotenoids in dried mango. OD pre-treatment reduced the hardness, drying time, and prevented colour changes. The potential use of alternative blanching techniques to improve the retention of vitamin C and β-carotene in processed mango was explored using infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) dry blanching and blanching in a closed plastic bag immersed in water bath at (High-Temperature-Short-Time - HTST) or (Low-Temperature-Long-Time - LTLT), prior to hot air-drying. Complete inactivation of PPO was achieved, while a minor activity of AAO remained. An improved retention of vitamin C in dried mango was achieved using IR and MW dry blanching or water blanching in plastic bag in comparison to conventional water blanching. However, the retention of all-trans-β-carotene was higher in dried mango after water blanching than after dry blanching. In conclusion, a correct selection of suitable techniques and conditions for blanching can enhance the nutritional value of dried mango and inactivate enzymes that degrade vitamin C and β-carotene. To address the problem of reduced sensory and nutritional quality during the processing of purées, the impact of acidification, addition of EDTA or water blanching at HTST, on the retention of vitamin C (L-AA and DHAA) and β-carotene was evaluated in <b>mango</b> <b>purée.</b> The results showed that the disruption of the cellular matrix during purée processing facilitates oxidative reactions of vitamin C and of all-trans-β-carotene unless protected by an initial blanching step, pH adjustments or addition of EDTA a chelating agent to inhibit AAO and PPO activities...|$|E
40|$|For {{shelf-stable}} pasteurised fruit juices, colour degradation (browning) is a known problem, which is, however, scientifically {{still not}} completely understood. Besides colour, also other chemical changes {{can occur in}} fruit juices during shelf life, thereby affecting consumer acceptance. The objective of the present PhD work is to obtain insight into quality changes of high-acid pasteurised fruit juices during shelf life. The following strategic choices have been made: (i) starting raw materials; (ii) processing conditions; (iii) storage conditions; and (iv) analytical approaches. Orange and mango juice were chosen as representative high-acid, pasteurised, shelf-stable products. As it was known {{from the start of}} the PhD that the colour stability of pasteurised mango juice during storage is much better compared to orange juice, the effect of product composition on colour stability during storage has been investigated. For that purpose, mango juice was studied as plain (i. e. without added precursors) and as reformulated juice (i. e. with the addition of different reaction precursors such as sugar, ascorbic acid and citric acid, making the formulation more similar to the composition of orange juice). For all fruit juices, the same intense pasteurisation process (92 °C for 30 s) was selected to destroy microorganisms and to inactivate thermally resistant endogenous enzymes. After pasteurisation, all juices were stored at ambient and/or accelerated storage conditions. The quality evolution of orange and mango juice during storage was studied by a priori selected targeted attributes (i. e. targeted approach) and by an untargeted multivariate ‘fingerprinting’ approach. Both approaches were applied individually or were combined. Changes in quality characteristics were investigated ranging from single response (univariate) to multiresponse (multivariate), and attributes or compounds clearly affected by shelf life were kinetically modelled. The experimental work of the PhD is presented in two parts, (i) investigating shelf life quality changes in pasteurised orange juice as affected by extrinsic factors (storage time and temperature) (Part I) and (ii) investigating shelf life quality changes in pasteurised mango juice as affected by intrinsic factors (different juice compositions) (Part II). In Part I, pasteurised orange juice samples were stored at four different temperatures, 20 °C and 28 °C for a total of 32 weeks, 35 °C for 12 weeks and 42 °C for 8 weeks. A targeted approach was used to gain insight in the chemical reactions responsible for quality changes, particularly, colour changes. The effect of storage time and temperature on a wide range of quality attributes (colour, carotenoids, acidity, sugars, oxygen, vitamin C, furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)) was investigated using a kinetic approach. In addition, multivariate data analysis (MVDA) was applied to describe the correlation between the multiple targeted responses and colour. Browning was clearly observed during storage, particularly at elevated storage temperatures, and could be associated to non-enzymatic browning reactions, such as the oxidative ascorbic acid degradation and acid catalysed degradation of sugars. It was observed that the total carotenoid content was relatively stable during storage which indicates that the contribution of carotenoid degradation to colour changes was limited. No changes in the acidity of orange juice were observed at all storage temperatures. Significant decreases were observed for ascorbic acid, oxygen and sucrose, while furfural, HMF, glucose and fructose significantly increased. Next, insight into other possible reaction pathways responsible for overall quality changes in stored orange juice was obtained through an untargeted fingerprinting-kinetics approach. For this purpose, the headspace fraction of the matrix was analysed. Volatile compounds classified as sulphur compounds, terpenes, esters, and aldehydes were clearly changing during storage and/or were highly correlated to storage time (i. e. shelf life markers). Changes in the selected volatile compounds can be linked to various chemical reactions, such as acid-catalysed degradation, Strecker degradation, oxidative reactions, and hydrolysis of esters. Also, flavour scalping could have played a role in changes in the volatile compounds during storage. To quantify the changes of the selected volatile markers as a function of time and temperature, kinetic modelling was applied. Results showed that terpenes (α-pinene, α-terpineol, and linalool) and aldehydes (octanal) had clearly temperature and time dependent kinetics within the investigated temperature range. In Part II, mango juices were prepared by adding different potential precursors for non-enzymatic browning (ascorbic acid, citric acid and sugars) to the control juice (<b>mango</b> <b>puree</b> and water). Control, ascorbic acid-enriched (AA 250 and AA 500), citric acid-enriched (CA, CA+AA 250 and CA+AA 500) and sugar-enriched (S) samples were stored at an accelerated storage condition (i. e. 42 °C for up to 8 weeks). The effect of different mango juice compositions on quality changes was investigated using a combined targeted and untargeted multivariate approach followed by kinetic modelling. With this advanced analytical approach, shelf life markers consisting of quality attributes (colour, °Brix, ascorbic acid, sugars, furfural, HMF) and volatile compounds (terpenes, sulphur compounds, acids, ketones, and esters) were selected. The markers could be linked to acid-catalysed reactions (e. g. terpene rearrangement, hydrolysis of esters and hydrolysis of sugars), ascorbic acid degradation and oxidation reactions. By modelling the kinetics of the selected shelf life markers, an increase in acidity of mango juice seems to enhance several reactions (e. g. sugar degradation, HMF formation, hydrolysis of esters and terpenes rearrangement). Also, faster ascorbic acid degradation and furfural formation in AA-enriched samples was observed. To determine which quality degradation reactions play important roles in predicting shelf life, the kinetic parameters of the selected markers of orange and mango juice were compared. Under the investigated storage conditions, colour degradation could be the main reaction determining shelf life of pasteurised orange juice, while in mango juice, changes in the volatile compounds could limit its shelf life. This hypothesis should be confirmed with a sensory evaluation which determines the level of acceptability of the juice (i. e. end of shelf life). In conclusion, insight into the chemical changes of pasteurised juices during storage was obtained through (combination) of targeted and untargeted multivariate approaches followed by kinetics. Multiple degradation reactions are responsible for quality changes in orange and mango juice, of which the reactions are influenced by storage temperature, oxygen and acidity. Future research can be carried out in different areas, for example, conducting a sensory evaluation in relation to the juice acceptability, developing analytical methods to characterise the brown components, improving the identification of the volatile compounds, and using an advanced multiway data analysis technique. status: publishe...|$|E
