5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E

At a warehouse, Harold grabs a gun from a shelf and Dr. Kroger gestures for Harold to shoot Merrigan and his accomplice, who are emptying the vacuum bag {{to destroy the}} evidence. However, Harold <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> noise. As Merrigan prepares to shoot Harold, the police arrive to arrest Merrigan, but just then, he shoots at Dr. Kroger. Harold intercepts the bullet in his chest and Merrigan is taken away.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} extinction of isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E
5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes that it is a recent feature. Next he <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E
5|$|When Veronica discovers new {{evidence}} that suggests that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, she decides to investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, {{as well as those}} provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and {{went out of his way}} to harass her.|$|E

25|$|Discrimination of women: The {{complete}} {{denial of}} the freedoms of expression and association has exacerbated the generally unequal status of women.

The male-dominated State preys on both economically advancing women and marginalized women who suffer bribery, sexual assault, and gender violence. Victims are not afforded protection by the State or recourse to justice.

This allows the work to be passed over the router, rather than passing the router over the work. This has benefits when working with smaller objects and <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> router operations safer to execute. A router table may be fitted with a fence, fingerboards and other work-guiding accessories to make the operation safer and more accurate.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types. This <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> of them particularly valuable as agents in biological control programmes. Determination of specialisation {{need not be}} a trivial matter, though; for example the larva of the Vedalia ladybird Rodolia cardinalis is a specialist predator on a few species of Monophlebidae, in particular Icerya purchasi, which is the most notorious of the cottony cushion scale species. However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|E

Several events are combined; some events, such as Tohru's first meeting with Momiji and all references to Tohru's baseball cap, never happen. The anime makes no mention that Yuki and Kyo have met Tohru's mother or that Kyo blames himself for her death. Many of the events surrounding the revealing of Kyo's true form are greatly changed in the anime, including adding an extended chase sequence and Tohru meeting Akito in the woods, none of which happen in the manga.|$|E
