This {{seems to be at}} odds with parameterizations forGWmomentum fluxes, where the source is a function of latent heating rates, which are largest in the region of the ITCZ in terms of monthly averages. The authors have examined global distributions of atmospheric latent heating, cloud-top-pressure altitudes, and lower-stratosphere absolute GW <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> and have found that monthly averages of the lower-stratosphere GW <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> more closely resemble the monthly mean cloud-top altitudes rather than the monthly mean rates of latent heating. These regions of highest cloud-top altitudes occur when rates of latent heating are largest on the time scale of cloud growth. This, plus previously published studies, suggests that convective sources for stratospheric GW <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes,</b> being a function of the rate of latent heating, will require either a climate model to correctly model this rate of latent heating or some ad hoc adjustments to account for shortcomings in a climate model's land-sea differences in convective latent heating...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConvective {{gravity waves}} in the Tropics are studied by {{analyzing}} in situ measurements from long-duration stratospheric balloons launched during the PreConcordiasi campaign (2010) and mesoscale simulations. An improved temporal resolution of the observations {{as well as the}} balloon quasi-Lagrangian behavior allow an unprecedented investigation of the whole gravity wave spectrum. First, a case study of gravity waves generated by a developing cyclone, Tropical Storm Gelane (February 2010), is carried out using observations complemented by numerical simulations with the Weather Research and Forecast model, with a resolution down to 1 km. Distributions of <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> obtained from both data show reasonable agreement and emphasize waves with short wavelengths (< 15 km) and short periods (< 20 min). Still, some differences are also found, which can likely be related to errors of the modeled background flow. Second, observations from the whole PreConcordiasi flights are analyzed with an emphasis on gravity wave <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Their phase speed distribution has a robust shape, with maximum fluxes with near-zero ground-based phase speeds. Yet, significant <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> are also found for larger values, yielding a mean phase speed of about 27 ms- 1. The <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> are concentrated in short episodes with intense values, and their intermittency is quantified using probability distribution functions and the Gini coefficient (0. 5 - 0. 6). The relative importance of convective and topographic sources are investigated, suggesting comparable intensities, but a greater occurrence frequency of convective events. Waves emitted by Tropical Storm Gelane do not stand out relative to other convective events. Key Points The whole gravity-wave spectrum is studiedin simulations and balloon data. Most <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> come from short-wavelength, short-period waves. Intermittency is quantified, a robust phase-speed distribution is found. © 2013. American Geophysical Union.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for estimating gravity wave characteristics from quasi-Lagrangian observations provided by long-duration, superpressure balloon flights {{in the stratosphere}} is reviewed. Wavelet analysis techniques are used to detect gravity wave packets in observations of pressure, temperature, and horizontal velocity. An emphasis is put on the estimation of gravity wave <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> and intrinsic phase speeds, which are generally poorly known on global scales in the atmosphere. The methodology is validated using Monte Carlo simulations of time series that mimic the balloon measurements, including the uncertainties associ-ated {{with each of the}} meteorological parameters. While the azimuths of the wave propagation direction are accurately retrieved, the <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> are generally slightly underestimated, especially when wave packets overlap in the time–frequency domain, or for short-period waves. A proxy is derived to estimate by how much <b>momentum</b> <b>fluxes</b> are reduced by the analysis. Retrievals of intrinsic phase speeds are less accurate, especially for low phase speed waves.

The enhancement averages to 56 W m- 2, or 16 % of the net radiation, at fetches less than 400 m, equivalent to fetch to height ratios less than 15. The enhancement of turbulent energy fluxes is explained by advection and increases with the difference in temperature and humidity of the air over the upwind area {{as compared to the}} forest.
