25|$|Once in Harlem, a news {{broadcast}} about {{the bombing of}} the convent causes the group to realize there is <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.|$|E
500|$|Regarding his {{portrayal}} of the character, Morgan commented, [...] "I played him with extra angst. I think {{what was on the}} page, what I foresawnot knowing where it was going, because no one would ever tell me anythingthere was always a lot <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in his head than he was going to show anybody, including his sons. Because, indeed, {{there was a lot more}} going on." [...] Kripke later confirmed this, stating, [...] "It's our view that John knew everything the producers of the show know. John knew stuff we're not even ready to reveal, that won't come out for a couple of seasons. He was an awesome hunter, and by the time he showed up in 'Dead Man's Blood', he knew it all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Company Picnic" [...] {{was filmed}} in Malibu, California. The episode {{featured}} about 360 extras, and was shot {{over the course}} of four days. Actor Ed Helms said of the episode, [...] "What the writers did is really fun and creative. It doesn't boil down to passive aggressive little picnic games with a vengeance. There's a lot <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> than that." [...] The episode marked return appearances of former guest stars Amy Ryan as Holly Flax and Idris Elba as Charles Miner. Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes, but that there are currently no plans for such a return: [...] "I think that door [...] will always be open, just because it's such a nice party to go to. But that said, there are no plans any time soon for them to be reunited again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I hear," [...] Redfield said sullenly, {{with the}} consent which Braile read in his words. [...] "But if there's any <b>more</b> such <b>goings</b> <b>on</b> as we've had here to-night, I won't answer {{for the rest of}} his scalp." ...|$|R
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, in an {{interview}} with Der Spiegel, he was asked if he was religious. Cleese stated that he didn't think much of organized religion and said he was not committed to [...] "anything except the vague feeling that there is something <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> than the materialist reductionist people think".|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} these findings, on 1 May, the American Veterinary Medical Association noted in a press release the [...] "extremely insoluble" [...] {{crystals}} formed in animal kidneys are suspected of blocking kidney function. On 7 May, however, Barbara Powers, president of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians {{and a professor of}} veterinary diagnostics at Colorado State University cautioned [...] "There's something <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> than just the mechanical blockage. Because you wouldn't see so much necrosis (cell death) and inflammation.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Attendance at the 2010 Bikefest events held in Atlantic Beach {{appeared}} to be up over 2009, with greater variety in entertainment, merchandise and services offered. [...] Atlantic Beach Town Manager William Booker said there are more families with children, and that, [...] "We have a lot <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in terms of vendors this year, including more people who are selling parts and upgrades for bikes, which is something we're really working to get more of. People are literally getting their bikes worked on today, which hasn't happened {{a lot in the}} past." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film". Whedon stated [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, [...] "the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary." [...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is no way you could hear the name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. This is what it is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{continued}} his review in part two, where he lauded {{the writing of}} Sinon's backstory and sufferance of PTSD as [...] "masterful", writing [...] "The way she falls apart even in her Sinon persona {{when faced with a}} particular stressor is quite credible, as is the way she struggles to cope with her crushing fear; she is desperately afraid to die, but even more afraid of living with the fear [...] almost seems like a deliberate message is being sent to the audience, and the way she finally finds her resolve and fights back when her life is in serious jeopardy is heartening." [...] He also praised Michelle Ruff's voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinon's portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series is that she has more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, she's someone who is actively working to change herself [...] it feels like this is a turning point for Kawahara's writing skill. Sinon isn't perfectly depicted, but she's got <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otaku's Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are wrong, John; {{there is}} <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> {{than meets the}} eye of a man walking through the streets.

All that silence and absence of goings-on is the stillness of infinite motion--the sleep of the spinning-top, to borrow the simile of a well-known writer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, sir, {{that there}} is <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in this {{neighbourhood}} than most people imagine.

6000|$|... "It must be fine to fly," [...] thought Peter. [...] "I wish I could fly. If I could, I wouldn't {{spend all}} my time flying around the way Flitter does. I'd go on long {{journeys}} and see the Great World. I'd fly way, {{way up in the}} blue, blue sky, the way Ol' Mistah Buzzard does, where I could look down and see all that {{is going on in the}} Green Forest and on the Green Meadows. And I'd fly in the daytime, because there is <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> then. I wonder, now, why it is that Flitter never comes out until after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple Hills. I never see him in the daytime, and I don't even know where he keeps himself. I never thought of it before, but I wonder why it is that he flies only at night. I believe I'll ask Grandfather Frog the very next time I see him." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} bright summer day, and Queen Mary {{and some of her}} train were preparing for their ride. The Queen was in high spirits, and that wonderful and changeful countenance of hers was beaming with anticipation and hope, while her demeanour was altogether delightful to every one who approached her. She was adding some last instructions to Nau, who was writing a letter for her to the French ambassador, and Cicely stood by her, holding her little dog in a leash, and looking somewhat anxious and wistful. There was <b>more</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> round the girl than she was allowed to understand, and it made her anxious and uneasy. She knew that the correspondence through the brewer was actively carried on, but she was not informed of what passed. Only she was aware that some crisis must be expected, for her mother was ceaselessly restless and full of expectation. She had put all her jewels and valuables into as small a compass as possible, and talked more than ever of her plans for giving her daughter either to the Archduke Matthias, or to some great noble, as if the English crown were already within her grasp. Anxious, curious, and feeling injured by the want of confidence, yet not daring to complain, Cicely felt almost fretful at her mother's buoyancy, but she had been taught a good many lessons in the past year, {{and one of them was}} that she might indeed be caressed, but that she must show neither humour nor will of her own, and the least presumption in inquiry or criticism was promptly quashed.|$|E
