The present analysis related to modification in sugar <b>mill</b> head <b>stock</b> Ø 40 ”X 80 ”. This paper describes the advantages of using Ø 40 ”X 80 ” <b>mill</b> head <b>stocks</b> by designing & analysis by ANSYS software. In this study theoretical study has been done considering the Bending moment & force polygon diagrams. Bending moment factor which helps in finding actual results. By changing various parameters the performance of <b>mill</b> head <b>stocks</b> is studies using static structural analysis & the same are compared with above theoretical results. Based on results the optimum design is proposed.

In addition to anthracite coal-mining, it became an industrial center in the 19th century, with silk and knitting <b>mills,</b> <b>stocking</b> and shirt factories, wagon shops, ironworks, and brickyards.

Hewenden, Bents and Beckfoot mills have all since {{been converted into}} private accommodation buildings. Hallas Bridge Mill was destroyed by fire. Goit <b>Stock</b> <b>Mill</b> was later utilised as a café and ballroom. It too burnt down (in 1927) with no reports of casualties.

50|$|The town of Newmarket had {{undergone}} rapid growth {{prior to the}} start of the 20th century due largely to the efforts of William Mulock, then a sitting member of the Liberal Party of Canada and Wilfrid Laurier's right-hand-man in the province. He used his influence to bring a number of industries to the town, setting up along the Northern Railway of Canada's mainline which passed northward through town along the valley of the East Holland River. The remains of these industries are still visible on the local geography; the Hill lumber mill and later William Cane and Sons factory's <b>mill</b> <b>stock</b> now forms Fairy Lake, the Davis Leather Company's buildings today form the Tannery Mall, and one of the original Office Specialty factory buildings has been converted to lofts just east of Main Street.|$|R

40|$|Breakage {{of wheat}} kernels during first-break roller milling depends on many factors, {{including}} {{the disposition of}} the fluted rolls: sharp-to-sharp, sharp-to-dull, dull-to-sharp, or dull-to-dull. Wheat kernel breakage under different dispositions during milling was studied using high-speed video imaging. The results show significant slippage between kernels and the flutes when a dull working angle is used, especially when the dull angle is on the fast roll. Experiments were conducted to compare the size distributions resulting front the four dispositions. Representative hard and soft wheat cultivars were milled using fluted rolls at five different roll gaps, and the resulting size distribution of the <b>milled</b> <b>stocks</b> was measured by sieve analysis. A sharp-to-sharp disposition gave a relatively uniform or straight line size distribution over the particle size range of 212 - 2, 000 mum. By contrast, a dull-to-dull disposition gave a U-shaped distribution with more larger and smaller particles and fewer in the middle size range. The size distributions from the other two dispositions lay between these, giving a transition from a straight-line distribution for sharp-to-sharp disposition, slightly U-shaped for sharp-to-dull, more curved for dull-to-sharp, and highly U-shaped for dull-to-dull. The effect of roll gap was to change the balance between large and small particles...|$|R

50|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 had a dramatic impact on McConnel & Kennedy. Raw cotton supplies from America were cut off, causing many Lancashire Mills to sharply reduce production or close completely.

50|$|A {{much more}} {{accurate}} way of notching {{the end of}} tube stock {{is to use a}} specially made milling cutter called an end <b>mill.</b> The <b>stock</b> to be notched is clamped into a vise and can then be fed slowly and accurately into a rotating, hardened metal, end mill. The equipment required for this method is considerably more expensive than the hole saw method and does not lend well to the same portability of the hole saw method as the machine is usually bolted to the floor for stability and safety reasons. This method of end notching is much faster and thus greatly minimizes the chance of damaging the stock either by warping due to heat build up or by squashing as can still happen with a hole saw.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{built around}} 1781, {{it was named}} <b>Stocks</b> <b>Mill</b> after the village stocks that stood nearby. The mill may be older {{and may have been}} moved from Stone in Oxney, with the date 1781 carved into the main post {{denoting}} its re-erection. The Mill House was at one time used as the parish Poorhouse. The mill was last worked circa 1900, and was then preserved by Norman Forbes-Robertson, who owned the mill and Mill House. The mill passed into the ownership of the artist Randolph H Sauter. and then Sir Edward Parry. The mill was repaired in 1958, and in 1968 a new stock and pair of sails was fitted by the millwright Derek Ogden. In 1980, the mill was acquired by Kent County Council and the Friends of <b>Stocks</b> <b>Mill</b> was set up to allow the mill to be opened to the public. The mill underwent a restoration programme starting in 2002 and partly funded by the National Lottery, which included two new sails amongst other work. Some of the milling machinery which had been removed over the years was recreated. The mill was reopened to the public in 2004.|$|R

50|$|The Wesleyan Methodist {{movement}} {{established a}} {{church on the}} corner of Manchester Street and St Domingo Street, Oldham (now Rochdale Road) at which John Wesley preached on 2 April 1790, From that church two workers were sent to establish a 'Society Class' in Cowhill on the outskirts of town. For a while the society flourished, meeting in houses or the 'National School', but with the departure of the two key workers and the national controversy agitating the Wesleyan Methodist cause the society dwindled until it ceased to exist. The work was re-established in 1847. The Methodists held open air services and cottage prayer meetings in premises at Old Lane, Bank <b>Mill</b> at <b>Stock</b> Brook and Denton Lane. Visits to these outlying spots became dangerous with ropes tied across the dark lanes to trip up the worshippers, who were then pelted with sods and stones. The antagonism increased with the village bell man going around the area urging the people to yell and shout whenever they met.|$|R

40|$|The work is {{concerned}} with the effects of applying the drum detachers as flake disrupters in industrial wheat flour <b>mills.</b> The <b>stocks</b> entering and leaving the drum detachers applied on the different reduction passages in two industrial mills were intercepted and employed in the experiments. The changes in the flour release and flour ash content were followed. The results show that the drum detachers are effective in disrupting the flakes formed in the smooth roller mills grinding zone. However, the contribution of the drum detachers to the overall milling efficiency is in close correlation with the nature of the formed flakes. If the flakes are primarily composed of endosperm particles, the employment of drum detacher results in a statistically significant increase of the flour yields without deterioration of flour quality. If flakes, formed on the end passages of the reduction system, contain large portion of branny particles, the increase of the flour ash content following the drum detacher is statistically significant.
