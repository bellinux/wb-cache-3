5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E

25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E
25|$|For {{practical}} purposes, different {{measures of}} location and dispersion are often compared {{on the basis}} of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the efficiency of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient than the sample median when data are uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions, but less efficient otherwise, and that the efficiency of the sample median is higher than that {{for a wide range of}} distributions. More specifically, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance <b>mean</b> (<b>for</b> large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean—see asymptotic efficiency and references therein.|$|E

25|$|During recent decades, {{many people}} in the West have {{developed}} an interest in reincarnation. Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families, modern Neopagans, followers of Spiritism, Theosophists and students of esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalah, and Gnostic and Esoteric Christianity as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life before we were born, will survive death and be born again physically. The <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the Nordic countries is 22%. The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries, with Lithuania having the highest figure for the whole of Europe, 44%. The lowest figure is in East Germany, 12%. In Russia, about one-third believes in reincarnation. The effect of communist anti-religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of Eastern Europe seems to have been rather slight, if any, except apparently in East Germany. Overall, 22% of respondents in Western Europe believe in reincarnation. According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit organization, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all born again Christians, embrace the idea.|$|E
25|$|With {{the coming}} of 1933, however, Schmeling's image in America began to take a decided turn. In 1932, the Nazi Party became the most {{powerful}} political force in Germany, and its ideologies, voiced by party leader Adolf Hitler, overflowed with anti-Semitic tendencies. Major American cities such as New York had large Jewish populations, who worried over what the party could <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> people of their religion in the future. Schmeling, because he was German, was viewed {{as an extension of}} Hitler's plans for world domination. When he was slated to fight heavy-hitting contender Max Baer on 8 June 1933, he immediately became the 'bad guy' in the eyes of fans. Baer, who did not practice the Jewish religion but had a Jewish father, came into the ring wearing the Star of David on his shorts. Promoter Jack Dempsey played up this angle and suddenly the fight was viewed as Baer defending his faith against the prejudice of the Nazis, represented reluctantly by Schmeling. Thrown off of his game in part by the bad publicity but also because of Baer's wild, brawling style and frequent fouls (including backhand punches and rabbit punches), Schmeling was thrashed after ten rounds before nearly 60,000 onlookers at Yankee Stadium. While the German took a battering against the ropes in the tenth, the referee leapt in to stop the fight. The fight, combined with a follow-up loss to contender Steve Hamas early the next year, left many wondering if Schmeling was still a world top-class fighter.|$|E
