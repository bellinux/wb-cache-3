25|$|In Shamokin Creek at Sunbury, {{there were}} 112 {{individual}} fish from 14 different species. The most common species were smallmouth bass (46 individuals), fallfish (24 individuals), and white suckers (14 individuals). Less common species included pumpkinseeds (six individuals), chain pickerel (five individuals), and spotfin shiners (five individuals). Rarer species included <b>Margined</b> <b>madtom</b> (three individuals) and rock bass and brown bullhead (two individuals each). Only one creek chub, green sunfish, bluegill, tessellated darter, and walleye were observed.|$|E
50|$|Noturus insignis (<b>margined</b> <b>madtom)</b> {{is a small}} {{species of}} North American catfish {{belonging}} to the family Ictaluridae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>margined</b> <b>madtom</b> is {{yellow to}} dark gray {{on the upper}} side of the body, and a pale shade on the underside. It is slimmer than {{other members of the}} Ictaluridae family. It has a square tail and lacks the rays of other tadpole madtoms. The dorsal fin and anal fins are rounded, the chin barbels are pale, and all the other barbels are dark. They are sized from about 10 cm to 13 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The species {{ranges from}} Lake Ontario drainages southward to Georgia. <b>Margined</b> <b>madtoms</b> inhabit clear-water streams, taking shelter among rocks, gravel, and boulders. Its eggs are laid in large quantities, and are guarded by the male parent.|$|R
50|$|Both {{brown trout}} and brook trout live in South Branch Roaring Creek. Both of these fish can {{grow up to}} 17 in long. The total {{concentration}} of trout ranges from 1.86 kg per hectare to 30.53 kg per hectare and 31.2 kg per hectare. The species of fish observed in the creek as of 2004 are mostly typical for a stream environment in that area. These included eastern blacknose dace, <b>margined</b> <b>madtoms,</b> and various warm-water fish which had swum into the creek from the reservoirs on it. Catch and release public fishing is permitted on the creek. It is an approved trout stream.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, {{when it was}} researching {{the fate of the}} former Galeville air base site (now Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge) found that the lower Shawangunk (from its mouth to Pine Bush) {{supports}} an unusually diverse plant and animal community for the region due to the absence of any serious impoundment along the upper river. It reported no less than six species of freshwater mussels, including the rare swollen wedge mussel, and 31 species of fish. Among the latter were the rare Notropis amoenus (comely shiner), Notropis stramineus (sand shiner), Percina caproedes (logperch), Lepomis auritis (redbreasted sunfish) and Noturus insignis (<b>margined</b> <b>madtom).</b>|$|E
40|$|Catfish {{pectoral}} spines are an anti-predator defense mechanism. They can {{be bound}} or locked, making the fish harder to swallow, or {{used to produce}} distress calls by rubbing ridges on the dorsal process against a channel in {{the wall of the}} pectoral girdle. Growth of the pectoral spine and girdle were examined in relation to fish size within and across species that occur throughout central and eastern Virginia. These included blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus), yellow bullheads (Ameiurus natalis), flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), <b>margined</b> <b>madtom</b> (Noturus insignis), and tadpole madtom (Noturus gyrinus). Pectoral spines and girdles grow as catfish increase in size. In larger species spine length and weight increase nonlinearly with fish size, suggesting that maintaining spine dimensions becomes less important in bigger individuals less likely to suffer predation. The incidence of spine breakage also increases in larger fish. In smaller species spine length increases linearly in our samples (brown and yellow bullheads and margined and tadpole madtoms). In all species spine width increases linearly with total length. The spine base (dorsal process width and depth and dorsal-ventral length) grows linearly with total length in most species. However, measurements of the spine base increase nonlinearly in white catfishes, and dorsal process width increases nonlinearly in wild channel catfish although the increase was linear in cultured channel catfish. Girdle depth increased linearly with total length in all species except for wild channel catfish, and the ratio of coracoid to cleithrum depth varied among species. Pectoral girdle weight increased linearly with fish weight in blue catfish, cultured channel catfish, brown bullheads, and margined and tadpole madtoms. However, girdle weight, a major component of the body, increased nonlinearly in wild channel, white, yellow bullheads, and flathead catfishes. Cultured channel catfish had smaller pectoral spines and girdles than wild channels, a likely epigenetic response to predators. Catfish spines were identified to species, allowing determination of catfishes eaten by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) using spines collected near their nests. Bald eagles ate blue catfish (60 %), channel catfish (27 %), white catfish (9 %), brown bullheads (4 %) and yellow bullheads (0. 5 %). Madtom and flathead catfish were not consumed. Mean sizes captured were: Blue catfish (366 mm, 414 g), channel catfish (417 mm, 618 g), white catfish (320 mm, 591 g), brown bullheads (278 mm, 277 g) and yellow bullhead (203 mm, 192 g) ...|$|E
