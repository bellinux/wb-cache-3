500|$|... "Love Song" [...] {{tells the}} story of an ex-girlfriend fondly remembered ("I knew a girl and I like her still"). It is the first of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics ("I'll lay <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and see what I see"). Barrett {{performed}} the song for Bob Harris' show in 1971.|$|E
500|$|King {{was issued}} a three-place grid place penalty by the {{stewards}} {{for his role}} in the collision with Gasly which was served at the season's next race in Austria. He said that it was a [...] "disappointing" [...] conclusion to the race weekend and revealed that he and Gasly discussed the incident and the pair had no issue regarding the matter. Gasly said that his team had hoped for a better result in Monaco but the car's amount of performance was not the reason that his team was unable to score points. He further stated that while he was happy with the behaviour of his vehicle he was afflicted with misfortune: [...] "I put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and fought my way back, but when you start from so far back on the grid in Monaco scoring points is a hopeless task." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Buren's profile at the Pro Football Hall of Fame states he [...] "lined up as a halfback but played {{more like}} a fullback." [...] He had a rare {{combination}} of strength, speed, and endurance. While not as elusive or nimble as other backs, he preferred to run through tacklers instead of avoid them, and never ran out of bounds if he felt he could pick up extra yards. [...] "There's no trick," [...] {{he said of his}} running style. [...] "When I see I'm gonna be tackled I just put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and give 'em the shoulder." [...] He was described as a [...] "deadly tackler", hitting as hard on defense as he did when he carried the ball. His disregard for his own body led to many injuries for both himself and opposing players.|$|E
6000|$|She drew an arm round my neck, {{and drew}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> close <b>down</b> to hers {{as she sat}} in the chair. [...] "Love her, love her, love her! How does she use you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Hoopdriver, anxious now to hedge. [...] "I don't make {{a regular}} thing of it, you know. Jest {{now and then}} {{something}} comes into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and <b>down</b> it goes. No--I'm not a regular artist." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stopped the}} {{preliminary}} slap, but before I could hit him, his terrible left fist reached <b>my</b> <b>head</b> again; and <b>down</b> I fell once more--upon the hearth-rug this time--not over-heavily.|$|R
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
50|$|This open C tuning {{was used}} by Soundgarden for songs {{including}} Pretty Noose, Burden in <b>My</b> Hand, and <b>Head</b> <b>Down.</b> Chord sequences often omit the high E string, leaving the power chord ubiquitous to Grunge music.|$|R
60|$|I drew my sword, but {{immediately}} a bludgeon fell {{on it and}} it smashed in two. I gave a {{shout and}} rushed at my assailants, but it was hopeless. I felt a crushing blow on <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I sank <b>down</b> insensible.|$|R
5000|$|I {{woke up in}} {{the middle}} of the night with that line in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> sat <b>down</b> at the piano and had written it in half an hour. The tune itself is generic, an {{aggregate}} of hundreds of others, but the words are interesting. It sounds like a comforting love song. I didn't realize at the time how sinister it is. I think I was thinking of Big Brother, surveillance and control. Sting ...|$|R
2500|$|Turner then scored 23 and 0, 21 and 7 and 53 and 15. In {{the fifth}} test Turner made 26 and 136, his debut century. [...] "I wasn't nervous after I reach ed 80 and just put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Once in Amman, Arar {{claims he}} was blindfolded, {{shackled}} {{and put in a}} van. [...] "They made me bend <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> in the back seat," [...] Arar recalled. [...] "Then these men started beating me. Every time I tried to talk, they beat me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 13, 2006, Knight {{was shown}} {{allegedly}} hitting player Michael Prince under the chin {{to get him}} to make eye contact. Although Knight didn't comment on the incident afterwards and has not yet done so, Prince, his parents, and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince's chin and told him, [...] "Hold your head up and don't worry about mistakes. Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> so he raised my chin up. He was telling me {{to go out there and}} don't be afraid to make mistakes. He said I was being too hard on myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Phyllis," [...] the Marquise said, [...] "this is the Vicomte de Bergillac, and {{he brings}} you {{messages}} from some one or other. Your affairs are quite too complicated for <b>my</b> little <b>head.</b> Sit <b>down</b> {{and let him}} talk to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|By and by I {{subsided}} into an indignant silence, and so sat {{until the}} end, hot and flushed, and execrating {{him in my}} heart for an ignorant savage. But he was calm. His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook. When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, {{he put his hand}} on <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> beamed <b>down</b> on me in an admiring way and said to my brother: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--ay: {{what did}} she say? Let's see. I was oiling my working-day boots without taking 'em off, and wi' <b>my</b> <b>head</b> hanging <b>down,</b> when she just brushed on by the garden hatch like a flittering leaf. 'Ann,' I said, says I, and then,--but, Dick I'm afeard 'twill be no help to thee; for we were such a rum couple, your mother and I, leastways one half was, that is myself--and your mother's charms was more in the manner than the material." ...|$|R
60|$|I bent <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> and {{he tried}} to lift his hand to my shoulder. I raised him a little on his pillows, and listened.|$|E
60|$|I kept <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> {{and my eyes}} on the ground. I {{was ashamed}} of my {{weakness}} and my want of spirit. I was determined not to look at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Victor," [...] he cried, [...] "don't {{look at me}} {{as though}} you wanted to punch <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>Down</b> on your knees, man, and pray {{for a sense of}} humour. It's the very salt of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then my {{eyes will}} not close nor will <b>my</b> <b>head</b> lay itself <b>down</b> till I fetch {{my wife and}} horses home again,' {{answered}} he, and he stopped and noted the tracks of the horses on the grass, and followed after them till {{he arrived at the}} wood, when the darkness fell.|$|R
5000|$|Saving Abel {{gradually}} {{came together}} {{with the addition of}} rhythm guitarist Scott Bartlett, bassist Daniel Dwight, and drummer Blake Dixon. Weeks would throw Saving Abel demo CDs onto the stages of bigger bands that toured through Corinth. Weeks recalled of the time: [...] "I used to work at a hospital. I’d have to be there at 4:30 in the morning drawing blood. I’d wake people up and stick a needle in their arm. I’d be walking around the hospital, singing ‘Addicted’ in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> writing <b>down</b> the lyrics on patients’ clipboards and doctor script pads." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, my father, {{the agony}} of the fire was such as may not be told. I felt my eyes start forward in their sockets, my blood seemed to boil within me, it rushed into <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>down</b> <b>my</b> face their ran two tears of blood. But yet I held my hand in the fire and made no sign, while the king and his councillors watched me curiously. Still, for a moment Chaka said nothing, and that moment seemed to me as {{all the years of}} my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said I, with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> and feigning to {{continue}} my occupation--"or, rather, {{let me call}} you again {{by the name of}} Mr. Henry, for I fear your anger, and want you to think upon old times----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hab dey done {{gone out}} ob de cabin, honey?" [...] Uncle 'Rasmus cried, and when I {{repeated}} again that which I {{had seen the}} old man said as he held <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> to his mouth that no word might be swept aside by the furious blast: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said I, with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> and feigning to {{continue}} my occupation - [...] "or, rather, {{let me call}} you again {{by the name of}} Mr. Henry, for I fear your anger and want you to think upon old times - [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{words of}} comfort and blessing come to me with fresh {{strength}} just now, two days only after {{the time when you}} too, had you been here, would in private have laid your hand on <b>my</b> <b>head</b> and called <b>down</b> God's blessing upon me. I shall never know in this world what I owe to your prayers.' ...|$|R
500|$|.....when I {{was writing}} it, I {{was in a}} cabin covered with snow {{and it was very}} quiet outside. This was all in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> of course. <b>Down</b> a hill there's a little town, all lit up, carolers singing. It's a little bit sad, {{although}} it's very beautiful. There's a little fox creeping through the snow, a fox that's very hard to catch.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I fancy I mentioned, {{there are}} matters {{in which it}} is hardly the {{province}} of the police to instruct me," [...] he said. [...] "I'm sorry I can't do anything more for you to-day, sergeant, but if you were to come round when <b>my</b> <b>head</b> has settled <b>down</b> a little I might be able to recollect the fellow's appearance rather more distinctly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{must not}} cry. I must be patient, and wait till they come. I am very tired, but I must {{not go to}} sleep, for then I shall not hear them when they come. I will lay <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> but I will keep my eyes open." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know when}} I've had a nastier shock. I {{had been going}} on the {{assumption}} that, now that they had stopped him making his speech, Gussie's fangs had been drawn, as you might say. To duck <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and resume my edging toward the door was with me the work of a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Without preface, then, {{my dearest}} brother, will you, for my sake, avoid those quarrels {{in which the}} people yonder are {{eternally}} engaged? I never go down there but I hear of some new brawl; and I never lay <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> to sleep, but I dream {{that you are the}} victim of it. Even last night"---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to the cabin at last, and arter {{lighting}} the lamp I ’ad another sup o’ the skipper’s whisky to clear <b>my</b> <b>’ead,</b> and sat <b>down</b> to try and think wot tale I was to tell ’im. I sat for pretty near three hours without thinking of one, and then I ’eard the crew come on to the wharf.|$|R
5000|$|... "I hit him {{squarely}} in the hip, but {{the mechanics of the}} tackle got blown up. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> was <b>down</b> and it should have been up." [...] Toburen's hit jarred the ball loose from Unitas and Nitschke recovered the fumble. But Toburen lie still on the City Stadium turf. [...] "With my first start, my emotions were high, and I was playing reckless that day," [...] Toburen said. [...] "It was the greatest thing with my first start in front of my wife and dad. One moment I was {{on top of the world}} and then I wasn't." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the mother}} bird, who had noted {{me and my}} pile of fish the first thing as she rounded the point, swept in swiftly with a curious, half-angry, half-anxious chiding that I had never heard from her before,--Chip, chip, chip! Chip! Chip!--growing sharper and shriller at each repetition, till they heeded it and swerved aside. As I looked up they were just over <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> looking <b>down</b> at me now with eager, {{wondering}} eyes. Then they were led aside in a wide circle and talked to with wise, quiet whistlings before they were sent back to their fishing again.|$|R
