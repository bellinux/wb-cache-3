50|$|The Amanayé people {{consist of}} nuclear {{families}} {{where the women}} run {{and take care of}} the home while the men deal with external matters.The majority of the Amanayé women marry when they are between 15 and 18 years old. It is usually at this age that they first have a child. Nursing lasts for approximately one year, though after the second month the newborn child begins to be fed with carimã (fine <b>manioc</b> <b>meal)</b> and croeira. They frequently relocate villages as their soil becomes exhausted, and possibly also to avoid their enemies.|$|E
5000|$|Cattle {{caused the}} first {{settlers}} to penetrate these hostile regions, {{as the great}} herds began to advance into unexplored lands, bathed by rivers with clear waters. It was the São Francisco River that first brought explorers up to the vast interior. At {{the point where the}} Rio Grande flows into the São Francisco a small settlement called Barras took root. By 1600 adventurers had made their way up the Rio Grande as far as rocks that impeded their further passage. Below these rocks, [...] "barreiras" [...] in Portuguese, a small community began. The Rio Grande was navigable by small boats, and traders soon arrived in the region to support the cattle industry and the ranches. The village became an agricultural center producing tobacco, beans, corn and manioc. These were exported together with molasses, rum, <b>manioc</b> <b>meal,</b> and leather while European articles, kerosene and coffee were imported [...] - [...] all commerce being conducted by river.|$|E
5000|$|Period of {{the transatlantic}} slave tradeIn 1646, Jesuit friar Gonçalo João succinctly stated the {{importance}} of the economic relationship between Brazil and Angola as [...] "Without Angola, there is no Brazil". Angola was a major source of slaves to Brazil, which was, out of the several European colonies in the Americas, the largest single importer of slaves during the Transatlantic Slave Trade. Two-thirds of those slaves in Brazil originated from the Angola-Congo region. Rio de Janeiro depended on the consistent influx of slaves from Angola to work on sugar cane plantations and for re-exportation to Buenos Aires in exchange for silver.Exports from Brazil to Angola in exchange for these slaves included <b>manioc</b> root <b>meal</b> and cachaça.During Dutch occupation of Angola in early 17th century, Brazil and Portugal acted as [...] "co-colonizers" [...] together in their efforts to reclaim the territory. Brazilian historian Luiz Felipe de Alencastro suggests that this critical historical period cemented Brazil's connection to Angola {{for the duration of the}} slave trade, and that the construction of Brazil occurred vis-à-vis the destruction of Angola's indigenous kingdoms.|$|R

Scientific data on postprandial glycaemic influence of common meals is essential when formulating diets. Objectives {{of this study were}} to analyse glycaemic indices (GI) of five common meals and effects of macronutrients, sources of carbohydrates, and physicochemical properties of starch on observed GI values. Design The meals analysed were; 1 – red rice (AT 353) meal, 2 – red rice mixed meal, 3 – stringhopper (wheat flour) meal, 4 – stringhopper (rice flour) <b>meal,</b> 5 – <b>manioc</b> (Manihot esculenta) <b>meal...</b>|$|R
50|$|Bobó de camarão, {{sometimes}} referred to as shrimp bobó in English, is a chowder-like Brazilian dish of shrimp in a purée of <b>manioc</b> (or cassava) <b>meal</b> with coconut milk and other ingredients. Like many similar dishes, it is flavored with palm oil, called dendê in Brazilian Portuguese and is traditionally served with white rice, but may also be treated as a standalone side dish. On the state of Espirito Santo due to Italian influences olive oil is used instead of palm oil. Shrimp bobó is nearly identical to the West African dish Ipetê, {{and is one of the}} many iconic recipes from the Bahia region of Brazil, which is known for its heavy Afro-Brazilian characteristics.|$|R
