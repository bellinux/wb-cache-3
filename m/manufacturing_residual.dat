40|$|The ODSCC {{detected}} in the TSP position of Ulchin 3 & 4 SGs are typical ODSCC of Alloy 600 MA tubes. The causative chemical environment is formed by concentration of impurities inside the occluded region formed by the tube surface, egg crate strips, and sludge deposit there. Most cracks are detected {{at or near the}} line contacts between the tube surface and the egg crate strips. The region of dense crack population, as defined as between 4 th and 9 th TSPs, and near the center of hot leg hemisphere plane, coincided well with the region of preferential sludge deposition as defined by thermal hydraulics calculation using SGAP computer code. The cracks developed homogeneously {{in a wide range of}} SGs, so that the number of cracks detected each outage increased very rapidly since the first detection in the 8 th refueling outage. The root cause assessment focused on investigation of the difference in microstructure and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>residual</b> stress in order to reveal the cause of different susceptibilities to ODSCC among identical six units. The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>residual</b> stress as measured by XRD on OD surface and by split tube method indicated that the high residual stress of Alloy 600 MA tube played a critical role in developing ODSCC. The level of residual stress showed substantial variations among the six units depending on details of straightening and OD grinding processes. Youngwang 3 & 4 tubes are less susceptible to ODSCC than U 3 and U 4 tubes because semi-continuous coarse chromium carbides are formed along the grain boundary of Y 3 & 4 tubes, while there are finer less continuous chromium carbides in U 3 and U 4. The different carbide morphology is caused by the difference in cooling rate after mill anneal. There is a possibility that high chromium content in the Y 3 & 4 tubes, still within the allowable range of Alloy 600, has made some contribution to the improved resistance to ODSCC. It is anticipated that ODSCC in Y 5 & 6 SGs will be retarded more considerably than U 3 SGs since the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>residual</b> stress in Y 5 & 6 tubes is substantially lower than in U 3 tubes, while the microstructure is similar with each other...|$|E

Residual stresses are generated during solidification of ingots and during the wafering or wire sawing process used to produce silicon wafers. In this paper, the residual maximum shear stress in diamond wire sawn photovoltaic multi-crystalline silicon wafers corresponding to different crystal growth rates and their pre-and post-etched conditions are analyzed. The full-field residual stress distributions in the wafers are measured using near infra-red transmission birefringence polariscopy. Results show that wafers corresponding to the high crystal growth rate are characterized by larger residual maximum shear stress. As the growth rate increases to two times the standard growth rate, the average residual stress increases by 43 %. The increase in residual stress in the high growth rate wafers is attributed to the interaction of abrasives with more grain boundaries present in these wafers. Etching results in lower residual stress for all growth rates and ingot locations...|$|E

The relative height of the riblets to rotor inlet blade height was introduced to generalise the results. At the end of this study the results were compared with the available data in literature. It was found that the introduction of riblets could reduce the wall shear stress at the hub surface, while they contribute to increasing the streamwise vorticity within the rotor passage. For the geometries tested, the minimum drag was achieved using riblets with relative height hrel = 2. 5 % equivalent to 19. 3 wall units.

The cyclic material properties of weld region (simulated heat-affected-zone, weld metal and StE 355 -base metal) are investigated experimentally and also compared with empirical formulas based on tensile properties. In strain-controlled fatigue tests with positive and negative mean strain was established, that the relaxation behaviour of mean stresses regarding the welding residual stresses {{is dependent on the}} magnitude of the plastic strain amplitude.

40|$|Railway rails {{are today}} often {{continuously}} welded. This type of joint generally requires less maintenance than {{is needed for}} the bolted joints. It has also reduced wheel damage and made the ride more comfortable. However, these joints are subject to damage. The severity of the fatigue problem {{is likely to increase}} since a trend towards higher train speeds, higher axle loads and heavier traffic density is probable even in the future. The thesis deals with the finite element simulation of two manufacturing processes, flash butt welding of rails and laser cladding of railheads, and the subsequent service life of the welds under operating conditions. Welding of rails, elasto-plastic material modelling, in particular for material subject to cooling from a melted state, fatigue and general issues in computational welding mechanics are discussed. Experimental data and materials characteristics were collected from full-scale measurements of production welds, at the welding site, and from materials testing of smaller specimens. The microstructure and the material characteristics of both the base and welded materials, in the interval - 40 °C to + 600 °C, for the rail steel R 260 (900 A) were investigated. The emphasis is on the method of joining rails with flash butt welding and the coating of surfaces using laser cladding, which were simulated with material models that handle the recovery behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} melting point. In addition, the interaction between residual stresses from the manufacturing operations, and service loads from the wheel-rail contact was studied. The influence of residual stresses on fatigue initiation, of a twin-disc specimen simulating laser cladded rail, and crack growth, from defects in a flash butt weld, was examined. The results showed, in both cases, that the residual stresses caused by the processes were high enough to raise the risk of fatigue failure above that of the base material.

40|$|In {{the light}} of {{clustered}} deaths in late 2001 associated with hemodialysis (HD), this article analyzes the pathochemical toxicity of the perfluorocarbon- 5070 (PF- 5070), a liquid used as test performance fluid for detecting capillary leaks during dialyzer <b>manufacturing.</b> <b>Residual</b> PF- 5070 in some Athane dialyzers of the involved brands was infused in the injured patients during hemodialysis. The clinical presentation was in contrast with other previously described severe reactions to HD. Foam material was discovered in the right ventricle and caval vein of the patients who underwent postmortem examination. Deaths were attributed to gas embolism without the external causes identified. To explore the pathochemical toxicity of the inert liquid PF- 5070, an animal model was developed. In a rabbit model, single slug intravenous injections as bolus of increasing doses of PF- 5070 were performed. In a first set of experiments, three groups of three rabbits were administered increasing doses of PF- 5070 at 4, 40, or 160 μl/kg. After intravenous injection, the animals were observed for clinical signs of adverse effects and underwent autopsy after death. Doses were normalized to animal body weight to allow comparison with supposed patient exposure. Five of nine rabbits died soon after PF- 5070 dosing: One rabbit died within 4 h in the 4 μl/kg group, one rabbit died within 30 min in the 40 μl/kg group, and three rabbits died within 30 min in the 160 μl/kg group. In {{a second set of}} experiments, six rabbits were injected with a lethal dose of PF- 5070 to analyze clinical symptoms and pathophysiology. All rabbits died on the day of dosing and displayed neurologic disorders (paralysis, nystagmus, rigidity, convulsions), then breathing abnormalities (rapid breathing, salivation, dark mucous membrane), and fatal collapse. Autopsy of rabbits showed evidence of gas retention in the lung tissue and gas bubbles in the right cardiac cavities. Histologic findings included alveolar hemorrhage with pulmonary edema, cerebellum, and cortex patchy areas of infarction. Single-dose intravenous administration of PF- 5070 reproduced in a rabbit model the pathophysiologic effects observed in the hemodialysis patients. Severity of the symptoms observed in the animals was dose-dependent. Clinical and pathologic findings {{can be explained by the}} capacity of perfluorocarbon to emulsify blood at body temperature, to increase partial pressure in the pulmonary capillary bed, and to form bubbles in the pulmonary capillary circulation, thus blocking lung and visceral perfusion. Such experimental findings indicate the toxicity of PF- 5070 administered intravenously and make the pathochemical toxicity link with the hemodialysis-related deaths caused by the presence of residues of PF- 5070 in the Althane dialyzers. We conclude, in light of this outbreak and the subsequent investigations, that liquid PF- 5070 is a highly toxic compound when administered intravenously because of its emulsifying properties. The use of PF- 5070 or any liquid fluorocarbon compounds in medical devices with blood contact and particularly in the dialyzer manufacturing should be considered with caution.

The use of freeform mirrors could drastically reduce the number of components in optical systems. Currently, manufacturing issues limit the common use of freeform mirrors at short wavelengths. This article outlines the use of freeform mirrors in astronomical instruments with a description of two efficient freeform optical systems. A new manufacturing method is presented which seeks to overcome the manufacturing issues through hydroforming of thin polished substrates. A specific design of an active array is detailed, which will compensate for <b>residual</b> <b>manufacturing</b> errors, thermoelastic deformation, and gravity-induced errors during observations. The combined hydroformed mirror and the active array comprise the Freeform Active Mirror Experiment, which will produce an accurate, compact, and stable freeform optics dedicated to visible and near-infrared observations.
