5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities.

5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|During the war the Australian Government greatly {{expanded}} its powers {{in order to}} better direct the war effort, and Australia's industrial and human resources were focused on supporting the Allied armed forces. The expansion of the government's powers began on 9 September 1939 when the National Security Act became law. This act enabled the government to introduce industrial conscription, and both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> ordered into essential industries. Rationing was first introduced in 1940 and was {{greatly expanded}} during 1942. The Government also strongly encouraged austerity and war bonds as a means of reducing demand for scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} festival to Athena in Athens was the Lesser Panathenaea, held annually, which {{was open to}} both sexes. <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> apparently not segregated during the procession leading the animals sacrificed to the altar, the festival's most religiously-significant part. Metics, both men and women, also had role in the Panathenaic procession, though it was subordinate {{to the role of}} the Athenians. In the procession, young noble girls (kanephoroi) carried sacred baskets. The girls were required to be virgins; to prevent a candidate from being selected was, according to Pomeroy, to question her good name. The sister of Harmodius was reportedly rejected as a kanephoros by the sons of Peisistratos, precipitating his assassination of Hipparchus.|$|E

Cleanup efforts started that day; the New York City Department of Sanitation worked to clean the area for three days and the New York City Departments of Buildings and Housing boarded windows. The city {{assigned}} a police escort for all department workers. The Red Cross gave Harlemites lemonade and crullers, and the mayor organized various hospitals to handle an influx of injured patients. By August 4, traffic had resumed through the borough, and taverns reopened the next day. La Guardia had food delivered to the residents of Harlem, and on August 6, food supplies returned to normal levels. Overall, six people died and nearly 700 were injured. Six hundred <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> arrested in connection with the riot.|$|E
5|$|Though women Friends {{had since}} the 1660s {{publicly}} preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held that <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> equals, Quaker women met {{separately from the}} men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings {{as an expression of}} their spiritual equality. In June 1848, approximately 200Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.|$|E
5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides.

In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish American <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming {{into the path of}} a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> able to divorce their spouses and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee.

5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> {{placed in front of}} a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} is {{a sport that}} is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} speed skating, but the first official short track speed skating events were not held until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Before 1992, short track speed skating events were held at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport. At those games, events for both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> held in five disciplines: 500 metre, 1000 metre, 1500 metre, 3000 metre and the relay (3000 metres for women, 5000 metres for men). The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Korea won two gold medals each, with Canada, Italy, Japan and China picking up a gold medal each. The results of those demonstration events are not considered official and {{are not included in}} this list. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, there were four medal events: men's 1000 metres, men's 5000 metre relay, women's 500 metres and women's 3000 metre relay. Men's 500 metres and women's 1000 metres was added in 1994. The men's and women's 1500 metres were added in 2002 and all eight events have been held at every Olympic Games since.|$|E

5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E
5|$|In March 1622, the {{governor}} of Yucatán, Diego de Cardenas, ordered Captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. In May the expedition advanced to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, {{where there was a}} lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, {{but as soon as the}} Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods. After their sacrifice, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fortune of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with a Maya scout to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. Bernardino Ek, the scout, escaped and returned to Mirones with the news. Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum, and killed them all. Spanish reinforcements arrived too late. A number of local Maya <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>were</b> killed by Spanish attackers, who also burned the town.|$|E
