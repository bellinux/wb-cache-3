40|$|The {{concept of}} {{probabilistic}} argumentation systems PAS {{is restricted to}} two types of variables: assumptions, which model the uncertain part of the knowledge, and propositions, which model {{the rest of the}} information. Instantiations of PAS have been used for dealing with problems in different contexts. Here, we introduce a third kind of variables into PAS: so-called decision variables. This new kind allows to describe the decisions which a user can <b>make</b> <b>to</b> <b>react</b> on some state of the system. Consider that given a system state, the users can themselves set the values of some decision variables in order to guarantee the requirement. The interesting system states are now those for which the users can find at least one setting of “their ” variables under which the requirement imposed on the system can be fulfilled. This {{can be seen as a}} game with two players, say nature against a user. Nature makes the first move and the user the second. If the requirement is fulfilled, the user wins (as the system is up), otherwise the user looses. Note that we do not include a concept of utility here as we are only interested in possible settings of decision variables. Further, we present an algorithm for computing arguments which exploits the special structure of PAS with decision variables. This allows now to use this framework for example in model-based reliability theory for computing structure functions...|$|E

The versatility of the framework enables its use in very different situations. However, such versatile framework is usually hidden by its complex management. One handicap identified in practical experiences is the lack of flexibility of scripted courses during the enactment phase. The activity sequence and learning resources are rigidly defined during authoring. This fact <b>makes</b> difficult <b>to</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> unexpected events that may happen in live courses. Also, this rigidness does not allow instructors to give "their personal touch " to courses. This paper presents the improvements made on GRAIL- an IMS LD compliant player- aimed at the support of a flexible enactment phase. Two types of modifications are considered: the modification of the learning flow and the management of course content with a wiki engine. Finally, this paper discusses how the integration of third party services in the activity sequence relaxes the rigidness of scripted learning flows. Experiences deployed in real scenarios allowed analyzing how such integration offered flexibility in practical situations...|$|R

30|$|Experimental {{studies of}} TCP-Westwood reveal {{improvements}} in throughput performance {{as well as}} in fairness. In addition, friendliness with TCP Reno was observed in a set of experiments showing that TCP Reno connections are not starved by TCP-Westwood connections. Moreover, TCP-Westwood fully complies with the end-to-end TCP design principle and the improvement is most significant in wireless networks with lossy links. However, in contrast with conventional TCP, which cannot distinguish between random errors and congestion loss, TCP-Westwood performance is also not sensitive to random errors. When a random error occurs, caused by route failure or by channel error, the estimated bandwidth will quickly reduce as described previously and this leads to poor performance after recovering the path. Similar to TCP-Vegas, TCP-Westwood uses the observed smallest roundtrip time (RTTmin) in estimating the bandwidth. This may lead to problems, since any route change will invalidate the RTTmin and, thus, lead to incorrect bandwidth estimates. Thus, the tendency of the researches is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> TCP able <b>to</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> different types of error.|$|R

40|$|So-called {{reliability}} adaptive {{systems are}} able to adapt their system behavior based on the current reliability of the system. This allows them <b>to</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> changed operating conditions or faults within the system that change the degradation behavior. To implement such reliability adaptation, self-optimization can be used. A self-optimizing system pursues objectives, of which the priorities can be changed at runtime, in turn chang-ing the system behavior. When including system reliability as an objective of the sys-tem, it becomes possible {{to change the system}} based on the current reliability as well. This capability can be used to con-trol the reliability of the system throughout its operation pe-riod in order to achieve a pre-defined or user-selectable sys-tem lifetime.

If we investigate the criteria that control the {{difference between}} alarm and alarmism in the moment-in-being, we address the undecidability of decisional situations again. The true question rather is on what is based the credibility of a warning signal. As any structural coupling, also warning signals imply the simultaneity of system and environment. The paradoxical effect is that the efficiency of signals depends on the impossibility of verifying their efficiency, as Lars Clausen and Wolf Dombrowsky clearly proved. Also, we should remind that warning against risks implies the risk of warning. As the lacking of warning signals <b>makes</b> it impossible <b>to</b> <b>react</b> <b>to</b> threats by means of prompt remedies, so the excess of alarm can produce a tailing-off of attention (as those {{who live on the}} volcano slopes know very well), or the loss of credibility of the signal itself (the ‘crying wolf’ mechanism).

The results are normally followed by the Control Theory {{in order to be}} constructed in a rigid feedback loop. According to the Control Theory, the controller is designed to measure result errors for the purpose of re-inputs of edited results into the system. The research in the paper proposes an approach to improving the context-aware ability of controller by designing a controller that enhance the self-adaptive software to solve both certain and uncertain problems especially in business. The controller relies on both Control Theory based modules and combination based module, in order to generate outputs including but not limited to activities based on costs or balanced scorecards through adding business context sensors, and create feedback loop to test differences for each module. When the proposed controller is established in self-adaptive software, it is important to extract and filter business information due to user demands, and <b>make</b> software <b>to</b> <b>react</b> itself in a changing environment. In summary, a designed controller model will help self-adaptive software to understand users' need and requirements clearly, so that not only existing parameters could be changed, but also the self-adaptive software can be made to to gain the ability to modify the parameter itself, and more importantly, a good context-aware controlled self-adaptive software could save costs for organisations in addition to improving the effectiveness and efficiency for business in a creative way...|$|R

Takahashi's personal belief was that the more negative, jaded JRPG character-type leads the player to resent them due to the emotional investment required to complete such long games.
