40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>foams</b> {{with high}} thermal conductivities are {{generally}} considered to have high potential to enhance the heat transfer performance for Phase Change Materials (PCMs). In this parametrical study, the effects of <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> on heat transfer in PCMs are examined, and the investigation is conducted in the aspects of both heat conduction and natural convection. The findings of this paper are that <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> significantly improve heat conduction in solid region, whilst suppress natural convection in liquid region. Buoyancy-driven velocities are too weak to produce dominant convection, {{which is due to}} high viscosity and low thermal expansion ratio of the PCM, as well as the large flow resistance of <b>metal</b> <b>foams...</b>|$|R
40|$|Low heat {{transfer}} performance {{has been the}} main problem restricting the use of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in situations requiring rapid energy release or storage. Three innovative solutions are studied in this Thesis to improve {{heat transfer}} in PCMs. These include combining PCMs with <b>metal</b> <b>foams,</b> Cascaded Thermal Energy Storage (CTES) and Metal Foam-enhanced Cascaded Thermal Energy Storage (MF-CTES).

Natural convection is investigated in Chapter 4, in which <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> were found to suppress natural convection due to their large flow resistances. Nevertheless, <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> can still achieve a higher overall heat transfer rate (3 – 10 times) than PCMs without <b>metal</b> <b>foams.</b> CTES is examined in Chapter 5, with results showing that CTES has a higher heat transfer rate (30...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Metal</b> <b>foams</b> are {{not easy}} to use as {{materials}} as their manufacturing process involves all three, solid, liquid and gaseous phases occurring simultaneously at varying temperatures and moreever the morphology of the solidified foam is quite complex. There has not been any report on the stabilization of <b>metal</b> <b>foams.</b> To compare the stabilisation of <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> using a different method, powder metallurgy and casting method using SiC and Ca alloy particle are required. Our investigation results showed deeply etched valleys with high oxygen content and secondary phases attached to line-shaped pores with higher SiC content than the matrix.

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCMs) {{are drawing}} increasing attention of researchers nowadays, and {{they play a}} pivotal role in thermal energy storage (TES) used in renewable energy resources applications, since these renewable energy, such as solar energy, wind energy and tidal energy, are intermittent and not available at any time. However, most of PCMs suffer from low thermal conductivities prolonging the charging and discharging processes. <b>Metal</b> <b>foams</b> with relatively high thermal conductivities, are believed to be able to enhance heat transfer performance of PCMs for those applications. In this paper, a two-equation non-thermal equilibrium model has been employed to tackle the phase change heat transfer problem in PCMs composites embedded into <b>metal</b> <b>foams.</b> Numerical results show good agreement with experimental data, and indicate that a better heat transfer performance can be achieved by using the <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> of smaller pore size and smaller porosity, and heat transfer performance of PCMs can be enhanced by up to 10 times by embedded <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> into PCMs...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{feasibility}} of using <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> to enhance the heat transfer capability of phase change materials (PCMs) in low- and high-temperature thermal energy storage systems was assessed. Heat transfer in solid/liquid phase change of porous materials (<b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> and expanded graphite) at low and high temperatures was investigated. Organic commercial paraffin wax and inorganic calcium chloride hydrate were employed as the low-temperature materials, whereas sodium nitrate {{was used as the}} high-temperature material in the experiment. Heat transfer characteristics of these PCMs embedded with open-cell <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> were studied. Composites of paraffin and expanded graphite with a graphite mass ratio of 3 %, 6 %, and 9 % were developed. The heat transfer performances of these composites were tested and compared with <b>metal</b> <b>foams.</b> The results indicate that <b>metal</b> <b>foams</b> have better heat transfer performance due to their continuous inter-connected structures than expanded graphite. However, porous materials can suppress the effects of natural convection in liquid zone, particularly for PCMs with low viscosities, thereby leading to different heat transfer performances at different regimes (solid, solid/liquid, and liquid regions). This implies that porous materials do not always enhance heat transfer in every regime. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
