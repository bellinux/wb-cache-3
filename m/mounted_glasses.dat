40|$|Eye-based Human-Computer Interaction: HCI {{system which}} allows phoning, reading e-book/e-comic/e-learning, {{internet}} browsing, and TV information extraction is proposed for handicap student in E-Learning Application. The conventional eye-based HCI applications are facing problems on accuracy and process speed. We develop new interfaces for improving key-in accuracy and process speed of eye-based key-in for E-Learning application, in particular. We propose eye-based HCI by utilizing camera <b>mounted</b> <b>glasses</b> for gaze estimation. We use the sight for controlling the user interface such as navigation of e-comic/e-book/e-learning contents, phoning, internet browsing, and TV information extraction. We develop interfaces including standard interface navigator with five keys, single line of moving keyboard, and multi line of moving keyboard {{in order to}} allow the aforementioned functions without burdening the accuracy. The experimental results show the proposed system does work the aforementioned functions in a real time basis...|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Deming Jarves in 1837 in South Boston, Massachusetts, as the <b>Mount</b> Washington <b>Glass</b> Works. Jarves had {{previously}} founded the New England Glass Company in 1818. Mount Washington did not at first have an official name, and until around 1850 was informally known as Russell's Glass House, after Luther Russell, the glasshouse superintendent. The first known use of the Mount Washington name was in the 1857 publication History of South Boston. In 1870, Mount Washington relocated to New Bedford, Massachusetts. That year, the company was briefly renamed W. L. Libbey & Company, before being incorporated as the <b>Mount</b> Washington <b>Glass</b> Works the following year. In 1876, the name was changed slightly, to the <b>Mount</b> Washington <b>Glass</b> Company.|$|R
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver <b>mounted</b> <b>glass</b> cruet of 1909.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{accessories}} were also made by other companies, which sometimes improved upon the Realist offerings.

Some users preferred cardboard slip-in mounts made by third parties because of their ease of use, {{even though they were}} generally considered to be of lower quality and were not suitable for projection. The Brumberger binder frames and <b>mounting</b> <b>glass</b> were very popular among users of stereo projectors.|$|R
40|$|Tephra is an {{important}} natural laboratory for studying processes of magma genesis and eruption. The analysis deficit generally reflects accidental intersection of mounting epoxy adjacent to glass fragments or of unseen microvesicles within glass fragments by the analytical beam.

In this study, quantitative chemical analysis on fine-grained volcanic glass shards (< 0. 25 mm) {{has been carried out}} by new technique for <b>mounting</b> small volcanic <b>glass</b> shards. Thin Cu sheet has been used for <b>mounting</b> <b>glass</b> shards. Volcanic glass must be polished until its thickness become about half in pits of the Cu sheet.

40|$|Background: : Permanent slide {{preparation}} of nematodes especially small ones is time consuming, difficult {{and they become}} scarious margins. Regarding this prob­lem, a modified double <b>glass</b> <b>mounting</b> method was developed and com­pared with classic method. Methods: A total of 209 nematode samples from human and animal origin were fixed and stained with Formaldehyde Alcohol Azocarmine Lactophenol (FAAL) followed by double <b>glass</b> <b>mounting</b> and classic dehydration method us­ing Canada balsam as their mounting media. The slides were evaluated in differ­ent dates and times, more than four years. Different photos were made with differ­ent magnification during the evaluation time. Results: The double <b>glass</b> <b>mounting</b> method was stable during this time and compa­rable with classic method. There were no changes in morphologic struc­tures of nematodes using double <b>glass</b> <b>mounting</b> method with well-defined and clear differentiation between different organs of nematodes in this method. Conclusion: Using this method is cost effective and fast for mounting of small nematodes comparing to classic method.  </p...|$|R

2500|$|An early type of {{electrochemical}} meter {{used in the}} United Kingdom was the 'Reason' meter. [...] This {{consisted of}} a vertically <b>mounted</b> <b>glass</b> structure with a mercury reservoir {{at the top of}} the meter. [...] As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column. [...] Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere-hours. [...] Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit. [...] It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier's agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The widely growing market of miniaturized electronic devices demands for alternative substrate materials and manufacturing technologies on which fine pitch components can be <b>mounted.</b> <b>Glass</b> {{has been identified as}} a potential substrate material as it offers a number of advantages including a coefficient of thermal expansion closely matched to that of silicon that may reduce the thermo-mechanical stresses on the interconnects in the flip-chip assemblies. In addition to this, its dimensional stability and optically transparent nature facilitates alignment of multiple layer structures, enabling accurate drilling of microvias to capture pads and the potential for applications in optical interconnect.

5000|$|Burmese is a uranium glass. The {{formula to}} produce Burmese Glass {{contains}} uranium oxide with tincture of gold added. The uranium oxide produced the inherent soft yellow color of Burmese glass. Because of the added gold, the characteristic pink blush of color of Burmese was fashioned by re-heating {{the object in}} the furnace (the [...] "Glory Hole"). The length {{of time in the}} furnace will determine the intensity of the color. Strangely, if the object is subjected to the heat again, it will return to the original yellow color.
