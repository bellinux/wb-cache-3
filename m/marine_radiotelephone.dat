50|$|SailMail is radio based e-mail system {{designed}} for yacht owners operating beyond line-of-sight radio {{links to the}} internet. Much of its underlying technology is built upon the Winlink software originally developed by amateur radio enthusiasts. Operation on SailMail network frequencies requires a license for the <b>Marine</b> <b>Radiotelephone</b> Service.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Marine</b> <b>Radiotelephone</b> Service or HF {{ship-to-shore}} {{operates on}} shortwave radio frequencies, using single-sideband modulation. The usual method {{is that a}} ship calls a shore station, and the shore station's marine operator connects the caller to the public switched telephone network. This service is retained for safety reasons, but in practice has been made obsolete by satellite telephones (particularly INMARSAT) and VoIP telephone and email via satellite internet.|$|E
5000|$|The TSPS {{system was}} {{replaced}} by the Operator Service Position System (OSPS) feature package developed for the 5ESS switching system. During the era of TSPS systems, calls to mobile and <b>marine</b> <b>radiotelephone</b> customers were initially handled by operators at a Special Operator Service Treatment cord switchboard. Operator assisted calls to international destinations were handled by [...] "Code 10" [...] and [...] "Code 11" [...] operators generally co-located at special gateway international switching systems.|$|E
50|$|If a {{suitable}} chartplotter is not available, local area AIS transceiver signals {{may be viewed}} via a computer using one of several computer applications such as ShipPlotter and Gnuais. These demodulate the signal from a modified <b>marine</b> VHF <b>radiotelephone</b> tuned to the AIS frequencies and convert into a digital format that the computer can read and display on a monitor; this data may then be shared via a local or wide area network via TCP or UDP protocols but will still {{be limited to the}} collective range of the radio receivers used in the network.Because computer AIS monitoring applications and normal VHF radio transceivers do not possess AIS transceivers, they may be used by shore-based facilities that have no need to transmit or as an inexpensive alternative to a dedicated AIS device for smaller vessels to view local traffic but, of course, the user will remain unseen by other traffic on the network.|$|R
5000|$|Five weeks later, on November 10, Gerald Douglas, {{captain of}} the {{merchant}} ship Tuvalu, en route from Suva to Funafuti, sighted Joyita more than 600 mi west from her scheduled route, drifting north of Vanua Levu. [...] The ship was partially submerged and listing heavily (her port deck rail was awash) {{and there was no}} trace of any of the passengers or crew; four tons of cargo were also missing. The recovery party noted that the radio was discovered tuned to 2182 kHz, the international <b>marine</b> <b>radiotelephone</b> distress channel.|$|E
5000|$|To obtain any {{of these}} {{licenses}} a person must be a U.S. citizen or otherwise eligible for work in the country, {{be able to communicate}} in English, and take written examinations approved by the Federal Communications Commission. Like the amateur radio examinations, these are given by private, FCC-approved groups. These are generally not the same agencies who administer the ham tests. Written test elements 1 and 7 are required for the Operator license, and elements 1 and 7R for the Restricted Operator. (Passing element 1 also automatically qualifies the applicant for the <b>Marine</b> <b>Radiotelephone</b> Operator Permit, the MROP.) ...|$|E
