40|$|Abstract For {{swimming}} pools, it {{is generally}} agreed that free chlorine levels have to be <b>mainted</b> in order to guarantee adequate disinfection. Recommended free chlorine levels can vary between 0, 3 and 0, 6 mg/L in Germany and up to 3 mg/L in other countries. Bathers introduce considerable amounts of organic matter, mainly {{in the form of}} such as urine and sweat, into the pool water. As a consequence, disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are formed. Regulations in Germany recommend levels of combined chlorine of less than 0, 2 mg/L and levels of trihalomethanes (THMs) of less than 20 µg/L. Haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), chloropicrin and chloral hydrate are also detected in considerable amounts. However, these compounds are not regulated yet. Swimming pool staff and swimmers, especially athletes, are primarily exposed to these byproducts by inhalation and/or dermal uptake.
