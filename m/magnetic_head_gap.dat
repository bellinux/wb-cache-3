40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} {{in an attempt to}} study the recording behavior of Enhanced Nonreturn to Zero (ENRZ) code at high linear recording densities. Using the "eye" pattern as a criteria in the first phase, the tests clearly demonstrate the sensitivity of a tape recorder to the DM (Delayed Modulation) coding technique as compared to ENRZ. For the same linear density, ENRZ has a considerably wider margin than the DM code. In the second phase of that study, a {{series of tests}} were conducted using high energy tape and <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> with reproduce <b>gaps</b> in the order of 12 μin, referred to as "double bandwidth heads. " Using present day technology, it was possible to demonstrate linear packing density never before achieved on magnetic recording tape...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{negative}} aspects of narrow <b>head</b> <b>gaps,</b> particularly for <b>magnetic</b> recording. The narrower the <b>head</b> <b>gap,</b> the more bias signal must be used to maintain linearity of the signal on tape which in turn will reduce the high frequency headroom or SOL (Saturated Output Level), particularly with slower tape speeds. Manufacturers must find a compromise between intended tape speeds and <b>head</b> <b>gaps</b> for this reason.|$|R

Double speed recording operation is also important. To satisfy the requirements, we have developed a compact and thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> for MD system by optimizing the core shape with a high magnetic flux efficiency. This head adopts a newly developed low loss Mn-Zn ferrite for the <b>head</b> core. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> enables double speed recording operation from 400 kHz to 1. 44 MHz at the disk velocity of 2. 8 m/s, in addition to stable following ability and sliding durability to the disk rotation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{hard disk}} drives (HDD) {{technology}} {{are being developed}} continuously {{in order to increase}} the capacity, and reduce the size of HDD to meet user requirements. To increase the capacity which is equivalent to increasing read/write ability, the flying clearance must be reduced. Current new HDD models show that the fly height is lower than 0. 3 µm. If the height of a particle or contamination is higher than 0. 3 µm, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> will scratch the magnetic disk surface. However the process of cleaning in the HDD industry cannot remove particles with size smaller than 0. 3 µm[1]. Therefore laser cleaning is selected first because this method can remove small particles [2]. and it does not damage the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b> This research compares the range of temperature needed for cleaning the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> between two types of heat source’s profile. The technique used is the heat transfer by finite element: FEM[3]. This technique provides an important factor of the laser cleaning method that increases the efficiency of particle removal. It is also a non-destructive method for cleaning the surface of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> slider...|$|R

50|$|When system {{behavior}} varies {{considerably in}} normal operation, multiple control laws {{may have to}} be devised. Each distinct control law addresses a specific system behavior mode. An example is a computer hard disk drive. Separate robust control system modes are designed in order to address the rapid <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> traversal operation, known as the seek, a transitional settle operation as the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> approaches its destination, and a track following mode during which the disk drive performs its data access operation.|$|R
40|$|Methods were {{developed}} to determine the coefficient of friction {{and the extent of}} stick-slip of magnetic recording tapes. After a preliminary phase during which experimental procedures were established and screening of candidate tapes was carried out, the frictional and stick-slip behavior of four selected tapes, using four different kinds of <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads,</b> was studied at various temperatures, under dry and humid conditions, and in various gaseous atmospheres, such as argon, helium, nitrogen and air. The effects of tape speed and outgassing on the drag properties of the tapes were also studied. A rank was assigned to each tape and <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> {{as a result of these}} tests. This study helped in the selection of a magnetic tape in a flight project, and will be useful in the consideration of tapes and <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> for future spacecraft applications...|$|R
5000|$|Three-head {{technology}} uses separate {{heads for}} {{recording and playback}} (the third of the three heads being the erase head). This allows different record and playback <b>head</b> <b>gaps</b> to be used. A narrower <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> is optimal for playback than for recording, so the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> width of any combined record/playback head must necessarily be a compromise. Separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording, permitting immediate verification of the recording quality. (Such machines can be identified {{by the presence of}} a [...] "monitor" [...] switch with positions for [...] "tape" [...] and [...] "source", or similar.) Three-head systems were common on reel-to-reel decks, but were more difficult to implement for cassettes, which do not provide separate openings for record and play heads. Some models squeezed a monitor head into the capstan area, and others combined separate record and playback gaps into a single headshell.|$|R

If a magnetic stripe can be recognized, a shutter will be opened and the card will be transported to the second <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> by roles. The card is read, thereby the device knows whether the transaction goes over the micro chip or the magnetic stripe. If no micro chip {{is placed on the}} card, the transaction goes directly above the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b> If the data gives the order for a transaction over the micro chip, the card is placed on the chip reading contact and is stopped. The chip contacts, are fitted on the chip and now the transaction begins. If the reading of the magnetic stripe respectively by the micro chip is not possible, the card will be declined.A cleaning card for a motorized card reader will need a magnetic stripe built into it to activate the acceptance shutter.|$|R

50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one pinch roller located after the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single capstan shaft, providing a more stable transport across two sets of <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads.</b> Dual pinch rollers are also used (along with dual capstans) in auto-reverse cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one pinch roller is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|R

The optical servo tracks allow for an increase in the tracking precision of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head,</b> from the usual 135 tracks per inch to [...] tracks per inch. Floptical disks provide 21 MB of storage. The drive has a second set of read/write heads so that it can read from and write to standard 720 kB and 1.44 MB ( [...] KiB) disks as well.|$|R
50|$|Metal in <b>Gap</b> (MIG) <b>heads</b> are ferrite {{heads with}} {{a small piece of}} metal in the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced with thin film heads. Thin film heads were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using photolithographic processes and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin film heads allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the <b>head</b> <b>gap</b> was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.|$|R

50|$|Runway designations {{change over}} time because the {{magnetic}} poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, {{it may be necessary}} over time to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> of a runway is 233 degrees, it would be designated Runway 23. If the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> changed downwards by 5 degrees to 228, the Runway would still be Runway 23. If on the other hand the original <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> was 226 (Runway 23), and the heading decreased by only 2 degrees to 224, the runway should become Runway 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers {{at each end of the}} runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.|$|R
