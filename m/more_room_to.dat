5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{big band}} is {{a style of}} big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernistic {{arrangements}} and <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> improvise. The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major proponents of the style.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} for the High Line was held, {{followed by the}} opening of the third section of the High Line Park on September 21, and a procession down the High Line. The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts. The first part, costing US$75 million, which opened on September 21, is {{from the end of the}} existing Phase 2 of the High Line to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. The second part, the spur, was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> install ambitious artworks curated by the public art program. It will also be integrated with 10 Hudson Yards, which has already been built over the High Line Spur. The spur will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.|$|E
5|$|The heavy Ottoman fire forced Canopus and Swiftsure to {{withdraw}} from their bombardment position, though this placed them in range of the guns at Erenköy as well, while those at Dardanus could still engage them. Cornwallis, having silenced the guns at Intepe, started shelling Erenköy, while Canopus and Swiftsure kept their fire on Dardanus. The Ottomans repeatedly straddled the three battleships, but being further out in the strait, they had <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> manoeuvre and so avoided any direct hits. By 16:40, the guns at Dardanus fell silent, allowing all three ships to concentrate their fire at Erenköy, where the batteries were quickly neutralised. The three ships then withdrew, seemingly having achieved their objective, though that night, when destroyers and minesweepers tried to clear the minefields blocking the straits, they were met with very heavy fire and were forced {{to withdraw}}.

By 2013 the inventory had risen to 47,154 items, with still <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> unpack and catalog.|$|R
50|$|The {{first record}} of the {{building}} is an 1858 atlas describing the building as a store with the school across the street; however this {{is believed to be}} in error because of the building's architecture. In 1875 another atlas describes it as Public School No. 11. It remained in use as a school until 1942-43, after which it was sold for use as a private residence. In 1956 the rear wing was added, and it was expanded nine years later, adding two <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the house.|$|R
25|$|The {{view that}} the Cantong qi is entirely {{concerned}} with alchemy and was entirely composed by Wei Boyang {{in the second century}} CE is virtually impervious to historical analysis.

25|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, government officials said that women received the closer parking spots so {{they did not have}} to walk as far with kids. It was also said that the parking spots were made larger so women can have <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> take the kids out of their vehicles. Men argued back that this implied that only women can be caretakers.|$|E
25|$|The first {{winners in}} 1876 were the Royal School, Armagh. When the Cup {{no longer had}} room to record the winners on it, the Cup was mounted on a wooden shield to which plaques were attached. In the centenary year of the {{competition}} after the 1976 final, the governors of Methodist College presented a new shield, as the original had no <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> record the winners. The Royal School won in 1977, thus claiming the place {{at the top of}} the new shield. The first wooden shield is on exhibit at the Ulster Branch offices at Ravenhill.|$|E

5000|$|The {{palace and}} its garden {{are open to}} the public and can be hired for weddings and other functions. Most of the rooms have been {{restored}} to resemble their appearance during the Courtaulds' occupation (though it is uncertain how some of them were furnished) but some have been left as they were when the palace was used by the Royal Army Educational Corps. In September 2013 English Heritage staff at the palace said that there were plans <b>to</b> open <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the public in 2014, including some of the servants' accommodation.|$|R

25|$|As the Soviet Union {{continued}} to maintain tight control over its {{sphere of influence}} in Eastern Europe, the Cold War gave way to Détente and a more complicated pattern of international relations in the 1970s in which the world was no longer clearly split into two clearly opposed blocs. Less powerful countries had <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> assert their independence, and the two superpowers were partially able to recognize their common interest in trying to check the further spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons in treaties such as SALT I, SALT II, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.|$|E
25|$|The joint airport {{proposal}} was revisited in 1961 after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) refused {{to invest more}} money in separate Dallas and Fort Worth airports. Although the Fort Worth airport was eventually abandoned, Dallas Love Field became congested and had no <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> expand. Following an order {{from the federal government}} in 1964 that it would unilaterally choose a site if the cities could not come to an agreement on a site, officials from the two cities finally agreed on a location for a new regional airport that was north of the abandoned GSW and almost equidistant from the two city centers. The land was purchased by the cities in 1966 and construction began in 1969.|$|E
25|$|There are two centres in a rugby team, inside centre (number 12) {{and outside}} centre (number 13). The inside centre usually stands {{close to the}} fly-half or at first {{receiver}} {{on the other side}} of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres' main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They need to run good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to side step and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.|$|E
50|$|By 1898, Duaringa {{had grown}} further {{due to the}} local timber {{industry}} flourishing. The building committee raised sufficient funds and a tender to build the new school building was finally accepted. The new school building was completed by October 1899 and was occupied the next month, meaning Duaringa State School was finally established. Throughout the 20th century, the school continued to grow. Two high set buildings were constructed {{on either side of}} the first building allowing <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> be added to incorporate additional classrooms, staff rooms, offices and a tuckshop. In 1979, Duaringa State School celebrated its centenary. By then, the school had grown to a four-teacher school with 110 students.|$|R
50|$|The Polyforum was {{designed}} {{as part of a}} major redevelopment/improvement project for Mexico City entitled Mexico 2000. Because of an increase in Mexico City’s urban population, Mexico 2000 strived to generate income for the city through tourism and services at its decentralized location at Parque de la Lama. In addition to making arts more accessible to people through Siqueiros’ work at the Polyforum, some of the other contributions of Mexico 2000 included underground networks of driveways, closed circuit radio and television broadcasting, a new system of construction called “Tridilosa” that lightened the weight of the building structure as <b>to</b> allow for <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> be created, and expedited travel services for tourists coming into the city.|$|R
5000|$|The Power family {{composed}} of [...] "Old Man" [...] Jeff, the father, his wife, Martha, three sons; Charles, John, and Tom, and one daughter; Ola May. They were originally from Texas, but moved to Arizona Territory in 1909 and homesteaded in lower Rattlesnake Canyon, south of Klondyke. Two years later, Charles bought a nearby goat ranch, {{which is now}} known as Power's Garden, and the family moved there. After improving the ranch by adding <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the cabin, the Powers began importing cattle. Life was not easy though; the Powers family lived [...] "in what was still a rough and occasionally violent frontier," [...] so the brothers often had to find work at the neighboring ranches or mines.|$|R
500|$|Gillom [...] {{contributed to}} the {{evolution}} of punting by standing further back from the center than was usual at the time to give himself <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> make kicks. His kicks were also high, which gave the coverage team more time to get down the field and stop punt returns. Gillom's distance from center and emphasis on [...] were followed by later generations of punters.|$|E
500|$|... 1937, {{primarily}} to accommodate vehicle traffic. Between 1916 and 1931, a large development of campgrounds, cabins, stores and service facilities were built {{just east of}} the bridge to support anglers. This area is now known as the Fishing Bridge Historic District. The 1937 bridge boasted pedestrian walkways {{on either side of the}} roadway to give <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> anglers. Angling in the river, at Fishing Bridge and in the lake, boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and over harvest caused a significant decline in the fishery. Consequently, in 1973, fishing was no longer permitted from Fishing Bridge.|$|E
500|$|Like the Grey Cup, {{awarded to}} {{the winner of the}} Canadian Football League, the Stanley Cup is {{engraved}} with the names of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff. However, this was not always the case: one of Lord Stanley's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring to the Cup to commemorate their victory. Initially, there was only one base ring, which was attached {{to the bottom of the}} original bowl by the Montreal Hockey Club. Clubs engraved their team names, usually in the form [...] "TEAM NAME" [...] "YEAR WON", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> engrave their names (and unwilling to pay for a second band), teams left their mark on the bowl itself. The 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowl's interior surface, and the first champion to record the name of every member of their team.|$|E
50|$|The Fidelity School then {{experienced}} {{growing pains}} whereupon the GPISD board authorized {{removal of a}} partition between two rooms of the school. Mrs. Emerson was re-elected {{to the position of}} principal and Laura Bailey was also re-elected by the board. The board also authorized the superintendent to add one additional African American teacher to the staff of the school. By 1937, the GPISD realized that both white and black school populations were still growing and petitioned the state for $85,000, $1000 to $2000 of which was to be used <b>to</b> add two <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the one-room Fidelity School. The old white elementary school was abandoned in 1938 when the GPISD built a new facility. When subsequent improvements to the Fidelity school proved necessary, lumber from the abandoned white student school was used <b>to</b> add two <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the one-room facility.|$|R
50|$|The Group {{acquired}} a prime {{site in the}} Nadi International Airport area and built a hotel which was to become the famous Tanoa Hotel. After operating a tourist hotel as the first local operator, the company soon started acquiring other hotels. RakiRaki in 1968, Skylodge in 1973 and Nadi Travelodge in 1992.In 1987, the Tanoa Group built a new 20-room hotel in Lautoka, the Tanoa Waterfront Hotel to cater for the need of accommodation for corporate visitors to the West. The Group soon added <b>more</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> the Tanoa Waterfront. This was followed up with the acquisition of a hotel in central Suva which was extensively renovated and refurbished and re-opened as Tanoa Plaza which gave the Group a foothold in Suva.|$|R
50|$|Deforestation {{has become}} one of the most {{prevalent}} issues environmentally. With an continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared <b>to</b> make <b>more</b> <b>room.</b> According <b>to</b> National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared.|$|R
500|$|Ne Tron Menia, Touch Me Not (from {{the biblical}} Latin phrase Noli me tangere which appears in [...] ), was ordered on 31 May 1862 when a {{contract}} was {{signed with the}} British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell. The total price of the ship was 923,500 rubles. The state-owned Galerniy Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg was leased to Mitchell and the Naval Ministry agreed to upgrade the facilities to handle iron-hulled, ironclad warships. The {{construction of a new}} slipway large enough to handle the ship delayed the start of construction until 30 January 1863 and the delay allowed the design to be modified to handle larger and more powerful eight-inch rifles about to enter service. These guns required <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> operate than the older, ineffectual smoothbore guns, so the main deck was slightly widened by raising {{the point at which the}} hull's tumblehome began. Based on the experiences with her sister, bilge keels [...] deep and [...] were fitted to reduce the ship's rolling. Ne Tron Menia was not formally laid down until 1 December 1863 and she was launched on 23 June 1864.|$|E

You got an idea — boom! Idea, boom!" [...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity.

Whedon noted he had decided {{at the end of}} season three to direct an episode in season four after doing some second unit work on [...] "Spacetime" [...] under Kevin Tancharoen. He {{credited}} his brother and series creator Joss Whedon along with Tancharoen, and his [...] "years working with S.H.I.E.L.D.s directors from a showrunning perspective and his close relationship with the cast and crew" [...] for why now was the right time for him to direct an episode. The cast expressed enthusiasm with Whedon directing [...] "Self Control", given he also wrote the episode, with Bennet feeling, [...] "The vision is so clear. There's a lot <b>more</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> play, like 'what about this?' and the enthusiasm because he wrote these words, he knows what's coming next. It's been so much fun."
