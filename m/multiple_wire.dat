40|$|The {{single wire}} {{replacement}} attempts {{to replace a}} target wire by another wire without changing the circuit functionality. Due to the large searching space required, {{there is very little}} success in directly extending the single wire replacement technique to replace multi-ple wires at the same time. The objective in this paper is to propose a new logic transfor-mation, called the alternative node (Alnode) technique, which attempts to replace <b>multiple</b> <b>wires</b> at a time. Basically, the transformation simultaneously replaces <b>multiple</b> input <b>wires</b> of a gate by a new set of input wires. To accomplish the transformation, we propose sev-eral speedup theorems for replacing <b>multiple</b> <b>wires.</b> In this paper, we also demonstrate that the Alnode technique can be applied to achieve power reduction for domino logic and wire length minimization in layouts. The experimental results are encouraging. ...|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{contacts}} have sharp prongs that when crimped, pierce the insulation and {{connect with the}} wire conductor, a mechanism known as insulation displacement. Ethernet cables, in particular, may have solid or stranded wire conductors and the sharp prongs are different in the 8P8C connectors made {{for each type of}} wire. A modular plug for solid (single strand) wire often has three slightly splayed prongs on each contact to securely surround and grip the conductor. Modular plugs for stranded or tinsel wire have prongs that are designed to connect to <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> strands. Connector plugs are designed for either solid or stranded wire; a plug for one wire type might not make reliable contact when crimped to a cable with wires of the other type.|$|E
5000|$|Curtain arrays are a {{class of}} large multielement {{directional}} wire radio transmitting antennas, used in the shortwave radio bands. [...] They are a type of reflective array antenna, consisting of <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> dipole antennas, suspended in a vertical plane, often {{in front of a}} [...] "curtain" [...] reflector made of a flat vertical screen of many long parallel wires. These are suspended by support wires strung between pairs of tall steel towers, up to 300 ft high. They are used for long-distance skywave (or skip) transmission; they transmit a beam of radio waves at a shallow angle into the sky just above the horizon, which is reflected by the ionosphere back to Earth beyond the horizon. Curtain antennas are mostly used by international short wave radio stations to broadcast to large areas at transcontinental distances.|$|E
5000|$|... === Vectoring === Performance in G.fast {{systems is}} limited to a large extent by {{crosstalk}} between <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> pairs in a single cable. Self-FEXT (far-end crosstalk) cancellation, also called vectoring, is mandatory in G.fast. Vectoring technology for VDSL2 was previously specified by the ITU-T in G.993.5, also called G.vector. The first version of G.fast will support an improved version of the linear precoding scheme found in G.vector, with non-linear precoding planned for a future amendment. Testing by Huawei and Alcatel shows that non-linear precoding algorithms can provide an approximate data rate gain of 25% compared to linear precoding in very high frequencies; however, the increased complexity leads to implementation difficulties, higher power consumption, and greater costs. Since all current G.fast implementations are limited to 106 MHz, non-linear precoding yields little performance gain. Instead, current efforts to deliver a gigabit are focusing on bonding, power and more bits per hertz.|$|E

50|$|An early {{experiment}} in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical' telegraph {{created by the}} German physician, anatomist and inventor Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo. Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) in order to visually represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmerring's design), {{with each of the}} telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each digit of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would visually observe the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message, albeit at a very low baud rate. The principal disadvantage to the system was its prohibitive cost, due to having to manufacture and string-up the <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> circuits it employed, as opposed to the single wire (with ground return) used by later telegraphs.|$|E
50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of wire rope, comprising <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> strands, spooling the wire has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers {{have a tendency to}} crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1937, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums. Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.Introducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to insert wiring without the proper tool, but this requires great care to avoid damaging the connectors. For example, pushing a screwdriver {{down the middle of}} the block is a bad practice as it forces the two blades of the terminal post apart, leading to bad contacts.

If these <b>multiple</b> <b>wires</b> are of different thicknesses (wire gauges), it is even more likely that the thinner wire will develop contact problems. Similarly, stranded wire can be used on punch-down blocks, even though they were originally designed for solid wire connections.|$|R

40|$|Global flow {{optimization}} (GFO) {{can perform}} multiple fanout/fanin wire reconnections {{at a time}} by modeling the problem of <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> reconnections with a flow graph, and then solving the problem using the maxflow-mincut algorithm on the flow graph. In this article, we propose an efficient <b>multiple</b> <b>wire</b> reconnection technique that modifies the framework of GFO, and as a result, can obtain better optimization quality. First, we observe that the flow graph in GFO cannot fully characterize wire reconnections, which causes the GFO to lose optimality in several obvious cases. In addition, we find that fanin reconnection can have more optimization power than fanout reconnection, but requires more sophisticated modeling. We reformulate the problem of fanout/fanin reconnections by a new graph, called the implication flow graph (IFG). We show {{that the problem of}} wire reconnections on the implication flow graph is NP-complete and also propose an efficient heuristic on the new graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an application which utilizes the flexibility of the wire reconnections explored in the logic domain to further minimize interconnects in the physical layout.
