40|$|Wine {{samples of}} four {{different}} countries: Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania and South Africa, {{have been studied}} within the European project WINES-DB "establishing of a wine data bank for analytical parameters from third countries". For each country two types of wine samples were collected, during three consecutive years: commercial wines and wines obtained by <b>microvinification</b> according to EC regulation N. 2729 / 2000. The sampling design was organized to represent both the grape varieties and the official wine regions in the four countries. The 1188 wine samples were analyzed for 58 chemical quantities.

Class modeling techniques (UNEQ, SIMCA, MRM) have been applied, to answer to the general question: "Does sample O, stated of class A, really belong to class A?". Two validation strategies, based on cross validation and on an external, representative, evaluation set, have been used to evaluate carefully the predictive performance of the class models. The results obtained with the four class modeling techniques indicate that for the four countries it is possible to compute models with high efficiency, generally with a reduced number of variables. To obtain efficient models, red and white wines, commercial and <b>microvinification</b> wines, must be considered separately.

To evaluate the oenological performances of the tested strains <b>microvinifications</b> in pasteurized red grape juice from Montepulciano d’Abruzzo cultivar were compared. The course of fermentation has been controlled through classical determinations (CO 2 evolution, ethanol, glycerol, pH, total titratable acidity, sugar content, free sulfur dioxide (SO 2), dry extract, sugars, organic acids and volatile compounds). Moreover, the yeast population was determined by both culture-dependent and independent approaches. In particular, the pure culture of H. uvarum and C. zemplinina didn’t end the fermentation. On the contrary, when S. cerevisiae was added, fermentations were faster confirming that yeast interactions influence the fermentation kinetics. Moreover, C. zemplinina showed a good interaction with S. cerevisiae by increasing the fermentation kinetic in high gravity Montepulciano must, with low ethyl acetate and acetic acid production.

The production of 4 -ethylphenol occurred roughly between mid-exponential growth phase {{and the beginning}} of the stationary phase. This behaviour was observed when glucose was the only energy and carbon source, the conversion rate being close to 90 %. Ethanol, as the single energy source, yielded conversion rates close to 80 % while in the presence of trehalose and acetic acid conversion rates lower than 10 % were obtained. The production of 4 -ethylphenol was not observed when the cells were maintained in buffer solution without carbon and energy sources. The precursor of 4 -ethylphenol, p-coumaric acid, was not utilized as energy and carbon source. Furthermore, it was shown that 4 -vinylphenol may be used as a precursor of 4 -ethylphenol in the absence of pcoumaric acid.

40|$|Abstract Background Wine Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, {{adapted to}} {{anaerobic}} must fermentations, suffer oxidative stress {{when they are}} grown under aerobic conditions for biomass propagation in the industrial process of active dry yeast production. Oxidative metabolism of sugars favors high biomass yields but also causes increased oxidation damage of cell components. The overexpression of the TRX 2 gene, coding for a thioredoxin, enhances oxidative stress resistance in a wine yeast strain model. The thioredoxin and also the glutathione/glutaredoxin system constitute the most important defense against oxidation. Trx 2 p is also involved in the regulation of Yap 1 p-driven transcriptional response against some reactive oxygen species. Results Laboratory scale simulations of the industrial active dry biomass production process demonstrate that TRX 2 overexpression increases the wine yeast final biomass yield and also its fermentative capacity both after the batch and fed-batch phases. <b>Microvinifications</b> carried out with the modified strain show a fast start phenotype derived from its enhanced fermentative capacity and also increased content of beneficial aroma compounds. The modified strain displays an increased transcriptional response of Yap 1 p regulated genes and other oxidative stress related genes. Activities of antioxidant enzymes like Sod 1 p, Sod 2 p and catalase are also enhanced. Consequently, diminished oxidation of lipids and proteins is observed in the modified strain, which can explain the improved performance of the thioredoxin overexpressing strain. Conclusions We report several beneficial effects of overexpressing the thioredoxin gene TRX 2 in a wine yeast strain. We show that this strain presents an enhanced redox defense. Increased yield of biomass production process in TRX 2 overexpressing strain can be of special interest for several industrial applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background] Aroma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} attributes defining wine quality in which yeasts play a crucial role, synthesizing aromatic compounds or releasing odourless conjugates. A present-day trend in winemaking consists of lowering fermentation temperature to achieve higher aroma production and retention. S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids seem to have inherited beneficial traits from their parental species, like fermenting efficiently at low temperature or producing higher amounts of certain aromatic compounds. In this study, allelic composition and gene expression of the genes related to aroma synthesis in two genetically and phenotypically different S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids, Lalvin W 27 and VIN 7, were compared and related to aroma production in <b>microvinifications</b> at 12 and 28  °C. In addition, the contribution of the allele coming from each parental to the overall expression was explored by RT-PCR. [Results] The results indicated large differences in allele composition, gene expression and the contribution of each parental to the overall expression at the fermentation temperatures tested. Results obtained by RT-PCR showed that in ARO 1 and ATF 2 genes the S. kudriavzevii allele was more expressed than that of S. cerevisiae particularly at 12 °C. [Conclusions] This study revealed high differences regarding allele composition and gene expression in two S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii hybrids, which may have led to different aroma profiles in winemaking conditions. The contribution of the alleles coming from each parental to the overall expression has proved to differently influence aroma synthesis. Besides, the quantitative contribution to the overall gene expression of the alleles coming from one parental strain or the other was clearly determined by the fermentation temperature for some genes.

Conversely, in both non-Saccharomyces single cultures the number of viable cells remained high (ranging 107 – 108 CFU ml− 1) even when cultures reached significant ethanol concentrations (up to 60 – 70 g l− 1). Thus, at least for these yeast strains, it seems that ethanol is not the main death-inducing factor. Furthermore, mixed cultures performed with different S. cerevisiae/ H. guilliermondii inoculum ratios (3 : 1; 1 : 2; 1 : 10; 1 : 100) revealed that H. guilliermondii death increases for higher inoculum ratios. In order to investigate if {{the nature of the}} yeast–yeast interaction was related or not with a cell–cell contact-mediated mechanism, cell-free supernatants obtained from 3 and 6 day-old mixed cultures were inoculated with H. guilliermondii pure cultures. Under these conditions, cells still died and much higher death rates were found for the 6 days than for the 3 day-old supernatants. This strongly indicates that one or more toxic compounds produced by S. cerevisiae triggers the early death of the H. guilliermondii cells in mixed cultures with S. cerevisiae. Finally, although it has not been yet possible to identify the nature of the toxic compounds involved in this phenomenon we must emphasise that the S. cerevisiae strain used in the present work is killer sensitive with respect to the classical killer toxins, K 1, K 2 and K 28, whereas the H. guilliermondii and H. uvarum strains are killer neutral...|$|R
40|$|Viticulture {{is widely}} practiced in dry regions, where the grapevine is greatly exposed to water stress. Optimizing plant water use {{efficiency}} (WUE) without affecting crop yield, grape and wine quality {{is crucial to}} limiting use of water for irrigation and to significantly improving viticulture sustainability. This study examines the use in vineyards of particle film technology (engineered kaolin) and compares it to a film-forming antitranspirant (pinolene), traditionally used to limit leaf water loss, and to an untreated control. The trial was carried out under field conditions over three growing seasons, during which moderate to very severe plant water stress (down to - 1. 9 MPa) was measured through stem water potential. Leaf stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthesis rate (An) were measured during the seasons and used to compute intrinsic WUE (WUEi, defined as An /gs ratio). Leaf temperature was also recorded and compared between treatments. Bunch quantity, bunch and berry weight, sugar accumulation, anthocyanin and flavonoid contents were measured. Finally, <b>microvinifications</b> were performed and resultant wines subjected to sensory evaluation. Results showed {{that the use of}} kaolin increased grapevine intrinsic WUE (+ 18 % on average as compared to unsprayed vines) without affecting berry and bunch weight and quantity, or sugar level. Anthocyanin content increased (+ 35 %) in kaolin treatment, and the wine was judged more attractive (p-value < 0. 05) and slightly more appreciated (p-value < 0. 1) than control. Pinolene did not increase WUEi, limiting An more than gs; grapes with this treatment contained lower sugar and anthocyanin content than control, and the obtained wine was the least appreciated. This study demonstrates that particle film technology can improve vine WUEi and wine quality at the same time, while traditional antitranspirants were not as effective for these purposes. This positive effect can be used in interaction with other already-demonstrated uses of particle film technology, such as pest control and sunburn reduction, in order to achieve more sustainable vineyard management. © 2016 Brillante et al.

40|$|AbstractAims: In this work, a {{population}} of 88 descendants derived from three wine strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was tested for the enological trait 'wine colour adsorption' (WCA) to evaluate its inheritability. Methods and Results: The WCA phenotype was tested on plate agar medium specifically formulated for the purpose. After 10 days of anaerobic incubation at 28 °C, a computer-assisted assessment of WCA aptitude of the yeasts was carried out. The biomass colour – ranging from white to dark brown – reflects the adsorption of grape pigments: white and dark brown biomass colour corresponds to low and high adsorption, respectively. In order to confirm biomass colour results, <b>microvinification</b> trials using red must were performed, and the obtained wines were analysed. Conclusions: The analysis of the progeny demonstrated that the enological trait WCA is inheritable and polygenic. Significance and Impact of the Study: A way to describe the polygenic effect of the WCA trait has been found, also showing that this trait is inheritable. The impact of the work revolves more around the large-scale screening method, which could then assist in breeding wine yeast, and {{can also be used}} as a scientific tool to investigate WCA trait...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Rotundone, {{a potent}} aroma {{compound}} responsible for peppery {{aroma and flavour}} in Shiraz, was detected recently in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Duras wines. In 2011 and 2012, two separate experiments were carried out {{to determine the effect}} of ripeness and viticultural techniques on rotundone concentration in Duras wine. Methods and Results: Rotundone was measured in wines prepared by <b>microvinification</b> techniques (1 L Erlenmeyer). Accumulation of this compound in wines depended on vintage conditions and the degree of ripening, such that a higher concentration of rotundone was reached 44 days after mid-veraison. Application of exogenous jasmonic acid and grape thinning did not significantly affect rotundone concentration, whereas leaf removal strongly reduced rotundone concentration. Wine from the irrigated treatment had a higher concentration of rotundone, and in most cases, vine water status over the veraison-harvest period was identified as a key variable that was well correlated with observed intraplot variability. Conclusions: These findings confirm that some common viticultural practices can be used to manipulate the peppery character in red wine. Significance of the Study: Our results may assist grape growers to produce Duras, Shiraz and other cultivars where rotundone makes an important contribution to wine aroma. O. Geffroy, T. Dufourcq, D.

40|$|The {{sparkling}} wine {{production and consumption}} have increased significantly in the last years. With the increased demand appear the necessity to check the {{sparkling wine}} authenticity, because the practice of adding CO 2 in sparkling wine is not allow. A way to control the carbonation process is through the determination of CO 2 δ 13 C, because the sugar added during the second fermentation define the CO 2 isotopic value, according to elaboration process. For this reason, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the relationship between values of δ 13 C from still wines and sparkling wines, in order to set up limit values to exogenous carbonation control. Thirty-eight still wines elaborated by <b>microvinification</b> and 59 samples of commercial sparkling wines were analyzed, using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). The most negative value of natural δ 13 C from still wine found was − 24. 7 ‰, it can be to estimate that lowest values are an indicative of industrial CO 2 addition. Among the commercial sparkling wine from South America evaluated in this study, 10 % from the samples showed signs of carbonation. Through this research was possible to establish limits of isotopic values to determine the presence of exogenous CO 2...|$|E

The two treatments employed were {{nitrogen addition}} to supplement yeast requirements and aging artificially {{to assess whether}} any changes caused by the DAP additions were impacted by long-term storage. The resulting three levels of nitrogen were: Control 450 mg/L YAN, 600 mg/L YAN and 700 mg/L YAN. Half the wines were subjected to a short-term artificial ageing (6 weeks at 30 ° C) and then aged at 8 ° C for 8. 5 months. The remainder were naturally aged for 10 months at 8 ° C. The chemical composition of the treatment wines was investigated. Standard wine composition parameters were determined (e. g. alcohol, titratable acidity, residual sugar). HS-SPME-GC-MS methods were used to measure specific volatile fatty acids, esters and sulphides. A sensory panel of wine professionals {{was used to determine}} if there were sensory differences between the wine treatments. Statistical analysis on the chemical data using MANOVA, principal component analysis, and canonical variate analysis showed the following results: a) esters concentrations tended to decrease with nitrogen addition with the exception of ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, hexyl acetate and ethyl 2 methyl butanoate. Conversely, artificially aging the wines significantly increased the concentration of four esters and decreased hexyl acetate; b) fatty acid concentrations decreased with nitrogen addition with the exception of decanoic acid, which significantly increased. Artificial aging of the wines caused a significant increase in decanoic acid concentration; c) dimethyl sulphide (DMS) decreased across the DAP amendments, however DMS and methanethiol both increased with artificial aging. Multidimensional scaling analysis of the sensory data showed the participants could differentiate that the wines had age related differences. Any sensory effects from variations in DAP addition were not able to be perceived either because the variation was to subtle or overwhelmed by the more obvious differences caused by the artificial aging. The aged wines were described as more “mature”, “reduced”, “jammy” with less “floral, fruity” on the nose. Significant increases in the fatty acid decanoic acid with aging seems to be partially responsible for the maturity characteristics. PLSR results correlated it to the “spicy” characteristics. Ethyl octanoate and 2 methyl ethyl butanoate were related to “maturity” and ethyl decanoate and ethyl isobutyrate to “jammy”...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of yeast strains on the composition and sensory quality of Gewürztraminer wine. Three different commercial yeast strains were examined on the <b>microvinification</b> scale. In the wines, the chemical parameters and the concentration of free volatile monoterpene alcohols were measured and a descriptive sensory analysis was performed. Significantly more geraniol and nerol were detected in the fermentation conducted with reference Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and more citronellol was found in the fermentation conducted with a hybrid of S. cerevisiae hybrid and S. paradoxus. However, more α-terpineol and linalool were found in the wine fermented with a combination of Saccharomyces and Torulaspora delbrueckii strains. The best wine flavour of tropical fruits was obtained using a hybrid of S. cerevisiae hybrid and S. paradoxus, and the best wine quality was achieved with a combination of Saccharomyces and T. delbrueckii strains. The selection of yeast strains for the fermentation of Gewürztraminer must significantly influenced the concentration of free volatile monoterpene alcohols and the sensory quality of the wine. With the selected hybrid of S. cerevisiae hybrid and S. paradoxus or the combination of Saccharomyces and T. delbrueckii strains either a better flavour or overall wine quality than with the reference strain can be achieved...|$|E
