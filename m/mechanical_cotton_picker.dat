5000|$|Economically, {{the major}} force in Alabama was the {{mechanization}} and consolidation of agriculture. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> became available in the postwar era, reducing the need for many agricultural workers.

Diversification from cotton into soybeans, poultry and dairy products also drove more poor people off the land. In the state's thirty-five Appalachian counties, twenty-one lost population between 1950 and 1960. What was once a rural state was become more industrial and urban.|$|R

Across the South, sharecropping evolved, in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until <b>mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> were developed, <b>cotton</b> farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton.

40|$|Episodes of {{labor-saving}} {{technological change}} and rural urban migration have become universal patterns {{of economic development}} the world over. Donald Holley, in The Second Great Emancipation, sets out {{to tell the story}} of the last great episode of such change in the United States, when the cotton harvest was mechanized following World War II. The last major crop to make the transition from hand production, cotton was extraordinarily labor-intensive, especially the harvest. In 1945 millions of workers hand picked almost every boll of American cotton, but by 1970 farmers gathered their crop with John Deere and International Harvester <b>mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers.</b> Folks, mainly blacks, who had for generations performed one of the most backbreaking forms of stoop labor, moved to northern and western cities. As Holley tells it, the First Great Emancipation occurred when President Lincoln freed the slaves and the Second Great Emancipation when the <b>mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> harvester freed laborers from the drudgery of the cotton harvest, poverty, and Jim Crow discrimination, and southern producers from inefficient production methods and farm sizes. It is a really big and important story of profound technological and demographic changes with spillover effects into civil rights, racial economic equality, and politics. These events, for example, transformed race from a southern regional to a national issue. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – The <b>mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>picker</b> is {{a machine}} that automates cotton {{harvesting}} {{in a way that}} reduces harvest time and maximizes efficiency. To develop a <b>mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>picker</b> with the intent on replacing manual labor. The first pickers were only capable of harvesting one row of cotton at a time, but were still able to replace up to forty hand laborers The current cotton picker is a self-propelled machine that removes cotton lint and seed (seed-cotton) users rows of barbed spindles that rotate at high speed and remove the seed-cotton from the plant. The seed-cotton is then removed from the spindles by a counter-rotating doffer and is then blown up into the basket the plant at up to six rows at a time. The picker or spindle type machine was designed to pick the open cotton from the bolls using spindles, fingers, or prongs, without injuring the plant's foliage and unopened bolls. In this cotton picking by spindle type machine will resul in sshort fibre content,micronair and fibre length will indirectly looses the fibre strength quality as compare to hand picking machine. over come to these problem make a cotton picking machine by suction will made a pressure equal to the hand picking (100 gm) Keywords:-cotton fibre/cotton harvesting/cotton fibre properties/cotton fibre testing/pneumatic cotton picking machin...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a critical}} study of technopolitical issues {{in the history of}} African American people. Langdon Winner 2 ̆ 7 s theory of technopolitics was used to facilitate the analysis of large scale technologies and their compatibility with various political ends. I contextualized the central technopolitical issues within the major epochs of African American political history: the Atlantic slave trade, the African artisans of antebellum America, and the American Industrial Age. Throughout this study I have sought to correct negative stereotypes and to show how 2 ̆ 2 technological gauges 2 ̆ 2 were employed to belittle people of African descent. This research also has shown that the mainstream notion that Africans had no part in the history of technology is false. This study identifies and analyses specific technologies that {{played a major role in}} the political affairs of Africans and African Americans. Those technologies included nautical devices, fort construction, and automatic guns in Africa, and hoes, plows, tractors, cotton gins, and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> in America. The findings of this study suggested that African Americans have been disengaged and victimized by western technologies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to {{determine}} the optimum replacement time for <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> under the technical and economic conditions in Greece. For this pur-pose, five relevant methods have been applied to analyze real data taken by 62 <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> working in Central Greece. Three of the methods consider that the optimum replacement time for <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> is the year when the accumulated annual deprecia-tion is equal to the corresponding repair and maintenance costs or the year when the aforementioned annual expenses of the machine per working hour are minimum. The fourth method considers the year in which the accumulated average total costs per working hour or per hectare harvested is minimum, while the fifth method refers to the year in which the accumulated annual “standardized ” net income received from the use of a <b>cotton</b> <b>picker</b> is maximum. Based on {{the results of this study}} the optimum replace-ment time of a <b>cotton</b> <b>picker</b> is the 14 th – 15 th year of its productive life combined with 4500 – 5000 working hours and 1450 – 1550 hectares harvested...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Farm {{workers and}} female <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> {{are exposed to}} {{residual}} impacts of pesticide use in cotton production, in addition to dust, ultraviolet radiation, etc. Cotton picking causes various health hazards among <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> with varied health cost. A soil bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is incorporated in cotton seed through genetic modification and it has resistance against certain bollworms of cotton. So it is considered that Bt cotton fields have less pesticide exposure compared to non-Bt cotton fields. This {{study was designed to}} examine and compare the impacts and health cost of cotton picking among female <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> working in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields. Methods The study used the data collected from Vehari district of Pakistani Punjab. Health hazards and associated health cost of the respondents involved in Bt cotton picking were compared with those who harvested non-Bt cotton. Comparative use of the personal protective measures among those respondents was also examined. Health cost function and its determinants were analyzed using ordinary least square method. Results Findings of the study showed that 61  % <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> from Bt <b>cotton</b> households reported one or more health effects of pesticide during picking season whereas this percentage for non-Bt cotton households was 66  %. Health impacts included skin problems, headache, cough, flu/fever, eye irritation and sleeplessness, however, percentage of these health impacts was comparatively higher among non-Bt cotton households. Health cost from exposure to pesticide use in cotton was US$ 5. 74 and 2. 91 per season for non-Bt cotton and Bt cotton households, respectively. Education, picking in Bt cotton fields and preventive measures were significantly related with health cost. Conclusion <b>Cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> working in Bt cotton fields are found to have less occupational health hazards compared to those working in non-Bt cotton fields. Thus generating awareness among <b>cotton</b> <b>pickers</b> for adopting precautionary measures during harvesting and the use of Bt cotton seed can result in a decline in the ill-effects of cotton picking...|$|R
