5|$|Lacks {{was buried}} in an unmarked grave in the family {{cemetery}} {{in a place called}} Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given to the land in Clover, Virginia that was originally owned by white, land- and slave-owning members of the Lacks family before the Civil War. Later generations gave the land to the <b>many</b> <b>black</b> members of the Lacks family who were descendants of African slaves and their white owners.|$|E

She has one older brother named Malaney (born 1972). Her Baptist family moved to New York and Newark for short periods until settling in South Orange, New Jersey. She had a middle-class upbringing, knowing both many Jewish families and <b>many</b> <b>black</b> ones. Future actor Zach Braff lived in the neighborhood, and she attended his Bar Mitzvah.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma {{also has}} a rich African American history. <b>Many</b> <b>black</b> towns thrived in the early 20th century because of black {{settlers}} moving from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-black state.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} did {{not reach}} the city until {{the second day of}} rioting, by which time the mobs had ransacked or destroyed numerous public buildings, two Protestant churches, the homes of various abolitionists or sympathizers, <b>many</b> <b>black</b> homes, and the Colored Orphan Asylum at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, which was burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for <b>many</b> <b>black</b> workers. During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E

40|$|No {{scientific}} experiment inflicted {{more damage}} on the collective psyche of black Americans than the Tuskegee study. After Jean Heller broke the story in 1972, news of the tragedy spread in the black community. Confronted with the experiment's moral bankruptcy, <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> lost faith in the government and no longer believed health officials who spoke on matters of public concern. Consequently, when a terrifying new plague swept the land in the 1980 s and 1990 s, the Tuskegee study predisposed <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> to distrust health authorities, a fact many whites had difficulty understanding...|$|R

5|$|In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for {{yet another}} {{prisoner}} exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due {{to the influence of}} the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the <b>many</b> <b>Black</b> African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Black</b> Hebrew {{groups were}} {{founded in the}} United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from Kansas to New York City, by both African Americans and West Indian immigrants. In the mid-1980s, the number of Black Hebrews in the United States was between 25,000 and 40,000. In the 1990s, the Alliance of Black Jews (which is no longer operating) {{estimated}} that there were 200,000 African-American Jews; this estimate {{was based on a}} 1990 survey conducted by the Council of Jewish Federations. The exact number of Black Hebrews within that surveyed group remains unspecified.|$|E
5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, Rosa {{stays in}} a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as <b>many</b> <b>black</b> fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|In 1880, {{the parish}} had a {{population}} {{with more than}} twice as <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> as whites. [...] They were essentially disenfranchised in 1898 under a new state constitution after the white Democrats regained power in the state in the late 1870s through paramilitary intimidation at the polls. Most of the former slaves worked as sharecroppers and laborers, cultivating cotton. Because of the mechanization of agriculture, <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> left the parish during the mid-20th century Great Migration to seek better job opportunities elsewhere. By 2000, the parish population was 9,622, with a white majority, but Coushatta itself was still two thirds black.|$|R

25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Blacks</b> who {{had settled}} on {{property}} surrounding Hampton {{were forced to}} leave by various means. These included Johnson's aggressive restoration policy, Black Codes passed by the Virginia legislature, and with vigilante enforcement by returning Confederates. Union troops also forcefully evicted settlers, sometimes provoking violent standoffs; <b>many</b> <b>Blacks</b> came to trust the Freedmen's Bureau no {{more than they did}} the Rebels. In 1866 Tidewater's refugee camps were still full, and many of their residents were sick and dying. Relations with Northern and Southern Whites had become violently hostile. The Whites (military occupiers and local residents) agreed on a plan to deport the freedpeople back to their counties of origin.|$|R

5000|$|Excluded {{from the}} {{political}} process and suffering lynchings and other violence, <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> left the county and state. In 1900 whites numbered 4565 in the county, and blacks 16,222. A local history noted <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> were leaving the county at that time. As {{can be seen in}} the Historical Population table in the [...] "Demographics" [...] section below, from 1900 to 1920, the population of the county declined by 41%, more than 8500 persons from the peak of 20,787. These rural blacks migrated to the North and Midwest cities, such as Chicago, in the Great Migration to seek jobs and other opportunities elsewhere. Rural whites also migrated out of the South.|$|R

5000|$|White {{paramilitary}} {{violence against}} African Americans intensified. <b>Many</b> <b>blacks</b> were fearful of this trend, and men like Benjamin [...] "Pap" [...] Singleton began speaking of separating from the South.

25|$|By {{the time}} the first black {{students}} enrolled at the university in 1951, enrollment had grown to nearly 10,000 students—4,000 of whom were women. Prior to 1951, <b>many</b> <b>black</b> students in Maryland were enrolled at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore.|$|E
25|$|Because of the then-prevalent {{notion that}} {{straight}} hair was more acceptable than kinky hair, <b>many</b> <b>black</b> people began exploring solutions for straightening, or relaxing, their tresses.

5000|$|A {{major source}} of stress remains the {{redistribution}} of land. Under apartheid 73% of land was in so called [...] "white areas" [...] and <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> had been uprooted and removed to previous tribal areas to keep crime and vandalism away from important land.|$|R
50|$|This selling {{pressure}} {{caused by}} the Act forced <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> to seek work in salaried employment outside of their family and tribal tradition rooted in residential areas. Destinations of these migrations were the large farms of the whites and the cities, preferably industrial urban centers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Many</b> <b>blacks</b> {{left the}} city {{permanently}} because of the hostile environment. The Freedmen's Bureau continued to struggle to protect remaining residents.
