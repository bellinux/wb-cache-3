The shape of carotid pulse wave was divided into five types by the contour of the late systolic hump, i. e, O, I, II, III and IV. The late systolic hump was observed in all normal subjects. The juveniles showed more frequently the clear-cut late systolic hump in the left carotid pulse wave than in the right one. The middle-aged and old subjects, however, did not indicate such a marked difference in the late systolic hump {{that depends on the}} recording side. The first type of the late systolic hump was, in general, often observed in normal subjects, patients with essential hypotension, mitral and aortic valvular diseases and high output disorders, among which high output disorders showed the first type most strikingly. The third as well as fourth types were frequently found in arterial hypertension. In the normal juvenile subjects and in patients other than the hypertensives the first type was observed most frequently and the advanced types (III, IV) were increased with age. This advancing of the type with aging was also noted in arterial hypertension though there existed a difference of the extent of changes between normal subjects and hypertensives. While normal subjects with the first and second types showed usually the normal cardiodynamical reaction in the sense of Blumberger, the third and fourth types revealed the tendency to pressure reaction. In the first and second types, the vasculodynamical values obtained from Wezler 2 ̆ 7 s method showed the normal type in majority of the cases. On the contrary, in the third and fourth types the vasculodynamical values indicated 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungstyps 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg & Schroeder) in majority. With the advancing, in tyWith the advancing, in types from I to IV mean values of systolic and diastolic pressures, peripheral vascular streaming resistance, vascular volume elastisity coefficient and pulse wave velocity of the arterial 2 ̆ 2 Windkessel 2 ̆ 2 were increased, while the stroke and minute volumes were decreased both in normal subjects and arterial hypertension. However, there existed a difference of extent of these changes in hemodynamics between normal subjects and patients with arterial hypertension. In atrial fibrillation appearance of the late systolic hump seemed to be depending on a preceding cardiac cycle length. When the preceding cycle length was very short, the late systolic hump often disappeared. Among the three small waves observed on the systolic portion of the carotid pulse wave, the third wave was shifted backward with the prolongation of the preceding cardiac cycle length. The late systolic hump became more marked in the 2 ̆ 2 Anspannungstyps 2 ̆ 2 obtained by norepinephrine injection. When the 2 ̆ 2 Entspannungstyps 2 ̆ 2 (Duesberg & Schroeder) was elicited by the injection of epinephrine, the late systolic hump decreased in its magnitude. By the depressant drug therapy for arterial hypertension, the change in the contour of the late systolic hump occured in the direction from IV to III, II and I. On this occasion, peripheral vascular streaming resistance and vascular volume elastisity coefficient tended to be diminished without any definite change in the stroke volume. No parallelism of the mode of changes was noted between the amplitude of the late systolic hump and that of the dicrotic wave. Therefore, it may be safe to say that a reflexion theory will not fully explain the origin of the late systolic hump...|$|E
40|$|The {{peripheral}} {{venous pressure}} (p. v. pr.) was estimated according to Burch 2 ̆ 7 s method, the right auricular pressure (central v. pr.), to Cournand 2 ̆ 7 s {{in health and}} disease. The cases in this observation were confined {{to those who were}} suffering from cardiac failure due to various causes, i. e., valvular disorders, myocardial diseases and so on. Firstly venous pressure, peripheral and central, of cardiac patients were determined. at quiet rest, then their fluctuations during treatment, especially, digitalis medication was examined. 2 ̆ 2 Digicorin 2 ̆ 2 of which effects were discussed in this paper is the product manufactured from the Y-number onward. In several cases, the venous pressure before and after application of sympatheticomimetic ammines was also observed. The influence of three kinds of somatic loading upon venous pressure was investigated with aim to elucidate the role of augmented venous return. 1. With respect to its simplicity in performance and its sensitiveness to pressure change, Burch 2 ̆ 7 s phlebomanometer is superior to Mobitz 2 ̆ 7 s original method or its modification, for clinical purpose. The <b>membrane</b> <b>manometer</b> which was adopted in this observation can be said to be the most excellent among those ever presented. The estimation of right intracardiac pressure by membrane manometry with use of cardiac catheter,・however, has some limitation which is inevitable on cardiac catheterization, so that there remains something to be improved by further studies. 2. In health, there can be seen almost constant difference between p. v. pr. in V. mediana cubiti and diastolic pressure in right auricle or right ventricle, whereas in cardiac insufficiency, venous pressures were raised both peripherally and centrally, and moreover their pressure difference got nearer to zero. In cor pulmonale chronica, so far as there occurs no decompensation, except for the elevated systolic pressure of right ventricle, the other pressures remain frequently within normal range. The pressure determined in V. mediana cubiti suggests, to a certain extent, the state of both right auricular and right ventricular diastolic pressure with the exception of cases with venous compression or obstruction, for example, due to neoplasma. 3. Digicorin as well as other sorts of digitalis preparates, i. e. Uavanin 2 ̆ 2 Takeda 2 ̆ 2, Digoxine 2 ̆ 2 Wellcome 2 ̆ 2 etc. lowers the venous pressure rapidly not only in cases with decompensated valvular disorders or hypertensive cardiac disease, but also in those who are suffering from emphysematous or anemic heart and so on. Although this action mode can be of course explained as the secondary results of the improved cardiac force, yet there are possible to exist some reasons which are suggestive of the more direct effect of digitalis on venous pressure. The elevation of venous pressure due to epinephrine injection has resulted largely from the venous constriction, so that it is of some different nature from that being seen in cardiac insufficiency. The venous pressure in cardiac insufficiency is more apt to be raised by norepinephrine injection than that of normal. 4. The degree of elevation of venous pressure in cardiac insufficiency does not always coincide with the extent of cardiac insufficiency, despite a few exceptions. Therefore the height of venous pressure at quiet rest does not necessarily indicate the severity of disturbed cardiac function nor course and prognosis of cardiac insufficiency. 5. In order to augment venous return, three kinds of somatic loading tests were taken. Among them the effect of the ligature of lower extremities is not distinct, while the elevation of lower extremities and the abdominal compression bring the marked reactions. The estimation of recovery times in these tests is proved significant {{as well as that of}} pressure change itself. The reaction of right auricular pressure due to loadings coincides almost with that of the height of p. v. pr. and of the length of recovery time observed peripherally, so that the reactivity of right auricular pressure can be roughly implied from that p. v. pr. In health the fluctuation due to these tests is considerably marked, and the recovery time is short, whereas in congestive cardiac failure the fluctuation is further remarkable and the recovery time is more prolonged. The degree of reactions agrees approximately with tha of clinical symptoms, but is not always parael with the venous pressure at quiet rest. In apparently compensated group, on the contrary to the completely compensated, both pressure change and recovery time react more distinct than those of health. By the medication of digitalis preparates the reactions against these tests can be normalized, mostly pararell with both descending of p. v. pr. at quiet rest and improvement of clinical symptoms. However during digitalis medication there are observed some cases of which venous pressures at quiet rest become entirely normal, but nevertheless the reactions against these tests are still very marked. It is worthwhile taking notice that among such cases the recidive ofcardiac decompensation can be observed much frequently in their further courses...|$|E
