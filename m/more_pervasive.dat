5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much <b>more</b> <b>pervasive</b> in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{have noted}} that fires appear in cycles {{associated}} {{with those of the}} hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer {{due to the lack of}} lightning, but their damage may be <b>more</b> <b>pervasive.</b> A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of charcoal have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 BCE.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{technological}} advances in hardware manufacturing {{led to an}} increase in heterogeneity and quantity of entities involved in pervasive computing environments. Consequently, more coordination efforts have to be employed in order to keep on improving the level of service quality. Current solutions do not explicitly address the coordination issue and usually cover this by self-contained attempts which lack reusability. To address this drawback, this work proposes a generic coordination architecture (CorA) based on a three-layered structure, which shall facilitate a <b>more</b> effective <b>pervasive</b> system development by providing problem-specific and reusable system components. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted {{not just from the}} publication of such new books as these, but from a <b>more</b> <b>pervasive</b> sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.|$|E
25|$|Ammolite {{is neither}} easily nor often imitated; however, a few {{materials}} have a passing resemblance that may deceive the unfamiliar. These include: labradorite (also known as spectrolite), an iridescent feldspar that {{may also be}} of Canadian origin; and broad-flash black opal. Neither are convincing substitutes, and the latter is actually of greater value than ammolite. Indeed, ammolite is often used as an imitation of black opal. An even less convincing possibility is Slocum stone, a common glass-based imitation of opal. Blues and purples are much <b>more</b> <b>pervasive</b> in labradorite, and in both it and opal the play of color is seen to roll across the stone unlike the comparatively restricted play of color in ammolite. In Slocum stone, the play of color {{takes the form of}} tinsel-like patches. The visible structure is also considerably different; in the imitations, the body of the stone is transparent to translucent from certain angles, whereas ammolite is entirely opaque.|$|E

500|$|Between {{the years}} of 1991 to 2001, the female-male ratio of the {{population}} of India fell from 94.5 girls per 100 boys to 92.7 girls per 100 boys.

The dissenters argued that the principle of jus sanguinis (that is, the concept of a child inheriting his or her father's citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been <b>more</b> <b>pervasive</b> in U.S. legal history since independence.

Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a <b>more</b> <b>pervasive</b> influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night".

40|$|We {{present a}} system that enables {{applications}} to discover and obtain information that describes {{the context of a}} particular entity (e. g., a user or a device).

Context agents facilitate the enforcement of an entity’s policies regarding the release of context information (e. g., to applications or visiting users), even while these entities roam across different administrative domains.
