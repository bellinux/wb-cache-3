50|$|The {{complexity}} of the biclustering problem depends on the exact problem formulation, and particularly on the <b>merit</b> <b>function</b> {{used to evaluate the}} quality of a given bicluster. However most interesting variants of this problem are NP-complete. NP-complete have two conditions.

The maximum size bicluster is equivalent to maximum edge biclique in bipartite graph. In the complex case, the element in matrix A is used to compute the quality of a given bicluster and solve the more restricted version of the problem. It requires either large computational effort or the use of lossy heuristics to short-circuit the calculation.|$|E

40|$|An {{assessment}} {{is made of}} the impact of a thermally bloomed atmosphere on target image quality. The steady-state phase perturbations due to blooming and the effects of the distortion on return wave-fronts are determined using a physical optics propagation code. The wavelength of the return radiation used to sense the distortions is shown to be an important consideration in the stability of the return image. The return targets images for several realistic scenarios are reconstructed based on the incoherent point spread function for each isoplanatic region of the object (target) plane. Special requirements of the back propagation algorithm are discussed with respect to "point source" geometry, tilt, tilt sensitivity, and isoplanatism criterion. The wave optics approach is shown to agree with the experimental results in regards to image blur and distortion. The stability of the reconstructed images is discussed using <b>merit</b> <b>functions</b> defining the amount of blur, distortion, and degradation in peak irradiance.
