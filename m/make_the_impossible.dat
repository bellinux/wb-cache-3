January 24th, after Konigsgratz and other Prussian posts,--January 24th, which is elsewhere so notable a day,--his route goes northeast, to Glatz, a hundred miles away, among {{the intricacies of the}} Giant Mountains, hither side of the Silesian Highlands; wild route for winter season, if the young King feared any route. From Berlin, hither and farther, he may have gone well-nigh his seven hundred miles within the week; rushing on continually (starts, at say four in the winter morning); doing endless business, of the ordering sort, as he speeds along.|$|E

No, you have n't.

5000|$|... "Regrets" [...] is a {{love song}} in which a couple of lovers are {{answering}} tenderly and with melancholy, while they are separated {{by the death of}} one of them (Farmer). Indeed, Instant-Mag said that the song deals with the [...] "very romantic theme of the loss of lover. This loss leaves an unfathomable lack in the one who remains, which invests the world of dreams to regain the lost happiness. Only memories then allow to savour the well-being of the past relationship". In his analysis of the song, the psychologist Hugues Royer stated: [...] "Death is a subterfuge to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>impossible</b> love. (...) Is not it easier to romanticize a dead person than a living one who, sooner or later, will show the faces of his faults? It is indeed the fear of everyday life that terrifies the advocates of absolute love." [...] About the lyrics, Farmer explained that she [...] "does not unit the regret with the notions of disappointment and failure, rather these things that we could do, but that we decide not to do".|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>impossible</b> cube {{draws upon}} the {{ambiguity}} {{present in a}} Necker cube illustration, in which a cube is drawn with its edges as line segments, and {{can be interpreted as}} being in either of two different three-dimensional orientations.An impossible cube is usually rendered as a Necker cube in which the line segments representing the edges have been replaced by what are apparently solid beams.In Escher's print, the top four joints of the cube, and the upper of the two crossings between its beams, match one of the two interpretations of the Necker cube, while the bottom four joints and the bottom crossing match the other interpretation. Other variations of <b>the</b> <b>impossible</b> cube combine these features in different ways; for instance, the one shown in the illustration draws all eight joints according to one interpretation of the Necker cube and both crossings according to the other interpretation.The apparent solidity of the beams gives <b>the</b> <b>impossible</b> cube greater visual ambiguity than the Necker cube, which is less likely to be perceived as an <b>impossible</b> object. <b>The</b> illusion plays on the human eye's interpretation of two-dimensional pictures as three-dimensional objects. It is possible for three-dimensional objects to have the visual appearance of <b>the</b> <b>impossible</b> cube when seen from certain angles, either by making carefully placed cuts in the supposedly solid beams or by using forced perspective, but human experience with right-angled objects <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>impossible</b> appearance seem more likely than the reality.|$|R
