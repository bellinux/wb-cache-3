It sought to analyse gendered organisational practices and procedures embedded within such cultures. We found that both men and women clearly agreed that the presence of women in senior roles had changed <b>management</b> <b>cultures</b> and influenced methods of decision-making. Yet we also found that the influences that women were seen to have on <b>management</b> <b>cultures</b> were often described in terms that reinforced traditional gender stereotypes. The paper argues that valuing management based upon traits and orientations traditionally associated with women and “the feminine” has the potential to further engender inequality at senior levels in organisations. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} {{findings}} of an Australia-wide empirical study that investigated {{the impact of}} the presence of senior women executives on <b>management</b> <b>cultures.</b> We found that both men and women clearly agreed that the presence of women in senior roles had changed <b>management</b> <b>cultures.</b> When there was a critical mass of women employed at senior levels, both women and men believed that women encouraged greater collaboration, more consultative decision-making processes and more collegial workplaces. Whilst this might represent a welcome shift towards less instrumental <b>management</b> <b>cultures,</b> the findings also strongly resonate with stereotypical images of women's traditional roles in Western culture – roles associated with the domestic sphere. Such perceptions have the potential to disadvantage women executives particularly if women accept that it is their role to manage these aspects of a culture – a scenario which could lead to the reproduction of a gender-based system of relations at the most senior levels in organisations. 19 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The term of post bureaucratic {{is used in}} two senses in the {{organizational}} literature: one generic and one much more specific. In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type bureaucracy. This may include total quality <b>management,</b> <b>culture</b> management and matrix management, amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies, rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{selected}} {{findings of a}} recent Australia-wide empirical study that investigated {{the impact of the}} presence of senior women executives on <b>management</b> <b>cultures.</b> The particular focus of this paper is the university sector. Our analysis of this sector revealed that both men and women clearly believed that the presence of women in senior roles had changed <b>management</b> <b>cultures.</b> We explore participants' descriptions of the nature of that change. Inherent to this discussion are notions of 'critical mass' and 'critical acts'. We define these notions and explore the influences that a critical mass of women in senior roles appears to have had on <b>management</b> <b>cultures</b> in the university sector. We found when women at senior levels reach a critical mass, both women and men believed that women encouraged greater collaboration, more consultative decision making processes and more collegial workplaces. Women were described as showing more 'emotional intelligence'. We consider why descriptions of the changes that women bring to senior management rely so heavily on stereotypical images of male and female behaviours and the implications this has particularly for women managers. 19 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|Scientific {{management}} {{was one of}} the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem. It may have been the first to do so in a [...] "bottom-up" [...] way and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. With the advancement of statistical methods, quality assurance and quality control began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into operations management, operations research, and management cybernetics. In the 1980s total quality management became widely popular, and in the 1990s [...] "re-engineering" [...] went from a simple word to a mystique. Today's Six Sigma and lean manufacturing could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their evolutionary distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, Shigeo Shingo, one of the originators of the Toyota Production System, believed that this system and Japanese <b>management</b> <b>culture</b> in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{implicit}} {{and indirect}} influence of classical science on strategic management {{has been of}} utmost importance {{in the development of}} the discipline. Classical science has underpinned the main and even contrasting strategic <b>management</b> <b>cultures.</b> Classical science has undoubtedly allowed strategic management to thrive. Nevertheless, important limitations, roadblocks and challenges have also been produced. This paper aims to explore the influence of classical science on the main positivist and interpretive strategic <b>management</b> <b>cultures.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual review is done on the influence of classical science on positivist and interpretivist traditions in strategic management. Findings: The benefits and shortcomings of classical science in strategic management are explored and presented. Furthermore, the convoluted implicit relationship between strategic management and science is shown to be changing but persisting, as to face some of the challenges of the classical science <b>culture</b> of strategic <b>management,</b> a complexity <b>culture,</b> also inspired partially on science, seems to be developing in strategic management. Complexity seems to be emerging as an alternative, which might allow strategic management to solve some of its current dilemmas and, thus, change its implicit relationship with science. Originality/value: The paper presents a novel way to conceptualize historical <b>cultures</b> of strategic <b>management</b> via their connection with academic cultures that have historically emerged from science. Through the analysis here done, a possible candidate for a Kuhninan normal strategic management and its potential revolution will be suggested, based on the recognition of the inheritance of classical science and currently complexity theory in strategic management...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 90 s, {{managers}} in Eastern Europe {{have had to}} adjust to the consequences of large scale re-structuring from a command to a market economy. Building on a previous paper accepted by the journal which examined shifts in HRM during transitional times, this study exaines the evolution of <b>management</b> <b>cultures</b> in one EE country- Romania. During the Communist period, Romania experienced a highly centralised and hierarchical system of economic management which tightly constrained the roles of the individual managers within it. At the enterprise level, the operational activities of managers were largely concerned with fulfilling the targets of planners laid down from above. Broader currents of historical and political culture also served to inculcate values of bureaucratic formalism and conformity among the cadres of managers. However, with the fall of Communism and fundamental system change (marketisation, privatisation etc), the post- command system forced managers to acquire new skills, knowledge and attitudes. As a consequence, it appears that the management role and identities are being re-defined and <b>management</b> <b>cultures</b> are changing. This article seeks to understand these cultural movements by examining management experience in a number of organisations- multi-national subsidiaries, state owned enterprises, public service organisations, charities and newly established companies- based in Romania...|$|R
