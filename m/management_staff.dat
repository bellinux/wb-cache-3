5|$|On November 2, 2016, {{concurrent}} {{with its}} earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp {{announced it would}} drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product <b>management</b> <b>staff.</b> Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.|$|E

He retired in October 1951, having reached the statutory age of 60. As a result of his military service, Mashbir received several medals including the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal (Silver Oak Leaf Cluster), Army of Occupation Medal, World War II Victory Medal, American Defense Service Medal and American Campaign Medal. He was also recommended to become an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Honorary) in 1946 by the Australian Governor-General, as was presented OBE insignia in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick ended some {{speculation}} about his international career by {{announcing that he}} would like to be considered for a place in the national side in the future. England's <b>management</b> <b>staff</b> continued to support him, and named him in the initial 25-man squad for the 2007 Test series against the West Indies. Having recovered from a double hernia operation, and proving himself fit for the start of the county season, Trescothick began his comeback to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against Devon on 8 April 2007, helping Somerset to 502–4 off their 50 overs.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} in the international collaborative strategy area has {{paid little attention to}} the matter of alliance staffing, limiting insight into conditions framing the adoption of alternative <b>management</b> <b>staffing</b> approaches. Following a thorough conceptualisation of staffing objectives and perspectives, this paper takes a theoretical approach to analyse the forces shaping managerial perspectives on international strategic alliance (ISA) top <b>management</b> <b>staffing,</b> drawing on a diverse range of literature and employing examples to provide illustrative grounding for our assertions. We suggest that risk perceptions are fundamental to parent firms' choice of staffing objectives, but are stimulated and tempered by other influences. Theory development on ISA <b>management</b> <b>staffing</b> is enhanced through the provision of a substantive, testable model along with a set of research propositions. The complex analytic focus of this study exposes important directions for research on the subject and offers guidelines for management practice. Furthermore, our typology of managerial decision perspectives provides a new tool for studying ISA staffing issues.

5|$|By May 1940, Castle Bromwich {{had not yet}} {{built its}} first Spitfire, in spite of {{promises}} that the factory would be producing 60 per week starting in April. On 17 May, Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook telephoned Lord Nuffield and manoeuvred him into handing {{over control of the}} Castle Bromwich plant to his Ministry. Beaverbrook immediately sent in experienced <b>management</b> <b>staff</b> and experienced workers from Supermarine and gave over control of the factory to Vickers-Armstrong. Although it would take some time to resolve the problems, in June 1940, 10 Mk IIs were built; 23 rolled out in July, 37 in August, and 56 in September. By the time production ended at Castle Bromwich in June 1945, a total of 12,129 Spitfires (921 Mk IIs, 4,489 Mk Vs, 5,665 Mk IXs, and 1,054 Mk XVIs) had been built. CBAF {{went on to become the}} largest and most successful plant of its type during the 1939–45 conflict. As the largest Spitfire factory in the UK, by producing a maximum of 320 aircraft per month, it built over half of the approximately 20,000 aircraft of this type.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 40 {{years of the}} tournament, Canada {{did not have a}} {{national}} team, instead choosing to send a club team, typically the Allan Cup winner. In 1960, the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen became the final club team to represent Canada at the Olympics. In 1962, Canada implemented a national team program, led by Father David Bauer. Between 1920 and 1952, seven Olympic ice hockey tournaments were held and Canada won six gold medals and a silver in 1936. The Soviet Union began competing in 1956 and frequently defeated the Canadian team. The Soviets won seven gold medals in nine tournaments; during that period Canada won a silver and two bronze medals. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. Many of Canada's top players were professional, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for the ability to use professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused, and Canada withdrew from the 1972 and 1976 Olympics in protest. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. The NHL decided not to allow all players to participate in 1988, 1992 or 1994, because doing so would force the league to halt play during the Olympics. An agreement was reached in 1995 that allowed NHL players to compete in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. National teams are co-ordinated by Hockey Canada and players are chosen by the team's <b>management</b> <b>staff.</b>|$|E

The first phase involved selecting, recruiting and training a skilled workforce and formulating rudimentary human resource policies. Cultural differences were most marked in this phase. The second phase, after three years of operation, involved evolution of human resource policies better suited to local conditions, and more polycentric <b>management</b> <b>staffing.</b> The final phase, after six years of operation, saw the development of a distinctive human resources system, and the minimisation of cultural differences as an operational issue.

The forms were judged by information completeness criteria "conformed" or "not conformed" with standards. Our analysis demonstrate that physicians often are unaware of legal and ethical topics related to constructing informed consent forms.
