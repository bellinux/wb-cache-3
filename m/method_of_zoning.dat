40|$|This {{research}} program {{is directed toward}} {{the understanding of the}} float zone crystal growth process, the melt interactions which lead to crystal inhomogeneities, and the influence of microgravity on reducing these inhomogeneities. Silicon was selected as the model crystal because its inhomogeneities lead to known variations in device performance, and because the mechanisms involved in its growth are understood better than for other high temperature crystals. The objective of the program is to understand the growth mechanisms in float zone growth and thereby determine the feasibility and advantages of float zone growth of silicon under microgravity conditions. This will be done by characterizing the growth at g = 1, projecting the changes in melt flows due to microgravity, observing these in space growth and determining the effects on defective inhomogeneities. A Thin Rod Zoner was constructed as a laboratory prototype for flight growth of 5 mm diameter silicon crystals, which can be done within the power and cooling capabilities of shuttle flights.

We have scrutinized the notion of distance and addressed it in correspondence with the notion of geodesic or optimum path. We present a new all-inclusive pathfinding algorithm for walking and cycling and show how this pathfinding algorithm {{can be used as a}} new basis for a number of conventional network indicators such as closeness and betweenness centrality measures -taking into account the physics of walking/cycling mobility as well as the cognitive aspect of human navigation. To this end, we revisit the meaning of distance and introduce a new notion of geodesic, which we call ‘easiest path’, i. e. a path that is reasonably short, flat and at the same time cognitively simple. Using this new geodesic, we reconstruct betweenness centrality indicator and introduce two new accessibility measures as ‘proximity to any’, ‘vicinity of all’ and a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>zoning</b> as to walking and cycling accessibility.

Landslide is an event which has different uncertain criteria such as altitude, slope, aspect, land use, vegetation density, precipitation, distance from the river and distance from the road network. This research aims to compare and evaluate different fuzzy-based models including Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP), Fuzzy Gamma and Fuzzy-OR. The main contribution of this paper reveals to the comprehensive criteria causing landslide hazard considering their uncertainties and comparison of different fuzzy-based models. The quantify of evaluation process are calculated by Density Ratio (DR) and Quality Sum (QS). The proposed methodology implemented in Sari, one of the city of Iran which has faced multiple landslide accidents in recent years due to the particular environmental conditions. The achieved results of accuracy assessment based on the quantifier strated that Fuzzy-AHP model has higher accuracy compared to other two models in landslide hazard zonation. Accuracy of zoning obtained from Fuzzy-AHP model is respectively 0. 92 and 0. 45 based on method Precision (P) and QS indicators. Based on obtained landslide hazard maps, Fuzzy-AHP, Fuzzy Gamma and Fuzzy-OR respectively cover 13, 26 and 35 percent of the study area with a very high risk level.

40|$|Since {{the water}} storage of the Three Gorges Reservoir (China) in June 2003, {{a number of}} new {{landslides}} occurred and existing landslides were reactivated over the slopes facing the reservoir. As a consequence, along with the process of immigration and development, landslides bring significant disadvantage to the reservoir and navigation and cause consequences to people’s life and property. Indeed, landslide susceptibility and hazard assessment is a fundamental step to properly manage the landslide risk, namely {{the most efficient way to}} reduce future damages and loss of lives caused by landslides. However, in China standard procedures for susceptibility and hazard zoning maps are currently lacking; this introduces a relevant constraint for risk mitigation measures.

Furthermore, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the detection <b>of</b> <b>ZON,</b> alpha-ZOL, beta-ZOL, alpha-zearalanol (alpha-ZAL) and beta-zearalanol (beta-ZAL) in in vitro biological samples. Zearalanone (ZAN) was used as internal standard in both <b>methods.</b> The limit <b>of</b> detection/limit of quantitation (LOD/LOQ) values <b>of</b> <b>ZON,</b> alpha-ZOL and beta-ZOL were 2 / 7, 2 / 7 and 4 / 13 mu g 1 (- 1), respectively, for the HPLC-FLD method. For the LC-MS/MS method LOD/LOQ values for ZON, alpha-ZOL, beta-ZOL, alpha-ZAL and beta-ZAL were 6 / 20, 5 / 17, 4 / 14, 9 / 30 and 6 / 19 mu g 1 (- 1), respectively. Within-day and between-day precision were less then 11 and 14 %, respectively for the HPLC-FLD method, and both less then 20 % for the LC-MS/MS <b>method.</b> The recovery <b>of</b> <b>ZON</b> and its metabolities ranged between 73 and 89 % for the HPLC-FLD method and between 69 and 112 % for the LC-MS/MS method.

The 8 -days post-confluent Caco- 2 cells were treated with ZON or a mixture <b>of</b> <b>ZON</b> and imazalil (IMA). After an incubation time of 24 h the samples were analyzed with the HPLC-FLD method. Neither ZON nor its derivatives were detected in the samples. The disappearance <b>of</b> <b>ZON</b> could possibly point out the formation of phase II metabolities like glucuronide conjugates. There, samples were pretreated with beta-glucuronidase before LC-MS/MS analysis.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} sited in Mukuru-Kwa-Njenga, a slum {{community}} in Nairobi, Kenya. Like many {{others around the}} world, this community faces issues of health, sanitation, mobility, and basic services. Through the investigation of these issues, a set of guidelines {{have been developed to}} help this slum community become a responsible and supportive environment that promotes participation from its residents, local governments, and the global population. After first acknowledging the complexity of the situation with regards to the formation and growth of slums, and the multi-layered problems that exist within them, the guidelines presented here are combined and herein named “Kijiji Kit”. “Kijiji” means “communal settlement” in Swahili. Hence, the Kijiji Kit is a resource tool for slum communities that can help build communal living environments for the urban poor. It consists <b>of</b> probable <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>zoning</b> processes (determined through site analysis), community infrastructure essentials (such as health care and educational facilities), and individual infrastructure systems (such as rainwater collection). It is not a physical entity but a long-term working model of the community operating on three scales: city, community, and individual. On a city scale, collaboration between governments, institutions, municipalities, public and private sectors, and the community is integral. The responsibilities of the state, specifically in terms of funding and policies, play a significant factor in strengthening urban slums. On a community scale, certain infrastructural systems and basic services are required, such as public transit, health care, and housing to ensure that proper support exists for the community to function effectively. Slum upgrading is one method that can begin helping communities develop resourcefully and independently. Finally, the individuals who form the community must be active participants in the processes that affect them. They must want change and be willing to put the time and dedication into the processes that will bring positive growth to their community. Based on the basic needs of the most vulnerable population – the orphans – the Kijiji Kit is a comprehensive and holistic approach to improving life in urban slums and calls for an overlapping of many disciplines, including architecture. Architecture is an essential component in developing and structuring communities. This thesis explores the social impact of architecture and how it can bring change to both the physical and social environment of slum communities...|$|R
40|$|Policies {{aimed at}} the {{alleviation}} of negative environmental impacts have increasingly been based on predictions made with models of the environmental systems involved. The usefulness of these models is limited by many uncertainties, e. g., is the complexity of a system properly reflected in the model structure and chosen aggregation-level? Is the data used in the model representative of the system? Is the temporal and spatial scale used in the model appropriate for understanding the system's behavior? The combination of these uncertainties may lead to unexpected results. This study identifies key factors determining watershed responses to acid deposition in different regions, using the RAINS Lake Acidification Model. The study aims at: [...] Providing a method for defining a region such that environmental policy directed at alleviating watershed acidification will become more suitable for the large scale management of surface water quality. [...] Depicting regional characteristics that allow for the usage of a less detailed and thus more aggregated model. [...] Providing an operational concept of critical loads for policy insight into watershed quality as a function <b>of</b> the spatial <b>zoning</b> <b>of</b> watersheds. The {{results of the study}} are: [...] The 5 -step <b>method</b> <b>of</b> flexible <b>zoning</b> introduced in this study, allows for a probabilistic investigation of the compatibility between models and available spatial data. [...] The calibration of models to previously defined regions may be of limited use for policy purposes because predictions of environmental effects (i. e., watershed acidification) as a result of changing deposition patterns over large regions may be error prone. [...] Cumulative distributions of model predictions about the acidification of watersheds should be used to assess critical and target loads for broad regions...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a calculation model for indoor air flows using the example of a car cabin whose temperature and velocity field are characterized by complex flow structures. For a simulation of these structures, the so-called zonal model approach offers the most reliable compromise in terms of real-time performance and the level of detail. The approach used in the work to model the enthalpy flows between individual zone requires knowledge of the current flow structures for different boundary conditions. Based on detailed CFD simulation of the air flow with different combinations of boundary conditions, the fluid transport between the individual zones is linked to the defining boundary conditions. The developed model consists of 24 zones. A simulation of the temperature distribution over the 24 zones results from a calculation of enthalpy flows between the zones, a consideration of transmission heat flows through the enclosure as well as the influence of solar radiation and long-wave radiation exchange between individual surfaces within the car cabin. The correlations between the boundary conditions and the resulting enthalpy flows between individual zones are {{based on the results of}} a limited number of detailed CFD simulations. The validity of the correlations in the zonal model is therefore limited to these cases, as well as to the dimensions of the geometry used. The model structure is developed in the programming language Modelica using the simulation environment Dymola. It allows an easy expansion with other combinations of boundary conditions and different geometries of car cabins. This text provides an introduction to the relations of thermal comfort and vehicle air conditioning against the background of gradual electrification of the powertrain. Starting with the growing importance of modeling in the automotive industry to compare climate control concepts, different approaches of modelling room air flows are presented. After an overview of existing approaches of zonal models, the parametric description based on CFD simulations is explained and different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>zoning</b> or identifying characteristic structures in a velocity field are presented.

A validation is performed for a variety of different heating and cooling cases (chapter eight).
