500|$|The Word for World is Forest {{shares the}} theme of dreaming with the later Le Guin novel The Lathe of Heaven. Suzanne Reid stated that the novel {{examines}} the source and effect of dreams. The Athsheans teach themselves to consciously and actively control their dreams. This allows them to access their subconscious {{in a way that}} the Terrans are not able. The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which makes it impossible for them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well. [...] The visions they see while dreaming direct and shape their waking behavior, which Selver describes as [...] "balanc your sanity... on the double support, the fine balance, of reason and dream; once you have learned that, you cannot unlearn it any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> unlearn to think." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1958 Comecon {{had begun}} to push for what was later termed an [...] "international socialist {{division}} of labor," [...] in which Albania was relegated to [...] "the task of supplying the member states with agricultural and mineral raw materials." [...] In May 1959 Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} Albania with the aim of pressuring Albania's leadership into building up Yugoslav–Albanian and Soviet–Albanian ties and also to, in the words of historian Miranda Vickers, [...] "focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization and the expansion of their oil industry... Khrushchev's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust, which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled." [...] According to Hoxha, Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in Butrint and said to Rodion Malinovsky, the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him, [...] "Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These old things [...] should be dug up and thrown into the sea... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean. From here we can paralyze and attack everything." [...] He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country [...] "into a flourishing garden," [...] suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists, and that rather than produce grain, Albania should focus on growing oranges for export. Khrushchev allegedly said, [...] "The Soviet Union has such an abundance of grain that the mice eat <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> produce here." ...|$|E

2500|$|The state's $22 {{million budget}} surplus {{disappeared}} during Craig's term, {{in large part}} though due to the Korean War bonus paid out to soldiers to enlist that the assembly authorized over Craig's veto. Craig was quoted as saying, [...] "you can't put a bonus on patriotism any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> on motherhood." [...] The bonus cost the state $7.6 million. The rest of the surplus was spent on school consolidation as one room schoolhouses were phased out and students bused to larger centralized facilities.|$|E
2500|$|The New Republic writer James Kirchick {{accused the}} network of [...] "often virulent anti-Americanism, worshipful {{portrayal}} of Russian leaders." [...] Edward Lucas wrote in The Economist (quoted in Al Jazeera English) that the core of RT was [...] "anti-Westernism." [...] Julia Ioffe wrote [...] "Often, it seemed that Russia Today was {{just a way to}} stick it to the U.S. from behind the façade of legitimate newsgathering." [...] Shaun Walker wrote in The Independent that RT [...] "has made a name for itself as a strident critic of US policy." [...] Allesandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times that RT is [...] "like the Voice of America, only with more money and a zesty anti-American slant." [...] David Weigel writes that RT goes further than merely creating distrust of the United States government, to saying, in effect: [...] "You can trust the Russians <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> trust those bastards." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the war he}} {{went into}} {{business}} with a new schooner, the Friends Hope. While in New Orleans he heard from the Spanish expedition under General Pablo Morillo, and wanting {{to take advantage of}} trade restrictions in the area, went to Cartagena de Indias, Viceroyalty of New Granada, to smuggle. Arriving in Cartagena in December 1815 he was fooled by the Patriot flag flying and not seeing anything suspicious looking, entered port, where they were captured by Spanish forces. The ship and its cargo were confiscated and Almeida and his men were stripped, brutally beaten with rifle butts and locked in a dank prison until his transfer to Cartagena, which Almeida called [...] "the most painful march, during which we suffered <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> describe." [...] The prisoners, including the battered crew, were forced to march 140 miles barefoot from Cartagena to Santa Marta, Colombia, during which several of the men died.|$|E

2500|$|Trump 101: The Way to Success {{is a book}} imparting {{advice and}} {{motivation}} from the authors about Trump's business acumen. The book is split into approximately twenty sets of aspirational genres, including: advising the reader to strive to better themselves, recognizing the right business opportunities when they come along, trying new things, the art of negotiation, how to gain wisdom from one's intuition, learning from failures, maintaining a sense of motivation, keeping lofty goals, and dropping efforts which do not give one passion. The authors caution about the element of risk during investing, [...] "Frequently, the risk will be well worth the gamble, but sometimes it will be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford". The book advises to deal with conflict prior to issues developing into larger problems. Readers are told they should practice taking onus for oneself for difficulties quickly after they ensue. The work criticizes those who constantly blame others for their problems.|$|E
