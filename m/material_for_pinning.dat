40|$|Joints are {{primary sources}} of {{weakness}} in structures. Pin joints are very common {{and are used}} where periodic disassembly of components is needed. A circular pin in a circular hole in an infinitely large plate is an abstraction of such a pin joint. A two-dimensional plane-stress analysis of such a configuration is carried out, here, subjected to pin-bearing and/or biaxial-plate loading. The pin {{is assumed to be}} rigid compared to the plate <b>material.</b> <b>For</b> <b>pin</b> load the reactive stresses {{at the edges of the}} infinite plate tend to zero though their integral over the external boundary equals to the pin load. The pin-hole interface is unbonded and so beyond some load levels the plate separates from the pin and the extent of separation is a non-linear function of load level. The problem is solved by inverse technique where the extent of contact is specified and the causative loads are evaluated directly. In the situations where combined load is acting the separation-contact zone specification generally needs two parameters (angles) to be specified. The present report deals with analysing such a situation in metallic (or isotropic) plates. Numerical results are provided for parametric representation and the methodology is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} joining {{two pieces of}} metal {{together}} has not significantly changed {{over the last few}} decades. The basic idea used is to bring the pieces together and apply enough heat to melt the metal at the interface. The molten metal mixes and after cooling forms a strong joint. This process is called the fusion process. The most significant difference between the many fusion processes is how the heat is generated and applied. The Welding Institute (TWI), in Great Britain, has recently patented an innovative application of mechanical friction. TWI designed a tool and process called Friction Stir Welding (FSW) that uses friction to heat the metal to within a few hundred degrees Fahrenheit of melting, just {{to the point of being}} plastic-like. The tool then stirs the plasticized metal together forming a joint that has been shown to be as good or better than an equivalent fusion joint. The FSW process is well suited for the joining of the aluminum alloys used in the aerospace industry. The relatively low melting point of aluminum eliminates the requirements <b>for</b> exotic <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>pin</b> tool design. The FSW process has been successfully used to join alloys such as 7075 which were before considered "unweldable", and aluminum-lithium 2195 which exhibits many problems when fusion welded. The objective this summer was to investigate the design of a FSW system that could take this process from the laboratory to the manufacturing floor. In particular, it was the goal of my NASA colleague to develop a concept for applying the FSW process to the manufacturing of aluminum cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen tanks, of the sort used to make the Shuttle External Tank...|$|R
40|$|A quite speared {{methodology}} of restoration envisages {{the introduction of}} new timber elements, connected to the standing structure. An efficient alternative to the most used jointing technologies, which employ metallic bolted plates, steel pins, or epoxy resin adhesives, is the use of timber pins. The design rules <b>for</b> <b>pinned</b> joints given by Eurocode 5 are based on Johansen’s theory. The present research has the target of verifying the applicability of this theoretical model, and of the derived practical formulas, to the case of timber pegs. At this aim an experimental research has been done, and obtained results have been compared with theoretical ones, showing as the different nature of the <b>material</b> employed <b>for</b> the <b>pins</b> needs more specific evaluations of the “yielding moment” and of the failure mode in case of low slenderness.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} applied interfacial electrical potentials and friction and abrasion for steel/steel contacts in alkaline aqueous-based solutions. The potential at a steel-aqueous lubricated surface is important since it determines {{a number of important}} surface properties which influence the overall friction and resistance to abrasion. The experimental approach used a pin-on-disc rig incorporating potentiostatic control of the disc between ? 1. 0 and + 1. 0 V overpotential. Tests employed a load of 50 N at a sliding speed of 0. 03 ms? 1. EN 24 grade steel, equivalent to AISI 4340, was used as the <b>material</b> <b>for</b> the <b>pin</b> and disc. Tests were conducted in electrolyte that contained electroactive species, namely octanoate ions, which could be “switched on” to the surface. Coefficient of friction measurements were carried out throughout testing and later linked to potential or current density behaviour to assess the mechanical and electrochemical interactions and its effect on wear and friction. The effects of lubricity of the adsorbed layers are discussed and used to explain the performance...|$|R
40|$|Ferritic-martensitic Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) steels are {{potential}} <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> fuel <b>pin</b> cladding in Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR) and their optimisation {{is essential for}} future industrial applications. In this paper, a feasibility study concerning the generation of tensile specimens using a quenching dilatometer is presented. The ODS steel investigated contains 9 %Cr and exhibits a phase transformation between ferrite and austenite around 870 [*]°C. The purpose was to generate different microstructures and to evaluate their tensile properties. Specimens were machined from a cladding tube and underwent controlled heat treatments inside the dilatometer. The microstructures were observed using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and tensile tests were performed at room temperature and at 650 [*]°C. Results show that a tempered martensitic structure is the optimum state for tensile loading at room temperature. At 650 [*]°C, the strengthening mechanisms that are involved differ and the microstructures exhibit more similar yield strengths. It also appeared that decarburisation during heat treatment in the dilatometer induces {{a decrease in the}} mechanical properties and heterogeneities in the dual-phase microstructure. This has been addressed by proposing a treatment with a much shorter time in the austenitic domain. Thereafter, the relaxation of macroscopic residual stresses inside the tube during the heat treatment was evaluated. They appear to decrease linearly with increasing temperature and the phase transformation has a limited effect on the relaxation...|$|R
40|$|A {{design for}} the {{fail-safe}} mechanism of a guide vane in a Francis-type hydro turbine is proposed and analyzed. The mechanism {{that is based on}} a shear pin as a sacrificial component was designed to remain simple. Unlike the requirements of conventional designs, a shear pin must be able to withstand static and dynamic loads but must fail under a certain overload that could damage a guide vane. An accurate load determination and selection of the shear pin material were demonstrated. The static load for various opening angles of the guide vane were calculated using the computational fluid dynamics Fluent and finite element method Ansys programs. Furthermore, simulations for overload and dynamic load due to the waterhammer phenomenon were also conducted. The results of load calculations were used to select an appropriate shear pin material. Quasi-static shear tests were performed <b>for</b> two shear <b>pins</b> of aluminum alloy Al 2024 subjected to different aging treatments (i. e. artificial and natural aging). The test results indicated that the Al 2024 treated by natural aging is an appropriate <b>material</b> <b>for</b> a shear <b>pin</b> designed to function as a fail-safe mechanism for the guide vanes of a Francis-type hydro turbine...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{vegetable}} oil-based lubricant as a lubricant in various applications has increased {{and it is}} eyed by the industry due to its superior tribological properties, besides possessing the potential to replace petroleum-based lubricants. Palm olein is one of alternative lubricants that could be suitable and attractive as a lubricant to be studied due to its advantages and large production in the country. Thus, in this study, the behavior of palm olein characteristics was investigated by using pin-on-disc experiment, in which a hemispherical pin was loaded against the rotating grooved disc. The experiments via sliding were performed with pin-on-disc tester using pure aluminum as the <b>material</b> <b>for</b> hemispherical <b>pin</b> and SKD 11 for disc. The test was implemented by dropping continuous flow of palm olein as lubricating oil on sliding surface at different loads applied, which were 10 N, 50 N, and 100 N. The wear rate of the pin and the friction coefficient were also investigated. Moreover, the surface roughness {{before and after the}} experiment was analyzed as well. All the results obtained were compared to hydraulic oil and engine oil- SAE 40. From the analysis, the friction coefficient acquired from lubricated with palm olein was the lowest for both conditions. The wear rate obtained for the three lubricants increased from 10 N to 100 N load for palm oil, but decreased for hydraulic and engine oil-SAE 40. Meanwhile, the wear rate obtained for lubrication with hydraulic oil showed the lowest value compared to Engine oil-SAE 40 and double fractionated palm olei...|$|R
