[...] Scott Schetler from AOL Radio Blog noted how Diddy referenced a different popular song in each verse. Lamb particularly noted the strong autobiographical lyrics, and the references to the 1979 hit song [...] "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now" [...] by McFadden & Whitehead. Other songs referenced include Dionne Warwick's [...] "A House Is Not a Home" [...] (1964) and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles' [...] "The Tears of a Clown" [...] (1970).

I would like to show my deep appreciation to her guidance, support, encouragement and immediate help in many aspects, during my graduate studies. Especially, I appreciate her detailed eye for creating engaging presentations and well-written papers, and these two skills are always essential. I {{would also like to thank}} my thesis committee members, Prof. Cherie R. Kagan, Prof. Nader Engheta, and Prof. Roger H. French for their critical review of my research proposal and I appreciate the time, attention and efforts they gave me. I am very grateful for the opportunities working with many excellent scientists. ...|$|R

6000|$|Our {{family history}} is a strange one. I, Lucy Alison, never even saw <b>my</b> <b>twin</b> brothers--nor, indeed, knew of their existence--during my childhood. I had one brother a year younger than myself, {{and as long as}} he lived he was treated as the eldest son, and neither he nor I ever dreamed that my father had had a first wife and two sons. He was a feeble, broken man, who seemed to my young fancy so old that in after times it was always a shock to me to read on his tablet, [...] "Percy Alison, aged fifty-seven;" [...] and I was but seven years old when he died under the final blow of the loss of my little brother Percy from measles.|$|E

[...] And she stood with a hand on each, proud that their heads were so far above her own, and looking still so slight and girlish in figure that she might better have been their sister than their mother. The cloud that the sudden light had revealed on Ebbo's brow had cleared away, and he made an inclination neither awkward nor ungracious in its free mountain dignity and grace, but not devoid of mountain rusticity and shy pride, and far less cordial than was Friedel's manner. Both were infinitely relieved to detect nothing of the greasy burgher, and were greatly struck with the fine venerable head before them; indeed, Friedel would, like his mother, have knelt to ask a blessing, {{had he not been}} under command not to outrun his brother's advances towards her kindred.|$|R
