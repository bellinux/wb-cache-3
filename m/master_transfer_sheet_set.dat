40|$|Multifunction Vehicle Bus (MVB) is a {{critical}} component in the Train Communication Network (TCN), which is widely used {{in most of the}} modern train techniques of the transportation system. How to ensure security of MVB has become an important issue. Traditional testing could not ensure the system correctness. The MVB system modeling and verification are concerned in this paper. Petri Net and model checking methods are used to verify the MVB system. A Hierarchy Colored Petri Net (HCPN) approach is presented to model and simulate the <b>Master</b> <b>Transfer</b> protocol of MVB. Synchronous and asynchronous methods are proposed to describe the entities and communication environment. Automata model of the <b>Master</b> <b>Transfer</b> protocol is designed. Based on our model checking platform M 3 C, the <b>Master</b> <b>Transfer</b> protocol of the MVB is verified and some system logic critical errors are found.

In this paper, we propose a new method of decomposing the solid model into the block structure based on sheet operations, which can guarantee {{the validity of the}} resultant block structure. The method firstly generates an initial hex mesh of the given solid model based on its tet mesh. Then, it inserts a number of global sheets on the boundary and inside the volume respectively by sheet inflation to make the hex mesh capture the geometry of the solid model. Finally our method determines the optimal <b>sheet</b> <b>set</b> that can be extracted based on quality prediction and extracts the <b>sheet</b> <b>set</b> as a whole to get the reasonable and valid block structure of the solid model.
