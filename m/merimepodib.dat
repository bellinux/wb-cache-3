40|$|Nucleos(t) ide analogues {{have proven}} {{useful in the}} {{treatment}} of viral infections. Ribavirin is a nucleoside, guanosine analogue, whose mechanisms of action include inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehy-drogenase (IMPDH), which is the key step in de novo guanine synthesis, a requirement for viral replication. In combination with pegylated interferon alfa, ribavirin is the standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C today. However, the medication is associated with significant haemolytic anaemia, which may require dose reduction, discontinuation or treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin. Dose reduc-tion also appears to decrease sustained viral clearance rates. Newer IMPDH inhibitors are in various stages of development. Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has demonstrated significant antiviral activity and erythrocyte-sparing properties. It is currently in Phase 3 trials. Clinical trials of <b>merimepodib,</b> another investigational IMPDH inhibitor, have completed enrolment for a Phase 2 b study as a third medication for administration with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Although other IMDPH inhibitors also have antiviral activity, these medications appear best suited as immunosuppressive medications at this time...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, due to {{the lack}} of an {{effective}} cell culture system for the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the design of novel therapeutic agents was difficult. The recent progress in the molecular virology of HCV has created the appropriate conditions for the development of in vitro viral replication systems and has led to research that was previously impossible. The first viral replication systems (replicons) were subgenomic, while currently full-length replicons are available. A full-length HCV genome that replicates and produces virus particles that are infectious in cell culture (HCVcc) has allowed the study of the natural characteristics of HCV. Up until the present, recombinant Interferon (IFN) a- 2 a, a- 2 b and pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alone or in combination with ribavirin have been the only approved available treatments. Serious side-effects and low efficacy of the current treatments, along with high prevalence of the infection worldwide mandate that new therapeutic agents need to be developed. NS 3 protease, responsible for the release of non-structural viral proteins, and RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) of NS 5 B are potential targets. Apart from the NS protease inhibitors other compounds play a significant rote in the treatment of HCV infection, among which cyclosporin A, albuferon, <b>merimepodib</b> or VX- 497, viramidin, arsenic trioxide (ATO), sodium stibogluconate (SSG) and interleukins 28 (IL- 28) and 29 (IL- 29) are examples...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: While {{combination}} of peginterferon-alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy {{is the current}} standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC), only 44 - 51 % of genotype- 1 patients achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), and both agents produce treatment-limiting toxicities. In the hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon system, <b>merimepodib</b> (MMPD), a novel, selective inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, has shown potent antiviral effects. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated the safety and antiviral activity of PEG-IFN-alpha 2 b and RBV combined with either placebo, 25 mg MMPD every 12 h (q 12 h), or 50 mg MMPD q 12 h in interferon-alpha (IFN) and RBV nonresponders. After 24 weeks of treatment, subjects with undetectable HCV RNA were proposed to continue assigned treatment for up to 24 additional weeks. RESULTS: The PEG-IFN-alpha, RBV, and MMPD combination was well tolerated at both doses. After 24 weeks, the proportion of HCV RNA undetectable subjects was 8 / 11 (73 %) in the 50 -mg MMPD group, 2 / 10 (20 %) in the 25 -mg MMPD group, and 3 / 10 (30 %) {{in the placebo group}} (P= 0. 02, Jonckheere-Terpstra test for increasing dose response). Ten subjects entered and completed an extension study, at Week 48, 2 of 2 (100 %) of the 25 -mg and 3 of 5 (60 %) of the 50 -mg subjects remained HCV RNA undetectable, compared with 3 of 3 (100 %) of the placebo subjects. At Follow-up Week 24, 2 (100 %) of the 25 -mg, and 1 (25 %) of the 50 -mg subjects remained undetectable, compared with 1 (33 %) of the placebo subjects. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses showed a correlation between MMPD exposure and early virological response at week 12, but not with hemoglobin decreases often associated with RBV. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, PEG-IFN-alpha 2 b and RBV combined with 50 mg MMPD q 12 h was well tolerated and induced virological response with undetectable HCV RNA in IFN-alpha and RBV nonresponders. status: publishe...|$|E
