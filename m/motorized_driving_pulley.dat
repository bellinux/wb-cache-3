30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, ratchet wheel 1 and <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 4 work to drive the <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between <b>pulley</b> 2 and <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 4 is maintained by ratchet wheel 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, ratchet wheel 2 and <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 5 work to drive the <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> 5 through ratchet wheel 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two ratchet wheels ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type wave power system, which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the float}} trajectory {{differs from that}} of the wave, owing to its self-oscillation. When <b>driving</b> <b>pulleys</b> rotate the SRG, the WEC completes the energy absorption process, and transfers the captured mechanical energy into SRG. In the next phase, the absolute value of the float velocity decreases and the transferred energy should be released. So, on the one hand, electrical energy would be generated. On the other hand, the WEC can recapture the wave energy, once the SRG rotor is pulled to rotate with increasing velocity. If the float velocity is equal to zero at this time point, the largest amount of electrical energy can be converted and transmitted to the power grid or loads.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft <b>pulley.</b> This <b>driving</b> <b>pulley</b> is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a rubber ring and an inertia steel ring with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models.

The model shows that when an appropriate quantitative and qualitative level of local heterogeneity is achieved, the oscillation mode {{of the belt}} starts to change, and the belt tensile force developing due to deformation of the belt significantly increases. Another V-belt drive dynamic model was developed based on the finite element model (FEM) analysis.

40|$|Serpentine {{belt drive}} systems {{are widely used}} in {{automobiles}} due to their compactness and long life. These systems are composed of a belt, a <b>driving</b> <b>pulley,</b> driven pulleys, and a spring-loaded tensioner. The driven pulleys may include such accessories as the alternator, air conditioner, or power steering pump. Serpentine belt drives experience {{many different types of}} steady state motions and transient vibrations due to the different parameters in the system. As a result of this, it is important to create a mathematical model that allows the designer to extract information about the system such as the natural frequency and the mode shapes. The accuracy of the model will depend primarily on the assumptions used. In particular, a key assumption is whether transverse and rotational motions of the belt are coupled due to the motion of the automatic belt tensioner. This coupling is often neglected by authors who model only longitudinal belt response and in effect decouple the transverse and rotational motions. Using a solution based upon coupled motion as well as a solution employing rotational motion only, the importance of this coupling will be assessed. Both solution results will be compared against published experimental data.

50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, <b>driving</b> <b>pulleys,</b> driven directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar driven pulleys, connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the driven pulleys were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the drive pulleys expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|R

5000|$|The concentrating {{machine for}} slimes, which has {{hitherto}} {{been a great}} favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and revolving cast-iron heads, shafting, bevel wheels, and <b>driving</b> <b>pulleys,</b> are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head the liquid stream, which {{should be in a}} uniform thin film, falls {{over the edge of the}} fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical line of holes, and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is stopped, a groove is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no clean products can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.|$|R
