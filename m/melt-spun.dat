The alloy was <b>melt-spun</b> in various temperatures. Morphology and chemical composition of the cross-section of the ingot and <b>melt-spun</b> ribbons were analysed with scanning electron microscope SEM with energy dispersive spectrometer EDS. The <b>melt-spun</b> ribbon was investigated by means of the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The melting range of the alloy was investigated by means of differential thermal analysis at the heating rate 20 K/min. Findings: The slow cooling rate resulted in the fractal-like structures formed by the Fe-rich regions andCu-rich regions typical for the alloying system with a miscibility gap. The structures observed after rapid cooling were dependent on ejection temperatures of the alloy just before the melt spinning process. The lower ejection temperatures {{led to the formation of}} crystalline structures separated into Fe-rich and Cu-rich regions which were a result of rapid cooling within the miscibility gap. The higher ejection temperatures contributed to formation of amorphous/crystalline composite. The crystalline spherical precipitates were found to be predominantlyCu-base solid solution. Research limitations/implications: It has been shown that the multi-component Fe-Ni-Cu-P-Si-B alloy provides possibility of microstructure control of amorphous/crystalline composite due to miscibility gap. Practical implications: The work reports that the ductile phase can be introduced into the amorphous alloy by using a suitable ejection temperature control in a melt spinning process, providing possibility of controlling properties in glassy matrix alloys.

40|$|Giant {{magnetostriction}} {{is achieved}} in the slightly Tb-doped Fe 83 Ga 17 <b>melt-spun</b> ribbons. The tested average perpendicular magnetostriction is - 886 ppm along the <b>melt-spun</b> ribbon direction in the Fe 82. 89 Ga 16. 88 Tb 0. 23 alloy. The calculated parallel magnetostriction is 1772 ppm, more than 4 times as large as that of binary Fe 83 Ga 17 alloy. The enhanced magnetostriction should {{be attributed to a}} small amount of Tb solution into the A 2 matrix phase during rapid solidification. The localized strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy of Tb element is suggested to cause the giant magnetostriction. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Nanoembedded lead-tin alloys in {{aluminum}} matrix were synthesized by rapid solidification processing. These <b>melt-spun</b> aluminum alloys were then investigated using XRD, EDX and TEM. The XRD study {{reveals that the}} <b>melt-spun</b> samples contain elemental aluminum, lead and tin. The TEM analysis shows that embedded particles in aluminium matrix have a distinct two-phase contrast of lead and tin. The lead and tin in these nanoalloys exhibit an orientation relationship with the matrix aluminum and with each other. DSC studies were conducted to reveal the melting and solidification characteristics of these embedded nanoalloys. DSC thermograms exhibit features of multiple solidification exotherms on thermal cycling, which {{can be attributed to}} sequential melting and solidification of lead and tin in the respective alloys...|$|E
