50|$|In {{the same}} gude Alan {{accurately}} predicted trends for the future. For example {{he pointed out}} that a number of overseas sites were providing <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> hook-ups and suggested that British caravanners and motor caravanners should take advantage of this by having their units wired to take <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b> In 1968 no standard British caravan was supplied with <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> wiring.The Alan Rogers series of guides continued to expand until 1986 when Alan decided to seek retirement. The eventual purchasers of the Guides publishing company Deneway Guides and Travel Ltd were Clive and Lois Edwards.|$|R

50|$|The guides {{have been}} {{influential}} in the rise in popularity of camping; for example, drawing attention {{to the number of}} overseas sites that were providing <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> hook-ups.

5000|$|Such {{generator}} sets {{were also used}} in industrial complexes and public buildings- anywhere where electricity was required but <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> was not available.|$|R
25|$|In a <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> (AC power) wiring installation, {{the term}} ground {{conductor}} typically refers to three different conductors or conductor systems as listed below.|$|R
50|$|Electric kettles were {{introduced}} {{as a means}} to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. They are normally constructed of durable plastic or steel (with a plastic handle) and powered by <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b> In modern kettles, the heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2-3 kW at 220V. In countries with 110V <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> kettles may be less powerful (1-1.5 kW) to avoid drawing too much current and requiring a very thick supply wire.|$|R
50|$|The wooden tower stands 26 ft {{high and}} 190 ft above sea level. The light flashes on for 6 seconds {{and off for}} 6 seconds, and can be seen for 10 nmi km. The {{light-emitting}} diode beacon is supplied by <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> with a battery for standby power. The original lens operated with a 1000-watt lamp supplied by <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> with a diesel generator for standby power. It can still {{be seen in the}} lantern room {{at the top of the}} tower.|$|R
50|$|The current {{light source}} is a 35,000 cd 120 Volt 1000 Watt Tungsten-halogen bulb, fed from the <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> with a diesel {{generator}} for backup.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common name}} for <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> in North America, despite the nominal voltage {{actually}} being 120 V (range 110-120 V). Normally spoken as [...] "one-ten".|$|R
50|$|About 50% of the {{population}} in village does not have <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> supply.There is a post office named 'Kayempur Post Office' with a post code of 5230.|$|R
50|$|The Edison {{screw socket}} {{was used as}} an outlet (such as for toasters) when <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> was still mainly used for lighting, and before wall outlets became common.|$|R
50|$|Other {{improvements}} made to {{the site}} by Electric Railway Museum in late 2009 include the provision of <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> on site and {{state of the art}} CCTV equipment.|$|R
50|$|There is no <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> {{available}} on the island, all dwellings are therefore off-the-grid, relying on generators, oil lamps and renewable power sources such as solar and wind.|$|R
50|$|On 19 December 2008 National Grid plc {{connected}} {{it to the}} UK national electricity power grid, {{making it}} the last village in Wales to be supplied with <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|R
50|$|Battery-powered {{equipment}} {{connected to}} <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> {{can be kept}} fully charged although switched on; for example, a mobile telephone can be ready to receive calls without depleting its battery charge.|$|R
50|$|The Quarff {{water supply}} {{is from the}} Sandy Loch {{reservoir}} at Lerwick. There is currently no mains drainage in Quarff; each property has its own septic tank. The village has <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1969 {{the light}} was {{electrified}} and connected to <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> with a 120 V battery bank as backup. The current light source is a 120 V, 1000 W, quartz halogen lamp.|$|R
50|$|On {{the input}} coils, the taps are usually {{connected}} by switches {{to compensate for}} differing supply potential - for example, between 110 V and 230 V for American and European <b>mains</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{power house}} located under the west tower {{contains}} an electrical generator driven by water leaving the reservoir. Before <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> {{arrived in the}} 1960s this was the area's only source of power.|$|R
50|$|In 1893 Cote {{suffered}} a diphtheria epidemic {{that may have}} been caused by contaminated wells. Cote had a mains gas supply by 1939, <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> by 1949 and mains water from about 1967.|$|R
50|$|Most {{stations}} use <b>mains</b> <b>electricity,</b> {{but they}} also have standby generators or solar energy panels in case of failure. If the voltage of the mains fluctuates, a high power voltage regulator may be used.|$|R
50|$|Diesel rotary {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} devices (DRUPS) combine the functionality of a battery-powered or flywheel-powered UPS and a diesel generator. When <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> supply is within specification, an electrical generator with a mass functions as motor to store kinetic energy in an electro-mechanical flywheel. In combination with a reactor or choke coil, the electrical generator also works as active filter {{for all sorts of}} power quality problems, like harmonics, RFI, and frequency variations. When <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> supply fails, stored energy in the flywheel is released to drive the electrical generator, which continues to supply power without interruption. At the same time (or with some delay, for example 2 to 11 seconds, to prevent the diesel engine from starting at every incident), the diesel engine takes over from the flywheel to drive the electrical generator to make the electricity required. The electro-magnetic flywheel can continue to support the diesel generator in order to keep a stable output frequency. Typically a DRUPS will have enough fuel to power the load for days or even weeks in the event of failure of the <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> supply.|$|R
50|$|Unlike a corded telephone, a {{cordless}} telephone needs <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> {{to power the}} base station. The cordless handset {{is powered by a}} rechargeable battery, which is charged when the handset is stored in its cradle.|$|R
50|$|In January 2011 it was {{announced}} {{that there would be no}} permanent ranger. Wirral Council said that they had had difficulty finding a ranger prepared to live without <b>mains</b> <b>electricity</b> or running water on the island.|$|R
