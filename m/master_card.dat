2500|$|Following Russia's unrecognized {{annexation}} of Crimea, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, {{and several other}} countries (including Ukraine) imposed economic sanctions against Russia, including some specifically targeting Crimea. [...] Many of these sanctions were directed at individuals—both Russian and Crimean. In general they prohibit the sale, supply, transfer, or export of goods and technology in several sectors, including services directly related to tourism and infrastructure. They list seven ports where cruise ships cannot dock. Sanctions against individuals include travel bans and asset freezes. Visa and MasterCard stopped service in Crimea in December 2014. To get around this, a new Russian national payment card system started on 1 April 2015, which allowed Visa and MasterCard cards issued by Russian banks {{to work in the}} Crimea. The Mir (payment system) [...] operated by the Central Bank of Russia is now functioning [...] as well as <b>Master</b> <b>Card</b> and Visa. However, there are no major international banks in the Crimea.|$|E
2500|$|In her view, {{two-thirds of}} this {{evaluation}} {{is based on}} tests, while only one third is based on grades, leading her to conclude {{at one point that}} grades were less important overall as a factor than test scores, while in a different chapter she also suggested that the high school transcript information described roughly 60% of the college's perception of a student's academic performance. Next, the composite academic index score was combined with an analysis of personal factors such as extracurricular activity or the essay, such that the academic factor was weighted 70% to 85% while the personal evaluation was weighted only 30% to 15%. Generally the particulars of the mathematical formulas are not revealed to the public, and different colleges have different formulas. Part of the purpose of algorithms is to expedite the handling of thousands of applications in a short amount of time. For example, at Dartmouth College, data goes into a <b>master</b> <b>card</b> for each application, which leads to a ready sheet, where readers summarize applications; then, an initial screening is done: top applications go directly to the director of admissions for approval while lackluster ones go to another director. Dartmouth uses [...] "A" [...] for accept, [...] "R" [...] for reject, [...] "P" [...] for possible, with [...] "P+" [...] and [...] "P-" [...] being variants. A committee might spend a week with the [...] "P" [...] ones, of which they only accept about a sixth, according to Hernandez.|$|E
60|$|By February 20th the British had firmly {{established}} themselves along the whole south {{bank of the}} river, Hart's brigade had occupied Colenso, and the heavy guns had been pushed up to more advanced positions. The crossing of the river was the next operation, and the question arose {{where it should be}} crossed. The wisdom which comes with experience shows us now {{that it would have been}} infinitely better to have crossed on their extreme left flank, as by an advance upon this line we should have turned their strong Pieters position just as we had already turned their Colenso one. With an absolutely <b>master</b> <b>card</b> in our hand we refused to play it, and won the game by a more tedious and perilous process. The assumption seems to have been made (on no other hypothesis can one understand the facts) that the enemy were demoralised and that the positions would not be strongly held. Our flanking advantage was abandoned and a direct advance was ordered from Colenso, involving a frontal attack upon the Pieters position.|$|E

50|$|In addition, Torg used {{an unusual}} card based system to augment gameplay. From Torg's unique Drama Deck, a hand of cards were dealt to each player at the {{beginning}} of the game. The rest were stacked in front of the game <b>master.</b> <b>Cards</b> could be used by both players and game masters to influence play. Whenever a combat encounter began the game master would flip over a card which would dictate certain advantages and disadvantages for the players and the NPCs. Players could also use cards to give themselves advantages or even plotlines which could result in extra points.|$|R
50|$|In {{its basic}} form, a tabulating machine would read one card at a time, print {{portions}} (fields) {{of the card}} on fan-fold paper, possibly rearranged, and add one or more numbers punched on the card {{to one or more}} counters, called accumulators. On early models, the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals. Later models could print totals directly. Cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior. For example, customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased. When read by the tabulating machine to create invoices, the billing address and customer number would be printed from the <b>master</b> <b>card,</b> and then individual items purchased and their price would be printed. When the next <b>master</b> <b>card</b> was detected, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected {{to the top of the}} next page, typically using a carriage control tape.|$|E
5000|$|CrossFire {{was first}} made {{available}} to the public on September 27, 2005. The system required a CrossFire-compliant motherboard with a pair of ATI Radeon PCI Express (PCIe) graphics cards. Radeon x800s, x850s, x1800s and x1900s came in a regular edition, and a [...] "CrossFire Edition" [...] which has [...] "master" [...] capability built into the hardware. [...] "Master" [...] capability is a term used for 5 extra image compositing chips, which combine the output of both cards. One had to buy a <b>Master</b> <b>card,</b> and pair it with a regular card from the same series. The <b>Master</b> <b>card</b> shipped with a proprietary DVI Y-dongle, which plugged into the primary DVI ports on both cards, and into the monitor cable. This dongle serves as the main link between both cards, sending incomplete images between them, and complete images to the monitor. Low-end Radeon x1300 and x1600 cards have no [...] "CrossFire Edition" [...] but are enabled via software, with communication forwarded via the standard PCI Express slots on the motherboard. ATI currently has not created the infrastructure to allow FireGL cards to be set up in a CrossFire configuration. The [...] "slave" [...] graphics card needed to be from the same family as the [...] "master".|$|E
