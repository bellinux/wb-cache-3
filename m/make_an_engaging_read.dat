40|$|How {{many people}} are imprisoned across the globe? What factors can help explain {{variations}} {{in the use of}} imprisonment in different countries? What ethical considerations should apply to the way imprisonment is used? Providing a comprehensive account of prison populations worldwide, this new work links prison statistics from the last 15 years with considerations of how prisons and prison populations are managed. With commentary from its well-known, respected authors on what is meant by an ethical approach to the use of imprisonment, and how this can be sustained in ever more challenging social, economic and political environments, this book is a major contribution to the knowledge of those currently debating prisons and the use of imprisonment, whether from academic, policy, practitioner, activist or lay perspectives.

500|$|Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties {{was first}} {{published}} in 2009 in paperback by Sphinx Publishing, and in an electronic format for the Amazon Kindle the same year.

In a 2011 article for the Federal Communications Law Journal, W.Wat Hopkins was critical of Fairman's article and subsequent book, writing that both appeared to be formats for the author to repeatedly use the word [...] "fuck", rather than actually analyze the subject from a rigorous perspective.|$|R

The marketing of auction houses and the works they sell has resulted in firms attaining authoritative positions and the ability both to influence and reflect collecting tastes. Pedigree and Panache is the first comprehensive history of the art auction in Australia. In this fascinating work, Shireen Huda investigates {{the construction of the}} glamorous reputation of art auctions and art auction houses. Featuring absorbing case studies of key art auctions and major art auction houses in Australia (including Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Deutscher-Menzies) the work provides an overview of the origin and international development of art auctions. The development of the Australian marketplace is then explored, detailing colonial inception and continuing until Christie’s withdrawal of its saleroom presence in 2006. This book is <b>an</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>read</b> for those involved in the art industry, as well as historians, artists, collectors and anyone interested in the art market, art investment, social history and art history...|$|R
40|$|Review of {{the book}} Hard time at Tehachapi: California 2 ̆ 7 s first women 2 ̆ 7 s prison by Kathleen A. Cairns (see record 2009 - 04233 - 000). This book chronicles {{the rise and fall}} of California 2 ̆ 7 s first prison for women. Tehachapi was {{operational}} from 1933 to 1952, yet this book could probably represent almost any similar time span in American penology. It is a detailed look at how prisons are intertwined with public sentiment and corresponding political shifts. This book is <b>an</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>read</b> for those interested in forensic psychology and particularly correctional psychology. The focus {{of the book}} is on the politics and history of the prison, not on the women themselves. The personalities and motivations of the women who fought to open Tehachapi and the women who eventually became wardens are described more fully than are the inmates. This is not a book about women prisoners, although certainly they are mentioned, but rather about the struggles surrounding women 2 ̆ 7 s prisons.

40|$|Incest {{autobiography}} is {{a distinct}} form of trauma writing. Although the sub-genre began {{more than two decades}} ago, it remains largely unexamined. Canadian writers’ substantial contribution to incest autobiography, in particular, is not well recognized. Four of the Canadian incest autobiographers, Charlotte Vale Allen, Sylvia Fraser, Elly Danica, and Janice Williamson have written specifically about father-daughter incest. Their books, Daddy’s Girl (1980), My Father’s House (1987), Don’t (1988), and Crybaby! (1998), because they are similar in focus but different in style, demonstrate the many ways to write autobiographically about incest. They validate incest victims’ experience while demonstrating that incest trauma is not monolithic. They are also shocking. Despite the media’s continuous exposure of incest victimization, most people will not feel a sense of complacency or familiarity with the presentation of incest in the autobiographies. Because of the very intimate autobiographical voice and the steady focus on incest, the books elicit an empathetic response. Readers become the witnesses to the incestuous abuse. Allen Fraser, Danica, and Williamson have encouraged <b>an</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>reading</b> of their books. They have also extended the parameters of contemporary Canadian women’s writing, autobiographical writing, and writing about sexual violence against children and women. The now well developed sub-genre of incest autobiography is in <b>a</b> position to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> substantial social and literary impact...|$|R

40|$|The first {{detailed}} English-language book on Korean horror {{introduces the}} cultural specificity {{of the genre}} to an international audience, from the iconic monsters of gothic horror, to the avenging killers of Oldboy and Death Bell. Beginning in the 1960 s, it traces {{a path through the}} history of Korean horror, offering new interpretations of classic films, demarcating the shifting patterns of production and consumption across the decades, and acquainting readers with films rarely seen and discussed outside of Korea. It explores the importance of folklore and myth on horror film narratives, the impact of political and social change upon the genre, and accounts for the transnational triumph of some of Korea’s contemporary horror films. While covering some of the most successful recent films such as Phone and A Tale of Two Sisters, the collection also explores the obscure, the arcane and the little-known outside Korea, including detailed analyses of The Devil’s Stairway and Woman’s Wail.

40|$|Mobile Lives interprets {{everyday}} activities, {{practices and}} experiences with the-ory. The authors, Anthony Elliott and John Urry, demonstrate {{the complexity of}} modern lives, emphasising the interplay of mobility, personal relationships, technological solutions and global consequences. The sources for their text are varied, with both narrative from research participants and contextual interpre-tations of the technology and tools used in mobile lives. The authors chose this approach because {{it allows them to}} demonstrate the interplay between mobile lives and the processes and systems that support them. This is <b>an</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>read,</b> providing <b>a</b> thorough focus on the mobile lives of affluent, employed people, which the authors portray in <b>a</b> readable, <b>engaging</b> narrative. The nar-rative is supported by focused theoretical discussion that concentrates on the individual level interests. There is, however, little consideration of the context of long-term and broader health and well-being of families and communities, other than a discussion about the futility of relying on carbon-based consump-tion for movement and mobility. The book follows a thematic structure, framed within the ‘mobilities paradigm’ previously established by Urry (2000) and others. This paradigm is described in the first chapter. They explain the 13 components of the paradigm – con-nections, the processes supporting these connections, physical movement, the emotion associated with mobility, social practices, distance, physical objects, affordance, distribution processes, circulation, the association of time and fixa-tion with mobility, the role of expert knowledge and, finally, the interdepend-ency of immobile structures associated with mobility.
