5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a <b>mental</b> <b>image</b> of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this <b>mental</b> <b>image</b> of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E

50|$|According to {{psychologist}} and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker, our {{experiences of the}} world are represented in our minds as <b>mental</b> <b>images.</b> These <b>mental</b> <b>images</b> can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, <b>mental</b> <b>images</b> allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of <b>mental</b> <b>images</b> in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome.

25|$|Visual memory {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. Visual memory {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a <b>mental</b> <b>image.</b> The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a <b>mental</b> <b>image</b> of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.|$|E

25|$|The same {{patterns}} can {{be found}} with comparing actual visual stimuli to imaging in the brain (Rossetti et al., 2010). A neglect patient who was very familiar with the map of France was asked to name French towns on {{a map of the}} country, both by a <b>mental</b> <b>image</b> of the map and by a physical image of the map. The image was then rotated 180 degrees, both mentally and physically. With the <b>mental</b> <b>image,</b> the neglect stayed consistent with the image; that is, when the map was in its original orientation, the patient named towns mostly on the East side of France, and when they mentally rotated the map they named towns mostly on the West side of France because the West coast was now {{on the right side of}} the represented field. However, with the physical copy of the map, the patient's focus was on the East side of France with either orientation.This leads researchers to believe that neglect for images in memory may be disassociated from the neglect of stimuli in extrapersonal space. In this case patients have no loss of memory making their neglect a disorder of spatial representation which is the ability to reconstruct spatial frames in which the spatial relationship of objects, that may be perceived, imagined or remembered, with respect to the subject and each other are organized to be correctly acted on.|$|E
40|$|When {{we speak}} of <b>mental</b> <b>images</b> we refer to {{representation}} of objects in our mind. Typically, <b>mental</b> <b>images</b> refer to visual representations, but we could also imagine {{the sound of a}} river, the scent of a daisy, the softness of wool, the taste of a piece of chocolate cake and thus produce also auditory, olfactory, tactile and gustative <b>mental</b> <b>images.</b> However the literature on imagery has taken into consideration almost exclusively visual <b>mental</b> <b>images,</b> so this is what we shall focus on in this chapter. The large use of imagery in everyday life and the close relationship between imagery and other cognitive processes justify the interest toward this topic...|$|R

25|$|The formal {{cause is}} its form, i.e., the {{arrangement}} of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that any thing {{is determined by the}} definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar {{in the mind of the}} sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the <b>mental</b> <b>image</b> or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.|$|E
25|$|The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is part of}} Baddeley and Hitch’s {{model of}} working memory. It is {{responsible}} for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is {{thought of as a}} three-dimensional cognitive map, which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on. It is used in tasks such as <b>mental</b> <b>image</b> manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, change of colour, etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one which you have a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of vividness is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad.|$|E
