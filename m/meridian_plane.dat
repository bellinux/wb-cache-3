40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of an eye movement that follows Listing's law is the half-angle rule that says that the angular velocity of the eye tilts by half the angle of eccentricity of the line of sight relative to primary eye position. Since all visually-guided eye movements in the regime of far viewing follow Listing's law (with the head still and upright), the question about its origin is of considerable importance. Here, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that Listing's law results from a unique motor strategy that allows minimizing ocular torsion while smoothly tracking objects of interest along any path in visual space. The strategy consists in compounding conventional ocular rotations in <b>meridian</b> <b>planes,</b> that is in horizontal, vertical and oblique directions (which are all torsion-free) with small linear displacements of the eye in the frontal plane. Such compound rotation-displacements of the eye can explain the kinematic paradox that the fixation point may rotate in one plane while the eye rotates in other planes. Its unique signature is the half-angle law in the position domain, which means that the rotation plane of the eye tilts by half-the angle of gaze eccentricity. We show that this law does not readily generalize to the velocity domain of visually-guided eye movements because the angular eye velocity is the sum of two terms, one associated with rotations in <b>meridian</b> <b>planes</b> and one associated with displacements of the eye in the frontal plane. While the first term does not depend on eye position the second term does depend on eye position. We show that compounded rotation - displacements perfectly predict the average smooth kinematics of the eye during steady- state pursuit in both the position and velocity domain...|$|R

5000|$|When the Airy transit circle was built, a mercury basin {{was used}} to align the {{telescope}} to the perpendicular. Thus the circle was aligned with the local vertical or plumb line, which is deflected slightly from the normal, or line perpendicular, to the reference ellipsoid used to define geodetic latitude and longitude in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (which is nearly {{the same as the}} WGS-84 system used by GPS). While the local vertical defined at the Airy transit circle still points to the modern celestial meridian (the intersection of the prime <b>meridian</b> <b>plane</b> with the celestial sphere), it does not pass through the Earth's rotation axis. As a result of this, the ITRF zero meridian, defined by a plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis, is 102 metres to the east of the prime meridian. A 2015 analysis by Malys et al. shows the offset between the Airy transit circle and the ITRF/WGS 84 meridians can be explained by this deflection of the vertical alone; other possible sources of the offset that have been proposed in the past are smaller than the current uncertainty in the deflection of the vertical near the observatory. The astronomical longitude of the Greenwich prime meridian was found to be 0.19&Prime; ± 0.47&Prime; East, i.e. the plane defined by the local vertical on the Greenwich prime meridian and the plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis on the ITRF zero meridian are effectively parallel. However, the claim, found, e.g., in a BBC article that this difference between astronomical and geodetic coordinates means that any measurements of transit time across the IRTF zero meridian will occur 0.352 seconds (or 0.353 sidereal seconds) before the transit across the [...] "intended meridian" [...] is based on a failure of understanding.

40|$|The {{solution}} of supersonic flow fields by {{the method of}} characteristics requires that starting conditions be known. Ferri, in reference 1, developed a method-of-characteristics solution for axially symmetric bodies of revolution at small angles of attack. With computing machinery that is now available, {{this has become a}} feasible method for computing the aerodynamic characteristics of bodies near zero angle of attack. For sharp-nosed bodies of revolution, the required starting line may be obtained by computing the flow field about a cone at a small angle of attack. This calculation is readily performed using Stone's theory in reference 2. Some solutions of this theory are available in reference 3. However, the manner in which these results are presented, namely in a wind-fixed coordinate system, makes their use somewhat cumbersome. Additionally, as pointed out in reference 4, the flow component perpendicular to the <b>meridian</b> <b>planes</b> was computed incorrectly. The results contained herein have been computed in the same basic manner as those of reference 3 with the correct velocity normal to the <b>meridian</b> <b>planes.</b> Also, all results have been transferred into the body-fixed coordinate system.

In addition, a solution was computed which yielded the minimum free-stream Mach number for a completely supersonic conical flow field.

40|$|In this research, a novel, unique {{systematic}} {{procedure was}} implemented {{to investigate the}} influence of the fracture networks and confining stresses on the jointed coal mass strength (JCMS). Both a laboratory experimental scheme and a numerical modeling scheme were carried out at the 3 -D level. The laboratory experiments were performed to achieve the following three goals. Firstly, the geomechanical properties for the intact coal and coal discontinuities were estimated through the laboratory geomechanical property tests. Secondly, naturally existing fracture networks in the cubic coal blocks were first detected by the industrial Computed Tomography (CT) scanning technique and then quantified by the fracture tensor based methodology. Thirdly, polyaxial tests were conducted on the same cubic coal blocks to obtain the JCMS values under different confining stresses. With respect to the numerical modeling, PFC^ 3 D and 3 DEC software packages were used to simulate the polyaxial compression tests for intact and jointed cubic coal blocks, respectively. From more than twenty intact rock strength criteria, nine criteria were selected for this research. The intact coal strength data bank obtained from PFC^ 3 D modeling was used to evaluate the applicability of nine different intact rock strength criteria. A modified grid search (MGS) procedure is proposed and used to find the best fitting parameter values and calculate the coefficient of determination (R²) values for each criterion. These criteria are compared in detail using the following features: R² values, σ₁ - σ₂ plots for different σ₃, shapes on the deviatoric planes, linearity or nonlinearity on the <b>meridian</b> <b>planes.</b> The regression analysis and the MGS procedure were found to be equivalent in finding the best fitting parameter values for a certain intact rock strength criterion. Through the comparisons, the modified Wiebols-Cook and modified Lade criteria were found to provide the highest R² values and fit the intact coal strength data best on the σ₁ - σ₂ coordinate <b>plane</b> and <b>meridian</b> <b>planes.</b> Based on the appearances on the deviatoric plane, the nine intact rock strength criteria are categorized into three types: the single shear stress criteria, the octahedral shear stress criteria and the criteria incorporating the maximum principal shear stress and partial intermediate principal shear stress. The relative positions of the different criteria on two specific <b>meridian</b> <b>planes</b> are also discussed. The geometric model of the jointed coal block was first set up by incorporating the fracture network constructed from the CT scanning into the intact coal block using a modified fictitious joint procedure. The numerical parameter values of intact coal and coal discontinuities were then calibrated and validated through a trial and error procedure using the laboratory test results of some selected samples. Next the JCMS data bank was consummated by performing a four-phase numerical investigation on several jointed coal blocks having selected fracture networks and five additional artificial fracture networks under different confining stress combinations. Finally, a new empirical coal mass strength criterion was developed to estimate the JCMS values at the 3 -D level. The developed new model is capable of capturing the scale effect and anisotropic strength behaviors. It can also be applied to rock masses having approximately orthogonal fracture systems or for masses where fracture system can be reduced to an equivalent orthogonal fracture system. The following new contributions were made in this dissertation to advance the existing state-of-art on the dissertation topic: (a) A new, unique methodology as shown in Fig. 1. 1 incorporating the following aspects was used to develop a new 3 -D coal mass strength criterion: a complete set of geomechanical property tests, fracture network detection and quantification, polyaxial compression tests, numerical decomposition techniques; (b) A new procedure was developed to construct the fracture network in the coal cubes starting from CT scans to perform numerical modeling using 3 DEC. In this procedure, a modified fictitious joint framework was also proposed to extend the applicability of the original fictitious joint framework, which allows incorporating a large quantity of non-persistent joints with acceptable numerical calculation effort; (c) A new 3 -D coal mass strength criterion was developed to incorporate the fracture network and 3 -D confining stress system to capture the anisotropy and scale effect of coal mass strength. The proposed criterion not only includes {{the influence of the}} intermediate principal stress, which is ignored by some existing strength criteria, but also includes the intensity and orientation and size probability distributions of the fracture system explicitly by a fracture tensor based methodology, which is far more advanced than most of the current criteria that are based on rock mass classification systems having only scalar indices; (d) A modified grid search procedure was proposed and used to evaluate the applicability of nine different intact rock strength criteria. The best intact rock strength criteria applicable for the intact coal data obtained through PFC^ 3 D modeling were found by performing the most detailed intact rock strength criteria evaluation incorporating σ₁ - σ₂ - σ₃ plots and behaviors on the deviatoric and <b>meridian</b> <b>planes,</b> which improves the understanding of the available intact rock strength criteria...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study and {{direct numerical simulation}} of near-wall turbulent flow and ionic mass transport was performed in a cylindrical electrochemical reactor for Reynolds numbers up to 18, 000 (friction Reynolds number of 1245). The experimental part involved the determination of velocity gradients close {{to the wall of}} a rotating cylinder. These velocity gradients are determined by electrochemical mass transport measurements to a rotating cylinder electrode and to micro-electrodes embedded in a rotating cylinder. Simulation of the fluid flow with passive scalar is accomplished using a hybrid finite element method (FEM) in <b>meridian</b> <b>planes</b> coupled to a Fourier expansion in the azimuthal direction. It was shown that the method reproduces the turbulent flow statistics with high accuracy. Due to its high parallel efficiency and the possibility of stretched meshes in finite element planes near the wall, this hybrid method is suitable to study laboratory electrochemical systems. Coupling with mass and energy transport equations allows prediction of the concentration and temperature fields. This feature makes the model suitable for large-scale design and optimization of different electrochemical processes where accurate prediction of near-wall turbulence and ionic mass transport is required.

40|$|We present {{stereoscopic}} reconstructions of {{the location}} and inclination of polar plumes of two data sets based on the two simultaneously recorded images taken by the EUVI telescopes in the SECCHI instrument package onboard the STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) spacecraft. The ten plumes investigated show a superradial expansion in the coronal hole in 3 D {{which is consistent with}} the 2 D results. Their deviations from the local <b>meridian</b> <b>planes</b> are rather small with an average of 6. 47 ^∘. By comparing the reconstructed plumes with a dipole field with its axis along the solar rotation axis, it is found that plumes are inclined more horizontally than the dipole field. The lower the latitude is, the larger is the deviation from the dipole field. The relationship between plumes and bright points has been investigated and they are not always associated. For the first data set, based on the 3 D height of plumes and the electron density derived from SUMER/SOHO Si viii line pair, we found that electron densities along the plumes decrease with height above the solar surface. The temperature obtained from the density scale height is 1. 6 to 1. 8 times larger than the temperature obtained from Mg ix line ratios. We attribute this discrepancy to a deviation of the electron and the ion temperatures. Finally, we have found that the outflow speeds studied in the O vi line in the plumes corrected by the angle between the line of sight and the plume orientation are quite small with a maximum of 10 km s^- 1. It is unlikely that plumes are a dominant contributor to the fast solar wind. Comment: 25 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{issues related to the}} modelling of sintering of hardmetal, which is composed of WC-grains that are embedded in a Co-binder. The aims are to develop a constitutive model framework and computational tools by which it is possible, in a unified manner, to simulate the two subsequent steps of cold compaction and (free) sintering. Only solid phase sintering is considered, i. e. it is tacitly assumed that the sintering process takes place below the melting point of the binder material. Free sintering is carried out without any external load. The "driving force" of the process (denoted the "sintering stress") arises from the change of surface energy between constituents and pores. From a continuum point of view, the sintering stress (that brings about the densification) acts as a hydrostatic pressure. An explicit expression for the sintering stress is derived from thermodynamics and from a simplified microstructure. This stress is applied in two ways: (1) As an external load on an "Representative Volume Element" (RVE), in a mesomechanical approach. (2) As a part of the effective stress that is employed in the constitutive equations in a continuum model. An RVE-generator, that uses the initial relative density and the weight portions of Co and WC as input, is developed. The creep mechanisms of the constituents (WC,Co) are modelled using an incompressible elasto-viscoplasticity model with isotropic hardening and temperature dependent parameters. The RVE is calibrated using experimental data from free sintering and uniaxially loaded specimens. A thermo-hyperelastic-viscoplastic model with isotropic hardening and temperature dependent parameters is used as a continuum model. The particular model chosen is based on quasi-static and dynamic yield surfaces that are elliptic in the <b>meridian</b> <b>planes</b> of the stress space. This model is, after calibration and validation using experimental data, implemented into a commercial FE-code.
