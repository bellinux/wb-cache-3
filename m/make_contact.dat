5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs <b>make</b> <b>contact.</b> Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes breaks a leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losers.|$|E
5|$|In mid-October, in {{response}} to suspicions of planned American raids on Wake Island, Musashi led a large fleet—three carriers, six battleships, and 11 cruisers—to intercept American forces, but failed to <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> and returned to Truk on 26 October. She spent the remainder of 1943 in Truk Lagoon. Captain Komura was promoted to rear admiral on 1 November and transferred to the 3rd Fleet on 7 December as Chief of Staff, Captain Bunji Asakura assuming command of Musashi.|$|E

Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E
5|$|Season three {{continues}} the story 67 {{days after the}} crash. The season begins where the second season left off: three of the crash survivors are held in captivity by the mysterious Others. More backstory on the Others, {{as well as the}} Dharma Initiative, is revealed. The survivors face continuous threats from their enemies, and also from their friends. The survivors attempt to <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with a freighter which they believe is there to rescue them. Season three takes place over 24 days.|$|E

50|$|The {{drop kick}} {{technique}} in rugby codes is usually {{to hold the}} ball with one end pointing downwards in two hands above the kicking leg. The ball is dropped onto {{the ground in front}} of the kicking foot, which <b>makes</b> <b>contact</b> at the moment or fractionally after the ball touches the ground, called the half-volley. The kicking foot usually <b>makes</b> <b>contact</b> with the ball slightly on the instep.|$|R
5|$|The Allied advance was {{severely}} hampered by poor communications in these crucial initial phases. The paratroopers' radio sets range was instantly {{limited by the}} wooded terrain and as the battalions advanced they lost contact with Divisional HQ at the landing zones. Over the coming nine days, radio communication within the division, with Browning's HQ at Nijmegen, with XXX Corps and with the United Kingdom would be intermittent and unreliable, severely hampering the British units. Carrier pigeons were even used to <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with Britain. Partly {{as a consequence of}} this limitation, Urquhart decided to follow the 1st Parachute Brigade and <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with Lathbury. When he found the Brigade HQ on Lion route, he was informed by Major Hibbert, who, at that time, was still en route to the bridge, that Lathbury himself was visiting the 3rd Battalion. Urquhart followed Lathbury there but subsequently {{would not be able to}} return to Divisional HQ for two days.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{witnessed}} the Polish drop but {{were unable to}} <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> by radio so a swimmer was sent south of the Rhine. The British planned to supply rafts for a river crossing that night as the Poles were desperately needed on the northern bank. The Poles waited on the southern bank, but by 03:00 no rafts were evident and they withdrew to Driel to take up defensive positions.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise, {{along with}} other ships in the sector, {{experience}} a localized time-distortion, and soon after receive a distress-call from Dr. Paul Manheim in a nearby system. Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) recalls that Manheim was ejected from the Federation Science Institute for conducting unauthorized experiments. They find the distress signal coming from a facility on a planetoid surrounded by a force-field. When they <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with the facility, a woman requests help to save her husband, Dr. Manheim, and lowers the shields.|$|E

The corner kick was taken short and the eventual cross was headed behind for another corner {{on the opposite side}} by Evra.

After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking Man has a meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side if he is given a good reason to do so.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> with the enemy.|$|E
