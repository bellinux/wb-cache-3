5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between <b>multimode</b> fibers and single-mode fibers. <b>Multimode</b> fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001 Aphex Twin {{released}} Drukqs, {{an experimental}} double album featuring computer-controlled piano (influenced by Erik Satie and John Cage) and abrasive, fast, meticulously-programmed songs. Many track names {{are written in}} Cornish—for example, [...] "Jynweythek" [...] ("Machine Music"). Rolling Stone described the piano pieces as [...] "aimlessly pretty". The release polarized reviewers, some believed that Drukqs was released as a contract-breaker with Warp Records, since James' next major release {{was on his own}} Rephlex label. The musician told interviewers he accidentally left an MP3 player with a large number of new songs (labelled [...] "Aphex Twin—unreleased tracks") on a plane, and rushed the album's release to preempt an Internet leak. In 2001 James also released a short EP, 2 Remixes By AFX, with remixes of songs by 808 State and DJ Pierre. It also had an untitled third track, consisting of a SSTV image with high-pitched sounds which can be decoded to a viewable image with appropriate software (such as <b>MultiMode</b> for Macintosh or MMSSTV for Windows). In 2002, James was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male.|$|E

50|$|Modal {{dispersion}} is a distortion mechanism {{occurring in}} <b>multimode</b> fibers and other waveguides, {{in which the}} signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal {{is not the same}} for all modes.

50|$|A {{single-mode}} laser {{launch into}} the center of a <b>multimode</b> fiber can generate multiple signals that confuse the receiver {{at the other end of}} the fiber. These multiple signals, caused by Differential Mode Delay (DMD) effects, limit the system distance lengths for operating Gigabit Ethernet.

This offset launch creates a transmitted signal that is similar to typical <b>multimode</b> light emitting diode (LED) launches.|$|E

5000|$|Real {{laser beams}} are often non-Gaussian, being {{multi-mode}} or mixed-mode. Multi-mode beam propagation is often modeled by considering a so-called [...] "embedded" [...] Gaussian, whose beam waist is M times {{smaller than that}} of the <b>multimode</b> beam. The diameter of the <b>multimode</b> beam is then M times that of the embedded Gaussian beam everywhere, and the divergence is M times greater, but the wavefront curvature is the same. The <b>multimode</b> beam has M2 times the beam area but 1/M2 less beam intensity than the embedded beam. This holds true for any given optical system, and thus the minimum (focussed) spot size or beam waist of a multi-mode laser beam is M times the embedded Gaussian beam waist.|$|E
