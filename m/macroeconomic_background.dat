50|$|The {{development}} of the pharmaceutical industry in China {{was found to be}} predominantly driven by economic factors. The nature of an industrial region can roughly fall into one of the following three types: natural resource-driven region, economy-driven region and science and technology-driven region. The pharmaceutical industry in China grows well only in areas with a strong <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background</b> rather than in regions with rich natural resources or advanced science and technology. Moreover, it is shown that the stronger the macro-economy, the faster the pharmaceutical industry grows. Therefore, the decision-making policy on pharmaceutical development in a region should be largely based on its macroeconomic situation.|$|E

This substantial jump is largely attributed to the 10 new share issues on the Casablanca Stock Exchange {{over the course of}} the year, as well as the several secondary issues that also took place in 2007. The market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio also moved in step with the upward trend, now accounting for 96.5% of GDP, up from 71.1% of GDP in 2006, and is comparable to the ratios characteristic of many developed Western economies. The major industrial leaders of the market are banking, telecoms and real estate, which together make up almost two-thirds of market capitalisation. The volume of activity on the stock market, including shares and bonds, also increased significantly in 2007, reaching Dh359.7bn ($46.8bn), an increase of 161.1% on 2006, when total volumes amounted to Dh166.4bn ($21.6bn). There is a widespread belief among market professionals that the market capitalisation and trading volumes will probably continue their upward trend, supported by a positive <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background,</b> and the latest technology developments, such as on-line securities trading, and the potential introduction of derivatives trading. Education of the public is also seen as an important issue and despite the improvements made in recent years, there is still a need to develop a level of professionalism of operators and to make professional training courses compulsory, as they are still offered on a voluntary basis.|$|E

Using rich data on attitudes towards European integration from the Eurobarometer (EB) surveys, we revisit the issue by analyzing the relation between <b>macroeconomic</b> indicators, socio-economic <b>background</b> variables, individual attitudes {{and the level of}} Euroskepticism within the 27 EU member states for the period 2006 to 2011.

We find evidence that negative financial expectations are positively related to Euroskepticism in Western European countries and negatively related to Euroskepticism in Eastern European countries.

It faces difficult choices regarding access, quality and affordability, while dealing with the increasing burden of chronic diseases. Policymakers are pressured to make complex decisions while implementing health strategies. This study shows how this process could be structured and reports the specific equity and efficiency preferences among Chinese policymakers. Methods In total, 78 regional, provincial and national level policymakers with considerable experience participated in a discrete choice experiment, weighting the relative importance of six policy attributes describing equity and efficiency. Results from a conditional logistic model are presented for the six criteria, measuring the associated weights. Observed and unobserved heterogeneities were incorporated and tested in the model. Findings are used to give an example of ranking health interventions in relation to the present disease burden in China. Results In general, respondents showed strong preference for efficiency criteria i. e. total beneficiaries and cost-effectiveness as the most important attributes in decision making over equity criteria. Hence, priority interventions would be those conditions that are most prevalent in the country and cost least per health gain. Conclusion Although efficiency criteria override equity ones, major health threats in China would be targeted. Multicriteria decision analysis makes explicit important trade-offs between efficiency and equity, leading to explicit, transparent and rational policy makin...|$|R

40|$|A THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ON SOME ECONOMIC VARIABLES OF INTEREST This {{research}} project addresses two topics {{related to the}} relation and effects that public infrastructure may have on economic growth. First, a functional relation is estimated from the basis of national <b>macroeconomic</b> data with <b>background</b> information on infrastructure is estimated based on an economic growth model in which infrastructure that is subject to congestion acts as a technological parameter modifying total productivity of the factors. Thus, evidence is found that enables affirming the existence of long-term relations between the variables, {{but it is not}} possible to be categorical on the type of endogeneity existing. The reason for this is that there seems to be a fundamental breakdown in infrastructure investment series before and after 1990, for which structural equations should be modified or explicitly consider the existence of these breakdowns. This is a pioneer work in Chile and has been used by the Ministry of Public Works to support diverse opinions on matters of investments. Secondly, a theoretical growth model was discussed in this study in which, once again, public infrastructure shows to play a fundamental role in economy. Unlike common models in these matters, in this new approach it is evident that public infrastructure also influences people’s commuting time, which in turn influences leisure choices; consumption of such choices and, obviously, their effects on productivity as it is usual in these matters. The model developed is original in the literature, and one of its consequences is showing that tax directions for financing infrastructure change qualitatively in regard to common models, as the above mentioned effect is explicitly considered. From this last work it is expected to obtain new results considering that the effect on commuting time that has been considered must now be corrected by an income effect. The reason for this is that if only the negative effect of infrastructure on commuting time is considered, there must be an income effect which in turn affects negatively against a higher circulation speed and, therefore, has a positive effect on commuting time. This analysis did not discuss on introducing the latter effect, for which it is to be later analysed. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R
40|$|Self-employment and {{entrepreneurship}} are economic {{phenomena of}} significant importance, which are increasingly {{addressed in the}} social science research and, on the other hand, in the mass media. Governments {{all over the world}} extol its benefits and implement policies designed to promote the venturing activities in their respective countries. There are several reasons for this interest in, and enthusiasm for, entrepreneurship. Owner-managers of small enterprises, for instance, run the majority of businesses in most countries. These enterprises are credited with providing specialised goods and services that are ignored by the largest companies. In addition, they intensify competition, thereby growing economic efficiency. Some entrepreneurs pioneer new markets for innovative products and services, creating job opportunities and enhancing economic growth. But only in a few cases, today’s small owner-managed enterprises do grow to become tomorrow’s industrial giants. Even those that do not may create positive externalities, like the development of supply chain that help attract inward investments, or greater social inclusion. It is often claimed that the decentralisation of economic production into a large number of small firms is good for society and democracy, as is the fostering of a self-reliant and hardy entrepreneurial spirit. When we add to the aforementioned migration as an essential component of the ongoing globalisation process, the entrepreneurship as a subject of research becomes even more complex. The increase in numbers of immigrants in most advanced economies, including Germany, in {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century, has also led to an increase in the immigrant entrepreneurship. More precisely, the self-employment structure of immigrants to Germany changed tremendously since the 1970 s. For instance, in the early 1970 s only 40, 000 immigrants were registered performing self-employment activities, and their businesses were tied to restaurant or to cater to the need of their compatriots. Overall, the absolute number of self-employed foreigners developed more dramatically than the number of the self-employed Germans. The stock of self-employed foreigners rose by 23. 6 per cent between 1992 and 2001, while the increase in total self-employment was 17. 0 per cent. In this context, this dissertation investigates the determinants of successful immigrant entrepreneurship for whole Germany as well as for some particular regions characterised by high fraction of immigrant population and venturing activities. The objective of the thesis is to answer the research questions: (i) Which factors contribute to the explanation of the observation that some immigrant groups in Germany have the opportunity and willingness to become an entrepreneur and others do not?, and (ii) Which factors contribute to the explanation of the observation that some immigrant entrepreneurs are more successful than others? The potential determinants of successful immigrant entrepreneurship are derived from theory and existing empirical evidence. They include financial variables, risk attitude, psychological, human capital, <b>macroeconomic</b> and <b>background</b> variables. As a main result, we uncovered that legal regulations with respect to the founding process do impact considerably the immigrant’s propensity to engage in entrepreneurial activities besides other significant factors taken into account. Therefore, for the sake of entrepreneurship growth in Germany, it is imperative that immigrants, in particular the non-EU nationals, have unfettered access to the formal labour market, and they be given the opportunities to implement their venturing endeavours. Moreover, we shed light on the survival of immigrant entrepreneurs in Upper Bavaria. Although the survival performance of immigrant entrepreneurs is by 1. 24 years shorter compared with Germans, we found based on the estimated hazard model that Asians account for the highest survival (4. 20 years on average) among all immigrants venturing in Upper Bavaria. Finally, every study is by nature limited. Although I provided considerable insights regarding the determinants leading to successful immigrant entrepreneurship in Germany, there is still enough space for future investigations in this area. A concluding research issue is that there are few German academics working and exploring the phenomenon of immigrant entrepreneurship, although immigrants establish more companies and employ more co-workers on average than Germans do. For instance, the start-up activities in year 2002 indicate that immigrants (5. 4 per cent) compared with Germans (2. 1 per cent) consider more often self-employment as occupational choice. Although immigrants feature more commonly funding obstacles prior to establishing an own company, they hire twice and a half more staff members on average. If the concerns identified above were to be conquered, then it would be appropriate for more German scholars to get involved, and to help understand the significance of that phenomenon, as Germany was and is among the countries attracting immigrants since the 1950 s. Obwohl der Migrationpolitik sowohl in der allgemeinen Diskussion als auch in der wissenschaftlichen Fachdebatte enorme Bedeutung zugesprochen wird, ist kaum etwas über den betriebswirtschaftlichen Erfolg von Immigranten-Unternehmern in Deutschland bekannt. Während die Selbständigenquote im Lande im internationalen Vergleich bereits eher gering ist, ist diese unter den Immigranten noch niedriger. Allerdings ist zu erwähnen, dass die unternehmerischen Aktivitäten von Immigranten eine dynamischere Entwicklung als diese der Deutschen aufweisen. Somit stellt sich berechtigt die Frage nach den Einflussfaktoren von Unternehmensgründungen durch Immigranten in Deutschland sowie auch nach den Erfolgsbedingungen solcher Gründungen nichts zuletzt angesichts der Hoffnung, welche die Arbeitsmarktpolitik auf eine zunehmende Selbständigkeit und Gründungsaktivität setzt. Die vorliegende Dissertationsschrift erarbeitet verschiedene theoretische und empirische Modelle, um die sozioökonomischen Faktoren zu identifizieren, welche sich auf das Entscheidungskalkül eines Immigranten, selbständig zu sein oder nicht, auswirken. Darüber hinaus wird untersucht, ob Investitionen in Human- und Sozialkapital den betriebswirtschaftlichen Erfolg positiv beeinflussen, und wie sich die Zusammensetzung von Belegschaften innerhalb der Unternehmen auf deren Erfolg auswirkt. Im Ergebnis wurde festgestellt, dass die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen, signifikant die Wahrscheinlichkeit ein Unternehmen zu gründen, beeinflussen. Immigranten aus dem EU-Raum weisen deutlich höhere Neigung im Vergleich zu diesen stammend aus dem Nicht-EU-Raum, eine selbständige Tätigkeit auszuüben. Abschließend wurde mit Hilfe des Hazard-Modells herausgefunden, dass die Überlebenschancen der Immigranten-Unternehmen um 1, 24 Jahre kürzer als diese der deutschen Unternehmen sind.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} {{for the analysis of}} regular patterns in public financial behaviour, and applies that framework in an empirical assessment of budgetary policies in the United States and in the Netherlands. Its purpose and scope are threefold. First, it sheds theoretical light on economic considerations guiding public financial behaviour in a dynamic model of optimal taxation. The resulting idea, that it may be sensible to smooth taxation over time,is subsequently extended to a more general model of the public finances, which involves spending, taxation, debt and money creation in an effort to control the government budget. Second, using modern econometric methods the practical relevance of this model is illustrated with estimations for the United States and the Netherlands. Third, the model is sufficiently flexible to allow for a number of more institutional insights. In this respect the emphasis is placed on the Dutch economy and public finances. The thesis thus engages economic theory, econometric technique and institutional and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background</b> in a combined effort to understand and evaluate regular patterns in public financial behaviour.

Then, the importance of wage rigidities is dealt with, which are significant both from a macro- and a microeconomic point of view, and which have been at the centre of scientific and economic-policy discussions particularly in recent years. Finally, wage-policy conclusions are examined briefly.

40|$|Investment {{expenditure}} {{relates to}} an evident optimization problem: {{to create an}} optimal capital stock which {{is a function of}} expected profits. According to the Tobin´s Q - theory, investment depends on the ratio Q of the market value of business capital assets to their replacement value. A firm´s investment should rise with its Q. In practice, however, Q is not observable and the measurement of numerator as well as of denominator presents problems in empirical implementation. Looking for an appropriate approach, both macroeconomic and microeconomic level can be followed. The macroeconomic Q can be derived from the Keynes equation for the price level. Tobin´s Q is given here as a measure of the economy´s willingness to invest (Mundschenk, 2000). As for the firms, a VAR model is estimated using panel data. Relevant forecasts enable to quantify an expected value of a firm even in case that it is not quoted on stock markets (Behr and Bellgardt, 2002). To characterize a <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background,</b> the Q of the Czech Republic was computed. Than, the panel data approach was applied to the Czech machinery. The Qs were computed with an evident majority of negative values and a zero correlation to investment, when following the detailed panel structure.

South Africa has implemented various policy initiatives in attempts to attract foreign investment. This study investigates on the effect of foreign {{direct investment}} on economic growth, with particular reference to the South African economy. The period of study is from 1980 to 2010. The study begins by reviewing literature on economic growth and foreign direct investment. South Africa’s <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background</b> is examined to determine the trends in FDI inflows and economic growth. An empirical model linking theoretical and empirical literature on the effect of FDI on economic growth is estimated using the Johansen cointegration and VECM framework. Variables specified in the methodology include real gross domestic product (RGDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), domestic investment (INVE), real exchange rate (REXCH) and foreign marketable debt (DEBT). The long run results showed that FDI, REXCH and DEBT {{have a negative impact on}} growth. INVE has a positive impact on growth. Short run results indicated that there is no strong pressure on RGDP to restore long-run equilibrium whenever there is a disturbance. The short run lag of FDI was found to exert a positive impact on growth. The impulse response and variance decomposition analysis complemented the long and short-run findings. Shocks on REXCH, and DEBT generated a negative response on RGDP. The shocks were not significantly different from zero and were transitory. Results from the variance decomposition analysis revealed that the fundamentals explain some, but not all, of the variations of RGDP. For the fifth year forecast error variance RGDP explains the largest component of the variation followed by INVE, REXCH, FDI and DEBT. After a period of ten years, the influence of RGDP and INVE declines, whereas REXCH, FDI and DEBT increase. Conclusions and policy recommendations were made using these results...|$|E
40|$|During the 1990 s, globalisation, severe {{recession}} and changing social values among several other factors have challenged the Finnish welfare state {{as it was}} during the transition between the 1980 s and the 1990 s. The beginning of this paper is dedicated to describing macro-social and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background</b> issues as some of the factors that might have influenced the form of the Finnish welfare state. Later on, descriptive statistics have been used with the purpose of tracing potential retrenchment of the welfare state expenses and to elaborate the background information. The descriptive data indicates growth in social security expenses paid by the Finnish state, as well as rising unemployment rate, growing debt and sinking gross national product in the early 1990 s. According to the same data, the national economy has recovered by the late 1990 s, and social security expenses have mainly decreased simultaneously. In order to see how the welfare state has developed and reacted to the internal and external changes in the 1990 s and to see how diverse social groups have been treated within the Finnish social security system, institutional revisions in three social security programs have been viewed in a narrative study. Developments in these social security programs have been compared to some presumably significant background factors in order {{to see if they could}} have affected these revisions. The conclusions are that retrenchment on the institutional level can be observed, tendency seems to be towards more activating social policies, as well as that the traditional universality of the Finnish welfare state may be fading.

40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) {{is seen as}} a way to provide the needed capital inflow to stimulate growth in a domestic economy. FDI can also result in increased employment levels, managerial skills and increase in technology. In efforts to attract FDI, host countries have undertaken various policy incentives to attract foreign investors. This study analyses the trends and determinants of inward FDI to South Africa for the period 1975 - 2005. The study starts by reviewing FDI literature on its determinants and provides the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background</b> and FDI related policies undertaken in South Africa. The trend and sectoral analysis provides the actual nature of FDI flows to South Africa. An empirical model linking theoretical and empirical determinants of FDI is estimated using the Johansen cointegration and VECM framework. The study also augments the cointegration framework with impulse response and variance decomposition analyses to complement the long and short run determinants of FDI. Dummy variables are used in each of the estimated FDI models {{to take into account the}} possibility of structural breaks. Results show that relative to the size of the economy and to other developing countries, South Africa still receives low levels of inward FDI. Only are few years are exceptional i. e. 1997, 2001 and 2005. From the sectoral distribution, the financial sector is now the major recipient of FDI followed by the mining and manufacturing sectors. The emergence of the financial sector could suggest that FDI motives could have shifted from the natural resource seeking and market seeking to efficiency seeking FDI. The United Kingdom emerges as the major source of FDI to South Africa followed by United States of America and Germany. Empirical analysis indicated that openness, exchange rate and financial development are important long run determinants of FDI. Increased openness and financial development attract FDI while an increase (depreciation) in the exchange rate deters FDI to South Africa. Market size emerges as a short run determinant of FDI although it is declining in importance. Most of the impulse response analysis confirmed the VECM findings. Variance decomposition analysis showed that FDI itself, imports and exchange rate explain a significant amount of the forecast error variance. The influence of market size variable is small and declining over time...|$|E

One part of the comparative work concentrates on the comparison of Slovakia with other new EU members that also face to challenge of state building after dissolution of one or the other sort (Czech Rep. and the Baltics). The other part of the comparative work concentrates on Hungary in comparison with the other EU-CEECs. A broad based comparison will most likely be possible on available data only. The possibility for deeper qualitative comparisons will have to be determined during the project. The comparative components will focus on the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background</b> (Slovakia) and the welfare state (Hungary) respectively. Cluster analysis (initially forseen for MS 25) and comparative country studies allows us to draw conclusions for the EU by providing a first comparison of the position of CEECs with respect to the “old” EU members, most interestingly the southern crisis countries that are often categorized into a form called mixed market economies with sometimes contradicting institutional set ups. Do CEECs converge towards prototype models or do they (still) constitute own models...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three chapters that empirically {{examine the}} interactions among economic variables {{from three different}} fields: labor economics, macroeconomics, and financial markets. This dissertation lies {{at the intersection of}} these three fields, and the underlying theme is the empirical investigation that enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive economic activities that we observe today. The first chapter examines how labor market composition and macroeconomic conditions affect each other. A dual labor market structure that consists of “permanent jobs” and “temporary jobs” is common in many Continental European countries and in Japan, and over the last two decades, the share of temporary workers in these countries has increased markedly. In this chapter, I demonstrate through an analysis of Japanese household panel survey data that permanent workers experience faster wage growth than temporary workers. Then, building a search and matching model of dual labor market with endogenous human capital accumulation, I show that, in the presence of two different types of jobs with different rates of return to experience, a slowing of the economic growth rate in a dual labor market structure can prompt a substantial shift in the composition of jobs. The second chapter proposes a nonparametric method for studying the time series properties of macroeconomic variables. In particular, I focus on a class of learning networks called the Radial Basis Function (RBF). The main advantage of the RBF method is its flexibility and that it requires minimal functional-form assumptions. To assess the potential value of the RBF method, I simulate data points using a nonlinear New-Keynesian (NK) DSGE model and show that the RBF time series can uncover the nonlinear NK structure from simulated data observations whose length is as small as 300 (quarters). I then compare the out-of-sample prediction performance of the resulting network formula with other traditional time series methods, i. e., Vector-Autoregression and Bayesian VAR models. Finally, I apply this RBF time series method to US macroeconomic data from 1960 - 2010. The third chapter studies the link between the probability of default implied by Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads and the final prices of the defaulted bonds as established at the CDS settlement auctions. We observe that the postdefault recovery rates at the observed spreads imply markets were often ‘surprised” by the credit event. We find that the prices of the bonds that are deliverable at the auctions imply probabilities of default that are systematically different than the default probabilities estimated prior to the event of default using standard methodologies. We discuss the implications for CDS pricing models. We analyze the discrepancy etween the actual and theoretical CDS spreads and we find it is significantly associated both to the CDS market microstructure {{at the time of the}} settlement auction and to the general <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background.</b> We discuss the potential for strategic bidding behavior at the CDS settlement auctions. 2019 - 06 - 0...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Commerce in Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 This study {{examines}} the economic sense in policies that promote or aim {{to attract more}} Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by specifically focusing on the determinant of FDI and how they impact the economic growth of South Africa. The study empirically identifies and investigates the determinants of FDI on South African economic growth as well as FDI attraction and its correlation with economic growth over the period 1994 to 2010 through the utilization of Cointegration and Error-Correction Model to identify the variables in explaining FDI in South Africa. This study analysis trends and the determinants of FDI {{as well as their}} impact on the South African economy. FDI is seen as the means of providing the needed capital injection to stimulate growth in the host economy. FDI can as well result in increased employment rate, managerial skills and technological increase. Multinational Corporation (MNC) should agglomerate {{in such a way that}} is consistent with country specific externalities. There is somewhat weak evidence that FDI generates positive spillover effects to the host country. In instances where FDI generates positive productivity spillovers for domestic market economy, FDI subsidies and incentives should be warranted particularly where they have been proven to have a catalytic role in FDI attraction. The study also indicates a positive and significant impact of reform on FDI in South Africa. The study considers trade Openness, GOP per capita as well as the Cost of labour variables on explaining FDI inflows. All variables indicate correct signs and are statistically significant except for cost of labour. There is some mild evidence that labour cost impedes FD I inflows. The infrastructure levels as well as other variables are directly related to FDI. In its endeavour to attract FDI, the host country undertakes various policy incentives to attract foreign investors. All these outcomes have important implications for improving the national economy which can be helpful in the allocation of funds and resources much needed for FDI attraction. This study clearly emphasizes the role of policy in FDI attraction as well determining short-run and long-run growth in South Africa by firstly providing the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>background.</b> Secondly, it reviews FDI literature on its determinants and related policies undertaken in South Africa. It further establishes a linear empirical relationship between these determinants, and variables to determine the direction of the causality as well as contribute to the debate on the relationship between FDI and growth through regression analysis. It assesses the growth implications of FDI in South Africa and the regional economic implications by subjecting FDI to Granger causality tests within the cointegration framework. The results suggest that in the host country, there exist a positive correlation between FDI and economic growth. In relation to other developing countries as well as the size of the economy, South Africa still receives low levels of FDI inflows with exception of 1997, 2001 and 2005. The major contributors are financial sector, mining and manufacturing sectors. One can conclude that the South African government should consider encouraging capital-intensive FDI through capacity building and further development of skilled labour force. The empirical analysis indicates that openness, the rate of exchange as well as the financial development and improved labour costs are important long run determinants of FDI. The study sets up further research that may be helpful in exposing the South African economy with greater FDI potential as well as indentify regional specific interventions needed to improve certain conditions to receive more FDI. The effects of trade liberalization imply that African countries require African specific solution. Policies that have been successful in other countries may not suggest that they equally successful in African countries. Master...|$|E
