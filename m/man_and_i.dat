25|$|The {{county board}} called an {{emergency}} {{meeting to discuss}} {{the recommendations of the}} arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues, an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn't indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: I am my own <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am proud to be a Cork football man. Holland said the claim that six people had refused the job before him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job.|$|E

He stated [...] "I'm comfortable saying I'm a gay <b>man.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't want people to {{feel the same way}} I did. You can grow up, you can be comfortable and you can be gay." [...] He added [...] "I am telling the world that I am gay … and I hope this makes it easier for others now, and even if you've held it in for years, it feels easier to get it out."In 2016 he began dating model Ryan Channing.|$|E
500|$|On 16 October, a jury {{took three}} and a half hours to convict Morgan of Figard's murder, and he was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} with a recommendation that the Home Secretary should decide his parole eligibility. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Latham said, [...] "What you did to Celine has caused revulsion in the minds of all right-thinking people. You are a dangerous <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will so report to the Home Secretary." [...] Latham subsequently set a minimum term of twenty years, which was later endorsed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Bingham, and on 4 November 1998, the Home Secretary informed Morgan of the length of the sentence he must serve.|$|E

500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them." [...] Wyatt testified, [...] "Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a good shot and a dangerous <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Vanger is {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love {{the character of the}} old <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old man would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Stop" [...] has a {{high pitched}} {{keyboard}} sound embedded in between {{the sound of a}} drum machine and clarinet. The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that [...] "I want my <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am going to get him whatever". Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus, with a synth line added on the top. He felt that [...] "Can't Stop", at 4:45 length, was {{a good example of the}} division of Madonna's songs between dance music—where the length is important—and the requirement of classic pop songs, which can vary from two minutes to four minutes. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book , described Faure's song [...] "24 Hours" [...] as a slow track which fails to build up momentum. Joe Brown from The Washington Post described Davidson's [...] "Turn it Up" [...] as consisting of a slow background synth, that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat, with Davidson's singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{motorcade}} {{arrived at}} the Cathedral and Reagan's casket was removed. The bearers carrying it paused on the Cathedral steps, and an opening prayer was given by Bishop John Bryson Chane, Dean of the Washington National Cathedral. The casket was then carried down the aisle; the Reagan family followed and Nancy Reagan was escorted to her seat by President Bush. Rabbi Harold Kushner and Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (the first female Supreme Court justice, whom Reagan appointed), then each gave a reading, which preceded the eulogies. The choir then sang hymns—"Faire is the Heaven"; [...] "Bring Us, O Lord"; [...] "And I saw a New Heaven"—before Thatcher delivered the first eulogy. In view of her failing mental faculties following several small strokes, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier and was broadcast throughout the Cathedral on plasma television screens. During the speech, Thatcher said, [...] "We have lost a great president, a great American and a great <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have lost a dear friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Pompeo's {{character}} {{has also been}} used to define the image a strong woman, Bustle previewing the 12th season wrote, [...] "Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own. [...] Grey's Anatomy is about Meredith's journey. Men and romantic interests {{are a part of}} her life, but they are not the priority. She doesn't need McDreamy. Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers will do this storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate." [...] The site added, [...] "This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe that this won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E

500|$|Sylvester was openly gay, with Gamson {{noting that}} he tended to enter into {{relationships}} with men who were [...] "white, self-doubting and effeminate." [...] In 1978, he entered into {{a relationship with a}} young white model named John Maley; Sylvester later devoted the song [...] "Can't Forget the Love" [...] from his Too Hot to Sleep album to his young lover. Maley ended the relationship to move to Los Angeles, later recollecting that Sylvester [...] "was a lovely <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> owe him a lot." [...] In 1981, Sylvester entered into a relationship with a slim brunette from Deep River, Connecticut named Michael Rayner, but unlike his predecessors, he did not move into Sylvester's house; their partnership ended when Rayner admitted that he had not fallen completely in love with Sylvester. Sylvester's next major relationship was with Tom Daniels, a hairdresser whom he met in 1982, but their romance ended after six months when Daniels discovered that Sylvester had been having sex with other men while on tour. The singer's final partner, the architect Rick Cranmer, was a six-foot two blonde, and the duo moved into a house together in the hills. Cranmer died of AIDS-related complications in 1987, the year before Sylvester succumbed to the virus.|$|E
500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron <b>Man.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's chorus. Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by {{a variation on the}} song's introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long. Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on The Byrds' version of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997: [...] "I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was saying to him, 'Hey, God, take me for a trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission." ...|$|E

500|$|From her {{earliest}} {{years she}} was known for her compassionate heart and desire to help others, but also for her temper, blunt honesty and moodiness. As a small child, she once lost patience while posing for a portrait painter and told the man, [...] "You are a very ugly <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't like you one bit!" [...] The Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible, sleeping on hard camp cots unless they were ill, taking cold baths every morning. Servants called Olga and her siblings {{by their first names}} and patronyms rather than by their imperial titles. However, Olga's governess and tutors also noted some of the autocratic impulses of the daughter of the Tsar of All the Russias, one of the wealthiest men in the world. On a visit to a museum where state carriages were on display, Olga once ordered one of the servants to prepare the largest and most beautiful carriage for her daily drive. Her wishes were not honored, much to the relief of her governess, Margaretta Eagar. She also felt the rights of eldest children should be protected. When she was told the Biblical story of Joseph and his coat of many colors, she sympathized with the eldest brothers rather than Joseph. She also sympathized with Goliath rather than David in the Biblical story of David and Goliath. When her French tutor, Pierre Gilliard, was teaching her the formation of French verbs and the use of auxiliaries, ten-year-old Olga responded, [...] "I see, monsieur. The auxiliaries are the servants of the verbs. It's only poor 'avoir' which has to shift for itself." ...|$|E
