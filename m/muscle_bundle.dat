50|$|Trigger points form only in muscles. They form {{as a local}} {{contraction}} in a {{small number}} of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or <b>muscle</b> <b>bundle.</b> These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed, the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH. These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region. This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive (pain) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction (Travell and Simons 1999).When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor. Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap, and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them.|$|E
50|$|Non-synaptic {{transmission}} {{is characteristic of}} autonomic neuroeffector junctions. The essential features are that: the terminal portions of autonomic nerve fibers are varicose and mobile; transmitters are released from varicosities at varying distances from the effector cells; and {{while there is no}} structural post-junctional specialization on effector cells, receptors for neurotransmitters accumulate on cell membranes at close junctions. Besides smooth muscle, autonomic neural control of immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells also involves nonsynaptic transmission.Smooth muscle effectors are bundles rather than single cells, that are connected by gap junctions which allow electrotonic spread of activity between cells. Many smooth muscle cells in a transverse section through a <b>muscle</b> <b>bundle</b> show regions of very close apposition to adjacent cells at which connexins form junctions between the cells. Unlike in cardiac muscle, where gap junctions are confined to the ends of cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle gap junctions occur {{along the length of the}} muscle cells as well as towards their ends. There are small bundles of three to seven varicose axons, partially or wholly enveloped in Schwann-cell sheath, both on the surface of the muscle as well as in the body of smooth muscle bundles. In addition, single varicose axons can be found on the surface and in the muscle bundles, and become divested of Schwann cells in the region of apposition between the varicosities and smooth muscle cells.|$|E

In the following season, his position in the defensive midfield remained competitive and he was often second choice, but he played 27 matches and scored three goals. In the 2011-12 season, he was a regular player and played most of the games over the full season, only interrupted by a forced break for a <b>muscle</b> <b>bundle</b> crack injury in the spring of 2012. On 21 March 2012, Bender signed a new contract with Leverkusen to 2018. In the 2012-13 Bundesliga season, he played 33 games, scored 3 goals and made 6 assists. On 31 October 2013, he extended his contract with Leverkusen until 2019. In the 2013-14 season, he played 29 games and scored three goals in the Bundesliga, despite being injured for the most of September and October and again in the spring of 2014. In the 2014-2015 season, he's comeback to field and played 26 games in Bundesliga, he's made only one goal in this season against SC Paderborn 07.

40|$|To {{investigate}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} transmission of spontaneous Ca 2 + signals in the bladder, changes in intracellular concentrations of Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) were visualized in isolated detrusor smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles</b> of the guinea-pig urinary bladder loaded with a fluorescent Ca 2 + indicator, fura-PE 3 or fluo- 4. Spontaneous increases in [Ca 2 +]i (Ca 2 + transients) preferentially originated along the boundary of <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles</b> and then spread to the other boundary (Ca 2 + waves). The synchronicity of Ca 2 + waves across the bundles was disrupted by 18 β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18 β-GA, 40 μm), carbenoxolone (30 μm) or 2 -aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2 -APB, 50 – 100 μm), while CPA (10 μm), ryanodine (100 μm), xestospongin C (3 μm) and U- 73122 (10 μm) had no effect. Intracellular recordings using two independent microelectrodes demonstrated that 2 -APB (100 μm) blocked electrical coupling between detrusor smooth muscle cells. Nifedipine (10 μm) but not nominal Ca 2 +-free solution diminished the synchronicity of Ca 2 + waves before preventing their generation. Staining for c-kit identified interstitial cells (IC) located along both boundaries of <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles.</b> IC were also scattered amongst smooth muscle cells and were more dominantly distributed in connective tissue between <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles.</b> IC generated nifedipine-resistant spontaneous Ca 2 + transients, which occurred independently of those of smooth muscles. In conclusion, the propagation of Ca 2 + transients in the bladder appears to be exclusively mediated by the spread of action potentials through gap junctions being facilitated by the regenerative nature of L-type Ca 2 + channels, without significant contribution of intracellular Ca 2 + stores. IC in the bladder may modulate {{the transmission of}} Ca 2 + transients originating from smooth muscle cells rather than being the pacemaker of spontaneous activity...|$|R

We hypothesized that hypoxia induces contractile protein dysfunction and that reactive nitrogen species are involved. In addition, we hypothesized that muscle reoxygenation reverses contractile protein dysfunction. In vitro contractility of rat soleus muscle bundles was studied after 30 min of hyperoxia (Po 2 approximately 90 kPa), hypoxia (Po 2 approximately 5 kPa), hypoxia + 30 microM N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), hyperoxia + 30 microM L-NMMA, and hypoxia (30 min) + reoxygenation (15 min). One part of the <b>muscle</b> <b>bundle</b> was used for single fiber contractile measurements and the other part for nitrotyrosine detection. In skinned single fibers, maximal Ca 2 +-activated specific force (Fmax), fraction of strongly attached cross bridges (alphafs), rate constant of force redevelopment (ktr), and myofibrillar Ca 2 + sensitivity were determined. Thirty minutes of hypoxia reduced <b>muscle</b> <b>bundle</b> contractility. In the hypoxic group, single fiber Fmax, alphafs, and ktr were significantly reduced compared with hyperoxic, L-NMMA, and reoxygenation groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Malignant {{hyperthermia}} (MH) is {{triggered by}} halogenated anaesthetics and depolarising muscle relaxants, {{leading to an}} uncontrolled hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. An uncontrolled sarcoplasmic Ca 2 + release is mediated via the ryanodine receptor. A compensatory mechanism of increased sarcoplasmic Ca 2 + -ATPase activity was described in pigs and in transfected cell lines. We hypothesized that inhibition of Ca 2 + reuptake via the sarcoplasmic Ca 2 + -ATPase (SERCA) enhances halothane- and caffeine-induced muscle contractures in MH susceptible more than in non-susceptible skeletal muscle. Methods With informed consent, surplus <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles</b> of 7 MHS (susceptible), 7 MHE (equivocal) and 16 MHN (non-susceptible) classified patients were mounted to an isometric force transducer, electrically stimulated, preloaded and equilibrated. Following 15 min incubation with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) 25 μM, the European MH standard in-vitro-contracture test protocol with caffeine (0. 5; 1; 1. 5; 2; 3; 4 mM) and halothane (0. 11; 0. 22; 0. 44; 0. 66 mM) was performed. Data as median and quartiles; Friedman- and Wilcoxon-test for differences with and without CPA; p Results Initial length, weight, maximum twitch height, predrug resting tension and predrug twitch height of <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles</b> did not differ between groups. CPA increased halothane- and caffeine-induced contractures significantly. This increase was more pronounced in MHS and MHE than in MHN <b>muscle</b> <b>bundles.</b> Conclusion Inhibition of the SERCA activity by CPA enhances halothane- and caffeine-induced contractures especially in MHS and MHE skeletal muscle and may help for the diagnostic assignment of MH susceptibility. The status of SERCA activity may play a significant but so far unknown role in the genesis of malignant hyperthermia. </p...|$|R
