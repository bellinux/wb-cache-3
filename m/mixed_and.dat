40|$|<b>Mixing</b> <b>and</b> loading may be {{the most}} {{hazardous}} activities associated with normal pesticide use. Because of the concentrations and quantities of pesticides involved, accidental releases of pesticides at a <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> loading site pose a high risk of ground and surface water contamination. Also, when you <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> load, you handle a pesticide in its most concentrated form and experience the greatest potential for exposure. To prevent pollution and safeguard human health, the <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> loading of pesticide and the washing and rinsing of equipment should be conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible fashion...|$|R

5|$|Historians' {{assessments}} of the Vengeance's career in Australian service differ. While there is consensus that the type was obsolete, some argue that it nevertheless proved successful.

5|$|An all-transgender netball {{team from}} Indonesia competed at the 1994 Gay Games in New York City. The team {{had been the}} Indonesian {{national}} champions. At the 2000 Gay Games VI in Sydney, netball and volleyball were the two sports with {{the highest rates of}} transgender athletes participating. There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as transgender. They came from places like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Teams with transgender players were allowed to participate in several divisions including men's, <b>mixed</b> <b>and</b> transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, the IFNA {{recognises}} only women's netball. Men's netball teams {{exist in}} some areas but attract less attention from sponsors and spectators. Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams {{to compete in the}} Australian <b>Mixed</b> <b>and</b> Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union. Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike women's netball at elite and national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then <b>mixed</b> <b>and</b> serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made from the dead, eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E

5|$|Depression Quest {{was praised}} by critics for its {{portrayal}} {{of depression and}} its educational value. The game was noted for diverging from mainstream uses of video games as a medium. Popular reception was more <b>mixed,</b> <b>and</b> Quinn received threats and harassment from people who disapproved of the game. False allegations that the game had received a positive review from a journalist {{in a relationship with}} Quinn triggered the Gamergate controversy.|$|E
5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some {{items were}} hard to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, <b>mixed</b> <b>and</b> poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where <b>mixed</b> <b>and</b> open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E
