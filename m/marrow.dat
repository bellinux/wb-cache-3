Witham Fogg (1966) wrote [...] "Courgettes These are really very tender baby <b>marrows</b> which have long been popular in France. ... Cooked and eaten with butter they form a very palatable dish." [...] He devotes a page {{and a half to}} (vegetable) <b>marrows</b> and less than half a page to courgettes, which he clearly regards as something new to Britain.|$|R

5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay.

Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, <b>Marrow</b> (C.maxima <b>Marrow),</b> Show, and Turban.|$|E

5|$|<b>Marrow</b> {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of <b>marrow</b> or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms}} of AML result from the growth of leukemic clone cells, which tends to displace or interfere with the development of normal blood cells in the bone <b>marrow.</b> This leads to neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. The symptoms of AML are, in turn, often due to the low numbers of these normal blood elements. In rare cases, people with AML can develop a chloroma, or solid tumor of leukemic cells outside the bone <b>marrow,</b> which can cause various symptoms depending on its location.|$|E

5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid {{organs are}} absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells.

40|$|Background: Bone {{cancer pain}} seriously affects {{the quality of}} life of cancer patients. Our {{previous}} study found that endogenous formaldehyde was produced by cancer cells metastasized into bone <b>marrows</b> and played an important role in bone cancer pain. However, the mechanism of production of this endogenous formaldehyde by metastatic cancer cells was unknown in bone cancer pain rats. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) is one of the major enzymes catalyzing the production of formaldehyde. The expression of LSD 1 and the concentration of formaldehyde were up-regulated in many high-risk tumors. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether LSD 1 in metastasized MRMT- 1 breast cancer cells in bone <b>marrows</b> participated in the production of endogenous formaldehyde in bone cancer pain rats. Methodology/Principal Findings: Concentration of the endogenous formaldehyde was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Endogenous formaldehyde dramatically increased in cultured MRMT- 1 breast cancer cells in vitro, in bone <b>marrows</b> and sera of bone cancer pain rats, in tumor tissues and sera of MRMT- 1 subcutaneous vaccination model rats in vivo. Formaldehyde at a concentration as low as the above measured (3 mM) induced pain behaviors in normal rats. The expression of LSD 1 which mainly located in nuclei of cancer cells significantly increased in bone <b>marrows</b> o...|$|R
