40|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>planning</b> (as {{one of the}} key {{components}} of financial planning) is seen as an important solution to investment problems and challenges. Previous research however indicated that compare to men, women are not as confident and knowledgeable about financial and investment matters. As a result, women do not conduct <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> until it is often too late and when they are confronted with a financial crisis or a life predicament such as a divorce or death. Given the lack of research attention focusing on women‟s perceptions of financial and <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> in South Africa, and in particular the Eastern Cape, the objective of this research is to investigate the factors that influence women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> in the Nelson Mandela Bay area. After conducting a comprehensive literature study, seven factors (independent variables) namely Values, Attitudes, Time horizon, Personal life cycle, Risks and Returns, Investment Knowledge, were identified as influencing the Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> (dependent variable) of women. Various hypotheses were formulated to be tested in the empirical investigation. The validity and reliability of the measuring instrument were tested among 207 respondents. The Exploratory Factor Analysis, as well as the Cronbach‟s alpha coeffient analysis, revelead that Investment knowledge, Personal life cycle and Values are important factors that influence the women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> As a result of these analyses, the hypotheses had to be reformulated. In order to establish whether correlations existed between the various factors investigated in this study, Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficients were calculated. Positive correlations were found between all the variables, except between Values and Personal life cycle and between Values and Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> To analyse the association in which the effects of the independent variables (Investment knowledge, Personal life cycle and Values) have on the dependent variable (Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning)</b> of this study, multiple regression analysis was conducted. Only one independent variable emerged as having a significant influence on Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> of women, namely Investment knowledge. In order to investigate the influence of the various demographic variables on the dependent variable, an Analysis of Variance was performed. No {{significant differences were found between}} the selected demographic variables, namely Age, Ethnic group, Marital status, Education and Investment experience and the independent variables or dependent variable of this study. By investigating the influence of women‟s Perceived successful <b>investment</b> <b>planning,</b> this study has added to the body of knowledge of both financial and <b>investment</b> <b>planning.</b> Based on the empirical results of this study, several recommendations have been made in an attempt to assist women to make better investment decisions and manage their <b>investment</b> <b>planning</b> more effectively...|$|R
