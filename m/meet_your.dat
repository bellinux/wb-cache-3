25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them <b>meet</b> <b>your</b> economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to <b>meet</b> <b>your</b> requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you to change your minds.

500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we <b>meet</b> <b>your</b> Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot.

It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to <b>meet</b> <b>your</b> needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want."

500|$|With the {{assistance}} of scriptwriter Tony Williamson, Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, had drafted a 194-page treatment long before the initial meeting with Kanter. The Andersons had originally intended to film the script as a one-hour drama for ATV; Sylvia explained that since the concept [...] "was too good for a television play, I suggested to Gerry {{that we try to}} develop it as a movie." [...] Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had [...] "dark" [...] scripting, Gerry stated that he wanted the film to have an interesting and entertaining premise. He also discussed the significance of the title, which was suggested to him by Century 21 co-director John Read: Doppelgänger being [...] "a German word which means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you <b>meet</b> <b>your</b> doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word." ...|$|E
500|$|David O. Selznick {{watched her}} {{performances}} that month in Fire Over England and A Yank at Oxford {{and thought that}} she was excellent but in no way a possible Scarlett because she was [...] "too British". Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, [...] "Hey, genius, <b>meet</b> <b>your</b> Scarlett O'Hara." [...] The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife, [...] "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's [...] "incredible wildness". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.|$|E
