25|$|Since the mid 20th century, modern {{urbanisation}} {{has transformed}} much of Penang Island. Skyscrapers and high-rises {{have sprung up}} all over the city, sometimes side-by-side with heritage buildings. Notable examples include the KOMTAR tower, and the Gurney Paragon Towers. Continuing urbanisation has also led to the <b>mushrooming</b> of residential high-rises in the suburbs of George Town.|$|E
25|$|Since {{worship of}} this image has been, and {{to a large extent}} still is, clandestine, most rituals are {{performed}} in altars constructed at the homes of devotees. Recently shrines to this image have been <b>mushrooming</b> in public. The one on Dr. Vertiz Street in Colonia Doctores is unique in Mexico City because it features an image of Jesús Malverde along with Santa Muerte. Another public shrine is in a small park on Matamoros Street very close to Paseo de la Reforma.|$|E

50|$|Both {{of these}} <b>mushrooms</b> can be {{confused}} {{with each other and}} many incidents of <b>mushroom</b> poisoning have occurred where inexperienced <b>mushroom</b> hunters have confused these <b>mushrooms</b> with edible <b>mushrooms,</b> such as the chanterelle, or hallucinogenic <b>mushrooms.</b> Extreme care should be taken when picking <b>mushrooms</b> like the cleaned funnel chanterelles as these <b>mushrooms</b> share the same habitat as the deadly webcap and the fool's webcap.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{production}} of oak <b>mushrooms</b> has steadily increased in Korea, but the <b>mushroom</b> market is plagued {{with a wave}} of falling prices and intensified competition as imports of Chinese oak <b>mushrooms</b> increase. Imported Chinese oak <b>mushrooms</b> are mostly grown on sawdust blocks, which are costly in Korea because of higher labor costs and log prices. <b>Mushroom</b> farmers, therefore, strive to seek ways to compete with Chinese oak <b>mushrooms,</b> and the use of broad-leaved tree species is under consideration to promote sawdust-based <b>mushroom</b> cultivation. Korean oak <b>mushrooms</b> are expected to be more competitive when they are grown on sawdust rather than log while imports of Chinese <b>mushrooms</b> are still limited due to difficulties sustaining freshness. However, there are some obstacles such as the acquisition of superior strains of <b>mushroom</b> to promote sawdust cultivation of oak <b>mushroom.</b> Thus, The study investigated the status of production and sales of oak <b>mushroom</b> and the intent of <b>mushroom</b> farmers toward <b>mushroom</b> culture in wooden trays by conducting a questionnaire survey involving <b>mushroom</b> farmers in the two cities in Gyeonggi Province. Results of the study revealed that there were differences in production volume and revenue per oak log between <b>mushroom</b> farmers in the two areas. Many farmers showed distrustful reactions towards strains distributed because of frequent loss and damages caused by purchased strains. It is, therefore, necessary to encourage farmers to increase productivity by standardizing culture techniques and supplying good strains of <b>mushrooms.</b> More farmers in Hwasung City are interested in <b>mushroom</b> cultivation in wooden trays, but farmers in Yongin City were less enthusiastic about <b>mushroom</b> cultivation in wooden trays after witnessing failures of other farmers. The findings of the study signifies the need for introducing effects of <b>mushroom</b> culture in wooden trays among <b>mushroom</b> farmers, and developing superior strains of <b>mushrooms</b> to promote <b>mushroom</b> growth using wooden trays...|$|R
25|$|During the British colonial era, English was the {{official}} language in Penang. This was helped by the <b>mushrooming</b> of missionary schools throughout George Town, all of which used English as their medium of instruction and were held in high esteem by the locals. Most Penangites still maintain reasonable command of the language. While British English is formally used, spoken English usually {{takes the form of}} Manglish. Notably, George Town is the only city in Malaysia that retains most of its English street names, as can be seen on the multi-lingual street signs in the city.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November, Seahorse skillfully maneuvered {{past three}} enemy escorts, {{launched}} four torpedoes from periscope depth, and sank the cargo ship, Daishu Maru. On 26 November, the submarine contacted another enemy convoy {{and began to}} close the range. Determined to mount an attack before the targets entered the mined Tsushima Strait, the submarine launched four torpedoes at long range quickly sinking a cargo ship; and then, dodging enemy escorts, let go four stern shots at a second target. The results seemed disappointing—until a sudden blast sent flames and debris <b>mushrooming</b> high into the air, completely destroying the 7,309-ton tanker, San Ramon Maru.|$|E
25|$|The Ptolemaic {{approach}} of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: {{there seemed to}} be no end to the <b>mushrooming</b> growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler was the first person to abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{growth was}} uneven in the 1980s. Restructuring {{of the economy}} and the {{rebuilding}} immediately following {{the end of the civil}} war caused the GDP to rise about 5 percent in 1980 and 1981. Each year from 1984 to 1990, however, showed a drop in the GDP. Reasons for the contraction included the reluctance of foreign banks to offer new loans, the diversion of funds to fight the new insurrection against the government, and, after 1985, the total embargo on trade with the United States, formerly Nicaragua's largest trading partner. After 1985 the government chose to fill the gap between decreasing revenues and <b>mushrooming</b> military expenditures by printing large amounts of paper money. Inflation rose rapidly, peaking in 1988 at more than 14,000 percent annually.|$|E
25|$|In {{the south}} {{the capital of}} the Presbyterian special {{settlement}} was <b>mushrooming</b> into a frontier city. Mason formed a partnership with David Ross (1827–1908) a Scottish-born Fellow of the Institute of British Architects who was already resident. There now followed numerous projects and a series of changing partnerships. The one with Ross was dissolved early in 1863. Of numerous small commissions the Dunedin Public Warehouse, for William Dalrymple, now 386 Princes Street, is a more substantial example. A three story building in brick it has a vigorously modelled street front with emphatic quoining used to define the edges and apertures of the facade. Those around the windows rise to form round-topped columns. There are echoes here of the fenestration of the second Government House but the relative simplicity and strength of the Dunedin building shows the designer his own master again and possessed of a corresponding new confidence.|$|E
25|$|The pre-war {{houses in}} the {{historic}} centre of George Town was protected from urban development by to the Rent Control Act which prohibited landlords from arbitrarily raising rentals as a measure to provide affordable housing to the low-income population. Its eventual repeal in 2001 visibly changed the landscape of Penang's demographic pattern and economic activity: it led to overnight appreciation of house and real estate prices, forcing out tenants of multiple generations {{out of their homes}} to the city outskirts and the development of new townships and hitherto sparsely populated areas of Penang; the demolition of many pre-war houses and the <b>mushrooming</b> of high-rise residences and office buildings; and the emptying out and dilapidation of many areas in the city centre. Unperturbed development sparked concerns of the continued existence of heritage buildings and Penang's collection of pre-War houses (Southeast Asia's largest), leading to more vigorous conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made to increase human capital base through improved education system, still the quality of education experience is low and unequally distributed. Due to lack of good quality education at the basic and secondary levels, there has been a <b>mushrooming</b> market for private tutoring. Now to take private tuition has become more of an obligation than a remedial activity. According to the Egypt Human Development Report (2005), 58 percent of surveyed families stated that their children take private tutoring. The CAPMAS (2004) survey showed that households spend on average around 61 percent of total education expenditure on private tutoring. In addition, per household expenditure of the richest quintile on private tutoring is more than seven times that of the poorest. Among the issues is the lack of sufficient education in public schools and the need for private tuition. As of 2005, 61-70% of Egyptian students attend private tuition. Other common issues include: theft of public educational funds and leakage of exams.|$|E
25|$|Tek {{was born}} to a Turkish father and an American mother {{and grew up in}} Ann Arbor, Michigan, a {{university}} town near Detroit where Tek was exposed to Motor City music icons such as MC5, The Stooges and The Rationals. In the late '60s Ann Arbor became somewhat of a nexus for rock music, hosting festivals which drew performers from all around the world such as Pink Floyd, Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, Captain Beefheart, and a personal favourite of Tek's, The Rolling Stones. Headlining world acts such as The Rolling Stones aside, Tek was heavily influenced by the <b>mushrooming</b> local underground scene of Ann Arbor, which included bands such as The Frost, Mitch Ryder, Carnal Kitchen with Steve Mackay, The Up, The SRC plus jazz greats Pharoah Sanders, Sun Ra, Archie Shepp and Yusef Lateef. In 1971 Tek left the rock metropolis of Ann Arbor to pursue his medical studies in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Katanga, however, South Kasai's secession did not {{explicitly}} mean {{the rejection of}} its position within the Republic of the Congo. Rather, it resembled the self-declared local governments in Équateur Province. The [...] "Autonomous State" [...] title was chosen in order to re-enforce {{the impression that the}} secession was not a rejection of Congolese sovereignty, but the creation of a federally-governed region of the Congo. The secession had some support among journalists, intellectuals and politicians in Léopoldville, with one newspaper calling it [...] "a model by which the many new states now <b>mushrooming</b> in the Congo might form a new federation". In practice South Kasai had considerably more independence than a regular province and, by mandating its own federated powers unilaterally, was effectively seceding from the Congo.
