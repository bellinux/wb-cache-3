5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric <b>motor</b> <b>running</b> a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, {{as part of}} {{the buildup}} to The Play's 25th anniversary, the Bay Area News Group asked Verle Sorgen, the Pac-10 Conference's {{supervisor}} of instant replay, to review the two disputed laterals according to modern NCAA instant replay review rules. (Sorgen was not asked to rule on the larger issue of the Stanford band's outside interference.) After watching enhanced footage on a modern, large-screen monitor, Sorgen opined that there was insufficient video evidence to overturn the third lateral, from Garner to Rodgers. However, Sorgen believed that the fifth lateral from Ford to Moen [...] "was released at the 22 and touched at the 20-1/2 (sic). From that, it clearly appears forward."

Marlowe visits them and learns {{the name and address}} of the detective they hired to investigate their daughter's death and that Dr. Almore's nurse was named Mildred Haviland. They also tell him that Almore is a [...] "dope" [...] doctor and that they believe he killed their daughter by drugging her and then putting her in the garage with the <b>motor</b> <b>running</b> on her car. The detective they hired was charged with drunk driving, spent 6 months in jail and is now not in contact with them. Marlowe visits the detective, who is not at his modest home, and is rebuffed by the detective's wife, who says that [...] "they" [...] have been there. Marlowe notices someone looking at his car and upon leaving realises he is being followed. He is confronted by the police again, who force him to drink liquor, beat him up and arrest him for speeding, resisting arrest and drunk driving, charges similar to those levelled against the parents' detective. Marlowe talks to a police captain, Webber, who treats him decently for a Bay City policeman, and although Webber isn't convinced by Marlowe's theories on the case, he is convinced that Marlowe is mostly telling him the truth, and he turns him loose.|$|E
