Antistasin is a polypeptide and a potent Xa inhibitor. In 1990 another naturally occurring Xa inhibitor was isolated, tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) from extracts of the tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata.</b> TAP and antistasin were used to estimate factor Xa as a drug target.|$|E

ASF virus was isolated from ticks collected in both domestic pig sties and houses in certain villages in Mchinji district where ASF outbreaks had recently occurred. Mchinji district is in the centre of a large ASF enzootic area which stretches into other districts of Malawi and also into Zambia and Mozambique.

40|$|A. persicus is a {{transmitting}} {{agent of}} Aegyptianella pullorum to fowls. The disease was successfully transmitted to 9 healthy chickens by adult ticks which had previously fed on infected chickens. Moreover, the tick can retain its infection after feeding on a healthy bird, as one adult transmitted the disease twice to healthy chickens. The shortest interval between feeding on an infected bird {{and a healthy}} chicken was 26 days. The incubation period in chickens after an infected tick has bitten varies from 12 to 15 days or more. An infected adult A. persicus may remain infected for at least 162 days. A. pullorum is apparently not transmitted by either Argas <b>moubata</b> or A. perengueyi, as four adults of A. <b>moubata</b> {{and two or three}} adults of A. perengueyi failed to transmit the disease to healthy chickens after having fed on infected birds.

40|$|African {{swine fever}} (ASF) {{is caused by}} African swine fever virus (ASFV), a tick-borne DNA virus. Soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros are the only {{biological}} vectors of ASFV recognized so far. Although other hard ticks have been tested for vector competence, two commonly found tick species in Europe, Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus, have not been assessed for their vector competence for ASFV. In this study, we aimed to determine whether virus replication can occur {{in any of these}} two hard tick species (I. ricinus and/or D. reticulatus), in comparison with O. <b>moubata</b> (the confirmed vector), after feeding them blood containing different ASFV isolates using an improved in vitro system. DNA quantities of ASFV in these infected hard ticks were measured systematically, for 6 weeks in I. ricinus, and up to 8 weeks in D. reticulatus, and the results were compared to those obtained from O. <b>moubata.</b> There was evidence of virus replication in the O. <b>moubata</b> ticks. However, {{there was no evidence of}} virus replication in I. ricinus or D. reticulatus, even though viral DNA could be detected for up to 8 weeks after feeding in some cases. This study presents the first results on the possible vector competence of European hard (ixodid) ticks for ASFV, in a validated in vitro feeding setup. In conclusion, given the lack of evidence for virus replication under in vitro conditions, D. reticulatus and I. ricinus are unlikely to be relevant biological vectors of ASFV. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Ecdysteroidogenesis is {{essential}} for arthropod development and reproduction. Although the importance of ecdysteroids has been demonstrated, there is little information on the sites and enzymes for synthesis of ecdysteroids from Chelicerates. Ecdysteroid functions have been well studied in the soft tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata,</b> making this species an excellent candidate for elucidating ecdysteroidogenesis in Chelicerates. Results showed that O. <b>moubata</b> has at least two ecdysteroidogenic enzymes, Spook (OmSpo) and Shade (OmShd). RNAi showed both enzymes were required for ecdysteroidogenesis. Enzymatic assays demonstrated OmShd has the conserved functions of ecdysone 20 -hydroxylase. OmSpo showed specific expression in the ovaries of final nymphal and adult stages, indicating O. <b>moubata</b> utilizes the ovary as an ecdysteroidogenic tissue instead of specific tissues as seen in other arthropods. On the other hand, OmShd expression was observed in various tissues including the midgut, indicating functional ecdysteroids can be produced in these tissues. In nymphal stages, expression of both OmSpo and OmShd peaked before molting corresponding with high ecdysteroid titers in the hemolymph. In fed adult females, OmSpo expression peaked at 8 - 10 days after engorgement, while OmShd expression peaked immediately after engorgement. Mated females showed more frequent surges of OmShd than virgin females. These {{results indicate that the}} regulation of synthesis of ecdysteroids differs in nymphs and adult females, and mating modifies adult female ecdysteroidogenesis. This is the first report to focus on synthesis of ecdysteroids in ticks and provides essential knowledge for understanding the evolution of ecdysteroidogenesis in arthropods...|$|E
40|$|The saliva of blood-feeding parasites is a {{rich source}} of {{peptidase}} inhibitors that help to overcome the host's defence during host-parasite interactions. Using proteomic analysis, the cystatin OmC 2 was demonstrated in the saliva of the soft tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata,</b> an important disease vector transmitting African swine fever virus and the spirochaete Borrelia duttoni. A structural, biochemical and biological characterization of this peptidase inhibitor was undertaken in the present study. Recombinant OmC 2 was screened against a panel of physiologically relevant peptidases and was found to be an effective broad-specificity inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, including endopeptidases (cathepsins L and S) and exopeptidases (cathepsins B, C and H). The crystal structure of OmC 2 was determined at a resolution of 2. 45 A (1 A= 0. 1 nm) and was used to describe the structure-inhibitory activity relationship. The biological impact of OmC 2 was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. OmC 2 affected the function of antigen-presenting mouse dendritic cells by reducing the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 12, and proliferation of antigen-specific CD 4 + T-cells. This suggests that OmC 2 may suppress the host's adaptive immune response. Immunization of mice with OmC 2 significantly suppressed the survival of O. <b>moubata</b> in infestation experiments. We conclude that OmC 2 is a promising target {{for the development of a}} novel anti-tick vaccine to control O. <b>moubata</b> populations and combat the spread of associated diseases...|$|E

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in Madagascar in 1998, African swine fever (ASF) has severely affected national pig production and persists {{as a common}} disease in that country. Two of its natural hosts in the African continent, the bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) and tick vectors of the Ornithodoros <b>moubata</b> complex, are reported in west and central regions of the island. However, {{their role in the}} maintenance and transmission of the virus has been insufficiently studied. In this work, we tried to assess their potential role in the epidemiology of the disease in Madagascar, by assessing the levels of interaction between (i) ASF virus (ASFV) and bushpigs and (ii) between soft ticks and domestic and wild suids in north-western Madagascar. Twenty-seven sera and 35 tissue samples from bushpigs were collected and analysed for the presence of anti-ASF antibodies and viral DNA. In addition, the sera from 27 bushpigs and 126 domestic pigs were analysed with an ELISA test for the detection of antibodies against salivary antigens from Ornithodoros ticks. No circulation of ASFV or anti-ASFV antibodies nor anti-tick antibodies were detected in bushpigs. However, seven of the domestic pig sera (5. 6 % of the total sample population) were antibody positive for O. <b>moubata</b> antigens. The probability of freedom from ASFV in the bushpig population using Bayesian statistical methods ranged between 73 % and 84 %. The probabilities of absence of anti-tick antibodies in domestic and wild pigs were estimated at 63 % and 71 %, respectively. These preliminary results suggest that bushpigs are unlikely to {{play a significant role in}} the maintenance and transmission of ASFV in Madagascar. Nevertheless, further ASFV surveys are needed on that species to confirm this assumption. In addition, the presence of antibodies against O. <b>moubata</b> in domestic pigs suggests that soft ticks may be able to maintain ASFV within a domestic pig cycle in areas of Madagascar where they remain present.

40|$|Background] The argasid tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata</b> is {{the main}} African vector of the human {{relapsing}} fever agent Borrelia duttoni and the African swine fever virus. Together with saliva, the tick midgut forms part of the host-tick-pathogen interface, and numerous midgut proteins play key functions in the blood digestion-related process and the infection and transmission of pathogens. This work explores {{the composition of the}} midgut proteome of unfed and fed O. <b>moubata</b> females with the aim to complete the biological information already obtained from the midgut transcriptome and provide a more robust and comprehensive perspective of this biological system. [Methods] Midgut tissues taken from females before feeding and 48 h after feeding were subjected to LC/MS-MS analysis. After functional characterization and classification of the proteins identified, the differences in the proteome between unfed and fed females were analysed and discussed. Additionally, a detailed analysis of particular groups of proteins that are involved in the processes of nutrient digestion and responses to the oxidative stress was carried out. [Results] 1491 non-redundant tick proteins were identified: 1132 of them in the midgut of unfed ticks, 1138 in the midgut of fed ticks, and up to 779 shared by both physiological conditions. Overall, the comparative analysis of the midgut proteomes of O. <b>moubata</b> females before and after feeding did not reveal great differences in the number or class of proteins expressed, enzymatic composition or functional classification. [Conclusions] The hemoglobinolytic system in ixodids and argasids is very similar {{in spite of the fact}} that they display very different feeding and reproductive strategies. Although the main source of nutrients in ticks are proteins, lipids and carbohydrates also constitute significant nutritional sources and play an important part in the process of blood digestion. The genes and proteins involved in intracellular transport mechanisms, defensive responses, detoxifying responses and stress responses seem to be closely regulated, highlighting the complexity and importance of these processes in tick biology, which in turn assigns them a great interest as targets for therapeutic and immunological interventions.

40|$|The presence, {{internal}} distribution, and phylogenetic {{position of}} endosymbiotic bacteria from four species of specific-pathogen-free ticks were studied. These included the hard ticks Ixodes scapularis (the black-legged tick), Rhipicephalus sanguineus (the brown dog tick), and Haemaphysalis longicornis and the African soft tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata.</b> PCR assays for bacteria, using {{two sets of}} general primers for eubacterial 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes (rDNAs) and seven sets of specific primers for wolbachial, rickettsial, or Francisella genes, indicated that I. scapularis possessed symbiotic rickettsiae in the ovaries and that the other species harbored eubacteria in both the ovaries and Malpighian tubules. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence of 16 S rDNA indicated that the symbiont of I. scapularis belonged to the alpha subgroup of proteobacteria and was {{closely related to the}} members of the genus Rickettsia. The other species had similar microorganisms in the ovaries and Malpighian tubules, which belonged to the gamma subgroup of proteobacteria, and formed a monophyletic group with the Q-fever pathogen, Coxiella burnetii. O. <b>moubata</b> harbored another symbiont, which formed a monophyletic group with Francisella tularensis and Wolbachia persica, the latter a symbiont previously isolated from Malpighian tubules of the soft tick Argas (Persicargas) arboreus. Thus, the symbionts of these four tick species were not related to the Wolbachia species found in insects.

40|$|The fate of {{injected}} [3 H]ecdysone ([3 H]E) and 20 -hydroxy-[3 H]ecdysone ([3 H] 20 E) {{has been}} investigated in the female tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata</b> (Murray, 1877; sensu Walton, 1962). When injected into fed mated vitellogenic females, [3 H]E is converted into [3 H] 20 E and two apolar classes of metabolites, AP 1 and AP 2. Injected [3 H] 20 E is directly converted into AP 1 and AP 2. AP 2 is incorporated into the ovaries in a high proportion {{and at the end}} of the vitellogenic cycle represents about 25 % of the total label recovered from the animal. The fate of labeled hormones injected into virgin females which perform an abortive vitellogenic cycle is quite similar. However, the ovaries incorporated less of the AP 2 products. Ovaries of mated females cultured in vitro in the presence of [3 H]E are able to produce [3 H] 20 E and AP 2. AP 2 is incorporated, while [3 H] 20 E is mainly found in the medium. Ovaries of virgin females presented a slower rate of transformation and of incorporation of the label. Labeled AP 2 is recovered in freshly laid eggs and AP 1 in the females after oviposition. AP 1 and AP 2 can produce [3 H] 20 E, [3 H]E, and other minor polar peaks when submitted to hydrolysis by esterase. It is concluded that the female O. <b>moubata</b> possesses a special enzymatic mechanism for transformation of ecdysteroids into apolar products and for selective incorporation of AP 2 into the ovaries.

40|$|Blood-feeding ticks must control C {{activation}} or {{be damaged}} by the host inflammatory response. We report the characterization and expression of a novel, relatively small, broad-acting C inhibitory protein (termed OmCI) from the soft tick Ornithodoros <b>moubata.</b> The native 17 -kDa nonglycosylated protein inhibits both human and guinea pig classical and alternative C activation pathways. The IC 50 values for each pathway were 12 and 27 nM, respectively, in hemolytic assays using human serum diluted 40 -fold. The cDNA encodes a protein of 168 aa, including an 18 -aa secretion signal sequence that is absent in the mature form. The inhibitor has 46 % amino acid identity with moubatin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor also from O. <b>moubata</b> that is an outlying member of the lipocalin family. Native OmCI had no inhibitory effect on the addition of C 8 and C 9 to preformed C 5 b-C 7 and C 5 b-C 8 to form the membrane attack complex and {{no effect on the}} rate of C 3 a production by the C 3 convertase enzymes C 4 bC 2 a, C 3 (H 2 O) Bb, or C 3 bBb. Both recombinant and native OmCI abolish production of C 5 a by human classical (C 4 bC 3 bC 2 a) and alternative (C 3 bC 3 bBb) C 5 convertases. Addition of excess C 5 but not C 3 competes away the inhibitory activity of OmCI, indicating that OmCI targets C 5 itself rather than inhibiting the C 5 convertase C 4 bC 3 bC 2 a itself. Direct binding of OmCI to C 5 was demonstrated by Western blotting and gel filtration chromatography using 125 I-labeled proteins. OmCI is the first lipocalin family member shown to inhibit C and also the first natural inhibitor that specifically targets the C 5 activation step...|$|E
