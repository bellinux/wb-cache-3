50|$|In 1947, Varian Associates {{started the}} modern <b>microwave</b> <b>tube</b> {{industry}} and by 1958 {{there were some}} 30 U.S. companies involved with microwave tubes. Consolidations began during the mid-1960s and continued through the 1980s. Four California companies, Litton, Varian, Hughes and Teledyne emerged as the survivors. Varian became Communication Power Industries (CPI). Litton was acquired first by Northrop Grumman which continued operating the company as Litton and months later sold it to L-3 communications. Hughes was acquired by GM, Boeing and finally L-3. In 2012, L3 announced the closure of its California Tube Labs division in Watsonville, CA and moved the assets to their San Carlos and Williamsport, PA facilities. In mid-2016, L3 announced they were again consolidating their microwave products companies {{with most of the}} Electron Devices, San Carlos, CA facility as well as the name moving to the former Hughes facility located in southern California. The new company would be known as L3, Electron Devices Division, thereby returning the initials EDD to the Torrance facility and closing the legacy Litton Electron Tube factory. On 31 December 2016, L3's company name changed from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc.

In 1959 Bob Coulson established Traveling-wave tube and <b>Microwave</b> <b>tube</b> sections and they were producing ceramic hydrogen thyratrons as well.

In 1962, EEV opened its first office in America in Buffalo, NY. The company has received 13 Queen's Awards for Technology in its history, most recently in 2006 for low light imaging devices and in 2004 for thyratrons for cancer radiotherapy treatment. Also, in 1972, they opened an office in Paris, France and in 1977 they opened another office in NY but this time in Elmsford.

40|$|Abstract: Electron {{cyclotron}} heating (ECH) assist {{has been}} demonstrated to significantly improve startup performance of tokamaks by decreasing the loop voltage, which translates into ramp current rates {{higher than those of}} pure Ohmic startup at equivalent loop voltages. This has been observed on several machines that normally rely on the use of gyrotrons or an assembly of klystrons to produce such beneficial effects at particular electron cyclotron resonance frequencies. However, specific RF source requirements in terms of frequency and power demand specially customized designs, leading to costly industrial tubes. In light of these considerations, pre-ionization and plasma production on the ETE spherical tokamak of LAP/INPE are currently being pursued {{on the basis of the}} monotron, which, consisting of an electron beam that traverses a standing-wave cavity resonator, ranks as the simplest <b>microwave</b> <b>tube.</b> Thus describing the design, construction techniques and simulation results of a high-power <b>microwave</b> <b>tube,</b> the present paper reports on a proof-of-principle monotron experiment currently under way at our laboratory. 1...|$|E
