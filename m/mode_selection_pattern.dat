40|$|Intra-frame <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> and inter-frame <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> are new {{features}} {{introduced in the}} H. 264 standard. Intra-frame <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> dramatically reduces spatial redundancy in I-frames, while inter-frame <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> significantly affects the output quality of P-/B-frames by selecting an optimal block size with motion vector(s) or a mode for each macroblock. Unfortunately, this feature requires a myriad amount of encoding time especially when a brute force full-search method is utilised. In this paper, we propose fast <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms tailored for both intra-frames and inter-frames. The success of the intra-frame algorithm is achieved by reducing the computational complexity of the Lagrangian rate-distortion optimisation evaluation. Two proposed fast inter-frame mode algorithms incorporate several robust and reliable predictive factors, including intrinsic complexity of the macroblock, mode knowledge from the previous frame(s), temporal similarity detection and the detection of different moving features within a macroblock. This information is used {{to reduce the number}} of search operations. Extensive simulations on different classes of test sequences demonstrate a speed up in encoding time of up to 86 % compared with the H. 264 1 benchmark.

Different from the existing <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> schemes where the decision on <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> is made based only on the D 2 D link distance (i. e., distance between two UEs using D 2 D mode of communication), the proposed <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> scheme for a UE accounts for both the D 2 D link distance and cellular link distance (i. e., distance between the UE and the BS).

The analysis pays specific attention to the competition between the two lowest order modes (LP 01 and LP 11 degenerate modes) appropriate to the chosen circularly symmetric VCSEL structure.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to provide a}} low-complexity rate-distortion optimal coding <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> method in digital video encoding. To achieve optimal compression efficiency in the rate-distortion framework with low computational complexity, we first propose a rate-distortion model and then apply it to the coding <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> problem. The computational complexity of the proposed method is very low compared to overall encoder complexity because the proposed method uses simple image properties such as variance that can be obtained easily. Also, the proposed method gives significant PSNR gains over the <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> scheme used in TM 5 for MPEG- 2 because the rate-distortion model considers rate constraints of each mode as well as distortion. We extend the model-based <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> approach to motion vector selection for further improvement of the coding efficiency. In addition to our theoretical work, we present practical solutions to real-time implementation of encoder modules including our proposed <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> method on digital signal processors.

30|$|Most of {{existing}} works {{focused on the}} performance of primary system and secondary system in cognitive relay networks or opportunistic relaying <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> in a cooperative relay network, but rarely consider opportunistic relaying <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> in cognitive relay networks. [29] studied the opportunistic relaying <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> in an underlay spectrum sharing system, but focused on the outage performance. In this work, an opportunistic HD/FD relaying <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> criterion in a cognitive relay network is proposed where a secondary transmitter acts as a cooperative relay to assist the transmission of primary system, {{in order to get a}} high throughput of secondary system under the interference constraint of primary system and transmission power constraints. This opportunistic relaying <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> criterion not only utilizes the throughput advantage of FD but also weakens the negative effect of self-interference. In case of reliable communications in the primary system, the secondary system can achieve maximum throughput. Though both this work and earlier works [23, 29, 33] studied opportunistic HD/FD relaying <b>mode</b> <b>selection</b> through <b>mode</b> switching, they are quite different in several aspects. Firstly, in this work, we consider a cognitive relay network but in [23, 29, 33] authors considered a three-node relay network, another kind of cognitive relay network, and a relay-aided cellular network, respectively. Secondly, in this work, the switching between HD and FD is based on the residual self-interference power but in [23, 29] and [33] the switching was based on the maximum channel capacity and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, respectively. Thirdly, in this work the goal is to maximize the throughput of secondary system but in [23, 29, 33], the goals were to maximize the spectral efficiency, the outage probability, and the energy efficiency, respectively.|$|R
