25|$|Government {{officials}} {{stated that}} the shipping container could not be <b>cleared</b> <b>through</b> <b>customs,</b> as proper procedures had not been followed. The Sierra Leonean government refused to pay the shipping fee of $6,500. New York Times noted {{that the government had}} already received well over $40 million in cash from international donors to fight Ebola. The New York Times noted that in the 2 months that the shipping container remained on the docks in Freetown, health workers in Sierra Leone endured severe shortages of protective supplies, with some nurses having to wear street clothes.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{country has}} its own laws and {{regulations}} for the import and export of goods {{into and out of}} a country, which its customs authority enforces. The import or export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden. [...] In most countries, <b>customs</b> are attained <b>through</b> government agreements and international laws. A customs duty is a tariff or tax on the importation (usually) or exportation (unusually) of goods. Commercial goods not yet <b>cleared</b> <b>through</b> <b>customs</b> are held in a customs area, often called a bonded store, until processed. All authorized ports are recognized customs areas.|$|R

In October 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that the LEMV project was 10 months behind schedule due to a combination of factors, including issues with fabric production, foreign components being <b>cleared</b> <b>through</b> <b>customs,</b> and the impact of adverse weather conditions.|$|R

50|$|The buyer may obtain {{possession}} {{of goods and}} <b>clear</b> them <b>through</b> <b>customs,</b> if the buyer has the shipping documents (original bill of lading, certificate of origin, etc.).

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that firms can reduce fixed trade costs by hiring {{intermediaries}} like trading companies. I argue that customs brokers – a type of intermediary rarely studied in economics before – can play a similar role. Using panel data of Norwegian trade transactions, I show that such brokers are commonly used to <b>clear</b> goods <b>through</b> <b>customs.</b> I find indications of lower sunk costs as well as fixed trade costs for firms that hire such services. However, engaging brokers can be risky, and traders in high-risk products like food {{are more likely to}} self-declare. Results are similar for importing and exporting, indicating that customs brokers facilitate both modes of trade...|$|R

5000|$|Rasst shipped {{the arms}} to Odessa {{but did not}} appear there in time to <b>clear</b> it <b>through</b> <b>customs.</b> As a result, the Russian {{government}} seized the consignment. Rasst {{with the help of}} the Russian embassy in Washington was able to get the shipment released and sent to Hamburg. However, there Rasst could not pay for the freight charges resulting in the German government impounding the shipment. Money from the American financier and Huerta supporter John Wesley De Kay finally achieved a release. The arms now went to Havana with German-made Mauser rifles and cartridges added to it. The arms on Ypiranga required [...] "three trains of ten cars each" [...] to unload.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} consideration for DDP terms {{is that the}} seller is responsible for <b>clearing</b> the goods <b>through</b> <b>customs</b> in the buyer's country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless {{the rules and regulations}} in the buyer's country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.|$|R
5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to <b>clear</b> goods <b>through</b> <b>customs.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is no {{obligation}} for the seller {{to make a}} contract of carriage, but there is also {{no obligation}} for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller's warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for <b>clearing</b> the goods <b>through</b> <b>Customs.</b> The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer's request and cost.|$|R

40|$|Pakistan, {{this paper}} investigates the {{relationship}} between investment climate and firm performance. These standardized surveys of large, random samples of firms in common sectors reveal that objective measures of the investment climate vary significantly across countries and across locations within these countries. The authors focus primarily on measures of the time or monetary cost of different bottlenecks (e. g., days to <b>clear</b> goods <b>through</b> <b>customs,</b> days to get a telephone line, sales lost to power outages). For many of these costs, the obstacles are lower in China than in Bangladesh or India, which in turn are superior to Pakistan. There is also systematic variation across cities within countries. The authors estimate a production function for garment firms and show that total factor productivity is systematically related to the investment climate indicators. Factor returns (wages for a given quality of human capital and rate of profit) are also higher where investment climate is better. These higher returns then have dynamic effects: accumulation and growth at the firm level is higher where investment climate is good. * We {{would like to thank}} Aart Kraay, Norman Loayza, and John Sutton for helpful comments on an initial draft of this paper and Sergio Kurlat and Victoria Levin for excellent research assistance.

40|$|Drawing on {{recently}} completed firm-level surveys in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Honduras, India, Nicaragua, Pakistan, and Peru, this paper investigates {{the relationship between}} investment climate and international integration. These standardized surveys of large, random samples of firms in common sectors reveal how firms experience bottlenecks and delays in hard infrastructure such as power and telecom {{as well as in}} soft infrastructure such as customs administration. The authors focus primarily on measures of the time or monetary cost of different bottlenecks (e. g., days to <b>clear</b> goods <b>through</b> <b>customs,</b> days to get a telephone line, sales lost to power outages). For many of these costs, the obstacles are lower in China than in the South Asian or Latin American countries. There is also systematic variation across cities within countries. The authors estimate a probit function for the probability that a randomly chosen firm is foreign-invested and a separate probit for the probability that a randomly chosen firm is an exporter. These measures of international integration are higher where investment climate isbetter. For locations to take advantage of opportunities in the international market, they need good infrastructure and a sound regulatory environment. The interaction of openness and sound investment climate creates a good environment for investment and production. This paper helps explain why China has been so successful over the past decade, both in terms of integration and of rapid growth, while other countries have had varied success.

40|$|Industry {{partnerships}} {{that provide}} meaningful practical learning for students are often {{one of the}} results of the development of a community of practice. The links developed with an external IT solutions organisation enable student to use industry-based software during problem based learning (PBL) activities in the classroom. The curriculum has been enhanced to ensure that the activities closely resemble everyday ‘real-life’ business situations. The practical aspects of the PBL exercises ensure that students are exposed to first hand experience of <b>clearing</b> export cargo <b>through</b> <b>customs</b> and generating the necessary paperwork to comply with barrier control regulations. Although customs clearance is obtained in ‘test mode’ through the external IT solution partner, for the user the process followed is identical to that of a ‘live’ clearance. The additional documentation required for compliance with legislation, and also to satisfy commercial contractual requirements, is generated by the students using specialised software, with the output academically assessed. Students have the additional option of submitting their work for external industry assessment and obtain a proficiency certificate. Such an approach enables the development of a community of practice by linking students, industry and educational institutions to fulfil the common goal of employment ready graduates...|$|R

50|$|In 1984, Rafindadi and the NSO were embrollied in {{controversy}} when the Emir of Gwandu (father of Buhari's ADC Major Mustapha Jokolo) {{and his entourage}} were allegedly allowed to <b>clear</b> 53 suitcases <b>through</b> <b>customs</b> on arrival from a foreign trip. Atiku Abubakar, then the customs Area Administrator at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport went on air to announce the incident in an apparent move to take credit {{and at the same}} time discredit his boss Abubakar Musa, the Director of Customs. Because of the impending currency change in the country at the time, the press went to town with a story alleging that the suitcases had contained hard currency smuggled into the country. The actual culprit at the time was Ambassador Dahiru Waziri, a friend of Rafindadi who had just returned with his family from a posting in Saudi Arabia to resume as the Chief of Protocol in the State House. Waziri had flown in on the same aircraft as the Emir of Gwandu and his luggage had been collected directly from the aircraft by a protocol officer in the State House and ferried directly to the State House without passing <b>through</b> <b>customs.</b> Another member of the Emir of Gwandu's party was Buhari's half brother, which led to the Emir of Daura's (Daura is Buhari's hometown) name being mentioned originally in the press instead of the Emir of Gwandu in an attempt to implicate the Head of State in the affair. In an attempt to protect his friend, Rafindadi later claimed that it was he who had received the suitcases on behalf of a colleague in the diplomatic service and that the suitcases were to have been ostensibly filled with personal effects and not hard currency as alleged by the media.|$|R
