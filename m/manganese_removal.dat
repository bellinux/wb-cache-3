40|$|Conventionally, limestones {{have been}} used in passive mine water {{treatment}} systems. Limestones with the highest proportion of calcite are recommended since they have the greatest long-term alkalinity generating potential. Manganese is present in mine waters and needs to be removed in order to comply with environmental quality standards. This paper compares seven different Permian carbonate rocks, both limestone and dolomite, in their ability to promote manganese oxidation in real mine waters over an 8 -h period. The substrates are characterised using thermogravimetric analysis, X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Fluorescence spectrophotometry is used to monitor any changes in the dissolved organic matter concentration in the water as manganese is removed. We determine that there is no statistically significant correlation between <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> and the proportion of calcite or between <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> and substrate surface roughness. Fluorescence spectrophotometry demonstrates that there is a distinct change in the observed spectra in the water during <b>manganese</b> <b>removal.</b> There is a positive and statistically significant correlation between <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> and the production of a tyrosine-like substance (up to 150 ppb in 8 h), which fluoresces at 270 &# 8211; 280 nm excitation wavelength and 300 &# 8211; 310 nm emission wavelength, suggesting that microbial activity {{is an important factor in}} promoting <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> within dolomite passive treatment systems.

40|$|The University of Massachusetts, Amherst and the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority {{have been}} {{conducting}} pilot {{studies at the}} West River Treatment Plant CWRTP) since 1989 to investigate the use of ozone and peroxone in in-line fIltration. Many studies in the past, both pilot and full-scale, have shown improved perfonnance on inclusion of pre-ozonation in to the treatment scheme. Peroxone {{has been found to}} be more effective than ozone in oxidizing taste and odor compounds. This study investigated the effects of the use of ozone and peroxone on fIlter perfonnance, and particle and <b>manganese</b> <b>removals.</b> Pilot run experiments were conducted in the summer of 1990 to compare ozone with no pre-oxidant, and ozone with peroxone. Treatment was evaluated in tenns of effluent turbidity and UV absorbance, headloss development in the fIlter, particle counts, and DOC and manganese analyses. Results from these experiments showed that the perfonnance of ozone and peroxone was very similar in tenns of fllter perfonnance and particle removal. Both ozone and peroxone trains gave effluent DOC levels similar to the no pre-oxidant train and the WRTP. The ozone train was able to achieve significantly greater <b>removals</b> of <b>manganese</b> compared to the peroxone train. However, the WRTP, which adds potassium pennanganate specifically for the oxidation of manganese, was achieving <b>manganese</b> <b>removals</b> far in excess of the pilot trains. Studies were conducted to investigate the large difference in perfonnance of the two pilot trains compared to the WRTP in removing manganese. A laboratory column set up with WRTP fllter media showed that low levels of manganese in the WRTP fllter effluent was due to direct oxidation by pennanganate rather than adsorption of MnCm by oxide coatings on fllter media during flltration. The oxidation of reduced manganese by ozone was also studied. Ozone doses between 1 and 2 mg/L oxidized a significant fraction of reduced manganese to colloidal oxides, which formed particulates after coagulant addition and rapid mixing. These particulates were then removed by mtration. At pH less than 7. 0, increasing the dose showed some additional oxidation. However, at higher pHs of 7. 5 and 8. 0, manganese oxidation was largely unaffected by the ozone dose. This may indicate that when the molecular ozone reaction pathway is dominant, ozone is able to oxidize manganese due its selective nature of reactions. However, when the free radical pathway is dominant, the free radicals may be quickly consumed in competing reactions before reacting with manganese. i...|$|R

40|$|Colorado School of Mines have {{developed}} a remediation process {{for the treatment of}} metals in circumneutral mining influenced waters. The process involves treatment with a pulsed limestone bed (PLB) system, followed by co-precipitation of metal-carbonate impurities. The PLB system is resistant to armoring through the action of intermittently pulsing fluids through beds of limestone. This imparts significant alkalinity to the water, especially when CO 2 has been added to enhance dissolution of the limestone. Then, product water is directed through an inclined channel containing limestone where co-precipitation of metal carbonates occurs, resulting in the removal of additional impurities, such as Zn, Cd and Mn. The maximum pH in the channel reaches 8. 3, which is suitable for direct discharge into surface waters. The selectivity of the process results in lower reagent consumption and sludge volumes than would be expected with conventional lime or caustic treatment. The process was tested on four different hard-rock-mine-drainage effluents, and process performance and effluent composition were determined. If the water has only significant concentrations of zinc and minor concentrations of <b>manganese,</b> then <b>removal</b> of 90 % or more of the zinc is achieved.

40|$|In The Netherlands, Belgium {{and other}} European countries, {{manganese}} {{is removed from}} groundwater by aeration followed by rapid (sand) filtration. Although <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> from groundwater has been studied extensively, the mechanisms that control the ripening of filter media are not yet fully understood. This thesis highlights {{the role of the}} formation of a manganese oxide coating on virgin filter media. Characterization and identification of the media revealed that Birnessite was the manganese oxide responsible for effective <b>manganese</b> <b>removal.</b> This study confirmed that Birnessite formed {{at the beginning of the}} ripening process was of biological origin. As filter ripening progressed, the origin of the Birnessite became predominantly physico-chemical, although biological manganese oxidation still contributed to the overall removal of manganese. The formation of Birnessite at the start of filter media ripening was negatively influenced by a high filter back wash frequency. Molecular DNA analyses showed that Pseudomonas species are most likely involved at the start of the manganese oxide formation process. Based on the knowledge that <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> in conventional groundwater treatment is initiated biologically, long ripening times may be reduced by creating conditions favouring the growth of manganese oxidizing bacteria, e. g., by limiting the back wash frequency and/or intensity. Finally it was shown that the use of freshly prepared manganese oxide, containing Birnessite, can completely eliminate the need for filter media ripening. The results of this research enable the development of an innovative <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> process to shorten or completely eliminate long periods of ripening of virgin filter media, as well as significantly prolonging the lifetime of the filter media. <br/...|$|E

40|$|The dolomitic cave {{deposits}} of southern Africa hold {{arguably the most}} abundant hominid and fauna fossil record in the world. However, {{as a result of}} various mineral processes occurring, these fossils are often covered in a brown/black deposit. This layer is a mixture of manganese and iron oxides from mineral dissolution of the dolomite in cave environment in which all the specimens are found. This covering presents a particularly complex problem as it obscures fine surface details (e. g. cut marks and carnivore tooth marks) on the bone that are of particular interest in the fields of palaeontology and palaeo-anthropology. Being able to identify and distinguish between different modifying agents is important for interpreting how the bones were transported into the cave. The deposit of manganese oxides was successfully removed from the bone using hydrogen peroxide, nitrites, chromium(III) and hydroxylamine without visibly altering the bone composition and structure, leaving all surface markings unaltered from their original state. It has been established that the above reagents can be used to reduce the manganese oxides resulting in Mn 2 + as the main product of the reactions. The concentration of reagents, reaction time and other conditions were optimised. The hydrogen peroxide method has been applied in the cleaning of over seven thousand manganese oxide coated fossil bones and teeth from the early hominid site of Coopers D situated in the Cradle of Humankind. A flow through system was also constructed and used for the mass cleaning of fossils using the hydrogen peroxide method and the hydrogen peroxide was continually replaced to maintain the [H+] and remove the Mn 2 + formed, and thus drive the Mn 4 + reduction reaction. Validation and analysis of cleaning methods included pH, time, Mn 2 + concentration as well as the Mn: Fe ratio determination.

Pentachlorophenol <b>removal,</b> <b>manganese</b> peroxidase, and laccase activity, and the formation of chloroanisoles in the contaminated field soils were measured. The majority of PCP removed by the Trametes isolates was in the first week after bioaugmentation. The maximum PCP removal by the fungi varied from 50 to 65 % from a 1065 mg kg⁻¹ PCP contaminated field soil. Pentachlorophenol was preferentially converted to pentachloroanisole (PCA) by the Phanerochaete isolates (> 60 %), while 2 to 9 % of the PCP removed by two Trametes isolates was converted to PCA. A pH increase was measured following bioaugmentation that was dependent on PCP concentration, fungal inoculum addition, and formulation.

While higher flow rate was preferred for raw water with lower iron and manganese concentrations, lower flow rate was better for raw water with higher iron and manganese concentrations. This study greatly improved our knowledge in system performance as well as iron and <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> by the PWDU, which would benefit the water treatment industry as well as the rural communities across NL by improving the quality and capacity of drinking water supply. In addition, the experimental approaches used by this study also provided a useful reference and tool for further studies aimed to improve the performance of small-scale water treatment systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{biodegradation}} of manganese in sequencing batch reactor. Biodegradation of manganese in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) is a new invention treatment method that gives a lot of advantage in term of lowering operation and maintenance cost. The works done in this research explore the effects of different loading rate (LR) on the water quality parameter. For this research, biofilm process was selected as a treatment method which is develop in the SBR. At {{the beginning of the}} experiment, the mixed cultured was collected from drain and acclimatized in 10 liter reactor and monitoring the growth by using suspended solid (SS) test. The mixed cultured was acclimatized within two months by fed with 1 mg/L manganese. For the treatment process, the mixed culture from acclimatization reactor will be transferred to the treatment reactor. The manganese treatment process will be carried out by controlling the loading rate. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) selected for this research is 5 days. The experiment will be run within two weeks. Within this period, the collection of the sample will be done for everyday as well as the addition of the simulated wastewater to the treatment reactor. The data shown that the lowest organic loading rate which is 3 mg/L. d giving the highest percent of <b>manganese</b> <b>removal.</b> The highest <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> is 65 % while the highest value of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal is 72 % at 3. 5 mg/L. d. By using the Design Expert, the predicted value will represent the optimization results for this research. The value for optimization is at lowest LR which is 3 mg/L. d. By using lowest LR, the treatment will get 43 % of COD removal and 57 % <b>manganese</b> <b>removal.</b> The optimization of concentration of suspended solid is 381 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|Manganese is {{a common}} {{contaminant}} of mine water and other waste waters. Due to its high solubility over a wide pH range, it is notoriously difficult to remove from contaminated waters. Previous systems that effectively remove Mn from mine waters have involved oxidising the soluble Mn(II) species at an elevated pH using substrates such as limestone and dolomites. However it is currently unclear what effect the substrate type has upon abiotic Mn removal compared to biotic removal by in situ micro-organisms (biofilms). In order to investigate the relationship between substrate type, Mn precipitation and the biofilm community, net-alkaline Mn-contaminated mine water was treated in reactors containing one of the pure materials: dolomite, limestone, magnesite and quartzite. Mine water chemistry and Mn removal rates were monitored over a 3 -month period in continuous-flow reactors. For all substrates except quartzite, Mn {{was removed from the}} mine water during this period, and Mn minerals precipitated in all cases. In addition, the plastic from which the reactor was made played a role in Mn <b>removal.</b> <b>Manganese</b> oxyhydroxides were formed in all the reactors; however, Mn carbonates (specifically kutnahorite) were only identified in the reactors containing quartzite and on the reactor plastic. Magnesium-rich calcites were identified in the dolomite and magnesite reactors, suggesting that the Mg from the substrate minerals may have inhibited Mn carbonate formation. Biofilm community development and composition on all the substrates was also monitored over the 3 -month period using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The DGGE profiles in all reactors showed no change with time and no difference between substrate types, suggesting that any microbiological effects are independent of mineral substrate. The identification of Mn carbonates in these systems has important implications for the design of Mn treatment systems in that the provision of a carbonate-rich substrate may not be necessary for successful Mn precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we sought}} to {{investigate}} the mercury <b>removal</b> efficiency of <b>manganese</b> oxides from natural gas. The fundamental studies on mercury <b>removal</b> with <b>manganese</b> oxides sorbents were carried out in a laboratory scale fixed bed reactor at 30 °C {{with a mixture of}} methane (20 %) and nitrogen gas laden with 4. 8 ppb of elemental mercury. Manganese oxides with varying surface area and crystalline phase were prepared by conventional precipitation method in this study. The effects of surface area, crystallinity and other metal oxides on mercury removal efficiency were investigated. Effect of Ag impregnation on mercury removal efficiency was also investigated. Ag supported on metal oxide such titania and zirconia as reference materials were also used in this study for comparison. The characteristics of mercury <b>removal</b> reaction with <b>manganese</b> oxide was investigated using a temperature programmed desorption (TPD) technique. Manganese oxides showed very high Hg removal activity (about 73 - 93 % Hg removal) for first time use. Surface area of the manganese oxide samples decreased after heat-treatment and resulted in complete loss of Hg removal ability for repeated use after Hg desorption in the case of amorphous MnO 2, and 75 % loss of the initial Hg removal activity for the crystalline MnO 2. Mercury desorption efficiency of crystalline MnO 2 was very low (37 %) for first time use and high (98 %) after second time use. Residual potassium content in MnO 2 may have some effect on the thermal stability of the adsorbed Hg species. Desorption of Hg from manganese oxides occurs at much higher temperatures (with a peak at 400 °C) than Ag/TiO 2 or Ag/ZrO 2. Mercury may be captured on manganese oxides in the form of mercury <b>manganese</b> oxide. Keywords—Mercury <b>removal,</b> Metal and metal oxide sorbents, Methane, Natural gas. I...|$|R
40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} results of a {{continuous}} 4. 5 -day laboratory aeration experiment and the first year of passive, aerobic treatment of abandoned mine drainage (AMD) from a typical flooded underground anthracite mine in eastern Pennsylvania, USA. During 1991 – 2006, the AMD source, locally known as the Otto Discharge, had flows from 20 to 270 L/s (median 92 L/s) and water quality that was consistently suboxic (median 0. 9 mg/L O 2) and circumneutral (pH 6. 0; net alkalinity 3 ̆e 10) with moderate concentrations of dissolved iron and manganese and low concentrations of dissolved aluminum (medians of 11, 2. 2, and 3 ̆c 0. 2 mg/L, respectively). In 2001, the laboratory aeration experiment demonstrated rapid oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) without supplemental alkalinity; the initial Fe 2 + concentration of 16. 4 mg/L decreased to less than 0. 5 mg/L within 24 h; pH values increased rapidly from 5. 8 to 7. 2, ultimately attaining a steady-state value of 7. 5. The increased pH coincided with a rapid decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) from an initial value of 10 - 1. 1 atm to a steady-state value of 10 - 3. 1 atm. From these results, a staged aerobic treatment system was conceptualized consisting of a 2 m deep pond with innovative aeration and recirculation to promote rapid oxidation of Fe 2 +, two 0. 3 m deep wetlands to facilitate iron solids removal, and a supplemental oxic limestone drain for dissolved <b>manganese</b> and trace-metal <b>removal.</b> The system was constructed, but without the aeration mechanism, and began operation in June 2005. During the first 12 months of operation, estimated detention times in the treatment system ranged from 9 to 38 h. However, in contrast with 80 – 100...|$|R
30|$|Regeneration of the zeolite {{media filter}} {{in the pilot}} process, between iron and <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> cycles, was {{effectively}} achieved by contacting the zeolite media on 10  % of a commercial NaCl solution. The regeneration protocol adopted to displace the iron, manganese and other cations adsorbed on the zeolite media during the groundwater water treatment cycle is shown in Fig.  6. The desorption of appreciable amounts of all four cations suggests that the regeneration technique is successful.|$|E
40|$|In {{drinking}} water production, river bank filtration has {{the advantages of}} dampening peak concentrations of many dissolved components, substantially removing many micropollutants and removing, virtually completely, the pathogens and suspended solids. The production aquifer is not only fed by the river bank infiltrate but also by water percolating through covering layers. In the polder areas, these top layers consist of peat and deposits from river sediments and sea intrusions. This paper discusses the origin and fate of macro components in river bank filtrate, based on extensive full-scale measurements in well fields and treatment systems of the Drinking Water Company Oasen in the Netherlands. First, it clarifies and illustrates redox reactions and the mixing of river bank filtrate and PW as the dominant processes determining the raw water quality for {{drinking water}} production. Next, full-scale results are elaborated on to evaluate trickling filtration as an efficient and proven one-step process to remove methane, iron, ammonium and manganese. The interaction of methane and <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> with nitrification in these systems is further analyzed. Methane is mostly stripped during trickling filtration and its removal hardly interferes with nitrification. Under specific conditions, microbial <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> may play a dominant role...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} iron and {{manganese}} at two passive treatment systems {{for the treatment of}} mine water in the North East of England was compared over a period of three weeks. In addition, 24 hour sampling was undertaken to determine the effect of diurnal variations in metal removal. Removal of iron was found to occur at both sites though effluent concentrations were much lower at Whittle. Oxidation of iron was the dominant removal process in the early parts of the systems (in the oxidation ponds and early parts of the wetlands) whereas biotic removal processes appeared to become more important in the distal parts of the system where iron concentrations were much lower. Manganese was also removed at Whittle but this was not achieved until iron was at concentrations below 5 mg. L- 1. Iron concentrations did not fall low enough in the Shilbottle system to allow <b>manganese</b> <b>removal.</b> The process of <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> was not evident but bacterially-mediated oxidation is likely to be involved. Further elucidation of the relative importance of abiotic and biotic removal processes within treatment systems is important in the design and management of constructed systems...|$|E
40|$|Estuarine {{profiles}} of dissolved barium are reported from six estuarine {{systems in the}} U. S. A. and Europe. All show clear evidence of mid-estuarine barium concentration maxima, although the location and scale of these maxima vary. These differences are rationalized in terms of low-salinity desorption of particulate barium, estuarine particle dynamics, riverine sediment supply and barium storage and subsequent slow release in salt marshes. Low-salinity removal of barium also occurs in some estuaries, apparently related to dissolved iron and <b>manganese</b> <b>removal...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} results comparing iron organic complexes, color, turbidity and <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies of two techniques: oxidation/coagulation/sedimentation and oxidation/coagulation/dissolved {{air flotation}} (DAF). The focus was the suitable adjustment of the coagulation processes {{rather than the}} oxidation process. In this way, lower dosages of oxidant and coagulant could be added increasing the removal efficiency and saving chemicals. The results showed that DAF is an attractive alternative to promote the removal of organic iron compounds (97 % of removal efficiency, residual of 0. 17 mg/L), color (98 % of removal efficiency, residual 7. 5). The <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> was better (> 84 % of removal efficiency, residual of 0. 04 mg/L) in a high pH value (8. 0) when sedimentation was used as clarification technique (dosage of ferric chloride of 45 mg/L; 9. 3 mgFe/L in a pH value of 8. 0) but a reasonable efficiency (52 % of removal efficiency, residual of 0. 12 mgMn/ L near to Brazilian drinking water standard 0. 10 mgMn/L) was achieved when DAF was applied with the dosage of ferric chloride of 15 mg/L (3. 1 mgFe/L) in a pH value of 6. 3. The solid/liquid separation technique can be a planner’s decision but the matter is to focus in coagulation process rather than oxidation. For DAF and sedimentation TH...|$|E
40|$|Precipitation was {{integrated}} with hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane {{process for the}} removal of manganese and ammonia in electrolytic manganese wastewater. Different precipitants, including NaOH, poly aluminum chloride, polyacrylatnide and NH(4) HCO(3), were added into wastewater and reacted with manganese to form precipitation for <b>manganese</b> <b>removal.</b> It was found that NH(4) HCO(3) showed the highest <b>manganese</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency (up to 98. 8 %) compared with the other three precipitants. The concentration of manganese decreased from 15420 to 182. 5 mg/L when the dosage of NH(4) HCO(3) was 12 g/L and the settling time was 2 h. In addition, the formed MnCO(3) is an important industrial material. Subsequent membrane process provided a hydrophobic barrier for residual manganese and a stripping channel for ammonia. Ammonia diffused through membrane pores to the stripping solution containing sulfuric acid. Such hydrophobic PVDF membrane process enabled 99. 9 % removal of ammonia. During a long-term performance of membrane process, ammonia decreased sharply and stabilized at about 203 mg/L, with the removal efficiency of 99. 4 %. Acceleration caused by ammonia stripping to the permeate flux was found; however, it may disappear accompanied with the reduction of ammonia. Membrane fouling caused by manganese and magnesium was also found and led to a permeate flux decline. Manganese was not detected during the whole performance, showing that PVDF exhibited a good hydrophobicity and stability...|$|E
