40|$|Background: Intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> {{resulted}} in less blood loss and better preservation of liver function {{when it was}} applied for fewer than 120 minutes. The mechanism of better preservation of liver function under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> at molecular level remains unclear. Furthermore, the ultrastructural features in the liver with chronic diseases under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> have not been studied. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the expression of stress genes and ultrastructural change of the liver under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre.</b> Methods: From July 1995 to February 1998, 131 patients underwent hepatectomy for liver tumours (61 patients without Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> and 70 patients with intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre).</b> Twenty-five patients (15 with Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> and 10 without Pringle <b>manoeuvre)</b> were included in the study of hepatic stress gene expression during hepatectomy. Twenty-two patients (18 patients with intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> and four patients without Pringle <b>manoeuvre)</b> were randomly assigned for electron microscopic examination. Results: For the expression of stress genes, both the heat shock genes (HSP 70 A and HSC 70) and acute phase genes (TNF-α and interleukin- 6) were detected simultaneously in the patients with or without intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre.</b> The patients under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> had relatively higher mRNA levels of heat shock gene 70 family, which is related to intracellular repair and protection. Induction of TNF-α and interleukin- 6 genes, which contributed to ischaemia-reperfusion injury and postoperative complication, was not found in the patients under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre.</b> Under the electron microscopy, the hepatic ultrastructure was well maintained under intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> whatever the liver status, even when the accumulated ischaemic duration was extended to 120 min. Conclusion: Intermittent Pringle <b>manoeuvre</b> induced relatively higher expression of heat shock genes, which are related to intracellular homeostasis, and is consistent with the well maintenance of liver ultrastructure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} level of recruitment of the muscles used in the generation of respiratory muscle force, and to ascertain whether maximal diaphragmatic force and maximal inspiratory muscle force need to be measured by separate tests. The level of activity of three inspiratory muscles and one expiratory muscle during three maximal respiratory <b>manoeuvres</b> was studied: (1) maximal inspiration against a closed airway (Muller <b>manoeuvre</b> or maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)); (2) maximal inspired <b>manoeuvre</b> followed by a maximal expiratory effort (combined manoeuvre); and (3) maximal inspiratory sniff through the nose (sniff <b>manoeuvre).</b> METHODS [...] All the <b>manoeuvres</b> were performed from functional residual capacity. The gastric (PGA) and oesophageal (POES) pressures and their difference, transdiaphragmatic pressure (PDI), and the integrated EMG activity of the diaphragm (EDI), the sternomastoid (ESTR), the intercostal parasternals (ERIC), and the rectus abdominis muscles (ERA) were recorded. RESULTS [...] Mean (SD) PDI values for the Muller, combined, and sniff <b>manoeuvres</b> were: 127. 6 (19. 4), 162. 7 (22. 2), and 136. 6 (24. 8) cm H 2 O, respectively. The pattern of rib cage muscle recruitment (POES/PDI) was similar for the Muller and sniff <b>manoeuvres</b> (88 % and 80 % respectively), and was 58 % in the combined <b>manoeuvre,</b> confirming data previously reported in the literature. Peak EDI amplitude was greater during the sniff <b>manoeuvre</b> in all subjects (100 %) than during the combined (88. 1 %) and Muller (61. 1 %) <b>manoeuvres.</b> ESTR and EIC were more active in the Muller and the sniff <b>manoeuvres.</b> The contribution of the expiratory muscle (ERA) to the three <b>manoeuvres</b> was 100 % in the combined, 26. 1 % for the sniff, and 11. 5 % for the Muller <b>manoeuvre.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Each of these three <b>manoeuvres</b> results in different mechanisms of inspiratory and expiratory muscle activation and the intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures generated are {{a reflection of the}} interaction between the various muscle groups.

40|$|SummaryWe {{hypothesized}} that peak values of oesophageal (Poes) and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) swings during a maximal sniff <b>manoeuvre</b> and a maximal static inspiratory <b>manoeuvre</b> (Muller <b>manoeuvre)</b> are comparable or give complementary information for assessing diaphragmatic and global inspiratory muscle strength. We studied 98 patients with suspected diaphragmatic dysfunction. Poes and Pdi swings were measured during maximal sniff <b>manoeuvres</b> (sniff), maximal Muller <b>manoeuvres</b> (max), and cervical magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation (cervical Tw). Eighty eight patients {{were able to}} perform both volitional <b>manoeuvres.</b> Among them, mean Poes sniff {{was significantly higher than}} mean Poes max (48. 7 ± 28. 7 cm H 2 O vs. 42. 9 ± 27. 4 cm H 2 O, p< 0. 05) and mean Pdi sniff was higher than mean Pdi max (49. 2 ± 35. 1 cm H 2 O vs. 42. 9 ± 33. 3 cm H 2 O, respectively, p= 0. 05). Cervical Pdi Tw correlated better with Pdi sniff (p< 0. 0001, r= 0. 62) than with Pdi max (p< 0. 0001, r= 0. 44). Poes and Pdi swings were greatest during the sniff <b>manoeuvre</b> in 42 patients (48 %) and during the Muller <b>manoeuvre</b> in 29 patients (33 %). Among the 17 remaining patients, nine had the greatest Poes swing during a maximal sniff <b>manoeuvre</b> and the greatest Pdi swing during a maximal static inspiratory manoeuvre; the opposite occurred in the other eight patients. The combination of Muller <b>manoeuvre</b> and sniff <b>manoeuvre</b> increased the diagnosis of normal diaphragmatic strength from 18 patients (20 %) to 21 patients (24 %), and the additional analysis of cervical Pdi Tw further increased the diagnosis of normal diaphragmatic strength to 27 patients (31 %). In conclusion, though sniff <b>manoeuvre</b> gave significantly higher values than Muller <b>manoeuvre,</b> both volitional <b>manoeuvres</b> and cervical Pdi Tw are complementary and should be used in combination to evaluate diaphragmatic muscle strength...|$|R

40|$|A new multiple-model filter {{for target}} {{tracking}} {{has been developed}} and performed well in this thesis. The procedure of the new multiple model (MM) filter has no compromises between non-manoeuvre and <b>manoeuvre,</b> and between <b>manoeuvres</b> except in the ambiguous cases. The operation of the new MM filter is simple like VD filter but with no need for reconstruction of <b>manoeuvre,</b> and the new MM filter also considers all kinds of motions like interacting multiple model (IMM) filter but with {{a small number of}} models and significantly reduced computational load. The scheme of the new multiple-model tracking filter consists of <b>manoeuvre</b> detection, construction of <b>manoeuvre</b> filters, construction of safeguard filter, and filter selection. The performance of the proposed tracking filter mainly relies on <b>manoeuvre</b> detection, construction of <b>manoeuvre</b> model filter, and construction of safeguard model filter. In order to improve the tracking, several <b>manoeuvre</b> detection methods have been developed. One of the <b>manoeuvre</b> detection methods is to test the statistic of normalised optimally squared smoothed accelerations, and gives quicker detection than classical <b>manoeuvre</b> detection by testing normalised squared-innovation statistic, in spite of the smoothing lag. This thesis suggests that the <b>manoeuvre</b> be detected by testing the changes of the statistic of normalised squared innovations to give effective <b>manoeuvre</b> detection, based on Chen and Norton's (1986) detection by testing rapid parameter changes. The thesis also modifies Weston and Norton's (1997) change detection with the fixed-lag smoothing instead of the fixed-interval smoothing used by Weston and Norton's method, and obtains more accurate and quicker <b>manoeuvre</b> detection. According to the features of target motion, the target <b>manoeuvres</b> are modelled as straight-line acceleration motion, cross-track acceleration motion, and curvilinear acceleration motion. Thus the <b>manoeuvre</b> model filters can be constructed by these three kinds of motions with a limited number of <b>manoeuvre</b> model filters and reduced computational load. To avoid the risk of the loss of track, a safeguard filter is used in the case of uncertain <b>manoeuvre.</b> The safeguard filter is constructed by combining Singer's (1970) filter and input estimation, to provide at least comparable performance to IMM filter. Further improvement for multiple-model tracking is provided by using the fixed-lag smoothing technique. In comparison with the multiple-model filter alone, the fixed-lag smoothing multiple-model filter provides much better performance (even with fixed lag d= 1), and can be implemented in a real time at the costs of a small delay and slight increase in computational load...|$|R

40|$|Formation flying of {{multiple}} spacecraft collaborating toward {{the same goal}} is fast becoming a reality for space mission designers. Often the missions require the spacecraft to perform translational <b>manoeuvres</b> relative to each other to achieve some mission objective. These <b>manoeuvres</b> need to be planned {{to ensure the safety}} of the spacecraft in the formation and to optimise fuel management throughout the fleet. In addition to these requirements is it desirable for this <b>manoeuvre</b> planning to occur autonomously within the fleet to reduce operations cost and provide greater planning flexibility for the mission. One such mission that would benefit from this type of <b>manoeuvre</b> planning is the European Space Agency’s DARWIN mission, designed to search for extra-solar Earth-like planets using separated spacecraft interferometry. This thesis presents a <b>Manoeuvre</b> Planning Architecture for the DARWIN mission. The design of the Architecture involves identifying and conceptualising all factors affecting the execution of formation flying <b>manoeuvres</b> at the Sun/Earth libration point L 2. A systematic trade-off analysis of these factors is performed and results in a modularised <b>Manoeuvre</b> Planning Architecture for the optimisation of formation flying reconfiguration <b>manoeuvres.</b> The Architecture provides a means for DARWIN to autonomously plan <b>manoeuvres</b> during the reconfiguration mode of the mission. The Architecture consists of a Science Operations Module, a Position Assignment Module, a Trajectory Design Module and a Station-keeping Module that represents a multiple multi-variable optimisation approach to the formation flying <b>manoeuvre</b> planning problem. The <b>manoeuvres</b> are planned to incorporate target selection for maximum science returns, collision avoidance, thruster plume avoidance, <b>manoeuvre</b> duration minimisation and <b>manoeuvre</b> fuel management (including fuel consumption minimisation and formation fuel balancing). With many customisable variables the Architecture can be tuned to give the best performance throughout the mission duration. The implementation of the Architecture highlights the importance of planning formation flying reconfiguration <b>manoeuvres.</b> When compared with a benchmark <b>manoeuvre</b> planning strategy the Architecture demonstrates a performance increase of 27 % for <b>manoeuvre</b> scheduling and fuel savings of 40 % over a fifty target observation tour. The Architecture designed in this thesis contributes to the field of spacecraft formation flying analysis on various levels. First, the <b>manoeuvre</b> planning is designed at the mission level with considerations for mission operations and station-keeping included in the design. Secondly, the requirements analysis and implementation of Science Operation Module represent a unique insight into the complexity of observation scheduling for exo-planet analysis missions and presents a robust method for autonomously optimising that scheduling. Thirdly, in-depth analyses are performed on DARWIN-based modifications of existing <b>manoeuvre</b> optimisation strategies identifying their strengths and weaknesses and ways to improve them. Finally, though not implemented in this thesis, the design of a Station-keeping Module is provided to add station-keeping optimisation functionality to the Architecture.
