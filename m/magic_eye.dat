5|$|Dorothy and Toto {{discover}} {{that they are in}} Munchkinland, a small town part of the vast Land of Oz. After discussing her situation with the town's people, the Munchkins (played by Rizzo the Rat and the other rats), she learns that the land's ruler the Wizard, has the power to grant her wish of becoming a famous singer. She meets the Good Witch of the North (Miss Piggy), and receives a pair of magic silver slippers from the Wicked Witch of the East (Miss Piggy), the Witch of the North's sister who was killed when Dorothy's trailer fell on her. Soon after, she embarks on a journey with Toto on the yellow brick road to meet the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City, the capital of Oz. On her journey, she meets three creatures: a Scarecrow (Kermit), a Tin Thing (Gonzo), and a Cowardly Lion (Fozzie). They are also seeking the Wizard of Oz to give them a brain, heart, and courage, respectively. The group meets various obstacles involving a deep gorge where the Kalidah Critics (Statler and Waldorf) are heckling them and a Poppy Field Club run by Clifford which nearly puts them to sleep. After arriving at the Emerald City and meeting the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends are sent to retrieve the Wicked Witch of the West's <b>magic</b> <b>eye,</b> a tool she uses to see anything she desires in the Land of Oz.|$|E
500|$|After being {{threatened}} {{to be killed}} by her, Toto calls the Munchkins, who set Dorothy free and hold up the witch. During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where Quentin Tarantino is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own [...] "bottled water bath" [...] which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap water to restock them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's eyes. With the Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the <b>magic</b> <b>eye</b> floating in the tub unharmed and grabs it.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Marvel {{launched}} a viral marketing {{campaign for the}} film called [...] "Galaxy Getaways", a fictional travel website that allows users to book passage {{to some of the}} planets depicted in the film, including Xandar, Morag, and Knowhere. Beginning July 4, 2014, a sneak peek of the film was presented at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios in the <b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> and ABC Sound Studio theaters, respectively. Approximately 14 minutes of the film was screened on July 7, 2014, in IMAX 3D in the United States, and 3D theaters and IMAX 3D in Canada, along with two trailers. The screening was met with positive reviews, praising the humor, the 3D and IMAX conversion, and Cooper's portrayal of Rocket. However, it was criticized for beginning partway through the film, not allowing viewers to easily acclimate to the film's tone, and for how the general audience might respond to a film within the MCU without established characters making appearances.|$|E

2500|$|Binocular rivalry was {{discovered}} by Porta (1593, as cited in Wade, 1996). Porta put one book {{in front of one}} eye, and another in front of the other. He reported that he could read from one book at a time and that changing {{from one to the other}} required withdrawing the [...] "visual virtue" [...] from one eye and moving it to the other. According to Wade (1998), binocular colour rivalry was first reported by Le Clerk (1712). Desaguiliers (1716) also recorded it when looking at different colours from spectra in the bevel of a mirror. The clearest early description of both colour and contour rivalry was made by Dutour (1760, 1763; see translations by O'Shea, 1999a, b). To experience colour rivalry Dutour either crossed his eyes or overdiverged his eyes (a form of free fusion commonly used also at the end of the 20th century to view <b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> stereograms) to look at differently coloured pieces of cloth (Dutour, 1760) or differently coloured pieces of glass (Dutour, 1763). To experience contour rivalry Dutour again used free fusion of different objects or used a prism or a mirror in front of one eye to project different images into it. The first clear description of rivalry in English was by Charles Wheatstone (e.g., 1838). Wheatstone invented the stereoscope, an optical device (in Wheatstone's case using mirrors) to present different images to the two eyes.|$|E

50|$|Rather {{than the}} fast-paced action of Wolfenstein 3D, Nitemare 3D has a {{slightly}} slower, more puzzle-oriented style of gameplay. The four weapons (plasma gun, magic wand, pistol, and auto-repeat plasma gun) have different usages—for example, magic blasts are especially useful against magical creatures such as witches, whereas robots are practically immune to them. Meanwhile, vampires take heavy damage from silver bullets, while shrugging off {{the effects of the}} plasma gun. Each level in the game has numerous secret panels, some of which were purely for bonuses, but others are essential to completing the level. To make this task easier, the player can collect <b>magic</b> <b>eyes,</b> which enable the player to activate a mini-map in the game's HUD and give hints as to the locations of panels, and crystal balls for displaying the location of enemies.|$|R
5000|$|Stereopsis, or retinal ({{binocular}}) disparity, or binocular parallax : Animals {{that have}} their eyes placed frontally {{can also use}} information derived from the different projection of objects onto each retina to judge depth. By using two images of the same scene obtained from slightly different angles, {{it is possible to}} triangulate the distance to an object {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Each eye views a slightly different angle of an object seen by the left and right eyes. This happens because of the horizontal separation parallax of the eyes. If an object is far away, the disparity of that image falling on both retinas will be small. If the object is close or near, the disparity will be large. It is stereopsis that tricks people into thinking they perceive depth when viewing <b>Magic</b> <b>Eyes,</b> Autostereograms, 3-D movies, and stereoscopic photos.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> is {{a series}} of books {{published}} by N.E. Thing Enterprises (renamed in 1996 to <b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> Inc.). The books feature autostereograms, which allow some people to see 3D images by focusing on 2D patterns. The viewer must diverge their eyes in order to see a hidden three-dimensional image within the pattern. A [...] "Magic Eye" [...] {{has become something of a}} genericized trademark, often used to refer to autostereograms of any origin. The autostereogram predates the <b>Magic</b> <b>Eye</b> series by several years. Christopher Tyler created the first black-and-white autostereograms in 1979 with the assistance of computer programmer Maureen Clarke.|$|E

In contrast, a relatively smaller proportion believed in the existence of black <b>magic</b> and evil <b>eye</b> (50 % and 44 %, respectively).
