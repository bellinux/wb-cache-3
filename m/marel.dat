50|$|Corvisart is an {{elevated}} station of the Paris Métro serving line 6 {{at the intersection}} of the Rue du Corvisart and the Boulevard Auguste Blanquis in the 13th arrondissement.The station opened as part of the former Line 2 South on 24 April 1906, when it was extended from Passy to Place d'Italie. On 14 October 1907 Line 2 South was incorporated into Line 5. It was incorporated into line 6 on 12 October 1942. It is named after the Rue Corvisart, which commemorates Jean Nicolas des <b>Marels,</b> Baron Corvisart (1755-1821), who was an important figure in the history of French medicine, specialising in the lungs and the heart, and the personal doctor of Napoleon. Nearby was the location of the Barrière de Croulebarbe, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.|$|R
40|$|We {{extract the}} shape of the stellar {{velocity}} ellipsoid as a function of radius in M 87 from van der <b>Marel's</b> (1994) velocity dispersion data. We include the gravitational force of a central black hole with the mass quoted by Harms et al. (1994). The kinematical data are corrected for the effects of seeing and instrumental blurring using a nonparametric algorithm. We find that the stellar motions in M 87 are slightly radially anisotropic throughout {{the main body of the}} galaxy, with oe r ß 1 : 2 oe t. However oe t exceeds oe r within the inner 1 00 Γ 2 00 by a statistically significant amount. A number of models for the formation of nuclear black holes predict a tangential anisotropy in the stellar motions, and our results provide evidence for such an effect in M 87. 1. Introduction Possibly no elliptical galaxy has been as thoroughly studied as M 87 (NGC 4486) in the Virgo cluster. Early observations of the core of M 87 revealed a velocity dispersion profile that rose toward the cente [...] ...|$|R
