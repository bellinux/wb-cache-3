50|$|In 1971, young, second-generation <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> {{from the}} {{neighborhood}} founded the Israeli Black Panthers, a protest movement against the perceived injustice and discrimination by the government against them. The rage quickly spread from Musrara to all areas inhabited by poor <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews,</b> and eventually evolved into a political movement.|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to the Palestinian Nakba narrative, the term [...] "Jewish Nakba" [...] is sometimes {{used to refer to}} the persecution and expulsion of Jews from Arab countries in the years and decades following the creation of the State of Israel.

5000|$|... (2015) Biton {{was awarded}} the Israel Prize for Literature, the first <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jew</b> to receive it. The prize {{committee}} described his poems as being [...] "the epitome of courageous dealings, sensitive and deep {{with a wide range}} of personal and collective experiences centered around the pain of migration, planting roots in the country, and the reestablishment of the Mizrahi identity as an integral part of the overall Israeli portrait.” ...|$|E
50|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Tel Aviv suburb, Herzelia, Israel as a <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jew</b> of Yemenite and Iraqi roots, she started as a child singer at the age of six, where {{she was a member of}} the “Li-Ron Choir” and gained {{advanced}} classical training as she participated in International Musical Festivals throughout the Middle East and Europe. When she was 12, her choir performed on the soundtrack to the 1993 film Schindler's List.|$|E
50|$|Anti-Jewish {{actions by}} Arab {{governments in the}} 1950s and 1960s, {{in the context of}} the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> from the Middle East. 25,000 <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> from Egypt left after the 1956 Suez Crisis, led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became refugees and most went to Israel.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> and Arab Jews report {{exclusion}} and discrimination by the Ashkenazi LGBT community in Israel. Some LGBT <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> have alleged that aspects of Ashkenazi LGBT activism express [...] "Ashkenazi hegemony" [...] and leave [...] "no legitimized cultural space for Mizrahi queers {{to express their}} Arab culture and heritage". [...] Prejudice against Arab Americans in the U.S. can also {{take the form of}} Islamophobia.|$|R

5000|$|Ezra Yitzhak Nawi (עזרא יצחק נאווי; born 1952) is an Israeli <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jew,</b> left-wing, {{human rights}} activist and pacifist. He is {{particularly}} active among the Bedouin herders and farmers of the South Hebron Hills and against the establishment of Israeli settlements there, in what Uri Avnery describes as a protracted effort by settlers to cleanse the area of Arab villagers, {{in the prevention of}} which he has played a key role. He {{has been described as a}} [...] "Ta'ayush nudnik", and [...] "a working-class, liberal gay version of Joe the Plumber".|$|E
50|$|The film (often {{categorized}} as a tragicomedy, but the comedic elements are limited) concerns two Israeli car salesmen who initially {{think the world}} is their oyster after a rare 1985 Lincoln Continental limousine - curiously with Quebec license plates (perhaps {{a nod to the}} largely Québécois production crew, although real plates in Quebec are actually only available in the rear of a car, not the front like in the film) - falls into their laps at their used-car dealership in Tel Aviv. After reviewing a publication by the corporate German dealership Auto Decker in Düsseldorf, they are led to believe that the car could net them as much as €50,000 and sail with the vehicle to Germany in order to sell it. While learning that the task may not be as easy as hoped, they are also confronted with a number of emotional episodes. Shmuel (portrayed by Avi Kushnir) is an Ashkenazi Jew, whose parents were Holocaust survivors, and is surprised to find how affected he is by the voyage. His companion Siso (played by Moshe Ivgy) is a <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jew</b> of modest means who, unlike his companion, has no working knowledge of English (spoken routinely by Shmuel to the various German characters they encounter), and is therefore often overwhelmed and confused during their experience. To Siso, Shmuel's history is largely unknown, and a tragic curiosity.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{the city was}} {{primarily}} settled by <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews,</b> who fled to Israel after being expelled from Muslim lands. Today, <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> still constitute {{the majority of the}} population. In the early 1950s, many South African Jews settled in Ashkelon, establishing the Afridar neighbourhood. They were followed by an influx of immigrants from the United Kingdom. During the 1990s, the city received additional arrivals of Ethiopian Jews and Russian Jews.|$|R

25|$|Today over 2,500,000 <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews,</b> and Sephardic Jews live in Israel {{with the}} {{majority}} of them being descendants of the 680,000 Jews who fled Arab countries (<2,500,000), due to expulsions, and antisemitism, with smaller numbers having immigrated from the Islamic Republics of the Former Soviet Union (c.250,000), India (70,000), Iran (200,000–250,000), Turkey (80,000). Before the immigration of over 1,000,000 Russian mainly Ashkenazi Jews to Israel after to collapse of the Soviet Union, 70% of Israeli Jews were Sephardic or <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{is not one}} {{generally}} recognized uniform nusach for Sephardi and <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews.</b> Instead, Sephardim and Mizrahim follow several slightly different but closely related nuschaot.|$|R

25|$|Sephardim are {{primarily}} {{the descendants of}} Jews from the Iberian Peninsula. They may be divided into the families that left in the Expulsion of 1492 and those that remained as crypto-Jews, Marranos and those who left in the following few centuries. In religious parlance, and by many in modern Israel, the term is used in a broader sense to include all Jews of Ottoman or other Asian or African backgrounds (<b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews),</b> {{whether or not they}} have any historic link to Spain, although some prefer to distinguish between Sephardim proper and <b>Mizraḥi</b> <b>Jews.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{prominent}} Israeli politicians such as David Ben-Gurion {{had tried}} to learn Arabic, the <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> spoke Judeo-Arabic although most of their descendants in Israel today only speak Hebrew.|$|R
2500|$|The use of {{the term}} Mizrahi can be {{somewhat}} controversial. The term Mizrahim is sometimes applied to descendants of Maghrebi and Sephardi Jews, who had lived in North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco), the Sephardi-proper communities of Turkey and the mixed Levantine communities of Lebanon, Israel and Syria. Before the establishment of the state of Israel, <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> did not identify themselves as a separate Jewish subgroup. Instead, <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> generally characterized themselves as Sephardi, as they follow the traditions of Sephardi Judaism (but with some differences among the minhag [...] "customs" [...] of particular communities). That has resulted in a conflation of terms, particularly in Israel and in religious usage, with [...] "Sephardi" [...] being used in a broad sense and including <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> and North African Jews as well as Sephardim proper. From {{the point of view of}} the official Israeli rabbinate, any rabbis of Mizrahi origin in Israel are under the jurisdiction of the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews,</b> {{being the}} {{pre-existing}} Jews of the Greater Middle East (who are of non-Spanish and non-Portuguese origins), are sometimes called Sephardim {{in a broader}} sense due to their style of liturgy, and although there is some overlap in populations due to the Sephardic Diaspora, the Sephardic Jews also settled in many other countries outside the Greater Middle East as well. As such, this article deals only with the cuisine of the Jewish populations with ancestral origins in the Iberian Peninsula, in whichever regions they settled, not just the Greater Middle East. For Cuisine of the <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews,</b> please see that article.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, whose ancestors came from Eastern Europe or Germany, {{where many of}} them spoke Yiddish as their first language. The foods commonly associated with American Jewish cuisine have their origins in Eastern Europe. The United States also has a sizeable population of Sephardic Jews, whose ancestors lived in Spain or Portugal, and later in other Mediterranean areas, and <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews,</b> whose ancestors lived in the Middle East or North Africa. [...] Sephardic and <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> have their own distinct cuisines, which, like Ashkenazi cuisine, were heavily influenced by their places of origin.|$|R
50|$|More {{specifically}} in the Israeli context, however, racism in Israel refers to racism directed against Israeli Arabs by Israeli Jews, intra-Jewish racism between the various Jewish ethnic divisions (in particular against Ethiopian Jews, historic and current racism towards <b>Mizrahi</b> <b>Jews</b> and Jews of color), and racism {{on the part of}} Israeli Arabs against Israeli Jews.|$|R
