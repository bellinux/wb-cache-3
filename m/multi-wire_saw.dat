On the basis of brittle fracture models, the authors have carried out calculations of absolute values of the depth of near-surface damages appearing in silicon, germanium, gallium phosphide, sapphire and lithium niobate wafers during the above mentioned processing procedures fulfillment. Experimental verification of the obtained data of calculation has been done using two materials – silicon and gallium phosphide. Calculated expressions given in this work for determination of the near-surface damages depth, describe near surface damage depth anisotropy in gallium phosphide and sapphire with different orientation of the processed surface: (100) and (111) for gallium phosphide and also for r-, a- and c-planes for sapphire. It has been noted that the accuracy of the near-surface damages depth absolute values prediction according to design formulae given in this work depends on the accuracy of the processed material mechanical properties and on knowledge of hardness of the material, which plays the role of the counter-body (lapping plate, pad or wire).

These ingots are sliced by a <b>multi-wire</b> <b>saw</b> mechanism {{consisting of a}} single thin and extremely long stainless steel wire wound on constant-pitch wire grooves. The wire is wound over each groove to create a web consisting of 500 - 700 parallel wires. The wire is kept at a constant tension using feedback control and the wire speeds typically are 10 - 15 m/s. A high speed nozzle directs an aqueous slurry of oil and SiC particles {{to the top of}} the wire array and the crystal silicon ingot is pushed upwards against the wire array during the cut. In a typical wire saw system MC ingots are sliced with an area of 100 x 100 square mm and the latest wire saw systems can achieve thicknesses down to 300 microns. What makes this a challenging simulation problem is the wide range of timescales that characterize the overall cutting process. The slowest dynamics are associated with the evolution of the cut, which is described by a spatially dependent differential equation in time and in which the cutting rate is modeled much in the same manner as the Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) process. Cutting rate is a direct function of the distance between the wire and ingot surface. Because the wire dynamics are orders of magnitude faster than cut evolution, the wire deflection is modeled by a static circular beam.

40|$|<b>Multi-wire</b> <b>sawing</b> is to date by far {{the most}} common method to produce wafers from {{crystallized}} silicon bricks. A lot of research is undertaken to reduce the kerf to minimize the loss of silicon. In this paper we present experiments in which we achieved a kerf loss of less than 100 ?m. It was possible to cut wafers successfully with a steel wire of 80 ?m thickness and F 600 silicon carbide particles. The wafers had industrial quality results for surface and geometry. A problem that occurred was some scratches on the wire exit. With an 80 ?m wire and F 2000 /F 1500 we could not cut wafers of desired quality. As a result of this investigation we conclude that to reduce the kerf it is important to optimize the relation between the wire size and the abrasive size.

However, the slicing {{mechanism}} has not been clarified completely, and the optimum slicing conditions are still determined through trial and error. In this study, the slicing mechanism of fixed abrasive wire sawing, using an electroplated diamond wire, was investigated experimentally. First, the diamond wire stiffness, {{and the relationship between}} normal cutting force and wire deflection, were discussed. Second, the influence of slicing conditions on cutting forces and the surface topography of the sliced wafer were investigated in detail. Third, a new analysis model based on a material removal method was proposed. The average abrasive cutting depth and the specific cutting energy were calculated at various slicing conditions namely, the wire speed, the feeding speed and the wire tension. Finally, the relationship of the average abrasives cutting depth to slicing characteristics and wafer quality were discussed. It was clarified that the average abrasive cutting depth is closely related to wafer quality and cutting characteristics. The material removal behavior changes with the average abrasives cutting depth. The size effect appears at a small cutting depth and brittle mode cutting becomes dominant at a large cutting depth...|$|R

For this purpose, less expensive substrates of upgraded metallurgical silicon (UMG-Si) are used as a mechanical support for the epitaxial cell. In the presented paper the mechanical strength of substrates coming from different positions of an UMG-Si ingot was investigated. The investigation of mechanical strength was performed after block crystallization, <b>multi-wire</b> <b>sawing</b> of the wafers and after depositing a 20 µm crystalline thin film until the production of an epitaxial wafer equivalent. UMG-Si substrates and epitaxial wafer equivalents were tested with the ring on ring bending test. To interpret the results IR-transmission and scanning electron microscopy, impurity concentration measurements and residual stress measurements were done on selected wafers. It could be shown that the presence of precipitates in the silicon matrix has a strong influence on the mechanical strength of the wafers. UMG-Si as well as industry standard Cz-Si and mc-Si showed less mechanical strength after epitaxial processes. This could be due either to a change in microstructure of the substrate or to thermal stresses introduced during the high temperature process. The deposition of the crystalline silicon thin film did not decrease the mechanical strength of the epitaxial wafer equivalent.

40|$|AbstractThe {{usage of}} diamond-plated wire to produce silicon wafers for the {{photovoltaic}} industry {{is still a}} new and highly investigated wafering technology. The requirements regarding {{the quality of the}} wafer surface are very high and they have to compete with the cost effectiveness and quality of wafers produced by the established loose abrasive sawing technology. Hence, the wafer topography, the fracture stress and the corresponding sub-surface damage have to be investigated and improved. This paper discusses the topographic parameters, the crack depths and the fracture stress of mono- and multi-crystalline silicon wafers that were produced on <b>multi-wire</b> <b>saws</b> using diamond-plated wire and comparable process parameters. Especially multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers exhibit lower fracture stress values compared to mono-crystalline silicon (cz-Si) wafers. We investigated the relations between crack depth and fracture stress. In detail, we determined a 15 % higher median and a 40 % increased interquartile range of the crack depth of mc-Si wafers in comparison to similar produced cz-Si wafers. That correlates with lower fracture stress values of textured mc-Si wafers compared to cz-Si wafers. In the following, we studied the sub-surface damage as a function of crystal orientation in detail. It was found that the crack depths increases from the { 100 } plane over the { 111 } plane to the { 101 } plane. However for the { 101 } plane two grains were investigated, resulting in a discrepancy of 4 μm. This {{may be related to the}} unknown rotation angle between the corresponding { 111 } cleavage planes and the wire direction and requires further investigations...|$|R

Satisfactory surface qualities and excellent yield of silicon wafers were found. One drawback is that the add-on cost of producing water from this saw, as presently used, is considerably higher than other systems being developed for the low-cost silicon solar array project (LSSA), primarily because the saw uses a large quantity of wire. The add-on cost can be significantly reduced by extending the wire life and/or by rescue of properly plated wire to restore the diameter...|$|R
2500|$|Stone (usually granite) countertops and {{bathroom}} vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4" [...] (2cm) and 1.25" [...] (3cm). Often 2cm slabs will be laminated {{at the edge}} to create {{the appearance of a}} thicker edge profile. The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using steel shot as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes diamond wire saws which use less water and energy. <b>Multi-wire</b> <b>saws</b> with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. [...] A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques.

Possible contaminations are organic compounds like slurry, glue, synthetics or etch resist and metals. The different influences on the alkaline texturisation and their were investigated. The results are quantified by confocal microscopy images, weighted reflection, surface roughness and surface enlargement. Therefore, it could be shown that the inorganic contamination has only a samll influence on the pyramid density, but no influence on macroscopic parameters, while organic contamination like glue residuals or etch resist showed critical problems and can inhibit the alkaline texturisation process...|$|R

40|$|The {{usage of}} more {{inexpensive}} silicon feedstock for the crystallization of multicrystalline silicon blocks promises cost reduction for the photovoltaic industry. Less expensive substrates {{made out of}} metallurgical silicon (MG-Si) are used as a mechanical support for the epitaxial solar cell. Moreover, conventional inert solar cells can be produced from up-graded metallurgical silicon (UMG-Si). This feedstock has higher content of impurities which influences cell performance and mechanical strength of the wafers. Thus, it is of importance to know these effects in order to know which impurities should be preferentially removed or prevented during the crystallization process. Solar cell processing steps can also exert {{a change in the}} values of mechanical strength of processed multicrystalline silicon wafers until the fabrication of a solar cell. Bending tests, fracture toughness and dynamic elastic modulus measurements are performed in this work in order to research the mechanical behavior of multicrystalline silicon crystallized with different qualities of silicon feedstock. Bending tests and residual stress measurements allows the quantification of the mechanical strength of the wafers after every solar cell processing step. The experimental results are compared with theoretical models found in the classical literature about the mechanical properties of ceramics. The influence of second phase particles and thermal processes on the mechanical strength of silicon wafers can be predicted and analyzed with the theoretical models. Metals like Al and Cu can decrease the mechanical strength due to micro-cracking of the silicon matrix and introduction of high values of thermal residual stress. Additionally, amorphous silicon oxide particles (SiOx) lower the mechanical strength of multicrystalline silicon due to thermal residual stresses and elastic mismatch with silicon. Silicon nitride particles (Si 3 N 4) reduce fracture toughness and cause failure by radial cracking in its surroundings due to its thermal mismatch with silicon. Finally, silicon carbide (SiC) and crystalline silicon oxide (SiOx) introduce thermal residual stresses but can have a toughening effect on the silicon matrix and hence, increase the mechanical strength of silicon wafers if the particles are smaller than a certain size. The surface of as-cut wafers after <b>multi-wire</b> <b>sawing</b> presents sharp micro-cracks that control their mechanical behavior. Subsequent removal of these micro-cracks by texture or damage etching approximately doubles the mechanical strength of silicon wafers. The mechanical behavior of the wafers is then governed by defects like cracks and particles formed during the crystallization of multicrystalline silicon blocks. Further thermal processing steps have a minor impact on the mechanical strength of the wafers compared to as-cut wafers. Finally, the mechanical strength of final solar cells is comparable to the mechanical strength of as-cut wafers due to the high residual thermal stress introduced after the formation of the metallic contacts which makes silicon prone to crack...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{solar energy}} {{is one of}} the {{important}} green sources, with more than 80 % of all commercial solar cells currently made from silicon wafer. The main purpose of using increasingly thinner silicon wafers for the manufacture of solar cells is to reduce production costs without introducing significant changes in the cell technology, while maximizing silicon utilization. The use of thinner silicon wafers means a higher breakage risk in the production line. A high cost must then be paid to convert poly-silicon into wafers; therefore, careful wafer handling is essential to reduce breakage and associated costs. Furthermore, solar silicon wafers are primarily produced through <b>multi-wire</b> <b>sawing.</b> The sawing process induces microcracks on the wafer’s surface, which are responsible for brittle fractures. Hence, it is important to scrutinize the crack geometries most commonly generated in the sawing or handling process of silicon wafers and link the crack to the wafer fracture. Surface cracks are among the most common defects in solar silicon wafer production. Consequently, a wide range of surface crack configuration parameters was investigated in the first attempt, both analytically and numerically. The ratio of crack depth to wafer thickness ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 8, while the ratio of crack depth to crack length ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 8. The results showed that the Newman- Raju solution predicts vanishing SIFs for long surface cracks (a/c≤ 0. 01). It indicates that finite element analysis is needed to predict the SIF for long surface cracks in ultra-thin silicon wafers. Also, due to the finite out of plane displacements in the wafer, geometrical nonlinearity {{should be included in the}} assessments. Based on the proposed surface crack model, the finite element model has been employed to identify the corresponding surface’s crack geometries by fitting the experimental results obtained by means of 4 - point bending- and twisting tests. Experiments displayed that the mechanical strength of the wafers tested parallel to the sawing direction is approximately 15 MPa smaller than those tested perpendicular to the sawing direction. After a huge statistical study, the surface cracks with a depth in the range from 10 to 20 μm, a length of up to 10 mm and angles in the range of ß= 30 º to 60 º were identified as the most common surface crack geometries in the wafers we tested. The stresses produced in the handling and transport, are as important as the presence of structural defects such as cracks, with the types of loading resulting in a different mechanical strength for the sample amplitude (e. g. static loading is usually less critical than vibration). One of the important loading types that has not been focused on in the literature is the vibration of wafers during handling. To carry out the vibration analysis, it is important to understand the factors that influence the natural frequency of thin silicon wafers in the first step. In this study, we applied a nonlinear finite element method to investigate the correlation of the natural frequency of thin solar silicon wafers with material microstructures (grain size and grain orientation), thickness variation and crack geometry (position and size). It has been found that the natural frequency for an anisotropic single crystal silicon wafer is a strong function of material orientation, as less than 10 % of a thickness variation will have a negligible effect on natural frequency. It has also been found that cracks smaller than 20 mm have no dominant effect on the first five natural frequency modes anywhere in the silicon wafer. The main goal of this part of the study was to show that the multi-crystalline silicon wafer can be modeled as isotropic material in a vibration analysis. After a natural frequency analysis, the second part of the study highlights the key parameters to consider for vibration loading. In particular, it has been found that the rate of loading causing the vibration during handling is very important. Findings within the industry show that the highest amount of breakage in wafers occurs in a suction process which is common to loading during the silicon wafer handling process. Therefore, a systematic approach is employed for the static and dynamic analysis of the suction process. An optimum pad diameter and location is obtained by minimizing the stress distribution in studied cases according to both static and dynamic loading, while the effect of the load rate on the fracture strength is also investigated in this optimum situation. Lastly, to reduce breakage in the suction process, we proposed ultrasound energy as a lubricant between wafers and support. In this regard, an approximate 20 times reduction in handling force was observed in our experiments. PhD i konstruksjonsteknikkPhD in Structural Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Crystalline silicon (Si) wafers used as {{substrates}} in {{the semiconductor}} and photovoltaic (PV) industries are traditionally manufactured using a <b>multi-wire</b> slurry <b>sawing</b> (MWSS) technique. Due to its high productivity potential, the fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing (DWS) technique is of considerable interest to Si wafer producers. Although both sawing techniques are currently {{used in the}} industry, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still lacking, particularly for diamond wire sawing. Consequently, optimization of the wire sawing process is carried out largely based on experience and trial and error. This thesis aims to develop a systematic fundamental understanding of diamond wire sawing of Si materials used for PV applications. First of all, a comparative analysis {{of the characteristics of}} silicon wafers cut by slurry and fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing is presented. The analysis results indicate that fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing may be a viable alternative to slurry wire sawing. Modeling and experimental studies of single grit diamond scribing of Si are proposed to shed light on the basic cutting mechanisms. Although Si is brittle at room temperature, it is possible to properly control the cutting conditions to obtain a completely ductile mode of material removal. The effects of material anisotropy, abrasive grit shape, friction condition and external hydrostatic pressure on the ductile-to-brittle mode transition in cutting of single crystal Si (sc-Si) are systematically investigated. Multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) based solar cells take up the majority of the global PV market. Hard inclusions (Silicon carbide and Silicon nitride) in multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) ingots may cause wire breakage and negatively impact the process, surface/subsurface morphology and mechanical properties of the resulting wafer. Their effects are experimentally studied through the single grit diamond scribing on the mc-Si sample with high density of inclusions. Finally, it is identified that there is a correlation between the high dislocation density and the increase of fracture toughness in mc-Si. The increase in fracture toughness leads to greater capability of ductile mode of cutting and higher specific scribing energy in the brittle fracture regime. Results of these fundamental investigations are expected to generate useful knowledge for optimizing the diamond wire sawing process in order to achieve high productivity and minimum surface/subsurface damage.
