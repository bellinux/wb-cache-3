2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks to stick it out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ugly facts before me." ...|$|E
60|$|And I turn <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{future that}} Maggie and I must prove, But {{the only light}} on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.|$|E
6000|$|I cast <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{stranded}} vessel, when, {{the breach}} and froth {{of the sea}} being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Swallow and the Swallow's mate," [...] she said, {{following}} <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> little creatures swung {{together on}} the beautiful bough.|$|R
60|$|Harris {{was afraid}} {{and did not}} want to go, but I heartened him up and said I would hold his hand all the way; so he gave his consent, though he trembled a little at first. I took a last pathetic look upon the {{pleasant}} summer scene about me, then boldly put <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> glass and prepared <b>to</b> mount among <b>the</b> grim glaciers and the everlasting snows.|$|R
60|$|Again I {{climbed to}} the ship's rail. This time I succeeded in raising <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level of the deck, where I could take a careful survey of the {{conditions}} immediately confronting me.|$|E
6000|$|I cast <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{stranded}} vessel--when {{the breach}} and froth {{of the sea}} being so big I could hardly see it, it lay so far off--and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Vivian; {{you have}} opened <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} in which fortune has placed me. The experience of every day only proves the truth and soundness of your views. Fortunate, indeed, was the hour in which we met." ...|$|E
60|$|I cast <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> {{downward}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brown planks of the dull, plodding ship, silent from stem to stern; then abroad.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will it be long--will it be short?" [...] thought I, passing my {{hand across}} <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> {{dissipate}} <b>the</b> silvery dimness of a suave, south-wind shower.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 As {{a student}} of geology, I attuned <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exactitude of {{observation}} required <b>to</b> convey <b>the</b> history of a place. My interest in the poetic work of observation led me to Lorine Niedecker’s “Lake Superior. ” In that poem, historical, folkloric, and scientific knowledge crop up alongside the poet-speaker’s primary thoughts and perceptions. Observation becomes an artifact. Such encapsulated perceptions broaden the viewpoint through which one human might understand geologic time...|$|R
6000|$|I cast <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{stranded}} vessel, {{when the}} breach and troth {{of the sea}} being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madonna?" [...] I challenged, and emulating {{something}} of old Falcone's attitude, I drew myself erect, flung back my head, and brought <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level {{of her own}} by an effort of will such as I had never yet exerted.|$|E
60|$|Lying {{back with}} closed eyes, I lost count of time. I even forgot that Kohokumu was {{chanting}} till reminded {{of it by}} his ceasing. An exclamation made me bare <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stab of the sun. He was gazing down through the water-glass.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> wandered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter {{lying on}} the table. If this were of the nature we suspected, it should prove a safer tool for his destruction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Agnes," [...] exclaimed, as I walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{house with}} my hands clasped and <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> raised <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky, [...] "the glacial period has given thee to me!" ...|$|R
60|$|And while {{upon this}} subject I will remark that once in Star City, in the Humboldt Mountains, I took {{my place in}} a sort of long, post-office single file of miners, to patiently await my chance to peep through a crack in the cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensation--a genuine, live Woman! And at the end of half of an hour my turn came, and I put <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crack, and there she was, with one arm akimbo, and tossing flap-jacks in a frying-pan with the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a matter}} for prayer and consideration," [...] said Major Oakshott. [...] "Meantime, reverend sir, I thank you most heartily for the {{goodness}} with which you have treated my untoward son, and likewise for having opened <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> root of his freakishness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He has {{produced}} a large pair of scissors, and drawn a roll of some substance, not unlike parchment in appearance, from the tin case. The experiment is about to begin. I must strain <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> utmost, {{in the attempt to}} follow its minutest operation.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No doubt, Madame,” I said, raising <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> figure outside—“Américain, Catholique et gentilhomme”—walking up {{and down}} the path with a cigar which he was not smoking. “For myself, I don’t know {{anything}} about those necessities. I have broken away for ever from those things.” ...|$|E
60|$|I lifted <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> city I {{was seeking}} evanished away indeed. But nearer at hand {{a child was}} playing upon the beach, whose spade among the pebbles had caused the birdlike noise I had heard.|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> wandered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mossy, mottled, garden walls, where plum-trees and pear-trees, {{flattened}} {{and fastened}} upon the rusty bricks, looked like crucified figures with many arms. [...] "Does n't it promise well?" [...] I inquired.|$|R
60|$|I now {{felt all}} my native pride buoyant within me; I no longer walked with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> bent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dust; hope {{elevated}} them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skies; my soul was {{lit up with}} fresh fires, and beamed from my countenance.|$|R
60|$|I turned <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room again. Now {{the blind}} was up, faint spectres of its {{furnishing}} {{came out of}} the darkness. There was a huge curtained bed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something of the shimmer of marble.|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the farm, it was evening. The lamp was not yet lighted in the hall. Pausing to accustom <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obscurity indoors, I heard {{the voice of the}} lawyer whom we had employed for the defense speaking to some one very earnestly.|$|E
6000|$|LOMAX [much concerned, {{sitting down}} sympathetically on the settee beside Barbara] I'm awfully sorry, Barbara. You know I helped you all I could with the {{concertina}} and so forth. [Momentously] Still, I have never shut <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that there}} is a certain amount of tosh about the Salvation Army. Now the claims of the Church of England-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Cocteau's stage play Les Parents terribles {{was first}} {{produced}} in Paris in 1938, but its run {{suffered from a}} number of disruptions, first from censorship and then the outbreak of war. In 1946 it was revived in a production which brought together several of the actors for whom Cocteau had originally conceived their roles, notably Yvonne de Bray, Gabrielle Dorziat, and Jean Marais. Cocteau said that he wanted to film his play for three reasons. [...] "First, <b>to</b> record <b>the</b> performances of incomparable actors; second, mingle with them myself and look them full in the face instead of seeing them at a distance on the stage. I wanted <b>to</b> put <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> keyhole and surprise them with a telescopic lens." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{these two}} Observations <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Rings distinct, {{and without any}} other Colour than Black and white, I found it {{necessary}} <b>to</b> hold <b>my</b> <b>Eye</b> at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of <b>my</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Plane of the Rings, there emerged a bluish Colour out of the white, which by dilating it self more and more into the black, render'd the Circles less distinct, and left the white a little tinged with red and yellow. I found also by looking through a slit or oblong hole, which was narrower than the pupil of <b>my</b> <b>Eye,</b> and held close to it parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prisms, I could see the Circles much distincter and visible to a far greater number than otherwise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ventured to}} raise <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mate's face; {{it was cold}} and impassive. I turned my face toward the crew; they were conversing in whispers with each other, with their faces toward us, yet {{apparently}} utterly oblivious of the scene that had just taken place in the stern. There was a moment of silence, and then the mate's voice came out quite impassively, but distinctly:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{unbroken}} {{stillness of}} the parlour window leading me to infer, after a while, {{that she was not}} there, I lifted up <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window above it, where I saw a florid, pleasant-looking gentleman, with a grey head, who shut up one eye in a grotesque manner, nodded his head at me several times, shook it at me as often, laughed, and went away.|$|E
60|$|I lifted <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. In my righteous indignation, I forgot Lucilla and {{her curiosity}} about Oscar--I forgot Oscar and his horror of Lucilla {{discovering}} who he was. I opened my lips to speak. In another moment I should have launched my thunderbolts against the whole infamous system of modern society, when I was silenced {{by the most}} extraordinary and unexpected interruption that ever closed a woman's lips.|$|E
60|$|As I lifted <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clear bright sky, I saw {{the high}} tower where Jemmy had stood above the birds, seeing that very window; {{and the last}} look of that poor pretty young mother when her soul brightened and got free, seemed to shine down from it.|$|R
60|$|I turned <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed, and it {{was with}} a mixture of {{disappointment}} oddly mingled with pleasure, that I saw my first suspicion had deceived me. I saw a head neither young nor beautiful, garnished with a grey beard of two days' growth, and accommodated with a red nightcap. The first glance put me at ease on the score of Diana Vernon; the second, as the slumberer awoke from a heavy sleep, yawned, and rubbed his eyes, presented me with features very different indeed--even those of my poor friend Owen. I drew back out of view an instant, that he might have time to recover himself; fortunately recollecting that I was but an intruder on these cells of sorrow, and that any alarm might be attended with unhappy consequences.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> strayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> silent scene {{beyond the}} window, silent, it seemed, {{with the very}} {{presence}} of poor Mr Hubbins. [...] "I should not like to go <b>to</b> Hell in <b>the</b> snow," [...] I said ruminatingly. Out of the past welled into memory an old ballad my mother had taught me:-- ...|$|R
