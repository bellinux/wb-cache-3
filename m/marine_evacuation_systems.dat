40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} three studies {{completed}} {{in the area of}} marine safety. The first study focused on the compatibility between the anthropometric characteristics of persons employed in the offshore oil industry in Newfoundland and liferaft and lifeboat evacuations systems employed in the offshore. Findings from this study suggest that manufacturers should consider shoulder breadth, rather than hip breadth measurements as a better criterion for determining seat design and lifesaving appliance occupancy capacities. Furthermore, the typical morphological features of a typical person employed in the Newfoundland offshore are considerably larger than the standards used in the type approval process. This study concludes that testing standards should be reconsidered. The second study assessed the requirements for measuring forces and accelerations acting on humans engaged in <b>marine</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>systems</b> such as chutes and slides. While no subjects reported pain or injury due to these tasks, the upper limits of loading recorded might have the potential to injure a younger, older or less-fit person. The study concludes that manufacturers should be aware of human tolerance limits when developing evacuations systems. The third study consisted of the measurement of egress times for injured or physically challenged users of <b>marine</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>systems.</b> Data from the study reported it takes on average 89. 3 s and a maximum of 129. 8 s for a mannequin loaded stretcher to descend through a slide and be placed into its final position in the raft. Throughout the trials, mannequins experienced head accelerations of approximately 2 Gs. There was a general trend that heavier stretchers seemed to better secure/restrain the mannequin and resulted in smaller accelerations during the descent. This thesis provides considerable guidance to regulatory bodies and manufacturers in the development, testing and deployment of <b>marine</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{trend in}} {{regulation}} {{development in the}} offshore and maritime industries appears {{to be away from}} specification-based standards and towards goal-based standards. While the merits of these regulatory regimes can and should be debated, the interest of the present work is in presenting some possible measures by which the performance of <b>evacuation</b> <b>systems</b> can be evaluated or benchmarked. The <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> considered here is the ubiquitous twin falls davit launched TEMPSC lifeboat system. Using a general statement of the goal of an <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> as a starting point, several performance measures are proposed along with a conceptual framework of the evacuation zone. These are then used to interpret results of model scale experiments, which have been done in order to assess the capabilities of <b>evacuation</b> <b>systems,</b> and to investigate the influence of weather, system configuration, and other factors on those capabilities.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a systematic study aimed at establishing {{the capabilities of}} <b>evacuation</b> <b>systems</b> installed on offshore structures {{as a function of}} environmental conditions, installation conditions, and load capacity of the life craft. Model scale experiments on an <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> were performed from a fixed platform at the Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT), Offshore Engineering Basin (OEB) during January 2002. A conventional twin falls davit <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> fitted with a flexible boom was used to deploy a Totally Enclosed Motor Propelled Survival Craft (TEMPSC) from a fixed platform into wind and wave conditions ranging from calm to storm conditions. The experiments involved the investigation of the performance of the <b>evacuation</b> <b>system</b> in seas ranging from Beaufort 0 (calm) to Beaufort 8 (fresh gale) equivalent. Particular attention was focused on the effects of TEMPSC loading conditions (either 100 % or 70 % capacity), TEMPSC orientation, intact versus damaged installation, direction of weather relative to launch, use of flexible boom or davit system alone, wave type (regular or irregular) and wave steepness.
