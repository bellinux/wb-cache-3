40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Intravenous patient-controlled {{analgesia}} (IV PCA) <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{can be used}} with a reasonable margin of safety. DESIGN: A retrospective review was performed of 355 medical records of patients receiving IV PCA meperidine treatment. Four groups of patients were defined, based on daily meperidine dose and {{the presence or absence of}} central nervous system excitation adverse effects. Use of more than 600 mg/d of <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was considered a high dose. SETTING: University tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Postoperative patients from general, orthopedic, neurosurgical, gynecological, and urologic procedures receiving IV PCA. INTERVENTIONS: If patients were judged to have consumed significant amounts of meperidine, the analgesic regimen was modified to (1) discontinue meperidine therapy, (2) substitute hydromorphone hydrochloride, or (3) decrease the use of meperidine by adding oral methadone hydrochloride or transdermal fentanyl citrate to the regimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients who received less than 10 mg/kg per day of IV PCA <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> therapy were unlikely to experience central nervous system excitatory adverse effects and maintain adequate analgesia. RESULTS: The mean <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> consumption for those patients classified as high dose, asymptomatic was 13. 3 mg/kg per day (95...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} tumor location and pain level in computed tomography (CT) -guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under local anesthesia. MethodsA total of 42 tumors in 35 HCC patients were given CT-guided percutaneous MWA under local anesthesia after transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization. The 35 patients {{were divided into two}} groups based on the distance from the tumor to the Glisson′s capsule and/or the branch of the portal vein. Group A (19 tumors out of 16 patients) had a distance of ≤ 5 mm from the tumor to the Glisson′s capsule and/or the branch of the portal vein, and group B (23 tumors out of 19 patients) had a distance of ＞ 5 mm from the tumor to both the Glisson's capsule and the branch of the portal vein. The pain levels of the two groups were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). The tumor size, baseline VAS score, intraoperative VAS score (the highest VAS score during MWA), relative VAS score (intraoperative VAS score minus baseline VAS score), the highest tolerated MWA power, ablation time, and <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> dose were recorded and compared between the two groups. The comparison was made by Mann-Whitney U test. ResultsThe 16 cases in group A had significantly higher intraoperative VAS score and relative VAS score than the 19 cases in group B (3. 25 ± 0. 68 vs 2. 74 ± 0. 73, P= 0. 042; 3. 00 ± 0. 52 vs 2. 47 ± 0. 61, P= 0. 009). It showed that the patients whose tumor was close to the Glisson′s capsule had a greater pain level than the patients whose tumor was away from the Glisson′s capsule. The dose of <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (78. 1 ± 20. 2 mg vs 64. 5 ± 17  3 mg, P= 0. 039). After treatment with high dose of <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> groups A and B showed no significant differences in the highest tolerated MWA power and ablation time (73. 8 ± 15. 4 W vs 75. 8 ± 17. 7 W, P＞ 0. 05; 6. 6 ± 1. 8 min vs 6. 4 ± 2. 1 min, P＞ 0  05). ConclusionThe patients who have a longer distance between the tumor and the Glisson′s capsule and the branch of the portal vein suffer greater pain in MWA therapy. Additional <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> can help complete the MWA treatment...|$|E
40|$|Migraine {{can be a}} {{disabling}} {{condition for}} the sufferer. For {{the small number of}} patients for whom home therapy fails and who seek treatment in an emergency department, several therapeutic options are available. I review the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the following therapies: the phenothiazines, lignocaine (lidocaine), ketorolac, the ergot alkaloids, metoclopramide hydrochloride, the “triptans,” haloperidol, pethidine (<b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride),</b> and magnesium sulfate. Based on available evidence, the most effective agents seem to be prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and sumatriptan, each of which has achieved greater than 70 % efficacy in several studies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dexamethasone has {{anti-inflammatory}} {{properties that}} can affect postoperative analgesia when added to caudal bupivacaine. Methods: Seventy-two geriatric patients scheduled for elective total hip replacement under ultrasound guided caudal anesthesia were randomized blindly into two groups: Group BD received caudal isobaric bupivacaine 0. 25 % (20  ml) and dexamethasone 8  mg (2  ml) and Group BS received caudal isobaric bupivacaine 0. 25 % (20  ml) and normal saline (2  ml). Postoperative analgesia was assessed by recording time to first rescue analgesia and the analgesic doses (paracetamol and <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> required during the first 24  h postoperatively as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the time taken to the onset of sensory analgesia at T 10, time to the onset of complete motor block, VAS pain score at rest and on movement at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24  h, and postoperative adverse events. Results: Group BD had a significantly longer time to first rescue analgesia [402 (63) vs 213 (53) ] min and significantly lower doses of paracetamol [3389 (728) vs 2833 (697) ] mg <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> [78 (30) vs 142 (28) ] mg than Group BS. VAS scores were significantly lower in Group BD than Group BS both at rest and on movement respectively at 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24  h. Conclusion: Adding dexamethasone with isobaric bupivacaine caudal anesthesia prolongs the duration of postoperative analgesia and decreased postoperative analgesic requirement in geriatric patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery in comparison isobaric bupivacaine alone...|$|E
40|$|A {{commonly}} prescribed drug combination, (hydroxyzine hydrochloride, <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and atropine sulfate), utilized as a preanesthetic medication, was {{studied to}} compare possible differences in stability between mixtures stored in glass and plastic containers. Combinations of drugs were stored in both glass and plastic syringes at 25 C and 3 C for a ten-day period. Analyses were performed at intervals throughout {{the time period}} utilizing visual examination, pH determination, ultraviolet absorption spectra, and gas chromatography. No significant degradation of the syringe contents nor appearance of additional constituents were detected {{in any of the}} admixture preparations. Thus storage of such preparations in glass versus plastic syringes yielded no significant differences in product stability...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{clinically}} healthy mongrel dogs of either sex {{of about one}} year of age were randomly divided in to three groups containing five dogs in each. The ketamine hydrochloride was administered epidurally at lumbosacral space in group I, whereas pentazocine and <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were given epidurally in combination with ketamine hydrochloride in group II and III, respectively. AST, ALT, glucose and creatinine showed a significant variation within normal physiological limits; whereas, GGT, BUN and total protein did not showed a significant variation (P> 0. 05) at respective intervals of observation. It may be concluded that epidural administration of ketamine in combination of opioids are safe and did not produce deleterious effect on vital organs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if women who had Cesarean birth experiences and used transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation as a means of pain control requested less pain medication and had shorter hospital stays than those who did not use TENS. I reviewed the medical charts of 72 women (46 using TENS, 26 not using TENS) retrospectively. Significantly less (F = 5. 77; df = 1, 65; p <. 02) <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was administered to the women who used TENS. The length of hospital stay of women using TENS was not significantly different than those who did not use TENS. My findings suggest that the use of TENS after Cesarean birth may result in decreased usage of medication and, therefore, a reduction of the side effects of the medication both to the mother and the infant. Key Words: Cesarean section; Electric stimulation; Pain, postoperative; Puerperium. The use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation as a new technique of pain control has increased since its pro...|$|E
40|$|BARBITURATE {{intoxication}} is {{an important}} cause of morbidity and mortality. The following case report describes a severe case of barbiturate intoxication in which hemodialysis, as recently recommended by Kyle 2 and Alwall, 1 was applied. Since we have noted reports of only five patients with barbiturate intoxication 1 _ 4 treated by hemodialysis, the striking clinical changes in a patient during hemo-dialysis prompted a report of this case. CASE REPORT A 63 year old white married woman {{was admitted to the}} Albany Hospital Emer-gency Room in coma at 5 : 00 p. m. Her husband related that the patient had been moody and depressed for the previous four weeks. At 1 : 00 p. m. on the day of admission he found the patient staggering about the house. Three hours later he found her lying unresponsive beside an empty bottle of <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and an empty bottle of Tuinal (equal parts of amobarbital and secobarbital). Physical examination on admission revealed a comatose woman who was without visible spontaneous respirations. Blood pressure was 60 / 0 mm. of H g; pulse, 46...|$|E
40|$|DOWNES, JOHN J., RICHARD A. KEu AND C. J. LAMBERTSEN: The {{magnitude}} {{and duration of}} respiratory depression due to fentanyl and meperidine in man. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 158 : 416 - 420, 1967. The effect of the potent analgesic, fentanyl, on minute volume, tidal volume and respiratory frequency at a controlled alveolar carbon dioxide tension of 46 mm Hg in six normal adult men was determined at intervals over a 4 -hr period. Fentanyl was administered i. m. in two doses (0. 1 mg and 02 mg) and the effects were {{compared with those of}} i. m. physiologic saline (2. 0 ml) and <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (75 mg), all on the basis of 70 kg of body weight. In the doses employed (fentanyl, 0. 1 mg; meperidine, 75 mg), the magnitude of maximal depression of the two narcotics is similar. Thus, in equi-analgesic doses (fentanyl, 0. 1 mg; meperidine, 65 mg) maximal ventilatory depression with fentanyl would be slightly greater. However, the onset and peak depression of minute ventilation, as well as the recovery toward control levels, occurs more rapidly with fentanyl. Thus, fentanyl may be a useful narcotic agent when rapid onset and recovery from the effects of the analgesic are desired...|$|E
40|$|OPERATION: Local {{resection}} of {{the head}} of the pancreas combined with longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy of the body and tail of the pancreas (LR-LPJ) was designed to improve decompression {{of the head}} of the pancreas, which often was not drained well by standard longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy. This was achieved by excising the head of the pancreas overlying the ducts of Wirsung and Santorini, and duct to the uncinate, along with their tributary ducts. PATIENT MATERIAL: The operation has been performed on 50 patients. There were five late deaths among the 50 patients; two at 6 months, and one each at 24, 26, and 91 months. Eighty percent of the patients were alcoholics, 50 % had pseudocysts, and 80 % had calcification. ASSESSMENT: Pain was assessed on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being most severe. Narcotic intake was considered minimal-Vicodin equivalent (hydrocodone bitartate, 5 mg, acetaminophen, 500 mg; Vicodin, Knoll Pharmaceuticals, Whippany, NJ) once or twice/month; moderate [...] Vicodin weekly daily; and major [...] <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Demerol, Winthrop Pharmaceuticals, New York, NY) weekly or daily. RESULTS: Pain relief in 47 patients was excellent (74. 5 %), improved in 12. 75 %, and unimproved in 12. 75 %. Endocrine status in 45 patients was as follows: 69 % were not diabetic, and 20 % were diabetic preoperatively and postoperatively. Postoperatively, 11 % had progression of their diabetes. Exocrine function was not worsened and may have been improved in some patients. Sixty-four percent of 39 patients gained an average of 15. 3 pounds. Fifty-nine percent of patients were not working preoperatively or postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The LR-LPJ provides good pain relief with a modest increase in endocrine and exocrine insufficiency and a significant increase in weight. Even when relieved of pain, patients seldom return to the work force...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis The unique toxic and {{adverse effects}} of <b>meperidine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> have {{prompted}} a number of expert panels convened by national health care policy organizations to recommend that meperidine {{not be used in}} older patients. We hypothesized that the prescription of meperidine was less likely to reflect these recommendations in older surgical patients than in older medical patients. The current study examined the use of meperidine in 2 urban hospitals as 1 quality indicator of the care of older adults, measuring the prevalence of its use and characteristics of the patients to whom it is administered. Design Retrospective analysis. Setting Two urban hospitals: a large private tertiary care teaching hospital and a smaller academically affiliated Veterans Affairs medical center. Patients Patients 65 years or older and hospitalized on medical and surgical services between February 19, 2001, and February 14, 2003. Main Outcome Measures Patient demographics, medication administration, and department of admitting physician. Results Meperidine was administered to approximately 1 in 8 older surgical patients at both institutions. Surgical patients were more likely than medical patients to receive a dose of meperidine (hospital A, 12. 2 % vs 4. 3 %, P<. 001; hospital B, 12. 9 % vs 1. 9 %, P<. 001). Of those administered meperidine, surgical patients were also more likely than medical patients to receive multiple doses (hospital A, 86. 0 % vs 65. 5 %, P = 3 D. 045; hospital B, 73. 8 % vs 48. 4 %, P = 3 D. 02). Conclusions Contrary to national recommendations, meperidine continues to be administered to many hospitalized older adults, particularly those on surgical services. Several alternatives to meperidine exist that provide equal or better pain relief with fewer toxic effects. Hospitals and, in particular, departments of surgery should address this cause of preventable morbidity in this vulnerable population...|$|E
