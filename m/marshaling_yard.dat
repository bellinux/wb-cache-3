He parachuted down safely at Saint-Omer in the Pas-de-Calais, but was immediately captured by a Wehrmacht patrol.|$|E
25|$|Güvercinlik Yard {{in central}} Ankara {{is the largest}} railway {{facility}} in Turkey. This multi-use facility includes a <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard,</b> passenger yard, 3 repair shops, for passenger cars, freight cars and locomotives, freight transfer terminal and a grain silo siding. The Haydarpaşa Yard is the second largest yard in Turkey, consisting of a freight yard, passenger yard, 3 maintenance shops for locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars, and a loop for trains.|$|E
25|$|Carlisle {{also became}} a major railway centre with at one time 7 {{different}} companies using Carlisle Citadel railway station. Prior to {{the building of the}} Citadel railway station, Carlisle had several railway stations, including London Road railway station. Carlisle also used to have the largest railway <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard</b> in Europe at Kingmoor which, although reduced in size, is still very much operational and used by railfreight companies like Colas Rail Freight, Freightliner Heavy Haul, DB Schenker Rail UK (formerly EWS) and very occasionally Direct Rail Services.|$|E

25|$|The {{route of}} the {{proposed}} new line and in particular, the proposed siting of new marshaling yards at Rotorua {{was the reason for}} much of the objections. NZR wanted to extend the existing Rotorua Branch line from the central city station, across Fenton Street to Ngapuna where they proposed having a large <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard,</b> along with a spur line running south to the Waipa State Mill. Many people in Rotorua objected to having a railway crossing Fenton Street and wanted the railway marshaling yards located at Waipa instead of Ngapuna. NZR objected to shifting the marshaling yards, as it would significantly increase the cost of the project.|$|E
25|$|Shunting signals allow a {{train to}} move forward onto a line which may already be occupied, for example the {{platform}} of a station, a siding, or a particular road in a <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard.</b> Modern ones comprise of three lenses in a triangular formation. They may be attached to a main signal in which case they are only cleared when the shunting movement is required (known as a subsidiary signal). When cleared they display two white lights at an angle of 45° indicating that the driver may pass the signal with caution, even if the main signal is showing danger, but at a speed that allows the train to stop short of any obstruction. When not cleared these signals would be unlit, displaying nothing, and the train driver would simply obey the aspect of the main signal.|$|E
2500|$|The USAF {{report also}} states {{that two of}} Dresden's traffic routes were of {{military}} importance: north-south from Germany to Czechoslovakia, and east-west along the central European uplands. The city was at the junction of the Berlin-Prague-Vienna railway line, {{as well as the}} Munich-Breslau, and Hamburg-Leipzig lines. Colonel Harold E. Cook, a US POW held in the Friedrichstadt <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard</b> the night before the attacks, later said that [...] "I saw with my own eyes that Dresden was an armed camp: thousands of German troops, tanks and artillery and miles of freight cars loaded with supplies supporting and transporting German logistics towards the east to meet the Russians".|$|E

2500|$|Numerous {{trucking}} {{companies and}} a truck <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard,</b> covered by asphalt and pierced by pollution test wells, lie directly {{north of the}} PG (now Mirant) power plant on former Naval ship building ways that were backfilled in 1970 with construction rubble, soil, concrete and non-permitted wastes. Chemicals found in limited testing in bay mud and in the old Navy slips include hydrocarbons, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, and xylene. [...] Other wastes identified include paint, oil, batteries, thinner, adhesives, herbicides, acids, and unknown [...] drums. The two major owners of the filled land in the Potrero are the Port of San Francisco and PG, before selling out to Mirant. The environmental liabilities still belong to PG.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bombing of}} Dresden was a British/American aerial bombing {{attack on the}} city of Dresden, {{the capital of the}} German state of Saxony, that took place during the Second World War in the European Theatre. In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and {{incendiary}} devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed over [...] of the city centre. An estimated 22,700 to 25,000 people were killed, although larger casualty figures have been claimed over the years. Three more USAAF air raids followed, two occurring on 2 March aimed at the city's railroad <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard</b> and one smaller raid on 17 April aimed at industrial areas.|$|E

Between Adamstown and Broadmeadow railway stations {{there is a large}} <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard</b> that opened in 1938. Adjoining this <b>marshaling</b> <b>yard</b> was Broadmeadow Locomotive Depot which was the second largest steam locomotive depot in the state, and served the last mainline steam locomotives in service on the New South Wales Government Railways in 1973. The depot was then used for the stabling & servicing of Diesel locomotives until the depot was closed in 1994.|$|E
50|$|On 11 January 1945 B-29's of the 20th Air Force {{attacked}} Penang. A further {{attack on}} Penang occurred on 24 February. This {{was followed by}} {{an attack on the}} <b>marshaling</b> <b>yards</b> in Kuala Lumpar plus Alor Star airfield on 10 March. The Royal Selangor museum was hit by bombs on 15 March. The bombs were intended for the Kuala Lumpar <b>marshaling</b> <b>yards.</b> On 28 March mines were dropped in several harbours and the last Malaya mission by the 20th Air Force took place on 29 March when attack was made on a mix of targets. Attacks on the ports ceased around this time as Mountbatten intended to use the ports during the proposed invasion of Malaya. Attacks continued against rail, coastal shipping, and other targets.|$|R

Through mid-1943, the group attacked strategic targets as submarine pens, docks, harbors, shipyards, motor works, and <b>marshaling</b> <b>yards</b> in France, Germany, and the Low Countries.|$|R
50|$|Colwick {{was one of}} {{the largest}} <b>marshaling</b> <b>yards</b> of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) after 193. The decline in its use of the {{facility}} began after the advent of British Railways (BR) in 1948. During the 1950s, the fortunes of the yard matched the decline in use of coal. In 1954 100,000 wagons were handled each month, but this had fallen to 90,000 by 1957 and 70,000 in 1959. The closure of Mapperley Tunnel after a rockfall in April 1960, further reduced the traffic using Colwick, so that barely 50,000 wagons were being handled by 1960. The yard was transferred to the London Midland Region of British Railways in 1966 and its remaining traffic was diverted to the nearby <b>marshaling</b> <b>yards</b> at Toton. The facility was almost entirely closed 12 April 1970 and is now the site of the Victoria Retail Park.|$|R
