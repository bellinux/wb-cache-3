25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
500|$|I used to {{play about}} with bells and buzzers and things around the house. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> {{sometimes}} say [...] "Oh, come and help me find something, it's so dark in this cupboard" [...] – she didn't have very good eyesight… So I'd get a battery and I'd hook a switch, and when she opened that cupboard door a light would come on… I started sort of playing with those things.|$|E
500|$|Braun's {{nickname}} [...] "The Hebrew Hammer", {{which was}} also a nickname for former All-Stars Al Rosen and Hank Greenberg, refers to his Jewish heritage. It is also the nickname of former teammate Gabe Kapler and alludes to former Milwaukee star Hank Aaron (whose nickname was [...] "Hammerin' Hank"), and the movie The Hebrew Hammer, starring Adam Goldberg. In response to the nickname, Braun's mother reiterated, [...] "He's totally not Jewish. I heard some organization started called him ‘The Hebrew Hammer.’ I said, ‘Oh no.’ <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> be rolling over in her grave if she heard that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ovid smiled--not cheerfully. [...] "Do {{you think}} <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> be {{in a state}} of indescribable {{agitation}} if there was not money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} your feeling, Cyril, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> assuredly <b>would</b> {{always have been}} pleased to see you. You know you were a favourite of hers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Horrible, Bignall! <b>my</b> Lady <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> faint at the suggestion. Nothing so low {{has been}} in the family, I do assure you, since the time when chivalry was genteel." ...|$|R
500|$|He {{publicly}} supported Sinn Féin and {{the unification}} of Ireland, although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long-standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster (abstentionism). Sinn Féin in turn argued that {{to do so would}} recognise Britain's claim over Northern Ireland, and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British-created institution. A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution, Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence, saying: [...] "I think nationalism is a mistake. And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife. The thought that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> suddenly be a foreigner would upset me very much." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush is of English, French, and Swiss ancestry. Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business. [...] Early on, her parents encouraged her to read, leading to what would become her love of reading. She said, [...] "I learned [...] at home from my mother. When I was a little girl, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> read stories to me. I have loved books {{and going to the}} library ever since. In the summer, I liked to spend afternoons reading in the library. I enjoyed the Little House on the Prairie and Little Women books, and many others... Reading gives you enjoyment throughout your life." [...] Bush has also credited her second grade teacher, Charlene Gnagy, for inspiring her interest in education.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{spoke of}} calling, and while I {{could not help}} being grateful, I knew how fallen <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> think me to welcome the notice of Pippa and Hippo.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! {{let me go}} to my own room,' murmured Ferdinand, in a faint voice. 'That {{room where}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> said the day would come--oh! what did <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> say? <b>Would</b> there were only mother's love, and then I should not be here or thus.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She 's awfully careful. I {{never saw}} any one so careful. But I suppose she is right. She promised <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> she <b>would</b> be tremendously particular; but I don't know what she thinks I would do." ...|$|R

[...] "The food was delicious," [...] Shabazz {{recalled}} in 1992, [...] "I'd never tasted food like that." [...] After dinner, the woman asked Sanders {{to come to the}} Muslims' lecture. Sanders agreed. After the speech, the nurse's aide invited Sanders to join the Nation of Islam; Sanders politely declined. When the woman asked her why she chose not to join the Nation of Islam after visiting, Sanders replied that she did not know she had been brought there to join. [...] "Besides, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> kill me, and additionally I don’t even understand the philosophy." [...] The Malloys were Methodists, and when she was 13, Sanders had decided she would remain a Methodist {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E
2500|$|... "Besides, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> {{have killed}} me if I hadn’t spoken up. No Hungarian after Communism, or Cuban after Castro, is {{not aware that}} human rights are {{incompatible}} with cruelty. The debate here isn’t only how to protect the country. It’s how to protect our values." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The other citizen {{also gave}} me five livres," [...] he said humbly. [...] "He lodges {{in the house}} where <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is concierge. It is in the Rue de la Croix Blanche. He has been very kind to <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I <b>would</b> rather do as he bade me." ...|$|R
50|$|Other famous novels {{include the}} posthumously {{published}} <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> (which <b>would</b> {{become the basis}} of Christophe Honoré's film Ma Mère), The Impossible and Blue of Noon, which, with its incest, necrophilia, politics, and autobiographical undertones, is a much darker treatment of contemporary historical reality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> eyes <b>would</b> {{let me have}} no rest {{in keeping}} him. Otherwise--Talk not to me of gladness, Friedel! Thou shouldst know better. How is one to be a knight with nothing to ride but a beast {{old enough to be}} his grandmother?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All, all I hoped or {{longed for}} I have," [...] murmured Richard. [...] "If you see Henry, my Lord, bear him my greetings--and to poor Adam--yea, and <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> Oh! <b>would</b> that I {{could make them}} all know your {{kindness}} and my joy--that it should be thus!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can you not? If you saw him, and the house, and <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> you <b>would</b> not say so. In the Bible {{it is said}} of some {{season that}} it is not a time for marrying, or for giving in marriage. And so it is with us." ...|$|R
60|$|I, too, was moved, for {{it seemed}} as though the time were come at last when {{something}} of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> history <b>would</b> be made known to me. But he seemed in no hurry to speak again. It was I who had to remind him of my presence.|$|R
60|$|Much to my surprise, I {{found that}} neither Nicholas Naranovitsch nor Bella nor <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> consent to witness my {{experiments}} with dynamite that day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know," [...] she answered. [...] "But even to {{the last}} Monsieur Feurgéres hesitated. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> never have wished me to be miserable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother was}} a captive princess here," [...] replied A-Kor. [...] "I but do for the Princess of Helium what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> have me do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Lois," [...] he said, [...] "what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{has advised}} <b>would</b> make me very happy. Will you {{remember}} that I wish it? Will {{you remember that}}?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Each will think: 'This falsifier {{knows that}} I too am a liar. [...] Curse {{him for a}} son of Satan, all unholily compound! [...] Curse my leader for another!

6000|$|Then <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> {{begin to}} laugh. ‘I {{would find out}} first {{if he had a}} family, and then I would say they were the finest family in London.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad she}} laughed at <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I <b>would</b> not give the old lady for a dozen beauties. That sneer did me all the good in the world. Thank you, Miss Fanshawe!" [...] And he lifted his hat from his waved locks, and made a mock reverence.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I {{come back}} here, father, after I see <b>my</b> <b>mother?</b> I <b>would</b> fain {{be of some}} use, if I may. I am known {{to many of the}} sailors down at the port; I might go about among them trying to stir them up in favour of Hannibal." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{thought of}} <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and <b>would</b> not commit myself further, and I rose to leave him; I had, however, waited too long.
