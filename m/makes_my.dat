[...] Valo and the rest of HIM have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative.

She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted {{what you have in}} your life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons.

500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on Kurt's storyline as he faced being {{perceived}} primarily as gay both when auditioning and when running for class president. VanDerWerff {{said it was}} [...] "the most consistent" [...] storyline, and Canning called it [...] "the most familiar story", but also described Kurt as [...] "by far the most interesting and most layered" [...] character, his stories [...] "delivering the most emotional connections", and this episode's installments [...] "entertaining territory". Kubicek stated that there were [...] "tons" [...] of wonderful [...] "Kurt moments" [...] in the episode. Benigno called Kurt learning to embrace his gayness yet again on the show [...] "kind of awkward", and Hyman asked [...] "Was this Kurt Accepts He's Special 3.0 or 4.0? I can't keep track." [...] Votta summed up Kurt's audition quandary: [...] "Kurt is fighting typecasting, and while the ninjitsu, fingerless gloves and climbing routine {{might have been an}} attempt to butch it up, instead Kurt played right into expectations with the over-the-top Funny Girl piece." [...] His attempt to rescue the situation by reauditioning via performing a Romeo and Juliet scene with Rachel evoked laughter from the three directors and Rachel herself, but as Votta points out, Kurt was [...] "not actually being bad as Romeo". Jayma Mays, who plays Emma, one of the directors in that scene, stated in an interview that she thought Kurt was [...] "good". Kurt finding himself in competition with Blaine was also touched on, but several reviewers were unhappy with the revelation that Blaine was not a senior like Kurt, as had been implied in the previous season. VanDerWerff wrote that Blaine [...] "seems to have simultaneously gotten younger and had a complete personality transplant over the summer", Votta noted [...] "the continuity-bending plot point that he's somehow a Junior and not a Senior like his boyfriend", and Urban allowed her exasperation to show: [...] "Oh really, Glee? Blaine's a junior? Blaine's younger than Kurt? Fine. FINE." [...] MTV Jim Cantiello went into rhyme to express his dismay: [...] "It's hard to keep my bearings straight / And oh, how it <b>makes</b> <b>my</b> heart ache / Kurt and Blaine were gonna move to New York together / But now they'll have to wait", referring to a scene in the [...] "New York" [...] episode where Kurt discussed the planned move with Rachel.|$|E
