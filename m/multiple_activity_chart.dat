The chart can also be color-coded to convey information; for example, The time column is used to specify the activity of the worker and the machine, if the column is shaded with black color, it indicates that the worker or the machine is performing an operation, while if it is shaded with gray color, it refers to inspection. For moving, it is customary [...] to refer to it with diagonal lines, whereas horizontal lines indicate a holding activity. If the column is blank then the worker or the machine is idle.

40|$|Abstract. The Model-Driven Development (MDD) {{describes}} {{and maintains}} {{models of the}} system under development. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) supports a set of semantics and notation that addresses all scales of architectural complexity by using a MDD perspective. Use Cases and <b>Activity</b> <b>Charts</b> are two modeling techniques of the UML. The first one helps the designers to identify {{the requirements of the}} system discovering its high level functionality. The second one helps them to specify the internal behaviour of a certain entity or subsystem of the software developed, such as a database, a graphical interface, a software component, or any specific software. However, there is not a direct way to relate/model the requirements (use cases) with their internal behavior (<b>activity</b> <b>charts).</b> In this paper we present a method for describing use cases with <b>activity</b> <b>charts.</b> Our technique also allow us to identify the two main use case relationships —include and generalization — by means of <b>activity</b> <b>charts.</b> As a case study, we will show how to use the <b>activity</b> <b>charts</b> to describe graphical user interfaces (GUI) from use cases.

40|$|Multi-activity {{recognition}} in the urban environment is a challenging task. This is largely attributed {{to the influence of}} urban dynamics, the variety of the label sets, and the heterogeneous nature of sensor data that arrive irregularly and at different rates. One of the first tasks in multi-activity recognition is temporal segmentation. A common temporal segmentation method is the sliding window approach with a fixed window size, which is widely used for single activity recognition. In order to recognise <b>multiple</b> <b>activities</b> from heterogeneous sensor streams, we propose a new time windowing technique that can optimally extract segments with <b>multiple</b> <b>activity</b> labels. The mixture of activity labels causes the impurity in the corresponding temporal segment. Hence, larger window size imposes higher impurity in temporal segments while increasing class separability. In addition, the combination of labels from <b>multiple</b> <b>activity</b> label sets (i. e. number of unique multi-activity) may decrease as impurity increases. Naturally, these factors will affect the performance of classification task. In our proposed technique, the optimal window size is found by gaining the balance between minimising impurity and maximising class separability in temporal segments. As a result, it accelerates the learning process for recognising <b>multiple</b> <b>activities</b> (such as higher level and atomic human activities under different environment contexts) in comparison to laborious tasks of sensitivity analysis. The evaluation was validated by experiments on a real-world dataset for recognising <b>multiple</b> human <b>activities</b> in a smart environment...|$|R
