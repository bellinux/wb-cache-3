5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new <b>model</b> <b>has</b> a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work on the}} <b>model</b> <b>has</b> {{shown that}} a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as an argument for their favored policies.|$|E

5|$|This model, {{known as}} the nebular hypothesis, was first {{developed}} in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since {{the dawn of the}} space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the <b>model</b> <b>has</b> been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr <b>model</b> <b>has</b> been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are {{based on the assumption that}} HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the assumption that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical <b>model</b> <b>has</b> been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E
