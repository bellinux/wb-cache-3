40|$|The {{efficiency}} of protocols based on synthetic progesterone (Medoxy Progesterone Acetate; <b>MAP)</b> <b>and</b> gonadotropins (PMSG/FSH) for estrus synchronization was evaluated in Thai-native goats. Nulliparous goats (n = 36) {{were randomly assigned}} to 3 treatments. Treatment 1 (14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG); goats were synchronized using 60 mg MAP for 14 days combined with 300 IU PMSG administration 24 h before MAP removal. Treatment 2 (7 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG); goats received MAP for 7 days combined with 300 IU PMSG administration 24 h before <b>MAP</b> removal <b>and</b> 5 mg PGF 2 α administration at MAP removal. Treatment 3 (14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> FSH), goats received MAP for 14 days combined with 3 days of FSH injections in decreasing doses (24 mg total) beginning on day 12 of MAP treatment. Percentage of estrus was 100 % detected in goats receiving 14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG or 7 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG whereas 83. 3 % was observed in goats receiving 14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> FSH (p> 0. 05). Time from MAP removal to onset of estrus was significantly advanced (p< 0. 05) in goats receiving 14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> FSH (27. 8 ± 2. 3 h) when compared to goats receiving 7 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG (42. 0 ± 3. 5 h). Duration of estrus was longer in goats receiving 14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG (34. 0 ± 3. 3 h) than those receiving 7 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG (24. 0 ± 2. 1 h; p< 0. 05). Results indicate that estrus and ovulatory response of Thai-native goats are not different among protocols, however the use of 14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> FSH led to shorter interval to onset of estrus than the use of 7 or 14 days <b>MAP</b> <b>and</b> PMSG...|$|R

5|$|Airports {{generally}} have long, fully lit, hard-surfaced runways, full air traffic control, and navigation and landing aids. They are usually located on urban fringes, support commercial and business operations, and often exclude {{certain types of}} light aircraft. At the more rurally located airfields, the lighter end of aviation, such as microlight and gliding activities, becomes increasingly prevalent, and there are few or no commercial operations other than flying schools. At this level runways are generally shorter, and grass surfaces are increasingly common. Navigation aids are increasingly scarce, being more basic where they are available, and informal ground to air radio communication replaces air traffic control. The smallest airfields {{are too small to}} feature on general purpose Ordnance Survey (OS) <b>maps,</b> <b>and</b> lack basic facilities such as fuel and maintenance. The majority of airstrips are basically single short grass runways with no supporting facilities, although the presence of a hangar is not uncommon at the larger examples.
