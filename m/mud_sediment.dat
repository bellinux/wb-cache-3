The Aztecs, in particular, {{are well known}} for their famous chinampas, artificial islands made of mud and human waste used to grow crops that could be harvested up to 7 times a year. Current research has placed the origins of chinampas in an Aztec town of Culhuacan in the year 1100 C.E. They were constructed by first fencing an area between 30 m x 2.5 m and 91 m x 9 m, using wattle. Then filled in with <b>mud,</b> <b>sediment,</b> feces and decaying vegetation. To stabilize the chinampas, trees were often planted on the corners, primarily āhuexōtl(Salix bonplandiana) or āhuēhuētl (Taxodium mucronatum). Chinampas were very common before Spanish conquest but today they can still be found in Mexico.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to know the {{nitrification}} potential of the <b>mud</b> <b>sediment</b> of the Ariake sea tidal flat, and to investigate the individual influence of environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, salinity and ammonium concentration on its nitrification rate. The Ariake Sea is a semi-closed shallow sea with macro-tidal and the largest tidal flat in Japan. Nitrification Potential Rate (NPR) and Nitrification Rate (NR) of the tidal flat <b>mud</b> <b>sediment</b> were determined by amending sodium chlorate to inhibit the oxidation of NO 2 -N to NO 3 -N. NPRs of the sediment were 91. 4, 71. 2 and 64. 8 nmol N/g Dry Weight Sediment (DWS) /h at the depth of 0 - 3, 3 - 6 and 6 - 9 cm, respectively. NRs were relatively high in the temperatures range of 20 - 35 oC with the optimum temperature of 29. 3 oC. Relatively high NRs were determined in the range of pHs 7. 5 - 8 with the optimum pH 7. 7. The optimum salinity for nitrification was 15 ppt. NRs increased drastically in the range of salinity 10 to 15 ppt, but it decreased sharply at 15 to 20 ppt. Relationship between ammonium concentration and NR resulted a hyperbolic Michaëlis-Menten type curve (R 2 = 0. 98) with the maximum NR rate (Vmax) 32. 5 nmol N/g DWS/h at NH 4 -N concentration 3, 000 mM and the half saturation constant (Ks) 700 mM NH 4 -N.

40|$|Periodical {{observations}} {{were made to}} see {{the relation between the}} changes in bacterial population and in organic carbon, oxygen consumption, organic acid and total sulfide in the <b>mud</b> <b>sediment,</b> and pearl farm was compared with other stations. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Among various constituents of <b>mud</b> <b>sediment,</b> the change in amount of sulfide was characteristic: it was accumulated in early stage with the rising of water temperature but it decreased later. The variation in concentration of organic acid was relatively remarkable during the period of sulfide-accumulation, but, generally, it showed a trend of increase {{in the latter part of}} the period. 2. There were higher counts of aerobic bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and other heterotrophic bacteria, and also more amount of sulfide in the sediment of pearl farm than in those of other stations. The constituents of sediment in pearl farm may be considerably influenced by the biodeposition of fecal pellets of pearl-mother shells. 3. Lower water layers containing little or no dissolved oxygen occurr in the central area of this bay in summer. It seems due to the fact that the dissolved oxygen is consumed by heterotrophic bacteria and / or reducing substances in a process of decomposition of easily oxidizable organic matter such as dead planktonic organisms under the stagnation of water mass. ﻿大村湾内の底質成分および有機栄養細菌の変化を,真珠漁場底質と比較追跡し,次のような結果を得た. 1. 底質成分変化のうちで,最も特徴的なものは,硫化物の消長で,水温上昇と共に硫化物が集積するが,後半では減少する. 硫化物集積期は,有機酸の消長が著しいが,硫化物減少期は増加の傾向を示す. 2. 有機物の豊富な所は,一般細菌や硫酸還元細菌も多く,かつ硫化物の集積も多い. この傾向は,漁場で最も顕著である. 漁場では,母貝排せつ物に由来する有機物が,底質変化に大きな影響を及ぼしていると思われる. 3. 湾央部における無酸素層の成因は,水温上昇による成層発達と,プランクトン遺がいの酸化分解などによる酸素消費によるものと考えられる...|$|E

40|$|The {{liberation and}} {{accumulation}} of sulfides in the <b>mud</b> <b>sediment</b> are discussedon {{the basis of}} results of observation at Omura Bay in 1966 and 1967. In the bottom sediments, the sulfate-reduclng bacteria increase with the rising ofseawater temperature in summer, and {{play a major role}} in the production of sulfides. In the earlier period, free hydrogen sulfides liberated by bacterial actions are boundmainly with the iron which is present in the mud, and accumulated in bottomsediments but they are sometimes suspended in the bottom water as iron sulfidesdepending on the condition of seawater and bottom. In the latter period, freehydrogen sulfides, due to lack of available iron, either diffuse onto bottom wateror partially stay in the bottom sediments depending on the condition of the mud. These tendencies seem remarkable in pearl farm. Judging from the above facts and the vertical observations, it seems that anoxiclayer formation in the central part of this bay is caused by abiological or biologicaloxidation of sulfldes diffused in the bottom water from mud sediments. 1966 年と 1967 年の観測結果を基に,底質中の硫化物の挙動について,次のような考察を行なった. 大村湾内の底質中においては,夏季水温上昇と共に,硫酸還元細菌数が増加し,硫化物生成の主役を演じ,その結果発生した硫化水素は,前半期では固定・集積されるが,海況・泥質の状態によっては懸濁硫化鉄として浮揚する. また後半期では硫化水素は,易反応性鉄が不足するため,遊離の状態で水層へ拡散するか,あるいは底質の状況によってその中に一部未結合状態で存在する. これらの傾向は,真珠漁場で著しい. また,湾中央部無酸素層の生成は,これらの水層拡散,あるいは浮揚硫化物の酸化のために,溶存酸素が消費されるのが主因である...|$|E

Abrupt deviations from the average values of NGR activity and MS determined by the linear model can be interpreted as due to singular lithologies.

Focusing on the former aspect of polychaete locomotion, computational models of crawling and swimming by such tail-to-head body undulations have been developed in this paper. These are based on the Lagrangian dynamics of the system and on resistive models of its interaction with the environment, and are used for simulation studies demonstrating the generation of undulatory gaits.

Habitat 1, with moderate trawling disturbance, was characterised by homogeneous mud and associated epifauna that was also highly homogeneous across sites.
