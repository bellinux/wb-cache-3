50|$|In 1971, Dr. Semyon Gluzman wrote a {{psychiatric}} report on Grigorenko. Gluzman {{came to the}} conclusion that Grigorenko was <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for refusing to diagnose Grigorenko with a mental illness.|$|E
50|$|De Gelder's {{attorneys}} {{argued that}} he was schizophrenic and therefore could not be held fully accountable for his actions. Psychiatrists believed that De Gelder was faking psychosis and instead diagnosed him with schizotypal personality disorder with psychopathic traits and narcissistic features. The College of Psychiatrists concluded the De Gelder was <b>mentally</b> ill but <b>sane,</b> and was in control of his actions when he committed the murders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{slaughter}} itself {{must be done}} by a <b>sane</b> (<b>mentally</b> competent) adult Muslim, Jew, or Christian as {{they are}} considered [...] "People of the Book" [...] (Ahl al-Kitāb); this {{is a point of}} consensus amongst Muslim scholars. They differ, however, concerning whether Sabians and Zoroastrians are also included under People of the Book as stated in Surat al-Maʼidah, ayah 5. Modern authors have proposed that Christians who follow the Pauline doctrine of the Trinity are not included in this dispensation.|$|R

Gluzman {{came to the}} conclusion that Grigorenko was <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp for defending Grigorenko against the charge of insanity. Amnesty International declared Grigorenko a prisoner of conscience.|$|E
5000|$|Persons with accentuations of {{character}} are placed somewhere between <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> persons and psychopaths (those {{who suffer from}} different personality disorders). Referring to the famous monograph by the German psychiatrist Karl Leonhard, [...] "Accentuated Persons", Andrey Lichko emphasized {{that it is more}} correct to use the term [...] "accentuations {{of character}}" [...] instead of the term [...] "accentuated personality" [...] because personality appears to be a wider notion, which includes IQ, skills, worldview, and so on.|$|E

The family arrive to the mansion 20 years later expecting to receive part of the money, but the only heir is Annabelle West, {{as long as she}} proves to be <b>mentally</b> <b>sane.</b> If she is not, another person will receive the fortune, but the lawyer disappears before revealing the secret name.|$|E
50|$|Semyon Gluzman was {{the first}} {{psychiatrist}} in the Soviet Union to openly oppose Soviet abuse of psychiatry against dissenters. In 1971, Gluzman wrote an in-absentia psychiatric report on General Pyotr Grigorenko who spoke against the human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. Gluzman {{came to the conclusion}} that Grigorenko was <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for defending Grigorenko against the charge of insanity. On 28 November 1977, Amnesty International added Gluzman to its list of 92 members of the medical profession who were imprisoned for their political beliefs. While in prison Gluzman and fellow inmate Vladimir Bukovsky jointly wrote A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents published in Russian, English, French, Italian, German, Danish.|$|E
50|$|On 5 January 2014, the Puntland {{parliamentary}} election committee announced the pre-requisites for office that every prospective candidate for President and Vice President must meet. According {{to the committee}} chairman MP Saadiq Abshir Garaad, under Article 78 of the Puntland Constitution, presidential contenders are required to be a native of Puntland, a practicing Muslim, <b>mentally</b> <b>sane,</b> older than 40 years of age, not married to a foreigner, in possession of the necessary educational, leadership and experience credentials to hold office, and to have resided in Puntland {{over the past two}} years. As per regulation, presidential and vice presidential candidates must also pay registration fees of $10,000.00 USD and $5,000.00 USD, respectively, to the election committee. According to government officials, the registration fees are managed by the five-member election committee, and the proceeds raised during the previous 2009 election were allocated toward the construction of the new regional parliament hall. Additionally, all contenders are required to sign a document stipulating that they would accept the outcome of the election, as well as recognize and work with Puntland's newly elected leadership. Any candidate who refuses to sign the document would be denied entry into parliament hall on election day.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, a {{vigorous}} movement grew up protesting against abuse of psychiatry in the USSR. Since 1968, A Chronicle of Current Events, the main organ of Soviet human rights movement, has started publishing systematic {{information on how}} dissidents were being committed to psychiatric hospitals and forcibly, and often very painfully, treated with drugs. President of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko says psychiatric repression was obvious to his circle as early as 1968, {{and president of the}} Ukrainian Psychiatric Association Semyon Gluzman states no one of Soviet psychiatrists was going to reveal psychiatric repression until Gluzman revealed it in his report. He was the author of An In Absentia Psychiatric Opinion on the Case of P.G. Grigorenko otherwise known as An In Absentia Forensic-psychiatric Report on P.G. Grigorenko; this document started circulating in samizdat form in 1971 and was based on the medical record of Pyotr Grigorenko who spoke against the human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. Gluzman {{came to the conclusion that}} Grigorenko was <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camps and three years in Siberian exile for refusing to diagnose Grigorenko as having the mental illness.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{psychological}} consequences of sexual abuse {{in children and adolescents}}. It presents review of domestic and foreign research of psychological injury in minors. The article gives results of complex psychological and psychiatric examination of 183 juvenile victims of sexual abuse. Psychological effects of sexual abuse in children and adolescents are identified and described on the basis of age, gender, clinical characteristics of the mental state of the victim, as well as the type and duration of the abuse. Intensity and expressiveness of post-traumatic response as well as coverage of personality spheres increase with aging. The data on the gender specificity of the sexual abuse effects suggest that girls more demonstrate internal forms, while external manifestations dominate in boys. The type and duration of sexual abuse determine a wide range of possible psychological consequences. It is noted that the severity of the psychological effects of sexual abuse in victims with mental disorders associated with the trauma is higher than in victims qualified to be <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> or having a mental illness, non-associated with psychologically traumatic situations. Psychological consequences exhibited by <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> victims show a decrease in their quality of life...|$|E

40|$|While {{other jurisdictions}} use guilty but mentally ill as a {{compromise}} verdict {{to fill the}} gap between {{guilty by reason of insanity}} and a guilty verdict after an unsuccessful insanity defense, Alaska has transformed the status into a prosecutorial tool to keep mentally ill defendants incarcerated for longer than their <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> counterparts through denial of “good time” credit. Although Blakely was used—correctly—to prevent the denial of the mentally ill their Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt in December 2013 ’s State v. Clifton, the court of appeals eliminated any utility from this middle ground, rendering serious mental illness short of M’Naghten insanity a per se aggravating circumstance...|$|E
40|$|It is my {{pleasure}} to follow the invitation by AV magazine to contribute an article. The support by animal welfare organizations from Europe and increasingly from the U. S. has always been instrumental to our work both directly collaborating with us and indirectly by raising public awareness and political support. No <b>mentally</b> <b>sane</b> person enjoys carrying out experiments which entail the suffering of animals. By putting forward the 3 R principles (reduce, refine, replace) a compromise formula {{was found between the}} societal need to advance research and to limit animal use, which is nowadays widely accepted by scientific and animal welfare organizations. This 3 R concept requires a continuous development of science towards less animal use and suffering. Animal welfare organizations {{play a central role in}} maintaining the drive of this process. I will attempt a comparative analysis of the validation of alternative methods in Europe and the U. S., unavoidably simplifying and giving my personal perception addressing here a more general audience. JRC. I. 2 -Validation of biomedical testing method...|$|E
