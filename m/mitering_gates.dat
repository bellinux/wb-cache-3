40|$|<b>Miter</b> <b>gates</b> have been, {{and still}} are, {{widely used in}} {{hydraulic}} engineering as control devices for several types of locks (e. g., navigation, flood, tidal, etc). Since centuries, engineering practice suggests a range of optimal values for the angle that the gate leaves must form pointing upstream, facing the current. According to experience and literature, this optimal range corresponds to an angle between the leaf and the normal to the lock wall that varies between 9. 5 ° and 33. 7 °. It is confirmed here that in horizontally framed <b>miter</b> <b>gates,</b> {{which is the most}} usual arrangement, these optimal values depend only on the lock dimensions (span and height) and the geometric characteristics of the girder cross-section. Using a simple dimensionless geometrical parameterization and static equilibrium considerations, a general approach for the preliminary dimensioning of <b>miter</b> <b>gate</b> leaves is developed, based on the optimization of the angle between the leaves for the three most commonly used types of girder cross-section: square, rectangular, and “I-beam” (IPE series) ...|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1979, the main lock opened in 1990, {{and the full}} {{structure}} was completed in 1994. It replaced the earlier Lock and Dam No. 26, demolished in 1990, and is the first replacement structure on the Upper Mississippi River nine-foot navigation project. The main lock is 1200 ft long and 110 ft wide; the auxiliary is 600 ft long and 110 ft wide. The main lock has a vertical lift <b>gate</b> and a <b>miter</b> <b>gate</b> while the aux. lock has two <b>miter</b> <b>gates.</b> The dam is 1160 ft long with 9 tainter gates, each 110 ft wide by 42 ft high.|$|R
50|$|The lock has a 110 feet m by 600 feet m {{chamber of}} the single-lift type with <b>miter</b> <b>gates.</b> The lock has a 20 feet m normal lift and 22 feet m maximum lift.|$|R
40|$|As both {{reliability}} {{analyses and}} systematic inspection {{programs for the}} world’s infrastructure gain increased usage and prominence, it becomes more important to use the information from routine visual inspections to update lifetime reliability assessments and resulting life-cycle inspection/repair strategies. The Army Corps of Engineers currently uses reliability analyses to economically justify the major rehabilitation of navigation structures. This paper illustrates how the Condition Index visual inspections for locks and dams can be modified and used to update the reliability analysis of a steel <b>miter</b> <b>gate.</b> The <b>miter</b> <b>gates</b> on two existing locks and dams along the Mississippi River are used as examples for corrosion and fatigue deterioration. The approach used is applicable to any structure where the inspection condition states are quantitative and a model exists to relate visual inspection results to the actual deterioration state of the structure...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to ensure public safety, many civil {{engineering}} structures undergo various inspections to assess their condition or performance. Comprehensive procedures for using routine inspection data to update reliability assessments have not been developed. This paper illustrates how the Condition Index inspection data from a specific <b>miter</b> <b>gate</b> on a Corps of Engineers navigation lock can be modified and used for this purpose...|$|R
50|$|The lock at Starved Rock Lock and Dam is an Ohio River Standard navigational lock of 110 by 600 ft. The lock has a drop/lift {{of about}} 18 ft. The {{chamber of the}} lock is formed by two {{parallel}} gravity section walls 38 ft tall on the north and south. These are framed horizontally by two <b>miter</b> <b>gates</b> at {{the east and west}} ends of the lock.|$|R
50|$|GGB plain {{bearings}} {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} applications worldwide. The DX bearing is used in the Lokomat Pro, a functional robotics system used to improve mobility in individuals following neurological diseases and injuries. Additionally, GGB products {{can be found in the}} Gateshead Millennium Bridge (GGB-DBTM monometal maintenance free bearing), the <b>miter</b> <b>gates</b> of the Panama Canal (GGB-DB cast bronze hemispherical bearing), and the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Plant (HPM and HPF fiber reinforced composite bearings).|$|R
5000|$|The dam feeds two canals (North, re-built in 1848, and South, {{completed}} in 1896). At their peak, the North Canal provided up to 13,000 horsepower and the South Canal 2,000 horsepower; the Essex Company sold [...] "mill rights" [...] to its water power, allowing mills {{to use the}} energy provided. The North Canal existed before the dam, but was redeveloped both to better feed the mills and to accommodate the 30 ft drop caused by the dam. About a mile in length, the canal had a guard lock and three lift locks with <b>mitered</b> <b>gates.</b> The locks were abandoned in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 9 is a {{historic}} lock and dam complex located at Madison Township and Washington Township in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. It was built between 1935 and 1938 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and includes the lock, dam, steel <b>miter</b> <b>gates,</b> and Operations Building. The lock measures 56 feet by 360 feet, and has a lift of 22 feet. The dam measures approximately 60 feet high and 918 feet long. The Operations Building, or powerhouse, is a utilitarian two-story building in a vernacular early-20th century revival style. The lock and dam were built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{as a part of}} an extensive system of locks and dams to improve navigation along the Allegheny River.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a series of investigations to address possible lock operation problems. "Tests to determine operation forces on miter-type lock gates were conducted in a 5. 5 -ft-wide, 66. 5 -ft-long, 4. 25 -ft-deep flume equipped with a single set of <b>miter</b> <b>gate</b> leaves located approximately inthe center of the flume. Three linkages, with differenet kinematics of the operating machinery, were studied: modified Ohio River, Panama, and Ohio River. For each linkage, tests were conducted at gate submergences of 1 to 4 ft and at operating times of 10. 1 to 40. 2 sec. The effects of chamber length, bottom clearance of gates, presence of barges in the lock chamger, and nonsynchronous operation of the gate leaves also were investigated" (p. vii) ...|$|R
2500|$|Each chamber {{has three}} lateral water-saving basins, {{for a total}} of nine basins per lock and 18 basins in total. Just like the {{original}} locks, the new locks and their basins will be filled and emptied by gravity, without the use of pumps. The location of the new locks uses {{a significant portion of the}} area excavated by the United States in 1939 and suspended in 1942 because of World War II. The new locks are connected to the existing channel system through new navigational channels. The new lock chambers are [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] deep. They use rolling <b>gates</b> instead of <b>miter</b> <b>gates,</b> which are used by the original locks. Rolling gates are used in almost all existing locks with dimensions similar to the new ones, and are a proven technology. The new locks use tugboats to position the vessels instead of electric locomotives. As with rolling gates, tugs are successfully and widely used for these purposes in locks of similar dimensions.|$|R
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called <b>miter</b> <b>gates,</b> was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, in {{a number}} of {{projects}} gate drive mechanisms of navigation locks were checked or adapted for a longer service life, during which the reliability, safety and availability of the structure had to be guaranteed for an extended period. Several problems were encountered. When verifying the gate drive mechanism, {{it was found that the}} drive mechanisms, which have performed well for years, do not meet the current design criteria. According to the current design criteria the capacity of the drive mechanism would be insufficient. The design force according to the latest criteria exceeds the maximum allowed force on the gate, and cannot be applied without major adaptations to the gate and lock head structure, hence, results in high costs. In coming years a series of approximately 50 locks require replacement or large scale maintenance, it is worth considering the apparent contradiction between drive mechanisms that performed satisfactorily for years against the much higher required capacities by the nowadays codes and guidelines, giving rise to the question; Is the approach as presented in the current codes and guidelines, in specific the ROK 1. 3 (Richtlijn Ontwerpen Kunstwerken, issued by Rijkswaterstaat), suitable for the design of drive mechanisms? This study presents a case study in order to answer this question. The case study focuses on a navigation lock containing <b>Miter</b> <b>gates.</b> The original design calculations dating from 1974 are compared to an updated calculation according to ROK 1. 3. Both calculations are subsequently compared to a more tailored calculation approach that accounts for site-specific forces. This third approach explained some of the key differences between the fully functioning drive mechanism with the capacity as designed in 1974 and the updated calculation applying ROK 1. 3. These differences primarily originate in the schematization of the forces affecting the drive mechanism and the resulting combination of forces. Applying the ROK 1. 3 resulted in a conservative estimation. Differences in order of magnitude are mostly explained by the adjusted regulations. In the past external forces were not accounted for in the calculations and the reliability requirements have become more stringent. Furthermore, operational requirements were not accounted for in the design phase. Navigation locks have the following main functions: navigation, water management and flood protection. Not defining properly which main function sets the safety requirement for the construction can result in a misjudgement of the loads that affect the navigation lock. ROK 1. 3 builds on principles and guidance for the different main functions separately, and these are not harmonized. The requirements for the different main functions relating the availability and structural reliability all translate into partial load factors that are aggregated into a reliability-index. Where one of the requirements leads to the normative reliability-index It is important to account for the different limit states when increasing availability of the system and, contrary to common practice in calculations for civil components, to increase the partial safety factors in the serviceability limit state. This will increase the safety mechanism of the system leading to higher availability. The regulations in ROK 1. 3 are useful in designing drive mechanisms as long as the main function that sets the safety constraint of the construction is taken into account. It is beneficial to include site-specific conditions and to estimate the load components more accurate. Although ROK 1. 3 does not explicitly discourage this approach, nor does it elaborate on it. At present another more sophisticated approach is not facilitated by the ROK. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R
