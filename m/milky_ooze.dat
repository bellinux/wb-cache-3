40|$|The sapota or {{sapodilla}} tree (botanical name: Achras zapota of sapotaceae family) grows in {{regions of the}} tropical and subtropical climates in south, west, and east 1 ndia. l The Indian sapota tree is about {{half the size of}} the original South or Central American species which may grow to an average height of about 15 m. 2 The American plant exudes milky latex when the bark of the trunk is cut while the Indian plant is mostly dry. However, when the fruit of the Indian plant is plucked from its calyx, a <b>milky</b> latex <b>oozes</b> out...|$|R
2500|$|The mature {{multiple}} fruit's {{size and}} general appearance resembles a large, yellow-green orange, [...] in diameter, with a roughened and tuberculated surface. The compound fruit is a syncarp of numerous small drupes, {{in which the}} carpels (ovaries) have grown together. Each small drupe is oblong, compressed and rounded; they contain a <b>milky</b> juice which <b>oozes</b> when the fruit is damaged or cut. The seeds are oblong. Although the flowering is dioecious, the pistillate tree when isolated will still bear large oranges, perfect to the sight but lacking the seeds.|$|R
50|$|El Esquilinchuche {{is known}} by its {{residents}} to be named for a large tree with sparse long leaves (approximately 1.5 x 8 inch) and prominent white five petaled flowers that once grew in abundance in the town. The Esquilinchuche tree has a very soft wood and is identifiable by the <b>milky</b> sap that <b>oozes</b> out when any branch is cut. Today there are no Esquilinchuche trees in El Esquilinchuche. The tree {{is said to be}} named for Esquiline Hill, one of the famous seven hills of Ancient Rome.|$|R
50|$|The mature {{multiple}} fruit's {{size and}} general appearance resembles a large, yellow-green orange, 4 to(-) 5 in in diameter, with a roughened and tuberculated surface. The compound fruit is a syncarp of numerous small drupes, {{in which the}} carpels (ovaries) have grown together. Each small drupe is oblong, compressed and rounded; they contain a <b>milky</b> juice which <b>oozes</b> when the fruit is damaged or cut. The seeds are oblong.

40|$|THE TERM NARCOTIC REFERS TO opium and opium {{derivates}} or synthetic substitutes. narcotics {{are also}} generally called opiates or opiods. Opium {{comes from the}} poppy plant Papavar somniferum. The <b>milky</b> fluid that <b>oozes</b> from incisions in the unripe seedpod of the plant are scraped by hand and airdried to produce opium gum. A more modern method of harvesting is through the industrial poppy straw process of extracting alkaloids from mature dried plants. The extract may be in liquid, solid or powder form. Most poppy straw concentrates made available commercially is a fine brownish powder with a distinct odour...|$|R
5000|$|Ammoniacum, or gum ammoniac, is a {{gum-resin}} exuded {{from the}} stem of the perennial herb Dorema ammoniacum of the umbel family (Apiaceae). The plant grows to the height of 2½ or 3 meters (8 or 9 ft.) and its whole stem is pervaded with a <b>milky</b> juice, which <b>oozes</b> out on an incision being made at any part. This juice quickly hardens into round tears, forming the [...] "tear ammoniacum" [...] of commerce. [...] "Lump ammoniacum", the other form of the substance, consists of aggregations of tears, frequently incorporating fragments of the plant itself, {{as well as other}} foreign bodies. Ammoniacum has a faintly fetid, unpleasant odor, which becomes more distinct on heating; externally, it possesses a reddish-yellow appearance, and when the tears or lumps are freshly fractured they exhibit a waxy luster. It is chiefly collected in central Persia, and comes to the European market by way of Bombay.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} chilli {{fields in the}} state of Karnataka, India, showed the {{presence}} of bacterial wilt disease in important chilli growing regions. The disease incidence ranged from 26 [*]–[*] 32 %. The pathogen was isolated from infected plant material and seeds. Infected plant material showed the release of <b>milky</b> white bacterial <b>ooze.</b> Burkholderia solanacearum was detected from chilli seeds by liquid assay and its identity was confirmed by biochemical tests, hypersensitive reaction and pathogenicity tests. Seed transmission of the pathogen up to 45 % was observed in seeds artificially infested with the pathogen. Among different tissues of the seed, endosperm showed the presence of the pathogen. Biological seed treatment with antagonistic Pseudomonas fluorescens significantly (p[*]=[*] 0. 05) improved the seed quality parameters under laboratory conditions and drastically reduced the bacterial wilt incidence under field conditions. Seed-borne nature, transmission and effect of Pseudomonas fluorescens in both the forms of pure culture and formulation on seed quality parameters and bacterial wilt incidence are discussed in the present work...|$|R
50|$|Fire blight {{was first}} {{described}} in New York {{in the late}} 18th century, and moved west with settlers, becoming established throughout North American apple production areas by the early 20th century. While fire blight {{has always been a}} concern in eastern apple production, severe outbreaks in the west in recent years have caused growers there to adopt more consistent and vigorous monitoring and management programs as well. The disease can affect every part of the tree, from the fruit to the trunk. Infected trees may die within months or can linger for years with severely reduced yields. In addition to the scorched appearance of the plant parts that gives the disease its name, plant tissues infected with the bacteria will exude <b>milky</b> or reddish-brown <b>ooze.</b> Initially copper sprays were used for fire blight control in the 1930s but this method had limited success. In the 1950s streptomycin and oxytetracycline showed high success in controlling fire blight in comparison to copper. Since then streptomycin sprayed two to three times during blooming phase has become the treatment of choice.|$|R
50|$|African teak {{is a large}} {{deciduous}} tree {{growing up}} to 50 m high. The trunk is bare lower down with the first branch usually at least 20 m above the ground. It often has several short buttress roots at the base. The bark is pale or dark grey, thick but little fissured, and if it gets damaged it <b>oozes</b> <b>milky</b> latex. There are a few thick branches in the crown all fairly horizontal giving an umbrella shape. The smaller branches hang down in female trees and curve up in male trees. The leaves are 5 to 10 cm long, ovate or elliptical with a finely toothed edge, green and smooth above and slightly downy beneath. Older leaves turn yellow, {{and all of the}} leaves have a prominent rectangular mesh of veins visible on the underside. The trees are dioecious. Male trees have white catkins that extend 15 to 20 cm and dangle from twigs at the axils of the leaves. Female trees have flower spikes measuring 5 to 6 cm long by 2 cm wide, green with prominent styles. The fruit are long, wrinkled and fleshy with the small seeds embedded in the pulp.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a <b>milky</b> latex that <b>oozes</b> out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|R
