40|$|Introduction: Acute {{appendicitis}} is {{the most}} common emergency abdominal operation. One of its different pathogenesis is infection with microbial agents such as Yersinia. Yersinia {{is the most}} common cause of <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> and may represent with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and tenderness and sometimes with systemic manifestation. Frequently in patient with Yersinia infection appendix is normal but may be involved as acute appendicitis. Case Report: This case report represent a 12 years old girl with acute appendicitis and <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> secondary to underline infections process (high probably Yersinia according to clinical syndrome) with multiple organ involvement. Conclusion: We conclude that in patients with clinical findings of acute appendicitis and without improvement after surgery, it should be considered an underline other disease process such as appendicitis and <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> with Yersinia infection...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{system of}} {{diagnostic}} and objective {{assessment of the}} state severity of children with acute nonspecific <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> was developed. The clinical material for the study was the observation of 210 patients aged from 3 months to 15 years. Prognostically significant signs were identified {{on the basis of}} mathematical analysis of the immediate treatment results (risk factors), which adversely affect the treatment outcome. Their importance is expressed in points. The severity of the patient's condition was determined by number of points they scored. The system allows predicting the treatment effectiveness of acute nonspecific <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> and optimizing the treatment strategy prior complications development...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{appendicitis}} {{is often}} simulated by other entities like <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis,</b> worm infestation, Meckel’s diverticulitis, uri-nary tract infection and rarely omental torsion. We report two cases, a 6 year old boy and an 11 year old girl, who presented with symptoms {{and signs of}} acute appendicitis but upon exploration {{turned out to be}} omental torsion...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{investigating}} the etiology and clinical characteristics of <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> in Korean adults, prospectively. Clinical manifestations of fifteen patients who presented with the acute onset of right lower quadrant pain and sonographically enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and normal appendix were evaluated. For etiologic diagnosis, stool culture, serologic test for Epstein-Barr virus, and Widal test were performed. Colonoscopy with mucosal biopsies and microbial tissue cultures were performed in 12 of 15 patients. Of fifteen patients 6 were male and the average age was 29. 9 (17 approximately 41) years. Associated symptoms were diarrhea (80 %), fever (73 %), nausea and vomiting (27 %). Right lower quadrant tenderness was observed in all cases but rebound tenderness was observed only in 26. 7 % of the cases. Etiology was identified in 7 cases (47 %) : 2 Yersinia enterocolitica infection, 2 non-typhoidal Salmonella infection, 2 tuberculosis, and 1 typhoid fever. In colonoscopic examination, signs of active inflammation were observed in 9 cases (75 %) and inactive or normal findings in 3 cases (25 %). All of our patients, except for the patients with tuberculosis and typhoid fever who needed specific antibiotic therapy, improved spontaneously without using antibiotics. In conclusion, the etiology of <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> in Korean adults seems {{to be different from}} that of western countries. Furthermore, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> in Korean adults is a clinical syndrome, frequently found in a relatively young age group, which improves spontaneously unless specific anti-microbial agents are indicated by microbiological tests, such as tuberculosis or typhoid fever...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{association}} between inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal infections has been suggested, the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) are still undetermined. We report {{the case of a}} man, who presented with <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> initially due to a Yersinia pseudotubercolosis infection, who was later diagnosed with Crohn's disease. This case is in keeping with recent evidence in the literature which suggests that CD is a disease linked to abnormal immune responses to enteric bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals...|$|E
30|$|Abdominal pain is a {{very common}} {{presenting}} complaint to the emergency department. The most common surgical cause of right lower quadrant pain is appendicitis; however, {{there are many other}} causes that must be considered in the differential diagnosis. There are inflammatory and infectious causes involving the ileocecal region, omentum, epiploic appendages, mesentery, and other miscellaneous conditions[1]. Intussusception, omental infarction, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis,</b> epiploic appendagitis, lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma may all present with right lower quadrant pain; therefore, advanced imaging modalities such as ultrasonography and computerized tomography can aid in definitive diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMesenteric {{adenitis}} is an {{inflammation and}} {{enlargement of the}} mesenteric lymph nodes often secondary to an infection. Symptoms often mimic many of the common causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and it is usually a benign, self-limited disease. We report {{a case of a}} 12 year old girl with <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> in which enlarged lymph nodes obstructed blood flow to her ascending colon, causing venous and arterial thrombosis and ischemic colitis, requiring a right hemi-colectomy. Ischemic colitis should be included on the wide differential for right lower quadrant pain and quickly identified to provide the best outcome for the patient...|$|E
40|$|Appendicitis is not {{the only}} common cause of acute {{abdominal}} pain in childhood. Almost equally common is an acute episode which in its early stages resembles acute appendicitis but which subsides without treatment in 24 to 48 hours. The clinical features of this syndrome are contrasted with those of appendicitis. The two conditions cannot always be distinguished on clinical grounds, leading to admission to hospital for observation and the finding of a normal appendix in 14 % of operations for suspected appendicitis. Reasons are given for abandoning attempts to diagnose acute <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> at the bedside...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMultiple nontraumatic peritoneal and {{mesenteric}} emergencies are encountered at imaging {{of patients}} in the emergency department. Peritoneal and mesenteric emergencies are usually detected in patients in the emergency department during evaluation of nonspecific abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion {{is required for the}} establishment of early diagnosis and aversion of life-threatening complications in cases of peritoneal carcinomatosis, nontraumatic hemoperitoneum, and peritonitis. A correct diagnosis of omental infarction, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis,</b> and mesenteric panniculitis helps patients primarily by avoiding unnecessary surgery. In this review article, we illustrate the cross-sectional imaging appearance of various nontraumatic peritoneal and mesenteric emergencies by emphasizing the role of the emergency radiologist in detecting and managing these entities...|$|E
40|$|During a twelve-month period, 416 {{children}} with acute abdominal pain required emergency admission to Southampton General Hospital; 46 % had operations. Appendicitis was the commonest organic cause of acute abdominal pain identified (31 %). Constipation (9 %) can present as acute abdominal pain simulating appendicitis. All children {{should have a}} urine sample examined microscopically and the finding of significant pyuria is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of a urinary tract infection (7 %). <b>Mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis,</b> {{which can only be}} diagnosed with certainty at laparotomy, was less common (4 %). Despite careful clinical assessment and follow up, 45 % of children in this series remained undiagnosed. Sedation but not analgesia may assist in the diagnosis of the acute abdomen in children...|$|E
40|$|A {{rare case}} of typhoid {{presenting}} with thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, ascites <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis,</b> and multi-drug resistance is being {{presented in this}} article. An 8 -year-old girl was admitted {{with a history of}} fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and loose stools. Clinical examination revealed fever and hepatosplenomegaly. Investigations showed leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and hyponatremia. Blood Widal was positive, and blood culture grew Salmonella typhi. Ultrasound abdomen revealed ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and thickening of the gall bladder. She was treated with ciprofloxacin intravenously for 6 days and when the fever persisted injection ceftriaxone was added. Ciprofloxacin was given intravenously for a total of 15 days and injection ceftriaxone was given for 12 days. Even then, the fever persisted and hence oral azithromycin was added. Fever subsided completely in 3 days with azithromycin and she became asymptomatic without fever, loose stools, abdominal pain or anything on follow-up after 3 months...|$|E
40|$|Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis {{has been}} {{considered}} a widespread animal pathogen for many years, but only within {{the last decade has}} its capacity to cause human disease been recognized. Two forms of human disease have been established—acute septicemia and mesenteric lymphadenitis. Because <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> is frequently indistinguishable from acute appendicitis, blood serum was obtained from 66 consecutive patients who underwent operation for appendicitis and was examined for agglutinins to seven serotype strains of P. pseudotuberculosis. Agglutinins were obtained in 21. 2 % of this series. Titres of over 1 / 100 were found in three of three cases of mesenteric lymphadenitis, one of 11 with no apparent disease, and one of 46 with appendicitis. P. pseudotuberculosis was isolated from a lymph node in the latter case. Two to four follow-up samples of sera in each of these five cases had increasing and then decreasing titres, indicative of active disease. Titres of 1 / 15 or less were found in five of the cases of appendicitis, in one case of salpingitis, and in three with no apparent disease. The occurrence of these nine cases with low titres may be indicative of previous contact with the organism...|$|E
40|$|Portal {{hypertension}} is {{a clinical}} syndrome {{that is difficult}} to study in an isolated manner since it is always associated with a greater or lesser degree of liver functional impairment. The aim of this review is to integrate the complications related to chronic liver disease by using both, the array of mast cell functions and mediators, since they possibly are involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of these complications. The portal vein ligated rat is the experimental model most widely used to study this syndrome and it has been considered that a systemic inflammatory response is produced. This response is mediated among other inflammatory cells by mast cells and it evolves in three linked pathological functional systems. The nervous functional system presents ischemia-reperfusion and edema (oxidative stress) and would be responsible for hyperdynamic circulation; the immune functional system causes tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells, particularly mast cells and bacteria (enzymatic stress) and the endocrine functional system presents endothelial proliferation (antioxidative and antienzymatic stress) and angiogenesis. Mast cells could develop {{a key role in the}} expression of these three phenotypes because their mediators have the ability to produce all the aforementioned alterations, both at the splanchnic level (portal hypertensive enteropathy, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis,</b> liver steatosis) and the systemic level (portal hypertensive encephalopathy) ...|$|E
40|$|In 2, 861 {{consecutive}} patients undergoing appendicectomy for clinically suspected appendicitis an {{enteric pathogen}} was {{isolated from the}} appendix in almost 7 % using an optimal combination of culture media. The pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica serotypes 03 and 09 predominated (3. 6 %), followed by Campylobacter and nontyphoid Salmonella. The same pathogen was isolated from the stool in 72. 5 % of patients with a culture-positive appendix and in 84. 1 % of those positive for a pathogenic Yersinia. Conversely, no pathogenic Yersinia were isolated in 326 gynaecologic control patients, in whom a normal appendix was removed. No frank appendicitis but <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> and/or terminal ileitis were found in 62. 3 % of 138 patients with a culture positive appendix, and in 74. 6 % of those positive for a pathogenic Yersinia Histologic findings available in 135 patients showed acute suppurative appendicitis in only six (4. 5 %) patients, and in only one of 73 (1. 4 %) positive for a pathogenic Yersinia. In contrast, 46. 8 % {{of a group of}} 345 culture-negative appendices showed acute inflammation. A positive stool culture in a patient with suspected appendicitis, if consistent with sonographic and clinical findings, should be taken as strong evidence against the presence of true appendicitis...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. ersinia enterocolitica is an {{important}} cause of enteritis and <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> in many countries. However the pathogenesis of the disease caused by this organism has not been fully elucidated. Most isolates from clinical material possess two independent properties associated with virulence whose relative contribution to the develop-ment of disease is not known. These are the ability to penetrate the intestinal wall, which {{is thought to be}} controlled by a plasmid gene, and the production of heat-stable entetotoxin, which is controlled by a chromosomal gene. In this study, we infected neonatal gnotobiotic piglets with strains of Y. enterocolitica expressing these two properties in various combinations. The suitability of the piglet model was shown in experiments in which piglets fed virulent Y. enterocolitica serogroup 0 3 developed a clinical illness related {{to the size of the}} inoculum, which was accompanied by intestinal lesions similar to those reported in naturally and experimentally infected 2 eople and animals. The results confirmed the key role of a 47 x 106 -mol. wt plasmid in the pathogenicity of Y. enterocolitica, but suggested that penetration of the intestinal wall may be governed by chromosomal rather than plasmid-borne genes. No role for enterotoxin in the pathogenesis of yersiniosis was shown, although there was evidence that enterotoxin may promote intra-intestinal proliferation of Y. enterocolitica, thus favouring increased shedding of bacteria and encouraging their spread between hosts...|$|E
40|$|Three {{situations}} mimic ulcerative colitis. First, in homosexual men, acute self-limited colitis due to campylobacter, salmonella or shigella is seen. Neisseria gonorrhea, herpes simplex, Chlamydia trachomatis and Entamoeba histolytica or {{a combination}} of these may also be present. The second setting is that of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), where opportunistic infections, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidium, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichiacoli 0157 : H 7 may cause diagnostic difficulty. The third situation is when patients have recently returned from or are in an endemic area for infectious diarrhea. This particularly affects the elderly, where salmonella, E coli 0157 :H 7, shigellosis and, increasingly, pseudomembranous colitis secondary to cycotoxin from Clostridium difficile, occur. The differential diagnoses for Crohn's disease include such disparate conditions as solitary rectal ulcer in females, and ischemic change in the elderly, which usually involves the splenic flexure area of the colon, but may also involve the recrosigmoid area. When a mass is present in the right lower quadrant, the differential diagnosis also includes local abscess formation from a perforated appendix or foreign body, tuberculosis and carcinoma. In the immunocompromised patient, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection and Kaposi's sarcoma may mimic inflammatory bowel disease. Yersinia enterocolitica is becoming increasingly recognized as a cause of acute enteritis, predominantly in the ileum, often with coexistent <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis.</b> Drugs may also cause diagnostic confusion. The one most recognized is antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. However, cleansing soapsuds, Fleet (Frosst) and bisacodyl enemas, methyldopa and Myochrysine (Rhone-Poulenc) may also cause colitis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may produce ileal ulceration and a clinical and radiological picture resembling Crohn's disease. Potassium chloride also causes discrete ileal ulcers. Five case reports arc presented to illustrate these diagnostic difficulties...|$|E

This hypothetical splanchnic and systemic inflammatory response would be aggravated during the progression of the chronic liver disease, since the antioxidant ability of the body decreases. Thus, a critical state is produced, in which the appearance of noxious factors would favor the development of a dedifferentiation process protagonized by the nervous functional system. This system rapidly induces an ischemia-reperfusion phenotype with hydration and salinization of the body (hepatorenal syndrome, ascites) which, in turn would reduce the metabolic needs of the body and facilitate its temporary survival. </p...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds/Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{abdominal}} sonographic features of patients with mesenteric lymphadenitis versus sonographic features of the asymptomatic children, in order to identify diagnost ic criteria for mesenteric lymphadenitis. Patients and Methods: Ultrasound data from 113 children with acute abdominal pain whose suspected sonographic diagnosis was <b>mesenteric</b> <b>adenitis</b> or ileitis was inspected in a child hospital in March 2004 to March 2005. The fina l diagnoses were established after patient management and follow-up. As for the control group, a hundred asymptomatic children were referred from health centers or kindergartens. Results: No para-aortic lymphadenopathy was found in any of the subjects from the study and the control groups. The number of enlarge d mesenteric lymph nodes observed in symptomatic children was significantly greater than the figure in asymptomatic children (P 0. 0001). The highest rate of sensitivity was seen with the presence of RLQ lymphadenopathy (94. 7 %) and the highest rate of specifici ty was seen with the presence of lymphadenopathy in two or three areas of LUQ or mi d-abdomen together; lymphadenopathies larger than 6 mm in RLQ; presence of more than 4 lymph nodes (with any size) in a sonographic image from RLQ; or thickening of terminal il eum more than 8 mm (92 %- 100 %) in the diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis. Conclusion: In children with acute abdominal pain due to causes such as appendicitis which cannot be confirmed by ultrasound and the f indings consist of only enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (&# 8805; 4 mm) and/or mural thickening of the terminal ileum (&# 8805; 8 mm), the probable diagnosis would be mesenteric adenitis-ileitis and surgery is not required; but close observation is recommended...|$|E
