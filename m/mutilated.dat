The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald's men in considerable detail. Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald's army <b>mutilated</b> the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.* T. F.

5|$|When {{tissue is}} {{deficient}} or <b>mutilated</b> {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments.
