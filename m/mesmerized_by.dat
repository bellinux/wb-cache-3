5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} era of silent films, smoking has had a major part in film symbolism. In the hard-boiled film noir crime thrillers, {{cigarette}} smoke often frames characters and is frequently used to add an aura of mystique or nihilism.

500|$|In 1994, {{the state}} {{legislature}} held a hearing to discuss {{the merits of the}} bill. Lee Ruth Davis died a few months before testimony began, but Minnie Lee Langley, Arnett Goins, Wilson Hall, Willie Evans, and several descendants from Rosewood testified. Other witnesses were a clinical psychologist from the University of Florida, who testified that survivors had suffered post-traumatic stress, and experts who offered testimony about the scale of property damages. Langley spoke first; the hearing room was packed with journalists and onlookers who were reportedly <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> her statement. Ernest Parham also testified about what he saw.

5000|$|Two 30-minute {{pieces of}} unique textural richness, {{borrowing}} something from industrial, Ligeti, Xenakis, and Tangerine Dream. 'Doctor' creates a <b>mesmerizing</b> effect <b>by</b> constantly hovering between tone and noise, disembodied orchestras and choirs singing multi-timbral drones, crashing waves of sound... best at high volume, but not late at night. 'Babel' is multi-tracked radios (FM, AM, Shortwave, CB, etc.) voices wreaking havoc with meaning and intelligibility in a dense riot of glossolalia.

500|$|Eric Lenneberg, Noam Chomsky, and Steven Pinker {{have also}} criticized Whorf {{for failing to}} be {{sufficiently}} clear in his formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments {{took the form of}} examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how [...] "exotic" [...] grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms– attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations. [...] argues that Whorf was <b>mesmerized</b> <b>by</b> the foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to Lakoff, Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which racism and jingoism were predominant, and when it was unthinkable to many that [...] "savages" [...] had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe.
