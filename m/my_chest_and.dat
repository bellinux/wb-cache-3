500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's the damp, sir, what {{settles on}} <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> voice," [...] said Jerry. [...] "I leave you to judge what a damp way of {{earning a living}} mine is." ...|$|E
60|$|Nov. 2.—I set up all <b>my</b> <b>chests</b> <b>and</b> boards, and {{the pieces}} of timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little within the place I had marked out for my fortification.|$|R
50|$|<b>My</b> back <b>and</b> <b>chest</b> he hammered.|$|R
6000|$|I threw <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> out <b>and</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulders}} back. [...] "What man has done, I can do," [...] I proclaimed grandly. [...] "And please don't {{forget that}} when we sailed on the Snark I knew nothing of navigation, and that I taught myself as I sailed." ...|$|R
60|$|I didn't answer him. I {{might have}} told 'im that there's about five million Bills in England, but I didn't. I {{stood there with}} my arms folded acrost <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> looked at him, superior.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, Margaret, ten whole {{minutes by}} the clock, {{and then if}} it is nay, all your life, for I pack <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> go. It will be said that I feared to be taken for that soldier's death." ...|$|E
60|$|Down, down I plunged, and {{the shock}} of the icy water seemed to petrify me. I should have gone {{straight}} to the bottom like a piece of lead but for the lasso. It tightened around <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> began to haul me up.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1999 New York Times interview, Young stated, [...] "In my {{short life}} I've been shot, I've {{been hit by}} a truck, survived an {{airplane}} crash, I've had <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> opened <b>and</b> <b>my</b> heart rebuilt. And it's sort of hard to get me flustered after all that." ...|$|R
6000|$|LUCIAN. [...] Aye, of him. [...] Hast thou {{forgotten}} that eventful night [...] When as we gathered were at Hoskyn House [...] To hear a lecture by Herr Abendgasse, [...] He placed a single finger on <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> [...] <b>And</b> I, ensorceled, would have sunk supine [...] Had not a chair received my falling form.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a hideous}} word," [...] he remarked. [...] "You {{make me feel}} that <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> is padded <b>and</b> <b>my</b> hair dyed. If to talk sense {{is a sign of}} youth, let us do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember, Ermine, I can't spend {{a winter}} in Scotland. A cold always makes the ball {{remind me of}} its {{presence}} in <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> I was told that if I spent a winter at home, it must be on the Devonshire coast." ...|$|E
60|$|The air hit me on {{the chest}} so that I gasped. I dropped the glass screw. I cried out, put my hands to <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> sat down. For a time I was in pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move about again.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it {{is nothing}} definite. That's the worst of it. You could fight it more easily if it was. It's just a dead, heavy {{depression}} here in <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> across my forehead. But do forgive me, dear girl! What a brute I am to shadow you like this." ...|$|E
60|$|I sat {{thinking}} of the pain in <b>my</b> own <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> wishing I could remember hearing Annable's jaw smash, and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were—though that was bad enough. I got up, and helped George to rise. He swayed, almost pulling me over. But in a while he could walk unevenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{you ought}} to. You {{know very well}} that <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> is weak, <b>and</b> yet I have to go hallooing all over the place after you. Now look here, have you got that fat pony of yours in the yard?" ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{the first}} in the house; and while I was still without I saw a match flash and the lamplight kindle in the windows. The station was a {{wonderful}} fine place, coral built, with quite a wide verandah, and the main room high <b>and</b> wide. <b>My</b> <b>chests</b> <b>and</b> cases had been piled in, and made rather of a mess; and there, {{in the thick of the}} confusion, stood Uma by the table, awaiting me. Her shadow went all the way up behind her into the hollow of the iron roof; she stood against it bright, the lamplight shining on her skin. I stopped in the door, and she looked at me, not speaking, with eyes that were eager and yet daunted; then she touched herself on the bosom.|$|R
6000|$|Albert. [...] I unfearingly [...] Trust this disguise. Besides, {{he thinks}} me dead; [...] And what the mind {{believes}} impossible, [...] The bodily sense is slow to recognize. [...] Add too my youth, when last we saw each other; [...] 195 [...] Manhood has swell'd <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> taught my voice [...] A hoarser note.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{doctor is}} a clever man, I can see,' he continued. 'He seemed to guess about me directly. He sounded <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> {{says it is}} all right now, but {{that there had been}} a little damage; he thought the long cough I had after the measles had left traces that this winter has told upon.' ...|$|E
60|$|In the morning, these Malays gave me breakfast, {{and then}} carried <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> other {{articles}} to the Plato's boat. I was happy {{enough to find}} myself, once more, under the stars and stripes, where I was well received, and humanely treated. The ship sailed for Bremen about twenty days after I got on board her.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} on time did not matter to me. I forgot all about it. I felt only my leaden feet <b>and</b> <b>my</b> laboring <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> {{dripping}} skin. I did not even notice the additional weight of my rifle and camera though they must have overburdened me. I kept {{my eyes on the}} lion runway and plunged away with short steps. To look at these towering walls would have been to surrender.|$|R
6000|$|... "No such thing. I am {{much too}} {{delicate}} {{to make and}} keep such appointments in the winter season. If you knew what a pain I had in <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> this morning, <b>and</b> how I went without breakfast, and was knocked down besides, you'd feel the impropriety of bringing me here in the snow. Come, I say." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, if I {{could tell}} you the glow of pride which it gave me {{to be taken into}} the great man's {{confidence}} in this way. As he handed our letters to us I clicked my spurs <b>and</b> threw out <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> smiling <b>and</b> nodding to let him know that I saw what he would be after. He smiled also, and rested his hand for a moment upon the cape of my dolman. I would have given half my arrears of pay if my mother could have seen me at that instant.|$|R
6000|$|But {{plucking}} up {{heart of}} grace, I crossed my cutlass on <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> reposing {{my hand on}} the hilt, addressed their High Mightinesses thus. [...] "Men of Mardi, I come from the sun. When this morning it rose and touched the wave, I pushed my shallop from its golden beach, and hither sailed before its level rays. I am Taji." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{stood there}} in my heavy coat and my poor {{battered}} shako, my chin upon <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> my eyelids over my eyes. I had done my best, and I could do no more. It {{was the sound of}} horses' hoofs which made me at last raise my head, and there was the grey-moustached Governor of Dartmoor Prison not ten paces in front of me, with six mounted warders behind him! ...|$|E
60|$|She found great {{comfort and}} {{assurance}} in my altered clothes--she liked the new fashions of dress, she alleged. It {{was not simply}} altered clothes. I did grow two inches, broaden some inches round <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> increase in weight three stones before I was twenty-three. I wore a soft brown cloth and she would caress my sleeve and admire it greatly--she had the woman's sense of texture very strong in her.|$|E
60|$|My {{belongings}} {{were packed}} snugly in a sea-chest, and I was {{all ready to}} buy my ticket and ride down on the train to Oakland, when Neil Partington arrived in Benicia. The Reindeer was needed immediately for work far down on the Lower Bay, and Neil said he intended to run straight for Oakland. As that was his home and as I was {{to live with his}} family while going to school, he saw no reason, he said, why I should not put <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> aboard <b>and</b> come along.|$|R
5000|$|At least forty-eight people, {{all but two}} of {{whom were}} Iranian pilgrims, were killed and {{approximately}} sixty-three others were injured when the New Khanaqin restaurant in Muqdadiyah was targeted at 12:45 pm The Iranians had paused for lunch as they embarked on a pilgrimage to a Shi'a Muslim religious site in Baghdad. Sixty-four-year-old pilgrim, Kadhumi Sadiq, said: [...] "While the waiter was serving us food a powerful explosion took place and the restaurant turned black. I suffered burns on <b>my</b> head, <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> hands". The restaurant was left demolished {{in the aftermath of the}} attack.|$|R
5000|$|On April 15, 2013, the New York Times {{published}} an Op-ed by Moqbel titled [...] "Gitmo is killing me". In it he described {{that he would}} not eat [...] "until they restore my dignity." [...] He wrote that he had lost 30 pounds and described how it feels being force fed. [...] "As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't," [...] Moqbel wrote. [...] "There was agony in <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> throat <b>and</b> stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone." [...] His Op-Ed stirred wide commentary.|$|R
60|$|It {{was really}} an offence to me when the {{jacketing}} ceased. I sadly missed that dream world of mine. But not for long. I found that I could suspend animation by the exercise of my will, aided mechanically by constricting <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> abdomen with the blanket. Thus I induced physiological and psychological states similar to those caused by the jacket. So, at will, and without the old torment, I was free to roam through time.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} {{sparring}} with Jackson for exercise this morning; and mean {{to continue and}} renew my acquaintance with the muffles. <b>My</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> arms, and wind are in very good plight, and I am not in flesh. I {{used to be a}} hard hitter, and my arms are very long for my height (5 feet 8 1/2 inches). At any rate, exercise is good, and this the severest of all; fencing and the broad-sword never fatigued me half so much.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{this the}} stock-broker, frightened nearly {{out of his}} wits, and with his hands still tied and the rope around his neck, made a dive for the companionway, and {{disappeared}} below. I stood up very bold; I threw out <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> gazed around in triumph. The air {{of the sixteenth century}} had saved me! Those men would have no more dared to attack me, as I stood roaring out my defiance and my threat, than they would have ventured to give battle to the boldest and the blackest of all bloody buccaneers.|$|E
5000|$|Frank Shamrock {{was criticized}} for pushing an {{unconscious}} Phil Baroni off him using his leg rather than allowing the referee to pull Phil off Frank. In a post-fight interview question regarding the incident, Shamrock stated that [...] "Phil was heavy on top of me... he was squishing {{the life out of}} me... he was laying on my leg <b>and</b> on <b>my</b> <b>chest...</b> that's it. <b>And</b> I thought it looked better on camera.".|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the bullet}} that he remembered {{impacting}} his back, Connally stated, [...] "...the most curious discovery of all took place when they rolled {{me off the}} stretcher and onto the examining table. A metal object fell to the floor, with a click no louder than a wedding band. The nurse {{picked it up and}} slipped it into her pocket. It was the bullet from my body, the one that passed through <b>my</b> back, <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> wrist, and worked itself loose from my thigh." [...] Connally does not say how he determined this object to have been a bullet, rather than his missing gold cufflink.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I woke up {{five minutes}} ago,' he cried, 'and found two men here. How they got past Richardson I don't know, {{but they were}} in the room, and they had dragged <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> out there, <b>and</b> had forced a crowbar through the lock! I was just in time; I hit one man in the arm and he fired back. Then they bolted right past Richardson. They must have nearly knocked you down. You must have been asleep, you idiot,' he cried, 'or you could have stopped them!' ...|$|R
