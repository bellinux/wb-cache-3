40|$|Abstract—Transmission {{scheduling}} plays {{a critical}} role in mo-bile ad hoc networks. Many transmission scheduling algorithms have been proposed to maximize the spatial reuse and minimize the time-division multiple-access (TDMA) frame length. Most algorithms require information on the network topology and cannot adapt to the dynamic topology in mobile scenarios. To overcome this limitation, topology-transparent scheduling algo-rithms have been proposed. Most of them, based on Galois field theory, Latin square, and block design theory, assign time slots to users and guarantee that {{there is at least one}} collision-free slot in each frame for each user. To the best of our knowledge, none of these topology-transparent algorithms support multiple quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we exploit the variable-weight optical orthogonal codes (VW-OOC) to design a topology-transparent scheduling algorithm in wireless ad hoc networks with multiple QoS levels. We study the performance, in terms of <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>throughput</b> and average throughput, of our proposed algorithm analytically and by extensive simulations. I...|$|E
40|$|Currently, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>throughput</b> of {{a stream}} {{processing}} application, mapped on a multi-processor system, can be computed with a conservative dataflow model, if only time division multiplex (TDM) schedulers are applied. A TDM scheduler is a budget scheduler. Budget schedulers can be characterized by two parameters: budget and replenishment interval. This paper introduces a priority-based budget scheduler (PBS), which is a budget scheduler that additionally associates a priority with every task. PBS improves the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>throughput</b> {{of a stream}} processing application compared to TDM, given {{the same amount of}} resources. We construct a conservative dataflow model for a task scheduled by PBS. This dataflow model generalizes previous work, because it is valid for a sequence of execution times instead of one execution time per task which results in an improved accuracy of the model. Given this dataflow model, we can compute the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>throughput</b> of the task graph that implements the stream processing application. Experiments confirm that a significantly higher <b>guaranteed</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>throughput</b> of the task graph can be obtained with PBS instead of TDM schedulers and that a conservative bound on the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>throughput</b> of the task graph can be computed with a dataflow model. Furthermore, our bound on the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>throughput</b> of the task graph is accurate, if the buffer capacities in the task graph do not affect the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>throughput...</b>|$|R

Therefore, an efficient management of the spectrum resources is required in order to meet the fast-growing service demand. To this purpose, this paper addresses the optimization of the return carrier frequency plan for a broadband network benefiting from adaptive return channel selection (ARCS). The optimization problem is formulated as a multiobjective instance aiming at minimizing the total bandwidth and the unused throughput by using integer linear programming techniques. So as to capture events in which multiple terminals experience fade simultaneously, the spatial correlation of the attenuation fields has been incorporated in the optimization process. Moreover, physical layer characteristics and a <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>throughput</b> per user have been included as optimization constraints. Hence, the final outcome of this paper is a general technique providing an optimized carrier allocation plan, i. e., the number of carriers required to cover a certain area and guarantee a given throughput to each user...|$|E

In this paper, {{we focus on the}} interaction between the MPR physical layer and the medium access control (MAC) layer. Some random access MAC protocols have been proposed to improve the network performance by exploiting the powerful MPR capability. However, there are very few investigations on the schedule-based MAC protocols. We propose a novel m-MPR-l-code topology-transparent scheduling ((m, l) -TTS) algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks with MPR, where m indicates the maximum number of concurrent transmissions being decoded, and l is the number of codes assigned to each user. Our algorithm can take full advantage of the MPR capability to improve the network performance.

This class of service is used to build services that provide only a <b>minimum</b> <b>throughput</b> <b>guarantee</b> without any delay or jitter restrictions.

As this adaptation can be seen as an extension to the DCCP with CCID 3 congestion control, we call it gDCCP for guaranteed DCCP. Results from simulations are presented to illustrate the improvements of the proposed modification in various situations. Finally, we investigate the deployment of this proposal in terms of security. ...|$|R

The objective of femto deployment is to improve coverage, capacity, and experienced quality of service of indoor users. The location and density of user-deployed femtos is not known a-priori. This makes interference management crucial. In particular, with co-channel allocation (to improve resource utilization efficiency), RRM becomes involved because of both cross-layer and co-layer interference. In this paper, we review the resource allocation strategies available in the literature for heterogeneous macro-femto network. Then, we propose a self-organized resource allocation (SO-RA) scheme for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access based macro-femto network to mitigate co-layer interference in the downlink transmission. We compare its performance with the existing schemes like Reuse- 1, adaptive frequency reuse (AFR), and AFR with power control (one of our proposed modification to AFR approach) in terms of 10 percentile user throughput and fairness to femto users.
