40|$|Due to the {{toxicity}} of petroleum compounds, the increasing accidents of <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> spills/leakages {{have had a}} significant impact on our environment. Recently, different remedial techniques for the treatment of marine petroleum pollution have been proposed, such as bioremediation, controlled burning, skimming, and solidifying. (Hedlund and Staley in Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 51 : 61 - 66, 2001). This review introduces an important remedial method for <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> pollution treatment-bioremediation technique-which is considered as a reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly method. First, the necessity of bioremediation for <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> pollution was discussed. Second, this paper discussed the species of oil-degrading microorganisms, degradation pathways and mechanisms, the degradation rate and reaction model, and the factors affecting the degradation. Last, several suggestions for the further research in the field of <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> spill bioremediation were proposed...|$|R

This study {{is the first to}} comprehensively examine these new institutions and safeguards in two regions of Alaska with <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> transportation systems. The major oil production streams of Alaska are transported through these two regions.

The Re-Os age agrees with the geological age derived from biostratigraphic data, indicating the great potential of the Re-Os method for dating the <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> shale.

40|$|Before {{the release}} of the Seismic Design Criteria for California <b>Marine</b> <b>Oil</b> Terminals (Ferrito et. al, 1999), the seismic design of piers and wharves was a {{nonuniform}} procedure.

Based on the damage to port facilities observed in such events, the Marine Facilities Division (MFD) of the California State Lands Commission, with funding through FEMA and the California Office of Emergency Services, is developing specific regulations for the seismic performance of <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> terminals in California. The goals of the criteria established by Ferrito et al., (1999) are to (i) ensure safe and pollution-free transfer of petroleum products between ship and land-based facilities, (ii) ensure the best achievable protection of public health, safety, and the environment, and (iii) maximize utilization of limited resources.

40|$|Population {{studies have}} shown that higher intakes of marine foods during {{pregnancy}} are associated with longer gestations, higher infant birthweights and a low incidence of pre-eclampsia. It is suggested that the fatty acids of marine foods may be the underlying cause of these associations. To estimate the effects of <b>marine</b> <b>oil,</b> and other prostaglandin precursor, supplementation during pregnancy on the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight and small-for-gestational age. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (December 2005), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 2) and MEDLINE (1966 to April 2005). All randomised trials comparing oral <b>marine</b> <b>oil,</b> or other prostaglandin precursor, supplementation during pregnancy with either placebo or no treatment. Trials were excluded if their aim was to treat women with established pre-eclampsia or suspected intrauterine growth restriction. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, data extraction and trial quality. Six trials, involving 2783 women, are included in this review. Three of these were rated as high quality, including the largest trial with 1477 women. Women allocated a <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> supplement had a mean gestation that was 2. 6 days longer than women allocated to placebo or no treatment (weighted mean difference (WMD), 2. 55 days, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 03 to 4. 07 days; 3 trials, 1621 women). This was not reflected in a clear {{difference between the two groups}} in the relative risk (RR) of birth before 37 completed weeks, although women allocated <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> did have a lower risk of giving birth before 34 completed weeks' gestation (RR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 49 to 0. 99; 2 trials, 860 women). Birthweight was slightly greater in infants born to women in the <b>marine</b> <b>oil</b> group compared with control (WMD 47 g, 95 % CI 1 g to 93 g; 3 trials, 2440 women). However, there were no overall differences between the groups in the proportion of low birthweight or small-for-gestational age babies. There was no clear difference in the relative risk of pre-eclampsia between the two groups. There is not enough evidence to support the routine use of <b>marine</b> <b>oil,</b> or other prostaglandin precursor, supplements during pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight or small-for-gestational age...|$|R
