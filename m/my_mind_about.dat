500|$|In the 1981 NFL Draft, Taylor {{was drafted}} by the NFL's New York Giants as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL General Managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league's 28 GMs said {{if they had the}} first {{selection}} they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: [...] "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There's no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> Taylor. He's bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the blitz, he's devastating." ...|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks and I decided that I'd make up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E

2500|$|The King enjoyed country pursuits {{and riding}} and {{preferred}} {{to keep his}} family's residence {{as much as possible}} in the then rural towns of Kew and Richmond-upon-Thames. He favoured an informal and relaxed domestic life, to the dismay of some courtiers more accustomed to displays of grandeur and strict protocol. Lady Mary Coke was indignant on hearing in July 1769 that the King, the Queen, her visiting brother Prince Ernest and Lady Effingham had gone for a walk through Richmond town by themselves without any servants. [...] "I am not satisfied in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the propriety of a Queen walking in town unattended." ...|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of {{the value}} of Darwin's theory. Only a few years later, Popper wrote, [...] "I have in the past {{described}} the theory as 'almost tautological' ... I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} make a recantation." [...] His conclusion, later in the article is [...] "The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, {{after her}} split from Elvis, Presley {{set up a}} joint venture with her friend and stylist Olivia Bis. Together they opened a {{clothing}} boutique in Los Angeles called Bis & Beau. Elvis was supportive of Priscilla's venture, and even contacted several friends in public relations to help with promotion for the launch. In a 1973 interview to promote the opening of the store, Priscilla said, [...] "After the separation, I had to make up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> what I wanted to do, and since I had worked with Olivia {{for such a long time}} on my own clothes, I decided to try it professionally. We both do the designing for the shop, and have people who sew for us." [...] The shop was a successful venture, with celebrity clients including Cher, Lana Turner, Barbra Streisand, and Natalie Wood shopping there regularly. The shop closed in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{relationships}} and her sexuality, Fox {{said that she}} has a general distrust and dislike of men, and that the perception of her as a [...] "wild and crazy sexpot" [...] is false because she is asocial and has only been sexually intimate with her [...] "childhood sweetheart" [...] and Brian Austin Green; she stated that she would rather stay at home instead of going out, and emphasized that she cannot have sex with someone she does not love. She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have no question in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> being bisexual," [...] Fox stated. [...] "But I'm also a hypocrite: I would never date a girl who was bisexual, because that means they also sleep with men, and men are so dirty that I'd never want to sleep with a girl who had slept with a man." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February 1964, Morris Berthold Abram, the {{president}} of the American Jewish Committee and supported by a United States representative to the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights, brought Kitchko's work to worldwide attention by attacking the book during a press conference. Shortly afterwards, international criticism was leveled at Kitchko and his book. Communist parties worldwide condemned the work. The French communist newspaper, L'Humanité denounced the book and demanded the Soviet Union disavow the work. Gus Hall, the secretary-general of the United States Communist Party, stated [...] "there is no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the anti-Semitic character of what I have seen. Such stereotyped, slanderous caricatures of the Jewish people must be unequivocally condemned." [...] To exploit this discontent with the Soviet Union, the American Central Intelligence Agency had the book translated into French to be distributed to left-wing groups across Europe. When Khrushchev toured Scandinavia, in the spring of 1964, demonstrations took place against the USSR's treatment of Jews, in part motivated by the publication of Judaism Without Embellishment. In the Ukraine, reaction to the book was also negative. Ukrainian nationalist Mykola Lebed saw the book [...] "as a Soviet attempt to paint Ukrainians with a broad anti-Semitic brush". The result was Ukrainians, especially amongst the former supports of Stepan Bandera, switching from using anti-Semitism as a weapon to use against the Soviet authorities to attacking the Soviet Government for being anti-Semitic.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all I {{would like to say}} is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E
