5000|$|Alfa Romeo 4C Concept is a two-seater, {{rear-wheel drive}} coupé with {{technology}} and materials {{derived from the}} Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione, with 1750 turbo petrol engine with direct injection, the [...] "Alfa TCT" [...] twin dry clutch transmission, and the Alfa DNA dynamic <b>control</b> <b>selector.</b>|$|R
25|$|The fire <b>control</b> <b>selector,</b> {{with its}} lever {{located on the}} left side of the {{receiver}} wall, enables fully automatic fire (lever in the “C”-marked position), semi-automatic fire (“P”) and 3-round burst fire mode (“S”). The selector can be operated with the safety either engaged or disabled.|$|R
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} large number of lightweight, {{corrosion-resistant}} synthetic materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, handguard and carry handle are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver.|$|R
50|$|<b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> is an {{automation}} playout {{system used}} in over 100 countries worldwide. <b>Master</b> <b>Control</b> integrates with RCS's other products, such as Selector music scheduling and Linker promo scheduling.|$|R
5000|$|The 4C is {{equipped}} with a six speed Alfa TCT Dual Dry Clutch Transmission, and can be operated via gearshift paddles on the steering wheel. It also has an Alfa 'DNA' dynamic <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> which <b>controls</b> the behavior of engine, brakes, throttle response, suspension and gearbox. In addition to the modes already seen in Giulietta, the 4C has a new [...] "Race" [...] mode.|$|R
50|$|In February 2005, CHUM {{announced}} plans to consolidate the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> operations for CFPL, CKVR, CHRO, CHWI and CKNX at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, and consolidating the traffic and programming departments at CFPL in London, resulting {{in the loss of}} approximately 13 staff members from CFPL. On June 3, 2005, at approximately 10:00 a.m., the London <b>master</b> <b>control</b> signal came to an end, as the new consolidated <b>master</b> <b>control</b> took to air.|$|R
50|$|<b>Master</b> <b>control</b> is {{generally}} staffed {{with one or}} two <b>master</b> <b>control</b> operators around-the-clock, every day to ensure continuous operation. <b>Master</b> <b>control</b> operators are responsible for monitoring the quality and accuracy of the on-air product, ensuring the transmission meets government regulations, troubleshooting equipment malfunctions, and preparing programming for playout. Regulations include both technical ones (such as those against over-modulation and dead air), as well as content ones (such as indecency and station ID).|$|R
50|$|The RK 95 TP (known commercially as the M95) is a 7.62×39mm Finnish {{assault rifle}} adopted in {{relatively}} small numbers by the Finnish Defence Forces in the 1990s. The RK95 TP originally featured many improvements including a fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> and a muzzle device that enabled {{the firing of}} rifle grenades, the attachment of a silencer, or bayonet. A civilian 7.62mm-caliber semi-automatic variant was manufactured and marketed as the M92S.|$|R
50|$|The firing {{mechanism}} {{features a}} two-stage progressive trigger that provides two modes of operation: semi-automatic fire, when the trigger is squeezed momentarily, and fully automatic fire—produced when the trigger is pulled {{all the way}} through and held back. No fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> is provided. The Jatimatic features a striker firing mechanism with a fixed firing pin installed inside the bolt (the dual-purpose return spring also serves as the firing pin spring).|$|R
50|$|On November 15, 2012, the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> {{operators}} at WKBN were notified {{that the}} day-to-day <b>master</b> <b>control</b> operations at Sunset Boulevard will {{be handled by}} a hub at the Chicopee, Massachusetts studios of sister station WWLP. The <b>master</b> <b>control</b> hubbing was completed on June 29, 2013 at 4 a.m. All syndicated and network content on WKBN, WYFX, WYTV and MyYTV now flows via fiber optic from the hub facility at WWLP; local newscasts still originate from the Sunset Boulevard studios in Youngstown.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{power system}} {{operates}} safely and stably {{depends on the}} reliable operation of electric automation system of which the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> computer is the core. To improve the reliability, security and real-time performance of the <b>master</b> <b>control</b> computer, the error-tolerant model of <b>master</b> <b>control</b> computer based on replication technology for electronic automation system is built and the implementing method of model is introduced in great detail. For the defects of dual-computer hot backup system and {{on the basis of}} three-machine voting system, the error-tolerant model of <b>master</b> <b>control</b> computer designed in this paper makes some improvements in system structure and voting algorithm,so as to provide a reference for the construction of electronic automation system in the “strong ” and "self-healing " smart grid...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>master</b> <b>control</b> {{section is}} used to adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer. The <b>master</b> <b>control</b> section has {{sub-group}} faders, master faders, master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls. In addition it may have solo monitoring controls, a stage [...] "talk-back" [...] microphone control (so the sound engineer can talk to the band, who may be some distance away at a live show or who might be separated in an isolation booth in the recording studio), muting controls and an output matrix mixer. On smaller mixers the inputs are on {{the left of the}} mixing board and the <b>master</b> <b>controls</b> are on the right. In larger mixers, the <b>master</b> <b>controls</b> are in the center with input faders and channel strips on both sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{system uses}} a hammer-type striker and a trigger {{assembly}} {{equipped with a}} manual fire <b>control</b> <b>selector</b> (the fire selector lever {{is located at the}} left side of the receiver, just above the pistol grip), that enables semi-automatic fire (selector switch in the “1” setting), continuous fire (“30”) and three-round burst mode (“3”). The fire selector lever also operates the external safety mechanism (lever in the “0” position - weapon is safe). The rifle features an internal safety.|$|R

50|$|The {{transmitter}} was reassembled in a {{newly built}} outbuilding located on KREX's current property, and the control room was temporarily housed in a mobile home directly behind the transmitter. The station's <b>master</b> <b>control</b> equipment was completely replaced with all-digital equipment, and the trailer featured three separate <b>master</b> <b>controls</b> for KREX's CBS, Fox, and MyNetworkTV affiliates.|$|R
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire <b>control</b> <b>selector,</b> {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|R
