50|$|A {{number of}} {{derivatives}} of EE exist. These include mestranol (EE <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether),</b> quinestrol (EE 3-cyclopentyl ether), ethinylestradiol sulfonate (EE 3-isopropylsulfonate), and moxestrol (11β-methoxy-EE). The former three are prodrugs of EE, {{while the latter}} is not.|$|R
50|$|MP-2001, {{also known}} as 2,3,4-trimethoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17β-ol or 2,4-dimethoxyestradiol <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> is a steroid and {{derivative}} of estradiol that was described in 1966 and is devoid of estrogenic activity but produces potent analgesic effects in animals. It was never marketed.|$|R
50|$|Mytatrienediol (developmental {{code name}} SC-6924; former {{tentative}} trade names Manvene, Anvene), {{also known as}} 16α-methyl-16β-epiestriol <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether</b> or 16β-hydroxy-16α-methylestradiol <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> is a semisynthetic, steroidal, weak estrogen and estrogen ether derived from estriol that {{was developed in the}} late 1950s but was never marketed. It was investigated as a mildly estrogenic drug for men to treat atherosclerosis and improve serum lipid profiles and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. However, like other estrogens, mytatriendiol was found in clinical trials to produce estrogenic side effects such as breast pain and gynecomastia in men, and its side effects ultimately precluded its use. The drug was also studied to treat bone pain in patients with multiple myeloma, metastatic bone disease, and osteoporosis, with effectiveness seen.|$|R
50|$|Mestranol is the <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether</b> of ethinylestradiol, {{and is a}} biologically {{inactive}} prodrug of ethinylestradiol {{to which}} it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70% (50 µg of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35 µg of ethinylestradiol, or ethinylestradiol being about 1.7 times as orally potent by weight as mestranol).|$|R
50|$|Mestranol (brand names Devocin, Ovastol, Tranel), {{also known}} as {{ethinylestradiol}} <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EEME), is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen that has been widely used medically. It was employed as the estrogen component {{in many of the}} first oral contraceptives, such as mestranol/noretynodrel (brand names Enovid, Enavid), and is still in use today. It was also a component of Ortho-Novum, Ortho-Novin, Femigen, and Norbiogest. In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive, mestranol {{has been used as a}} component of hormone replacement therapy.|$|R
50|$|Clomestrone (brand names Arterolo, Atheran, Colesterel, Iposclerone, Liprotene, Persclerol, others; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} SC-8246), {{also known as}} 16α-chloroestrone <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> is a semisynthetic, steroidal, weak estrogen derived from estrone and used as an anticholesterolemic agent {{in the treatment of}} atherosclerosis. It is said to have beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles while producing minimal feminization, though some estrogenic side effects, including breast tenderness, loss of libido, and fatigue or avolition, were observed in most patients in clinical studies. The drug is a close analogue of mytatrienediol, and the two estrogens have similar drug profiles. Clomestrone was described in the literature in 1958 and introduced for medical use shortly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} analogues of estriol are known, {{including}} both naturally occurring isomers and synthetic substituted derivatives and esters. 16β-Epiestriol, 17α-epiestriol, and 16β,17α-epiestriol are isomers of estriol that are endogenous weak estrogens. Mytatrienediol (16α-methyl-16β-epiestriol <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether)</b> is a synthetic derivative of 16β-epiestriol {{that was never}} marketed. Estriol diacetate benzoate, estriol succinate, estriol sodium succinate, and estriol tripropionate are synthetic esters of estriol that have been marketed for medical use, whereas estriol triacetate has not been introduced. Quinestradol is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of estriol and has also been marketed. These esters and ethers are prodrugs of estriol. Ethinylestriol and nilestriol are synthetic C17α ethynylated derivatives of estriol. Ethinylestriol has not been marketed, but nilestriol, which is the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestriol and a prodrug of it, has been.|$|R
2500|$|All {{contain an}} estrogen, {{ethinylestradiol}} or mestranol, in varying amounts, {{and one of}} a number of different progestogens. (Regarding the estrogen, the inactive <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether</b> of ethinylestradiol, which must be metabolized by the liver into the active ethinylestradiol; 50µg of mestranol is equivalent to only 35µg of ethinylestradiol and should not be used when high-dose [...] estrogen pills are needed; mestranol was the estrogen used in the first oral contraceptive, Enovid). They are usually taken for 21 days with then a seven-day gap during which a withdrawal bleed (often, but incorrectly, referred to as a menstrual period) occurs. These differ in the amount of estrogen given, and whether they are monophasic (the same dose of estrogen and progestogen during each of the 21 days) or multiphasic (varying doses). The introduction of extended-cycle monophasic pills (i.e. Seasonale) has shown that the withdrawal bleeding intervals can be decreased.|$|R
50|$|In April 1956, {{noretynodrel}} was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in {{the first}} large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate {{in the country and}} concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts (1-2%) of the <b>3-methyl</b> <b>ether</b> of ethinylestradiol (noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, mestranol, that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 μg mestranol per pill.|$|R
