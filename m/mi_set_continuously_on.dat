40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the non-autonomous ordinary differen-tial inclusion in finite dimensional space with periodic, compact, but not neces-sarily convex valued right-hand side. The existence of periodic solution for such an inclusion which stays in a strongly positively invariant (under inclusion) <b>set</b> <b>continuously</b> depending <b>on</b> the time parameter is proved. The connection be-tween the density principle and stability of the set of all periodic solutions on positively invariant sets with respect to internal and external perturbations of the inclusion is derived. The special attention is paid to the property of strong positive invariance which is studied here in terms of Lyapunov functions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{dependence}} of the solutions of an evolution inclusion on a parameter-lambda. We prove two dependence theorems. In the first the parameter appears only in the orientor field and we show that the solution <b>set</b> depends <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> it for both the Vietoris and Hausdorff topologies. In the second the parameter appears also in the monotone operator. Using the notion of G-convergence of operators we prove that the solution set is upper semicontinuous {{with respect to the}} parameter. Both results make use of a general existence theorem which we also prove in this paper. Finally, we present two examples. One from control theory and the other from partial differential inclusions...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{takes as}} {{starting}} point diophantine approximation with {{focus on the}} area of badly approximable numbers. For the special kind of rationals, the q-adic rationals, we consider two types of approimations models, a one-sided and a two-sided model, and the sets of badly approximable numbers they give rise to. We prove with elementary methods that the Hausdorff dimension of these two <b>sets</b> depends <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> a defining parameter, is constant Lebesgue almost every and self similar. Hence they are fractal sets. Moreover, we give the complete description of the intervals where the dimension remains unchanged. The methods and techniques in the proofs uses ideas form symbolic dynamics, combinatorics on words and the beta-shift...|$|R
40|$|A diffeomorphism f has a C^ 1 -robust homoclinic {{tangency}} {{if there}} is a C^ 1 -neighbourhood of f such that every diffeomorphism in g∈ has a hyperbolic <b>set</b> _g, depending <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> g, such that the stable and unstable manifolds of _g have some non-transverse intersection. For every manifold of dimension {{greater than or equal to}} three, we exhibit a local mechanism (blender-horseshoes) generating diffeomorphisms with C^ 1 -robust homoclinic tangencies. Using blender-horseshoes, we prove that homoclinic classes of C^ 1 -generic diffeomorphisms containing saddles with different indices and that do not admit dominated splittings (of appropriate dimensions) display C^ 1 -robust homoclinic tangencies.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} parameter families of iterated function systems and continuity. Specifically, {{if we have}} a set of iterated function systems that depend <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> a parameter, which properties of the invariant <b>sets</b> will vary <b>continuously?</b> We show here that the invariant <b>sets</b> will vary <b>continuously</b> {{as a function of the}} parameter. Furthermore, we give some sufficient conditions under which the Hausdorff dimension will depend <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> the parameter. Lastly, we give a counter-example where the dimension is not a continuous function of the parameter...|$|R
40|$|The main {{result of}} this note is a {{parametrized}} version of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. We show that for a continuous family of Borsuk-Ulam situations, parameterized by points of a compact manifold W, its solution <b>set</b> also depends <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> the parameter space W. Continuity here means that the solution set supports a homology class which maps onto the fundamental class of W. When W is a subset of Euclidean space, we also show how to construct such a continuous family starting from a family depending {{in the same way}} <b>continuously</b> <b>on</b> the points of the boundary of W. This solves a problem related to a conjecture which is relevant for the construction of equilibrium strategies in repeated two-player games with incomplete information. A new method (of independent interest) used in this context is a canonical symmetric squaring construction in Cech homology with coefficients in Z/ 2 Z.
