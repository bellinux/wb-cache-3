25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money I can make from films. Nothing is beneath <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on the album's lyrics, Lewis said, [...] " [...] reflect {{things that}} I'm really passionate about. I {{have to be}} able to put myself in the song for it to ring true to <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> doesn't ring true to me, it's not going to be {{believable}} to anyone else." [...] Lewis described the album's style as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", containing R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds; however, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends, but are songs that can be performed acoustically.|$|E
2500|$|The choice {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from Republicans and conservatives. Victor Davis Hanson stated [...] "the timing and choice were inspired", and Mark Steyn stated he was [...] "happy" [...] over the choice. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell said of Palin, [...] "She is strong. She is capable. She is articulate," [...] and suggested opponents should not underestimate her. Independent-Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman stated that McCain made a [...] "bold choice" [...] in picking a [...] "maverick {{who has done}} {{exactly the same thing}} at the state level that he's done at the federal level." [...] However, some Republicans did not receive the choice favorably. Charles Krauthammer of the Washington Post wrote, [...] "The Palin selection completely undercuts the argument about Obama's inexperience and readiness to lead.... To gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful 'Is he ready to lead' line of attack seems near suicidal." [...] David Frum of National Review wrote: [...] "The longer I think about it, the less well this selection sits with <b>me....</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> were your decision, and you were putting your country first, would you put an untested small-town mayor [...] a heartbeat away from the presidency?". Following an NBC interview, Peggy Noonan commented, [...] "It's over... the most qualified? No." ...|$|E
