40|$|Abstract. In all eukaryotes, <b>segregation</b> of <b>mitotic</b> {{chromosomes}} requires {{their interaction}} with spindle microtubules.

We compare {{the consequences of}} depleting homologues of the centromeric histone CENP-A, the kinetochore structural component CENP-C, and the chromosomal passenger protein INCENP. Depletion of either CeCENP-A or CeCENP-C results in an identical “kinetochore null ” phenotype, characterized by complete failure of <b>mitotic</b> chromosome <b>segregation</b> as well as failure to recruit other kinetochore components and to assemble a mechanically stable spindle. The similarity of their depletion phenotypes, combined with a requirement for CeCENP-A to localize CeCENP-C but not vice versa, suggest that a key step in kinetochore assembly is the recruitment of CENP-C by CENP-A–containing chromatin. Parallel analysis of CeINCENP-depleted embryos revealed <b>mitotic</b> chromosome <b>segregation</b> defects different from those observed {{in the absence of}} CeCENP-A/C.

Here, we have performed {{a search for}} genes that affect chromo-some stability when overexpressed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have obtained clones encompassing 30 different genes. Twenty-four of these genes have been previously characterized. Most of them are involved in chromatin dynamics, cell cycle control, DNA replication or <b>mitotic</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> Six novel genes obtained in this screen were named CST (chromosome stability). Based on the pattern of genomic instability, inter-action with checkpoint mutations and sensitivity to chromosome replication or segregation inhibitors, we conclude that overexpression of CST 4 specifically interferes with <b>mitotic</b> chromosome <b>segregation,</b> and CST 6 affects some aspect of DNA metabolism. The other CST genes had complex pleiotropic phenotypes. We have created deletions of five genes obtained in this screen, CST 9, CST 13, NAT 1, SBA 1 and FUN 30.

Except for REC- 8 required for meiosis, function of these C. elegans proteins remains largely unknown. Herein, we examined their possible involvement in mitosis and development. Embryos depleted of the homolog of either Scc 3, or Smc 1, or Smc 3 by RNA interference revealed a defect in <b>mitotic</b> chromosome <b>segregation</b> but not in chromosome condensation and cytokinesis. Depletion of SCC- 1 /COH- 2 caused similar phenotypes. SCC- 1 /COH- 2 was present in cells destined to divide. It localized to chromosomes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Worms depleted of COH- 1 arrested at either the late embryonic or the larval stage, with no indication of mitotic dysfunction. COH- 1 associated chromosomes throughout the cell cycle in all somatic cells undergoing late embryogenesis or larval development.

40|$|PURPOSE: In many {{childhood}} neoplasms, prognostic subgroups {{have been}} defined based on specific chromosome changes. In Wilms' tumor (WT), such subclassification has been {{hampered by the}} diverse and relatively unspecific pattern of chromosomal imbalances present in these tumors. Unspecific patterns of cytogenetic imbalances in tumors are often caused by <b>mitotic</b> <b>segregation</b> errors due to short dysfunctional telomeres. As an alternative to cytogenetic classification, we therefore have evaluated whether the rate of telomere-dependent chromosomal instability could influence the clinical course in WT patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Telomere function and <b>mitotic</b> <b>segregation</b> errors were assessed in 12 cultured tumors and in tumor tissue sections from 41 WT patients. RESULTS: Abnormal telomere shortening was found in cultured cells and in tissue sections from highly aggressive tumors. In vitro, dysfunctional telomeres were associated to specific cell division abnormalities, including anaphase bridges and multipolar mitoses. Assessment of mitotic figures in tissue sections revealed that anaphase bridges and multipolar mitoses were predominantly, but not exclusively, present in high-risk tumors and were predictors of poor event-free and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Telomere-dependent mitotic instability is present in a subgroup of WT, predominantly consisting of high-risk tumor...|$|E

The results demonstrate that gene mutation of leu 1 - 12 to LEU 1 and <b>mitotic</b> <b>segregation</b> of heterozygous chromosome-VII markers occur in strong positive nonrandom association, suggesting that the stimulatory DNA lesion is both mutagenic and recombinogenic. In addition, genetic analysis of diploid Leu+ revertants revealed that approximately 3 % of mutations of leu 1 - 12 to LEU 1 result in LEU 1 /LEU 1 homozygotes. Red-white sectored Leu+ colonies exhibit genotypes that implicate post-replicational chromatid breakage and exchange {{near the site of}} leu 1 - 12 reversion, chromosome loss, and subsequent restitution of diploidy, in the sequence of events leading to mutational homozygosis.

40|$|Purpose: Chromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) {{is believed}} to have {{an important role in the}} pathogenesis of urothelial cancer (UC). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether disturbances of <b>mitotic</b> <b>segregation</b> contribute to CIN in UC, if these processes have any effect on the course of disease, and how deregulation of these mechanisms affects tumor cell growth. Experimental Design: We developed molecular cytogenetic methods to classify <b>mitotic</b> <b>segregation</b> abnormalities in a panel of UC cell lines. Mitotic instabilities were then scored in biopsies from 52 UC patients and compared with the outcome of tumor disease. Finally, UC cells were exposed in vitro to a telomerase inhibitor to assess how this affects mitotic stability and cell proliferation. Results: Three distinct chromosome segregation abnormalities were identified: (a) telomere dysfunction, which triggers structural rearrangements and loss of chromosomes through anaphase bridging; (b) sister chromatid nondisjunction, which generates discrete chromosomal copy number variations; and (c) supernumerary centrosomes, which cause dramatic shifts in chromosome copy number through multipolar cell division. Chromosome segregation errors were already present in preinvasive tumors and a high rate mitotic instability was an independent predictor of poor survival. However, induction of even higher levels of the same segregation abnormalities in UC cells by telomerase inhibition in vitro led to reduced tumor cell proliferation and clonogenic survival. Conclusion: Several distinct chromosome segregation errors contribute to CIN in UC, and the rate of such mitotic errors has a significant effect on the clinical course. Efficient tumor cell proliferation may depend on the tight endogenous control of these processes...|$|E
