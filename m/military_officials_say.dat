500|$|Once {{they had}} {{gained control of}} East Timor, Fretilin faced attacks from the west, by Indonesian {{military}} forces—then known as Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia (ABRI)—and by {{a small group of}} UDT troops. Indonesia captured the border city of Batugadé on 8 October 1975; nearby Balibó and Maliana were taken eight days later. During the Balibó raid, members of an Australian television news crew—later dubbed the [...] "Balibo Five"—were killed by Indonesian soldiers. Indonesian <b>military</b> <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> the deaths were accidental, and East Timorese witnesses say the journalists were deliberately killed. The deaths, and subsequent campaigns and investigations, attracted international attention and rallied support for East Timorese independence.|$|E
2500|$|Five sets of {{remains were}} found {{but could not}} be identified. [...] <b>Military</b> <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> that, by a process of elimination, they {{believed}} these remains to be those of the hijackers. Army Military District of Washington officials said the remains which were inextricably commingled {{were excluded from the}} burial so that there was no possibility that any terrorist remains were included. These terrorist and commingled remains were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in February 2002. The FBI said the remains were [...] "disposed of in a dignified manner'", although a very small amount of suspected terrorist remains were retained to aid in later criminal prosecutions.|$|E
50|$|The Taliban {{continues}} to {{rely heavily on}} decentralized, conventional propaganda efforts, which U.S. <b>military</b> <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> is the crucial battleground. These include the distribution of leaflets with threats or pleas, sermons in mosques and clandestine radio stations. As the Islamist movement steps up conventional grass-roots propaganda efforts and polishes its online presence—going {{so as far as}} to provide Facebook and Twitter icons online that allow readers to disseminate press releases—the U.S.-led coalition finds itself on the defensive in the media war. Foreign troops are ill-equipped to offer counterarguments in mosques and other gatherings, forcing them to rely on Afghan officials to do so.|$|E
50|$|On 11 April, {{security}} and <b>military</b> <b>official</b> <b>say</b> loyalist forces launched an attack {{the day before}} on Houthis around Mocha, which more than 40 pro-government soldiers, Houthis and civilians were killed during the past 24 hours.|$|R

50|$|Parallel to this, the White House has to {{deal with}} an {{impending}} international crisis: U.S. President Jack Neil (Ronny Cox) has been trying to deal with a situation where Americans are being held hostage in North Korea, and some people—including several members of his inner circle, led by Vice President Gordon Dylan—think the President is not handling it the right way. Some people think Neil should send troops to North Korea to rescue the hostages; {{he does not want to}} start a potential 2nd Korean War, and is disgusted that a high-ranking <b>military</b> <b>official</b> <b>says</b> that the main reason to act decisively is to send a message to North Korea's only ally, China.|$|R

50|$|On {{the same}} day, North Korea also {{conducted}} short-range surface-to-air missile tests. The number of fired missiles was first reported as three, but corrected to two by the South Korean defense ministry on 27 May 2009. The first missile had {{a range of}} 130 km. The South Korean news agency Yonhap cited <b>military</b> <b>officials</b> as <b>saying</b> that the launches seemed to be aimed at keeping U.S. and Japanese surveillance planes away from the site.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2005, a {{small group}} of commandos were {{deployed}} to support security at the Presidential inauguration. They were allegedly deployed under a secret counter-terrorism program named Power Geyser. The New York Times quoted a senior <b>military</b> <b>official</b> as <b>saying,</b> [...] "They bring unique military and technical capabilities that often are centered around potential WMD events," [...] A civil liberties advocate who was told about the program by a reporter said that he had no objections to the program as described to him because its scope appeared to be limited to supporting the counterterrorism efforts of civilian authorities.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009, The Times (London) {{claimed that}} it had {{obtained}} Google Earth images from 2006 that showed Predator drones parked outside a hangar {{at the end of}} the runway at Shamsi. The Times investigation was in response to a statement by US Senator Dianne Feinstein that the CIA was basing its drone aircraft in Pakistan. The US company Blackwater was also reported to have a presence there, hired by the government to arm the drones with missiles. The Pakistani Government had initially denied that the airfield was being used as a base for US military or covert operations but confirmed the same later. The New York Times cited a senior Pakistani <b>military</b> <b>official</b> as <b>saying</b> that in 2009 the drone operations were moved across the border to Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|Frank Otis {{was born}} on 19 Jun 1905 in Chicago, Illinois to Frank J. Otis, Sr. and Mabel Howe. Frank was an intern at the Boston City Hospital. He was a {{graduate}} of the Harvard University Medical School. He was {{also a member of the}} 101st Observation Squadron. On January 11, 1937 while traveling to his parents' house in Moline, Illinois, his plane went down in the Illinois River near Hennepin. At the time of his death, he was a Second Lieutenant in the air national guard. The <b>official</b> <b>military</b> explanation <b>says</b> that he was killed on a cross country training mission, and this is backed up by the fact that he was flying a Douglas O-46A. In 1938, the airfield at Camp Edwards was named Otis Field after him.|$|R
5000|$|High ranking North Korean <b>military</b> <b>officials</b> {{denounced the}} {{international}} investigation {{and said the}} North {{does not have the}} type of submarines that supposedly carried out the attack.

5000|$|Caldwell's spokesman, Lt. Col. Shawn Stroud, denied Holmes's assertions, {{and other}} unnamed <b>military</b> <b>officials</b> disputed Holmes's claims as false and misleading, {{saying there are}} no records of him ever {{completing}} any PSYOP training. Subsequently, Holmes conceded {{that he was not}} a Psychological Operations officer nor was he in charge of a Psychological Operations unit and acknowledged that Caldwell's orders were [...] "fairly innocuous." [...] <b>Officials</b> <b>say</b> that Holmes spent his time in theater starting a strategic communications business with Maj. Laural Levine, with whom he conducted an improper relationship in Afghanistan. A former aid said, [...] "At no point did Holmes ever provide a product to Gen. Caldwell". General David Petraeus has since ordered an investigation into the alleged incident.|$|R
5|$|Following the attack, the U.S. issued new {{security}} guidance to its bases in Afghanistan, according to U.S. <b>military</b> <b>officials.</b> One U.S. <b>military</b> <b>official</b> said the guidance would adjust procedures {{as quickly as}} possible on a large scale.|$|R

5000|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, {{military}} and congressional sources distinguished between two squads: the original Marine squad {{involved in the}} explosion and shootings, and a Marine intelligence squad that took photos shortly after the shootings. According to LA Times sources, no investigation occurred until after a March 2006 Time magazine story alleging a massacre, even though the intelligence squad's photos were inconsistent with the Marine squad's report of a firefight. According to the Time story, <b>military</b> <b>officials</b> blamed the delay of the investigation on the Marine squad's efforts {{to cover up the}} events:...Military <b>officials</b> <b>say</b> they believe the delay in beginning the investigation was a result of the squad's initial efforts to cover up what happened."However, both {{military and}} congressional sources said that the [...] "intelligence team" [...] that took photos after the firefight did not appear to participate in any improper action:...Military and congressional sources said there was no indication that the members of the intelligence team did anything improper or delayed reporting their findings." ...|$|R
