The analysis {{demonstrated that the}} longer acceleration lane length is associated with further merging positions. Furthermore, the traffic conditions do not significantly affect the means of merging positions but their variations. The variations of merging positions become significant when the density of mainline is higher. A similar tendency can be observed if acceleration lane length becomes longer. Regarding <b>merging</b> <b>speed,</b> {{it is found that}} mainline traffic conditions significantly affect <b>merging</b> <b>speeds.</b> They decrease as traffic conditions become denser. To generalize the results of analysis, a normal distribution was adopted to fit the models of <b>merging</b> position and <b>speed.</b> The results of model estimation and sensitivity analysis indicate that the models give consistent results with the analysis...|$|R

The approach of hierarchically merging visual words {{has been extensively}} employed, because it gives a fully determined merging hierarchy. Existing supervised hierarchical merging methods take different approaches and realize the merging process with various formulations. In this paper, we propose a unified hierarchical merging approach built upon the graph-embedding framework. Our approach is able to merge visual words for any scenario, where a preferred structure and an undesired structure are defined, and, therefore, can effectively attend {{to all kinds of}} requirements for the word-merging process. In terms of computational efficiency, we show that our algorithm can seamlessly integrate a fast search strategy developed in our previous work and, thus, well maintain the state-of-the-art <b>merging</b> <b>speed.</b> To the best of our survey, the proposed approach is the first one that addresses the hierarchical visual word mergence in such a flexible and unified manner. As demonstrated, it can maintain excellent image classification performance even after a significant dimension reduction, and outperform all the existing comparable visual word-merging methods. In a broad sense, our work provides an open platform for applying, evaluating, and developing new criteria for hierarchical word-merging tasks. Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu and Luping Zho...|$|R

AIA 304 and 171 Å images show an emerging loop/flux tube (L 1) moving radially outward, which interacts with preexisting structures within the active region. The QPP was observed during the expansion and rising motion of L 1. The Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) microwave images in 17 / 34 GHz channels reveal a single radio source, which was co-spatial with a neighboring loop (L 2). In addition, using AIA 304 Å images, we detected intensity oscillations in the legs of loop L 2 with {{a period of about}} 26 s. A similar oscillation period was observed in the GOES soft X-ray flux derivative. This oscillation period seems to increase with time. We suggest that the observed QPP is most likely generated by the interaction between loops L 2 and L 3 observed in the AIA hot channels (131 and 94 Å). The <b>merging</b> <b>speed</b> of loops L 2 and L 3 was 35 km/s. Loop L 1 destroyed possibly by its interaction with preexisting structures in the active region and produced a cool jet with the speed 106 - 118 km/s associated with a narrow CME (770 km/s).

40|$|We study a cobweb-type {{commodity}} market where n firms operate and characterised by a strictly monotone demand and supply. The firms {{are assumed to}} differ in a key parameter governing price expectations which we suppose to be adaptive. We characterise the unique steady state of the resulting economic dynamics in terms of stability and we study {{the impact of the}} number and diversity of firms: to this end we introduce the notions of structural and behavioural degree of instability which prove to be crucial in determining whether stability or instability prevail. We also consider the case of market merging and establish conditions to have stability (or instability) in the aggregated market in terms of the original (structural and behavioural) degrees of instability. We take up the issue of transitional dynamics and speed of convergence when the system is stable and characterise parametric configurations that maximise the speed of convergence. Motivated by the difficulty to actually observe expectations, whereas it is easier to measure some structural features of a given market, such as the relevant demand and supply price elasticities, we take the perspective of an observer (e. g. a policy maker) whose information set includes the structural but not the behavioural degree of instability. We therefore assume the firms - via the parameter which defines their expectations - are sampled independently from a population described by a given probability distribution. In this case the structural degree of instability determines how the number of potentially different firms affects the probability of ending up with a stable outcome. Analytical results are provided alongside numerical evidence. heterogeneous agents, expectations, stability of steady states, market <b>merging,</b> <b>speed</b> of convergence...|$|R

40|$|To improve traffic {{mobility}} and safety on highway segments plagued by work zone activities, transportation professionals {{in recent years}} have focused on exploring the potentials of using various <b>merge</b> and <b>speed</b> control strategies to regulate traffic flows. This study is focused on developing an advanced dynamic <b>merge</b> and variable <b>speed</b> limit controls for work zone applications, including an integration of both controls for best use of their strengths in maximizing throughputs and minimizing speed variance in traffic flows. With respect to the merge control, this study has developed an advanced dynamic late merge (DLM) control model and its operation algorithm, based on the optimized control thresholds that take into account the interactions between the speed, flow, and available work zone capacity. The proposed DLM control allows potential users to select the control variables and to determine their optimal thresholds in response to traffic flow dynamics. On regulating the approaching vehicle speeds, this study has developed a dynamic variable speed limit (VSL) control model and its operation algorithm. The proposed VSL system has adopted the maximization of work-zone throughput as its control objective with some embedded safety related constraints with such a system, one can optimize the sequence of transition speeds for approaching vehicles in the work zone, and dynamically adjusted the set of displayed speeds so as to effectively respond to potential demand variation. To best operate the DLM and VSL controls under various congested work zone conditions, this study has also explored the potential of integrating those two control strategies in work-zone operations. The logic of an integrated control is to facilitate the merging maneuvers and minimize potential collisions with the VSL during the DLM operation period, and to coordinate the sequence of VSM messages generated from both control algorithms. The numerical experiments have demonstrated that the integrated control can take full advantage of the strengths from both DLM and VSL controls, and offer the operational environment that is likely to yield a higher traffic throughput and lower speed variance than those operated independently...|$|R

In this scenario, two aircraft are approaching to a freeze horizon with approximately equal distance when they become aware of each other via an ADS-B communication link that {{will be available in}} NextGen airspace. Both pilots want to gain advantage over the other by entering the freeze horizon earlier and obtain the first place in landing. They re-adjust their speed accordingly. However, they cannot simply increase their speed to the maximum allowable values since they are concerned with safety, separation distance, effort, possibility of being vectored-off from landing and possibility of violating speed constraints. We present how to model these concerns {{and the rest of the}} system using semi network-from game framework. Using this framework, based on certain assumptions on pilot utility functions and on system configuration, we provide estimates of pilot behavior and overall system evolution in time.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{considerable}} increase in the amount of construction work on the U. S. national highways, resulting in lane closure in work zone area, causing congestion with a high traffic demand. ITS-based technology such as dynamic lane <b>merging</b> and variable <b>speed</b> limits were adopted by several states to enhance both safety and mobility of roadway work zones. Dynamic lane merging (DLM) in its two main forms namely the early merge and the late merge was designed to advise drivers on definite <b>merging</b> locations. Variable <b>speed</b> limits (VSL) were introduced to work zones to decrease speed fluctuations and to smoothen traffic through work zones. Up to date, there are no studies that contrast standalone or a combination of ITS technologies to standard work zones under matching work zone settings. This study simulates a two-to-one work zone lane closure configuration in VISSIM under six different Maintenance of Traffic (MOT) plans. The first MOT consisted of the conventional plans used in Florida work zones, the second MOT consisted of a simplified dynamic early merging system (early SDLMS), the third MOT consisted of a simplified dynamic late merging systems (late SDLMS), the fourth MOT consisted appending a VSL to the conventional Florida MOT, the fifth MOT consisted of adding a VSL to the early SDLMS, and the sixth MOT consisted of adding a VSL to the late SDLMS. From the safety point of view, early and late SDLMS performed poorly as compared to VSL and Motorist Awareness System (MAS) when higher volumes were involved, but the addition of VSL improved their safety aspect by decreasing the speed variance of the vehicles traveling in both open and a closed lane. It was concluded that the passage of traffic through a work zone is made safer when a speed control is integrated to a dynamic merge system...|$|R

Additionally, both exhaustive and metaheuristic approaches are compared to optimise train operations such as enhanced brute force, ant colony optimisation and genetic algorithm. Moreover, [280] developed an offline eco-driving design model based on simulation tasks, whose aim is to define manual energy-efficient profiles, in terms of easily interpretable and executable commands for the driver, and implemented a genetic algorithm as an optimisation search technique.

The NNC consists of a principal component analyzer (PCA) and a Kohonen self-organized feature map (SOFM) neural network (NN). The output neurons of the NNC define the color classes for each node. The final image not only has the dominant image colors, but its texture also approaches the image local characteristics used.

The study is based on experimental measurements on 45 -nm SiGe pMOSFETs with a high-/metal gate stack, {{as well as on}} 45 -nm Si pMOSFETs with identical gate stack for comparison. In the reference SiGe technology, an innovative technological solution is adopted that limits the SiGe material only to the channel region. The resulting SiGe device <b>merges</b> the higher <b>speed</b> of the Ge technology with the lower leakage of the Si technology. Appropriate circuit- and system-level metrics are introduced to identify the advantages offered by SiGe technology in VLSI circuits. Analysis is performed in the context of next-generation VLSI circuits that fully exploit circuit- and system-level techniques to improve the energy efficiency through aggressive voltage scaling, other than low-leakage techniques. Analysis shows that the SiGe technology has more efficient leakage-delay and dynamic energy-delay trade-offs at nominal supply, compared to Si technology. Moreover, it is shown that the traditional analysis performed at nominal supply actually underestimates the benefits of SiGe pMOSFETs, since the speed advantage of SiGe VLSI circuits is further emphasized at low voltages. This demonstrates that SiGe VLSI circuits benefit from aggressive voltage scaling significantly more than Si circuits, thereby making SiGe devices a very promising alternative to Si transistors in next-generation VLSI systems...|$|R
