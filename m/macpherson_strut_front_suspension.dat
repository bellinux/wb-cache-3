5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent commonality with the Opel. The Rekord's <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit could {{accommodate}} {{six people}} with an optional front split-bench seat. It had a large trunk, a solid-beam rear axle, and a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> The Spirit differed from the other A-bodies primarily in the grille and rear lamp styling, and in {{the availability of a}} sportier, higher-performing R/T version.|$|E
25|$|The Frisky Family Three was {{basically}} a three-wheeled version of the coupe fitted with a smaller Villiers 9E engine and <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> Having three wheels instead of four meant the car qualified for lower vehicle excise duty and also meant {{that it could be}} driven with a motorcycle licence. It entered production in about February 1959.|$|E
50|$|Control {{arms are}} most {{commonly}} encountered {{as part of}} the <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> The control arms are perpendicular to the axis of the vehicle and are termed track control arms. A diagonal radius rod constrains the strut from moving forward and back.|$|R
50|$|Conceived as a small, {{economical}} and sporty car, the MR2 employed straightforward design elements, including {{fully independent}} <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspensions,</b> four wheel disc brakes, and transverse-mounted inline-four engines.|$|R
50|$|The Noble uses a unibody frame {{based on}} a {{shortened}} Suzuki Alto platform. It carries the same <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and a dead axle rear suspension with a Panhard stabilizing rod. The body is constructed using high tensile and ultra high tensile steel, a choice that makes the car somewhat heavy for its size at 875 kg.|$|R
25|$|Early {{versions}} used four speed manual transmission, whilst {{the current}} car is available with either six speed manual or five speed automatic transmission. The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> and a Twist-beam rear suspension. Most models use disc brakes {{at the front}} and rear drum brakes, although some recent models have all round disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1959 a {{new version}} of the Family Three was announced. The Frisky Family Three Mk2, dropped the <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> of the {{original}} car replacing it with the Dubonnet system used on the Friskysport. The chassis was lengthened to allow the engine to be moved back out of the cabin and it was now offered with the choice of either a [...] or [...] Excelsior Talisman twin engines giving the advantage of an Albion gearbox with a true reverse gear. Twin front seats replaced the original bench seats and production commenced in early 1960.|$|E
2500|$|The Escort had {{conventional}} {{rear-wheel drive}} and a four-speed manual gearbox, or three-speed automatic transmission. The suspension consisted of <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> {{and a simple}} live axle mounted on leaf springs. The Escort was the first small Ford to use rack-and-pinion steering. The Mark I featured contemporary styling cues in tune with its time: a subtle Detroit-inspired [...] "Coke bottle" [...] waistline and the [...] "dogbone" [...] shaped front grille– arguably the car's main stylistic feature. Similar Coke bottle styling featured in the larger Cortina Mark III (a visually similar car was built in West Germany as the Taunus) launched in 1970.|$|E
50|$|All models {{featured}} <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> {{as well as}} a four-link {{trailing arm}} rear suspension arrangement with a Panhard rod. Disc brakes were fitted as standard equipment on the front of all models. Rear disc brakes were fitted as standard on the 2000GT and 2000SL, which were not available to all international markets. Other models were fitted with rear drum brakes.|$|R
50|$|It {{is powered}} by a range of {{turbocharged}} petrol or common rail diesel engines, which are able to meet the Euro V emission standards and can be equipped with Start & Stop system. It has four disk brakes with ABS and EBD, electronic stability control (ESC), <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and independent rear suspension with double cross arm and torsion bar springs, and intelligent four-wheel-drive transmission.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was also}} the first car they built with {{up-to-date}} technology. The new 1508 cc [...] engine had overhead valves, and hydraulic clutch operation was used, which in 1950 was an unusual feature. [...] However, a three-speed gearbox, with synchromesh only on second and top, was retained. The Consul {{was also the}} first British production car to use the now-common <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Volkswagen added a [...] "Super Beetle" [...] (the Type 131) to its lineup in 1971. The Type 131 {{differed}} from the standard Beetle in its use of a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> {{instead of the usual}} torsion bars. The Super Beetle featured a new hooded, padded dash and curved windshield (from 1973 model year on up). Rack and pinion steering replaced recirculating ball steering gears in model year 1974 and up. The front of the car was stretched [...] to allow the spare tire to lie flat, and the combination of these two features increased the usable front luggage space.|$|E
2500|$|Jenkins went winless in 1971. NHRA {{changed the}} 1972 rules to allow drivers {{with a small}} block wedge engine to run a lighter car. Jenkins used a small block-based [...] in a Chevrolet Vega fitted in the division's first tube chassis, which debuted at the 1972 Winternationals. He had a subpar 9.90 second pass in the {{untested}} Vega, qualifying 17th of the 32 entries at the season-opening event. After tuning the chassis, the car clocked low-9.6 second passes on race day and Jenkins won the event. Jenkins used the car to win five of the first eight events of the season (some of them regionals) and six of eight Nationals. Jenkins earned a total of $250,000 that year, including event and manufacturer support. He matched Wilt Chamberlain as the professional athlete with the highest salary in the United States. That year he was featured in Time magazine, the first drag racer to experience mainstream national coverage. Jenkins built a Vega in 1974 (dubbed Grumpy's Toy XI) that had several firsts which impacted future drag racing cars, including the first dry sump oiling system and a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> This car would give him thirteen wins in Pro Stock that year.|$|E
50|$|The Audi 80 had a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> and a C-section beam {{rear axle}} located by {{trailing}} arms and a Panhard rod, and using coil springs and telescopic dampers.|$|E
50|$|The 200 Series had <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> type <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> which {{increased}} room around the engine bay, while the rear suspension was {{a modified version}} of that fitted to the 140 Series. The steering was greatly improved with the installation of rack-and-pinion steering, with power steering fitted as standard to the 244GL, 264DL and 264GL, and there were some modifications made to the braking system (in particular the master cylinder).|$|R
50|$|Chapman did use <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> of the Lotus 17. These were unsuccessful, {{owing to}} the {{stiction}} problems that Chapman had worked to avoid with the sliding drive shaft joint. A wishbone conversion kit was later developed by ex-Lotus engineer Len Terry.|$|R
50|$|A {{combined}} steel monocoque chassis {{and body}} featured a tubular steel subframe {{at the back}} for the engine and transmission. Suspension was independent all round (a first for a Maserati road car) with coil springs, telescopic shocks and anti-roll bars. The development prototype and the broadly similar show car first seen at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show featured <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> based <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> but this was abandoned for production because, installed in combination with very wide front tires and rack-and-pinion steering, the strut-based solution produced severe kickback. For the production cars Maserati reverted to a more conservative wishbone front-suspension arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The Mk II's <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> was {{replaced}} with more conventional double A-arm suspension to give the car a soft 'freeway' ride, which gave the larger engines distinct understeer.|$|E
5000|$|The Rover SD1 (released in 1976) shared several {{engineering}} features {{with the}} P76 [...] - [...] including <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> the aluminium V8 engine and a live rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The Crider {{is based}} on a {{stretched}} Honda City body architecture. It features an independent <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and a single torsion beam rear suspension. All models feature four wheel disc brakes and electric power steering.|$|E
50|$|The RM460 is a Genesis Coupe with a 4.6-liter Hyundai Tau engine V8, {{built by}} Rhys Millen Racing. The engine is mounted behind the {{passenger}} compartment {{to become a}} mid-engine rear wheel drive (MR) platform. The numerous modifications are: an increased compression ratio to 11.0:1, engine management system by AEM, Mendeola five-speed sequential transmission, original <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> dual-link <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and a five-link rear suspension, with a KW coilover component; HRE 560 Series 20-inch wheels with Toyo T1R tires, StopTech brakes, RMR Signature Edition kit, a carbon fiber spoiler and custom carbon fiber rear hatch, custom RM ONYX HD paint from BASF, Sparco Chrono sports seats, Sparco Alcantara and carbon fiber interior panels, Infinity Kappa Perfect Speakers and power amplifier.|$|R
5000|$|The new styling {{was joined}} by {{something}} the smaller Fords had been needing for some time, a new engine [...] - [...] a 997 cc overhead valve (OHV) straight-four with an oversquare cylinder bore that {{became known as the}} [...] "Kent". Acceleration from rest was still sluggish, but it was much improved from earlier cars. Also new for British Fords was a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three forward ratios: this was replaced by an all-synchromesh box in September 1962 (on 1198 powered cars). [...] The notoriously feeble vacuum-powered windscreen wipers of earlier Anglias was replaced with more conventional windscreen wipers powered by their own electric motor. The <b>Macpherson</b> <b>strut</b> independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> used on the 100E was retained.|$|R
25|$|Vehicles {{installed}} {{with the}} 3.5 V6 were longer, while the wheelbase remained unchanged {{for the regular}} versions. As this generation was Mitsubishi's flagship limousine, the bodystyle that was compliant with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement was no longer offered. The suspension was upgraded to <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> and the rear suspension used a multilink approach. Much of the technology installed in this generation Debonair was shared with the Mitsubishi GTO.|$|R
5000|$|As Volkswagen's first 4-door saloon, the Type 4 also {{introduced}} unibody construction, coil springs, trailing wishbone rear suspension, hydraulic clutch manual transmission [...] - [...] {{as well as}} <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> subsequently adapted to the VW Type 1 1302/1303 ("Super Beetle").|$|E
50|$|The <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> was {{replaced}} with more conventional double A-arm suspension (Also known as double wishbone suspension) which gave the Mark III a much softer ride on the road' but did give cars fitted with the larger, heavier engines distinct understeer.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} C-platform was jointly designed by global team of Fiat engineers and {{small number of}} Lancia engineers in Fiat development center in Mirafiori, also engineers in Betim, Brazil took part of the development. This all-new chassis uses <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and torsion beam rear suspension.|$|E
5000|$|The G-body had an {{extremely}} resilient structure. For its time, the G-body {{was one of}} the strongest unibody car frames in production (25 Hz). This fact did not go untouted as GM literature made much of the need to use a 'frame crusher' designed to test heavy-duty truck frames to finally break the G-body structure in their crush-to-failure procedures. Vehicles built on the G platform are also noted for having belt-in-seat style seat belts like the mid-size GMT360 SUVs. [...] The G-body also featured four-wheel independent suspension with a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> style <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and a semi-trailing arm style rear suspension that utilized aluminum control arms. All-new aluminum control arms were introduced for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> for 1998. [...] The handling was further enhanced with standard front and rear stabilizer bars and lateral links in the rear suspension to further control wheel toe.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum {{is used in}} the body, hood, {{trunk lid}} and is also used in the doors {{internally}} to reduce weight. The <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> uses a double wishbone setup, also to reduce unsprung weight, and to improve vehicle handling. This type of suspension was previously used on the Cedric/Gloria until 1983, when that platform began to use <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> but still uses the multilink rear suspension which was introduced on the Cedric/Gloria in 1979. The Fuga uses aluminum alloy extensively in both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> components.|$|R
5000|$|The Proudia was {{priced from}} ¥4.6 million to ¥6.4 million, {{and came in}} three {{specifications}} labelled A, B or C. A and B featured a 6G74 3497 cc GDi V6 producing [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] of torque at 2500 rpm, while specification C featured the 8A80 4498 cc GDi V8 producing [...] at 5000 rpm and [...] at 4000 rpm. The car was equipped with several advanced features like CCD cameras to monitor adjacent lanes and behind the car, and a laser activated adaptive cruise control. It used <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and a multi-link suspension for the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The Passat {{originally}} {{used the}} four-cylinder OHC 1.3-litre (...) and 1.5-litre (/) petrol engines {{also used in}} the Audi 80—longitudinally mounted with front-wheel drive, in Audi tradition, with either a four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic. It had a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> with a solid axle/coil spring setup at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Spirit could {{accommodate}} {{six people}} with an optional front split-bench seat. It had a large trunk, a solid-beam rear axle, and a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> The Spirit differed from the other A-bodies primarily in the grille and rear lamp styling, and in {{the availability of a}} sportier, higher-performing R/T version.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1976 GM began {{developing}} the J-body, an economy car platform {{intended to be}} shared across all its passenger car divisions. [...] It had a 101.2 in (2,570 mm) wheelbase, torsion beam rear suspension, and standard 4-cylinder engine. The unibody's front subframe carried a <b>MacPherson</b> <b>strut</b> <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and transverse engine/transmission unit.|$|E
50|$|To save {{development}} costs, the 1980 Thunderbird {{utilized the}} Fox platform {{with a unique}} exterior design that would only be shared with the Mercury Cougar XR7. While the Thunderbird itself was distinctly to be a luxury car, {{the use of the}} Fox platform would prove beneficial in improving the handling of the vehicle. Along with the massive weight reduction, the 1980 Thunderbird was the first to be fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, greatly improving steering precision; sharing the underpinnings of the Fairmont meant the use of <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension.</b> Further in contrast to its personal-luxury background, a specially-tuned suspension package was designed to make use of Michelin TRX tires; Recaro bucket seats were an option.|$|R
5000|$|The ¥9,990,000 Dignity (S43 chassis code) {{featured}} Mitsubishi's 8A80 4,498 cc V8, a 90-degree aluminium-block GDi engine producing [...] at 5000 rpm and [...] at 4000 rpm, and {{an extension}} of the Proudia's exterior dimensions in order to liberate more interior space for the rear occupants; the roofline was raised by 10 mm and the wheelbase by 250 mm. It used <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and a multi-link suspension for the rear wheels. The car was equipped with several advanced features like Driver Support System (CCD cameras to monitor adjacent lanes and behind the car for lane departure warning system and blind spot monitor, and a lidar activated adaptive cruise control), self-levelling multi-link air suspension with electronic damping control ...|$|R
2500|$|A [...] {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the smaller engine {{was added to the}} line-up in February 1987, using the world's first needle roller rocker arm assembly. This generation was badge engineered and was introduced to the Asian luxury car market as the Hyundai Grandeur, giving Hyundai a luxury sedan to shuttle foreign dignitaries during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. As Mitsubishi and Chrysler had a business relationship where automotive technology was being shared and used in both Chrysler and Mitsubishi products, this generation Debonair does have some superficial similarities with the Chrysler New Yorker of the same time period. The Debonair's platform, however, shares nothing with the Chrysler [...] "E", [...] "Y", or [...] "K" [...] platforms. The suspension was upgraded to <b>MacPherson</b> <b>struts</b> for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> and the rear suspension used a three-link torsion axle. The only transmission available was a four-speed automatic unit.|$|R
