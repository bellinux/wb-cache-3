50|$|RPT {{offers a}} variety of reports to {{identify}} the presence and cause of system performance bottlenecks. There are reports that <b>measure</b> <b>accuracy</b> of system response which ensure that the system did not error out or crash during a test. There are reports to measure system performance metrics such as disk, network and CPU utilization, to identify the presence of hardware bottlenecks. To identify software related bottlenecks, there are reports to measure load, throughput and response times. For Java EE environments, when a bottleneck is identified, users can drill down on the performance reports to identify the cause of the bottleneck, identifying slow performance classes, methods and individual lines of application source code.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> of {{atmospheric}} refractivity directly affects {{the precision of}} radar refraction error correction and atmospheric duct measurement. Because the conventional gas sensor can not accurately measure the atmospheric refractivity, the sensor–high Q microwave resonator that can accurately measure the atmospheric refractivity on-line is proposed basing {{on the principle that}} resonant frequency will change as different medium pass through the microwave resonator. Many aspects of the microwave resonator, such as the size, electromagnetic coupling ventilation material and processing technology are designed to ensure the <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the sensor. The results of experiment show that the sensor has the advantages of higher <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> and faster <b>measuring</b> speed, and the <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{of atmospheric}} refractivity can meet the request of radar refraction error correction and the atmospheric duct measurement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tool {{presetter}} {{is a type}} {{of precision}} measuring instrument that associates to CNC machine tools and machining centers, which integrates the technologies of optics, mechanics and electrics all together, and its <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> gives direct influence on machining accuracy of CNC machines. The main factors that influence <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> of tool presetter include: image edge detection, image positioning and accuracy of its mechanical system. This paper gives analysis on these main factors and puts forward three newly developed algorithms for improving <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> of tool presetter. First algorithm is image edge detection algorithm based on subpixel that increases the edge positioning accuracy by more than 10 times. Second one is uniformity compensation algorithm for whole view measurement that is able to capture accurate real pixel size so that image movement is more precise, which further increases the <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The third one is linear compensation algorithm in the measuring space that makes effective compensation to the mechanical system errors, which can compensate any position in measurement space so that system accuracy increases significantly. These algorithms are tested in CoVis software and the results show that the total <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> of tool presetter is improved dramtically to 2 μm...|$|R
50|$|While affective {{forecasts}} {{take place}} in the present moment, researchers also investigate its future outcomes. That is, they analyze forecasting as a two-step process, encompassing a current prediction as well as a future event. Breaking down the present and future stages allow researchers to <b>measure</b> <b>accuracy,</b> as well as tease out how errors occur. Gilbert and Wilson, for example, categorize errors based on which component they affect and when they enter the forecasting process. In the present phase of affective forecasting, forecasters bring to mind a mental representation of the future event and predict how they will respond emotionally to it. The future phase includes the initial emotional response to the onset of the event, as well as subsequent emotional outcomes, for example, the fading of the initial feeling.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} table {{represents the}} Russian method for determining accuracy {{and it is}} far more complex than Western methods. In the West, one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measure the overall diameter of the group. The Russians on the other-hand, fire a group of shots into the target. They then draw two circles on the target. One for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits. They then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits (50% or R50) on the inner part of the circles. This dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups. They then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to <b>measure</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This method cannot be converted and is not comparable to western methods for determining accuracy.|$|E
