500|$|Scientology {{spokeswoman}} Pat Harney called Lonsdale's apparent suicide [...] "awful" [...] {{and stated}} [...] "It's just unfortunate anybody feels {{they have to}} go to that length ... I wouldn't wish that on anybody." [...] Jerald Rowlett, a fellow Scientology critic and friend from Michigan, told The Tampa Tribune: [...] "In many ways Shawn was a hero to <b>me</b> ... <b>He</b> <b>had</b> a hard life and a history he knew Scientology would use to hurt him. And yet he still felt strongly enough to try to inform the public about the actions of Scientology." [...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn. When alive a Scientology spokesman said of him: 'He has no redeeming value to anyone, anywhere.' Well, he {{was a bit of a}} hero to me ... I for one mourn the loss - of a brave and singular American".|$|E

At 6:39p.m., Ravi tweeted, [...] "Anyone with iChat, I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again." [...] Ravi had set up the webcam and initially pointed it towards Clementi's bed. Ravi has stated that he realized that his [...] "joke" [...] was [...] "stupid", and pointed the webcam towards his own bed before the planned viewing on September 21. The police say, however, that it was subsequently found still pointed directly at Clementi's bed. When Ravi's friend suggested that Clementi and his guest might use his bed, Ravi said [...] "My webcam checks my bed, hahaha." [...] At trial, two Rutgers students testified that Ravi had spent part of that early evening in their dorm rooms, and used their computers to verify that the webcam was still focused on the bed. The captain of Ravi's Ultimate Frisbee team testified that, after practice that evening, Ravi [...] "told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> set up a webcam of some sort to capture images of his roommate. He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done it before that date" [...] and [...] "that he was planning on doing it again. That night." [...] When Clementi returned to his room, he noticed the camera and texted a friend saying he had unplugged Ravi's powerstrip to prevent further video streaming during his date. Ravi has said that he had changed his mind regarding the broadcast and disabled the camera himself by putting the computer in sleep mode.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E

Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, he told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
