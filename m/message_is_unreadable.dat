50|$|The banner {{will now}} be rolled up, brought to the pick-up point, usually in the grass along the runway and unrolled. Again, {{it will have to}} be checked. If one of the lines catches and loops itself around one of the rods, the tension not only may result in damage, but also will cause the banner not to hang straight, even twist and roll in the {{airstream}} during flight and the <b>message</b> will <b>be</b> <b>unreadable.</b>|$|R
50|$|EMS <b>messages</b> that <b>are</b> sent to {{devices that}} do not support it will be {{displayed}} as SMS messages, though they may <b>be</b> <b>unreadable</b> due {{to the presence of}} additional data that cannot be rendered by the device.|$|R

60|$|GILBERT. Oh! journalism <b>is</b> <b>unreadable,</b> and {{literature}} <b>is</b> not read. That is all. But {{with regard to}} your statement that the Greeks had no art-critics, I assure you that is quite absurd. It would be more just {{to say that the}} Greeks were a nation of art-critics.|$|R

50|$|After adding system {{information}} (such as emphasis settings, SCMS information, time code) and adding Reed-Solomon error correction bits to the 384 kbit/s data stream, followed by 8b/10b encoding, the resulting bit rate is 768 kbit/s, which is recorded onto the eight data tracks at 96 kbit/s per track in a checkered pattern. According to the Philips webpage, {{it is possible}} for a DCC recorder to recover all missing data from a tape even if one of the 8 audio tracks <b>is</b> completely <b>unreadable,</b> or if all tracks <b>are</b> <b>unreadable</b> for 1.45 mm (about 0.03 seconds).|$|R

50|$|It {{was also}} {{good sense to}} keep the first 16 colors, as they were, and modify colors 16 - 255. This would make sure any GUI or UI had {{reliable}} colors. Otherwise a user might be presented with a message or bit of text which <b>was</b> <b>unreadable,</b> or very difficult to read.|$|R

50|$|Machine Translation Machine {{translation}} tools apply computational linguistic analysis of source documents to provide draft translations of text.While often producing text which <b>is</b> <b>unreadable,</b> machine translation can provide users {{with the general}} gist of a document, article, or letter and {{can also be used}} to screen documents to identify those in need of more accurate human translation.|$|R
50|$|The single {{available}} copy of {{this work}} is late, Seleucid era, recovered from the Parthian mound southeast of the Eanna temple complex in Warka and has passages marked with the term ḫe-pí, “broken”, suggesting it was a duplicate of an earlier damaged work where parts of the tablet <b>were</b> <b>unreadable.</b> The fragmentary tablet is arranged in four columns.|$|R
5000|$|A Data Matrix code is a {{two-dimensional}} barcode consisting {{of black and}} white [...] "cells" [...] or modules arranged in either a square or rectangular pattern, also known as a matrix. The information to be encoded can be text or numeric data. Usual data size is from a few bytes up to 1556 bytes. The length of the encoded data depends on the number of cells in the matrix. Error correction codes are often used to increase reliability: even if one or more cells are damaged so it <b>is</b> <b>unreadable,</b> the <b>message</b> can still <b>be</b> read. A Data Matrix symbol can store up to 2,335 alphanumeric characters.|$|R
