BackgroundIron deficiency and anemia are commonly encountered {{in patients with}} autoimmune diseases undergoing immune apheresis. This makes erythropoietin and iron substitution necessary in most patients. However, intravenous iron therapy may result in an increase of potentially toxic nontransferrin-bound iron. MethodsWe examined the effect of 50 mg or 100 <b>mg</b> of <b>iron</b> (III) sucrose on bleomycin-detectable iron (BDI) in immune apheresis patients. Six patients with autoimmune disorders and normal kidney function were enrolled. Before and after the injection of 50 mg or 100 <b>mg</b> of <b>iron</b> (III) sucrose, BDI was measured in serum samples at five different time points. ResultsThere was no BDI traceable before injection of iron (III) sucrose. BDI was present in serum of all patients after the administration of 100 <b>mg</b> of <b>iron</b> (III) sucrose in concentrations up to 0. 49 μmol/L. In contrast, only one patient showed BDI at a concentration of 0. 16 μmol/L after the administration of 50 <b>mg</b> of <b>iron</b> (III) sucrose. ConclusionWe conclude that if parenteral iron is administered after apheresis treatment, despite the equal tolerability, use of 50 <b>mg</b> of <b>iron</b> (III) sucrose is superior to 100 <b>mg</b> of <b>iron</b> (III) sucrose in avoiding the formation of potentially toxic nontransferrin-bound iron...|$|R

In addition, we updated a recent meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of home fortification with iron-containing powders, with a view to examining diversity in trial results. Methods: We gave chemoprevention by dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, albendazole and praziquantel to 338 afebrile children with haemoglobin concentration ≥ 70 g/L. We randomly allocated them to daily home fortification for 30 days with either placebo, 3 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as NaFeEDTA or 12. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as encapsulated ferrous fumarate. We assessed haemoglobin concentration (primary outcome), plasma iron markers, plasma inflammation markers and Plasmodium infection in samples collected at baseline and after 30 days of intervention. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in pre-school children to assess the effect of home fortification with iron-containing powders on anaemia and haemoglobin concentration at end of intervention. Results: A total of 315 children completed the 30 -day intervention period. At baseline, 66. 9 % of children had inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein concentration > 5 mg/L or plasma α 1 -acid glycoprotein concentration > 1. 0 g/L); in those without inflammation, 42. 5 % were iron deficient. There was no evidence, either in per protocol analysis or intention-to-treat analysis, that home fortification with either of the iron interventions improved haemoglobin concentration, plasma ferritin concentration, plasma transferrin receptor concentration or erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-haem ratio. We also found no evidence of effect modification by iron status, anaemia status and inflammation status at baseline. In the meta-analysis, the effect on haemoglobin concentration was highly heterogeneous between trials (I 2 : 84. 1 %; p value for test of heterogeneity: < 0. 0001). Conclusions: In this population, home fortification with either 3 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as NaFeEDTA or 12. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as encapsulated ferrous fumarate was insufficiently efficacious to assess non-inferiority of 3 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as NaFeEDTA compared to 12. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as encapsulated ferrous fumarate.

40|$|Introduction Home {{fortification}} powders containing {{iron and}} other micronutrients have been recommended by World Health Organisation to prevent {{iron deficiency anaemia}} in areas of high prevalence. There is evidence, however, that home fortification at this iron dose may cause gastrointestinal adverse events including diarrhoea. Providing a low dose of highly absorbable iron (3 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as NaFeEDTA) may be safer because the decreased amount of iron in the gut lumen can possibly reduce the burden of these adverse effects whilst resulting in similar or higher amounts of absorbed iron. Objective To show non-inferiority of home fortification with 3 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as NaFeEDTA compared with 12. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as encapsulated ferrous fumarate, with haemoglobin response as the primary outcome. Design 338 Kenyan children aged 12 – 36 months will be randomly allocated to daily home fortification with either: a) 3 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as NaFeEDTA (experimental treatment), b) 12. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>iron</b> as encapsulated ferrous fumarate (reference), or c) placebo. At baseline, after 30 days of intervention and within 100 days post-intervention, blood samples will be assessed for primary outcome (haemoglobin concentration), iron status markers, Plasmodium parasitaemia and inflammation markers. Urine and stool samples will be assessed for hepcidin concentrations and inflammation, respectively. Adherence will be assessed by self-reporting, sachet counts and by an electronic monitoring device.

The women were randomly allocated to 20; 40 or 80 mg of iron daily for 8 weeks from mid-pregnancy. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-nine (99 %) women completed the trial. At the end of treatment, {{there was a clear}} dose-response of increasing mean haemoglobin concentration with iron dose (111 +/- 13 g l(- 1) at 20 mg per day, 114 +/- 11 g l(- 1) at 40 mg per day and 119 +/- 12 g l(- 1) at 80 mg per day, P= 0. 006). However, the incidence of anaemia did not differ statistically between groups.
