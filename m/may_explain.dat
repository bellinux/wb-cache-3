5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} underlying global dimming {{may also}} have regional effects. While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> the cooling of the eastern United States relative to the warming western part.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E

This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why attacks are more common in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{takes place}} in the three mountainous regions at 45 {{distinct}} coal beds near Mesozoic basins. Over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, sand, or gravel, were also mined in Virginia in 2012. The state's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism. 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting crater <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> sinking and earthquakes in the region.|$|E

50|$|Some demographers {{question}} whether sex-selective abortion or infanticide claims are accurate, because underreporting of female births <b>may</b> also <b>explain</b> high sex ratios. Natural reasons <b>may</b> also <b>explain</b> {{some of the}} abnormal sex ratios. In contrast to these possible causes of abnormal sex ratio, Klasen and Wink suggest India and China’s high sex ratios are primarily the result of sex-selective abortion.|$|R

School {{counselor}} Emma (Jayma <b>Mays)</b> <b>explains</b> that they are focusing on the pain of Whitney's death so {{that they do not have}} to think on the pain of leaving their friends after graduation. Will makes their assignment for the week a tribute to Houston.|$|R
5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> some of the discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al. (2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E

5|$|Stress has {{effects on}} the immune system, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why some cases {{directly}} correlate with stress. It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress, and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{church of}} St. Peter's at Exeter became Leofric's cathedral {{and he was}} enthroned as Bishop of Exeter there on St Peter's Day in 1050 with King Edward in attendance. The king, and his wife Edith {{took part in the}} {{ceremony}} of enthronement, with both of them leading the bishop to his cathedra, or episcopal chair. Edith had dower rights to the town of Exeter, which <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> her presence at the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble {{assumption is}} that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the arterial side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the arterial circulation.|$|E

5|$|The {{avalanche}} deposit consists {{mostly of}} loose material such as ash, lapilli, pumice, {{with only a}} few lithic blocks. This loose consistency <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> the lack of megablocks. Its total volume is about , less than the volume of the Mount St. Helens and Socompa deposits. It is comparable to the volume of the landslide that the Ancash earthquake triggered on Huascarán in Peru in 1970, resulting in more than 20,000 fatalities. Evidence points to previous flank collapses at Lastarria.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> the subspecies' phenotypic diversity.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} {{capture of}} Triton <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> several {{features of the}} Neptunian system, including the extremely eccentric orbit of Neptune's moon Nereid and the scarcity of moons {{as compared to the}} other giant planets. Triton's initially eccentric orbit would have intersected orbits of irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller regular moons, dispersing them through gravitational interactions.|$|E

5|$|The {{taking of}} black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat. Black swans {{were considered to be}} a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
