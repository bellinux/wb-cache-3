Nonetheless, hypothyroidism would have been the principal precipitant of both these complications. Both paralytic ileus and acute kidney injury improved with thyroxine replacement. Hypothyroidism may induce de novo acute kidney injury or it may exacerbate ongoing chronic kidney disease.

Method: A 74 year male patient without previous psychiatric history was presented with acute psychotic symptoms to the emergency department and was hospitalized for three days. Results: The laboratory profile showed the presence of high titer of serum thyroid antibodies (ANTI-TG> 4000 IU/ml, n. r. = 0. 0 - 115. 0 IU/ml), high titer (corrected) of serum Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (Α-TPO: 386. 7 IU/ml, n. r. : 0. 34 IU/ml) and high Thyroidstimulating hormone TSH: 45. 6 μΙU/ml,n. r. : 2. 03 - 4. 01 μIU/ml, T 4 (Thyroxine = 6. 98 μg/dL, (n. r. : 5. 10 - 14. 10 μg/dL), T 3 triiodothyronine= 0. 84 ng/mL (n. r. : 0. 80 - 2. 00 ng/mL).

40|$|Background. For unknown reasons, the {{prevalence}} of thyroid autoimmune disorders is higher in patients with Down's syndrome than in the general population. The present case strongly supports a recent evaluation of propagating screening for thyroid disease in this group of patients to assure early diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Methods. In a 25 -year-old man diagnosed with Down's syndrome, clinical <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> were lacking, but profound biochemical abnormalities were found with particularly high levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Antigenic properties of TSH were characterized using a panel of anti-TSH antibodies. Results. Technical problems not infrequently associated with TSH measurements are convincingly ruled out. Antigenic characterization of the patient's circulating TSH revealed circulating forms of TSH different from pituitary TSH which closely resembled TSH recombinant human hormone. Conclusions. It appears counterintuitive that the bioactivity of TSH decreases in the hypothyroid state as higher bioactivity of TSH is anticipated in hypothyroidism promoted by an increased hypothalamic TRH drive. In contrast, diminished negative thyroid hormone feedback will enhance posttranslational glycosylation of TSH subunits and increase sialylation of the carbohydrate side chains. Both exert {{a negative effect on}} TSH bioactivity, only compensated by the very high levels of the hormone as in the present case...|$|E

ObjectiveTo investigate the presence of HT in SSc patients and its possible association with disease manifestations. MethodsClinical <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism,</b> TSH and anti-thyroid auto antibodies (anti-TPO. anti TBG and TRAb) were studied in 56 patients with SSc. SSc patients with HT were compared with SSc patients without thyroiditis. ResultsHT was observed in 19. 64 % of patients with SSc. No association was observed between HT and the different forms of disease or profile of autoantibodies. Likewise, {{there was no difference between}} the mean modified Rodnan score and presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, scars, digital necrosis, myositis, arthritis, sicca symptoms, esophageal dysmotility and scleroderma renal crisis when the groups were compared. On the other hand, patients with HT had higher frequency of pulmonary hypertension in relation to patients without HT (66. 6 % vs 22. 5 %, p= 0. 016).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} clinical and pharmacokinetic responses to once daily administration of an oral solution of L-thyroxine (20 µg/kg body weight) for treatment of primary hypothyroidism in dogs. The 10 dogs included in the study had been diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism based on a plasma total thyroxine (tT 4) concentration 0. 60 µg/l, a scintiscan showing no or inadequate uptake in the thyroid glands, and a very low response (< 5 nmol/l) to TSH stimulation. After 4 ± 1 weeks of treatment the clinical improvements were evaluated and a pharmacokinetic profile of tT 4 over 34 hours was made. Several of the clinical <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> had improved. The plasma TSH concentrations had significantly decreased and plasma tT 4 concentrations had increased. Seven of 10 dogs had a plasma tT 4 concentration that was within the reference range during the first 24 hours.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} patient with severe {{hypothyroidism}} complicated by paralytic ileus and acute kidney injury. A 65 year old male patient, diagnosed with hypothyroidism one year ago was transferred to our unit {{in a state of}} drowsiness and confusion. He was severely hypothyroid and had paralytic ileus and impaired renal function at the time of transfer. Hypokalaemia was present, and was likely to have contributed to the paralytic ileus and this together with dehydration was likely to have contributed to renal injury. Nonetheless, hypothyroidism is very likely to have been the principal precipitant of both these complications, and both paralytic ileus and acute kidney injury improved with thyroxine replacement. Unfortunately, the patient died unexpectedly eight days after admission to the unit. Hypothyroidism may induce de novo acute kidney injury or it may exacerbate ongoing chronic kidney disease. This rare complication is assumed to be due to the hypodynamic circulatory state created by thyroid hormone deficiency. Paralytic ileus is an even rarer fatal manifestation of hypothyroidism and is thought to be due to an autonomic neuropathy affecting the intestines that is reversible with thyroxine replacement. To our knowledge, both these complications have not been observed in a single patient so far. It is important that clinicians are aware of these rare <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> as in most occasions, thyroxine deficiency may be missed, and treatment can reverse the complications. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interaction}} between the indicators of lipid exchange and thyroid status among the inhabitants of radiation contaminated territories under additional psycho-emotional load. We observed 170 students aged between 18 – 24 and divided them into a control group of students who were from areas unaffected by radiation (70 people) and the main experimental group of students from territories of increased radio-ecological load (IV radiation zone, 100 people). We determined the content of thyrotropic hormone (TTH), triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroxin (T 4), total cholesterin (TC), triglycerides (TG), cholesterin of lipoproteins of high density (Ch-LPHD) and cholesterin of lipoproteins of low density (Ch-LPLD). We found that people who had lived since birth in territories which were contaminated with radionuclides and were affected by prolonged influence of small doses of ionizing radiation had significant fluctuations of indicators of concentrations of TTH, T 3 and T 4, forming <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> and hyperthyrosis among some of those tested. Independently from hyperthyrosis, the effect was accompanied by growth in the level of TH, TG, Ch-LPHD and Ch-LPLD. Persons with <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> had the content of TH above the upper limit of the homeostatic norm and the level of Ch-LPLD was higher than the norm in sub-groups with features of hypo- and hyperthyrosis. All those tested from the main group showed a significant positive correlation connection between the level of TTH and levels of TH and Ch-LPLD. The subgroup with manifestations of hyperthyrosis had a positive correlation between the levels of TTH and TG, the subgroups with manifestations of euthyroidism and hyperthyrosis had a negative correlation between the levels of TTH and Ch-LPHD. The hyperthyrosis subgroup had a significant positive correlation connection between T 3 and TH and Ch-LPLD. The euthyroidism and hypothyroidism subgroups had a significant negative correlation between T 3 concentration and Ch-LPLD. The cortisol indicator positively correlated with levels of TH and Ch-LPLD in all subgroups divided according to thyroid status. In the conditions of additional psycho-emotional load (examinations), those tested had an increased level of TP (higher than the norm in the subgroups of hyperthyrosis and hypothyroidism) caused by the increase in cortisol level and a tendency of decrease in TTH. At the same time, the level of Ch-LPLD increased (higher than the upper norm) as a result of decrease in the content of Ch-LPHL. The coefficient of correlation between the level of TTH and levels of TH and Ch-LPLD lost statistical significance in all subgroups divided according to thyroid status. In the hyperthyrosis subgroup, the effect of loss of correlation with TH and Ch-LPLD was also observed for T 3. Thus, the individuals tested from territories polluted by radionuclides, had proaterogenic changes dependant on thyroid status,which can become a precondition for the development of metabolic syndrome. The risk of dyslipidemia increases in the conditions of additional psycho-emotional load, when the regulatory effect of the thyroid gland`s hormones is reduced...|$|E

40|$|Background: Thyroid {{disorders}} {{are known to}} involve all the organ systems of the body, the skin being no exception. The association of thyroid disorders with cutaneous manifestations is complex. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are known to cause these changes. Aims: The present {{study was designed to}} ascertain the varied cutaneous <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism.</b> Materials and Methods: This study was a hospital based clinical study conducted in collaboration with the Endocrinology Division (Department of Medicine) of SMHS Hospital (associated teaching hospital of Government Medical College Srinagar), over a period of one year, from May 2010 to May 2011. Four hundred and sixty consecutive diagnosed cases of hypothyroidism constituted the subject material for the study and were evaluated for the presence of any cutaneous manifestation. Results: In our study group of 460 patients, there were 416 females and 44 male patients. The predominant cutaneous symptom in our hypothyroid patients was dry coarse skin (65. 22 %), followed by hair loss (42. 6 %) and puffy edema (38. 48 %).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Cardiac tamponade {{is a rare}} {{manifestation of}} hypothyroidism, and a less rare cause of pericardial effusion. The {{accumulation}} of the pericardial fluid is gradual, and often does not compromise cardiac hemodynamic function. There is {{a relationship between the}} severity and chronicity of the disease with the presence of pericardial effusion. There are few cases describing associated pericardial tamponade published in the literature. When a tamponade occurs, a concomitant provocative factor such as a viral pericarditis may be related. Our patient's case appears to be the youngest patient described so far. Case presentation We report the case of a previously healthy five-year-old Hispanic (non-indigenous) boy who developed rhabdomyolysis with a history of a recent pericardial effusion and tamponade two months before that required the placement of a percutaneous pericardial drainage. Pericardial effusion was considered to be viral. Later on readmission, clinical primary hypothyroidism was diagnosed and thought {{to be associated with the}} previous cardiac tamponade. He developed rhabdomyolysis, which was considered to be autoimmune and was treated with steroids. The level of creatine phosphate kinase and creatine kinase MB fraction returned to within the reference rangeone week after our patient was started on steroids and three weeks after he was started on thyroid hormones. Conclusions Physicians should consider hypothyroidism as a differential diagnosis in patients with pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion may progress and cause a cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic instability. The fact that our patient did not have any <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> might have delayed diagnosis. </p...|$|E

Hypokalaemia was present, and was likely to have contributed to the paralytic ileus and this together with dehydration was likely to have contributed to renal injury. Nonetheless, hypothyroidism is very likely to have been the principal precipitant of both these complications, and both paralytic ileus and acute kidney injury improved with thyroxine replacement. Unfortunately, the patient died unexpectedly eight days after admission to the unit. Hypothyroidism may induce de novo acute kidney injury or it may exacerbate ongoing chronic kidney disease. This rare complication is assumed to be due to the hypodynamic circulatory state created by thyroid hormone deficiency. Paralytic ileus is an even rarer fatal manifestation of hypothyroidism and is thought to be due to an autonomic neuropathy affecting the intestines that is reversible with thyroxine replacement. To our knowledge, both these complications have not been observed in a single patient so far. It is important that clinicians are aware of these rare <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> as in most occasions, thyroxine deficiency may be missed, and treatment can reverse the complications. Background Hypothyroidism presenting with acute kidney injury is rare, with only few cases reported so far [1, 2]. Hypothyroidism may induce de novo acute kidney injury (AKI) or mayexacerbateongoingchronickidneydisease[3]or contributetotheoccurrenceofAKIinthepresenceof other renal insults. AKI is life threatening, and identification of possible contributory causes and early treatment is potentially life saving. Paralytic ileus is an even rarer fatal manifestation of hypothyroidism [4]. In this article we discuss a patient presenting with severe hypothyroidism and both these complications. Case presentation and discussio...|$|E

Los síntomas y signos del hipotiroidismo son sistémicos y dependen de la duración e intensidad de la deficiencia de la hormona tiroidea. Las manifestaciones neuromusculares, son excepcionalmente los únicos signos clínicos. Se presenta el caso de un paciente joven con una miopatía severa con rabdomiolisis como la única manifestación de hipotiroidismo severo {{debido a}} tiroiditis de Hashimoto Hashimoto’s {{thyroiditis}} {{is the most}} frequent cause <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism.</b> In the regions with no iodine deficiency, it is more frequent in women and oftentimes has a familial association.

40|$|Background: Myxedema coma is {{the extreme}} <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism,</b> {{typically}} seen {{in patients with}} severe biochemical hypothyroidism. Its occurrence in association with subclinical hypothyroidism is extremely unusual. We describe a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism who developed clinical <b>manifestations</b> <b>of</b> myxedema coma. Summary: A 47 -year-old woman presented to our endocrine clinic with complaints of fatigue and biochemical findings <b>of</b> subclinical <b>hypothyroidism.</b> She was started on treatment with thyroxine (T 4) but remained unwell and was later admitted to hospital with hormone profile showing persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated thyrotropin and normal free T 4 [FT 4] and free triiodothyronine [FT 3]) : FT 4 10. 7 [*]pmol/L (reference range 10. 3 – 24. 5), FT 3 2. 7 [*]pmol/L (reference range 2. 67 – 7. 03), and thyrotropin 6. 09 [*]mU/L (reference range 0. 4 – 4. 0). She subsequently developed hypothermia (temperature 33. 2 °C), circulatory collapse, and coma. Biochemical profile showed hyponatremia, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. An echocardiogram revealed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion. We diagnosed myxedema coma and started treatment with intravenous T 3. She responded dramatically with improvement in level of consciousness and normalization of metabolic parameters. We found no explanation other than hypothyroidism {{to account for the}} presentation. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests excluded adrenal insufficiency, and serum gonadotrophins were within the normal reference range. FT 4 estimation by equilibrium dialysis excluded analytical interference, and molecular analysis for the thyroid hormone receptor β gene associated with thyroid hormone resistance was negative. Conclusions: To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report of myxedema coma in a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism. The reason for normal thyroid hormone levels is unclear but may reflect deviation from a higher pre-morbid set-point. The case highlights the importance of careful clinical evaluation in patients with disparate clinical and laboratory findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} <b>of</b> myopathy in <b>hypothyroidism</b> {{ranges from}} 30 to 80 %. The major symptoms related are weakness, muscular cramps and myalgia. The pseudohyperthrophic form is called Hoffman's syndrome. The electrophysiological study reveals myopathy, neuropathy or mixed pattern. Laboratorial investigation generally shows {{increased levels of}} muscle enzymes and low serum thyroid hormones, with thyrotrophic-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevated. The treatment consists in hormone replacement and the prognosis is good {{in most of the}} cases. We report an adult male who developed muscular cramps, myalgia, weakness, pseudohyperthrophy, associated with facial edema and alteration of his voice. The muscle enzymes were increased and T 4 was undetectable with a raised level of TSH. The myopathy was the initial <b>manifestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothyroidism</b> in this case. A frequência de miopatia no hipotireoidismo varia de 30 % a 80 %. Os sintomas relacionados ao acometimento muscular são fraqueza, cãimbras e mialgias. A forma pseudo-hipertrófica é denominada síndrome de Hoffman. O estudo eletrofisiológico pode revelar padrão miopático, neuropático ou misto. A investigação laboratorial em geral mostra aumento das enzimas musculares e redução dos níveis de hormônio tireoidiano com TSH elevado. O tratamento consiste na reposição oral de hormônio e o prognóstico é bom na maioria dos casos. Relatamos o caso de um adulto que apresentou cãimbras, mialgia, fraqueza com pseudohipertrofia muscular associados a edema facial e alteração da voz. As enzimas musculares estavam elevadas e o nível de T 4 foi indetectável com aumento de TSH. A miopatia foi manifestação inicial de hipotireoidismo neste caso...|$|R
