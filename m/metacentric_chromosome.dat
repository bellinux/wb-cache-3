50|$|In an {{acrocentric}} chromosome the p arm contains genetic material including repeated sequences such as nucleolar organizing regions, {{and can be}} translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced Robertsonian translocation.

A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes; in this case, because more species are extant, {{it is apparent that}} the evolutionary sequence is a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one <b>metacentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> in humans (see Karyotype#Aneuploidy).|$|E
