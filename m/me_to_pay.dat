'I have studied political economy, and am familiar with the principles of internal revenue, and the income to be derived from ordinary taxes and imposts in a principality of this size would not enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> that sum.' ...|$|E
60|$|Burr. Wit from a Low Country soldier! One, {{that has}} conversed with none but dull Dutchmen these ten years! What an {{unreasonable}} rogue art thou? why, I tell thee, 'tis as difficult <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him ready money.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{discharges}} all its debts. You {{must teach}} <b>me</b> how <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{you back in}} full measure; that's my one big task. You're giving so much freely; but, of course, I'm glad--I don't want duty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] {{said the}} skipper, bitterly, {{as he turned}} to the mate, [...] "is what you an’ <b>me</b> have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>to</b> keep up. I wouldn’t let you go now, my lad, not for a fi’ pun’ note. Deserter, that’s what you are!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And if your esteemed mamma {{will allow}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> my respects," [...] said Mr. Prong, [...] "I shall be most happy to {{accompany}} the ladies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, the Duke always wished <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{him some}} attention,' said Lord Henry, mildly. 'His family were so civil {{to us when}} we were at Manchester.' ...|$|E

60|$|Eugène {{scowled at}} me, and from <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Andrea. <b>To</b> <b>pay</b> {{him for that}} scowl, I had it in my mind to stay; but, {{overcoming}} the clownish thought, I took Andrea by the arm.|$|R

6000|$|... "Sorry, kid. That's it," [...] he said abruptly. [...] "She {{just gave}} me the money--told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> you off. You needn't bother to speak with her about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would allow}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for our board and lodging, of course?" [...] I {{answered}} interrogatively. [...] "Otherwise I mustn't trespass {{so far as}} that on your kind indulgence." ...|$|E
60|$|Abdal. My first {{acknowledgments}} {{to heaven}} are due; My next, Almanzor, let <b>me</b> <b>pay</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get me a flagon of beer, good Alwyn. I have drunk but {{water for}} the last twenty-four hours, and was in too great haste, to learn what was before <b>me,</b> even <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a visit <b>to</b> brother Anselm, the cellarer, who is a stanch friend of mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "It did {{not occur}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> miss, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> my respects <b>to</b> you, till Amelius and I had parted company," [...] he said.

Should I find you there later in the day?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, oh, Aunt Rebecca," [...] said Jane Lavinia tremulously. [...] "I can't go unless you'll help <b>me.</b> I'll have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for my {{lessons at}} the art school, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wager, Sire," [...] said I, [...] "is {{one that}} I take shame in having entered upon; that shame made <b>me</b> eager <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> it, {{although}} fully conscious that I had not lost. But even now, I cannot, in any case, accept the forfeit Chatellerault {{was willing to}} suffer. Shall we--shall we forget that the wager was ever laid?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Ralph said, apologetically; [...] "but {{father told}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> call, and <b>pay</b> {{him for some}} masses. My eldest sister was very ill, when we came away, and father worries about her.|$|R

5000|$|The show covers [...] "real topics" [...] with a {{sense of}} humor like Chelsea Does, with guest celebrities. Her comedic partner Chuy will not be a part of the series.
