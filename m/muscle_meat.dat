50|$|Some heterocyclic amines (HCAs) {{found in}} cooked and {{especially}} burned meat are known carcinogens. Research {{has shown that}} heterocyclic amine formation in meat occurs at high cooking temperatures. For example, heterocyclic amines are the carcinogenic chemicals formed from the cooking of <b>muscle</b> <b>meats</b> such as beef, pork, fowl, and fish. HCAs form when amino acids and creatine (a chemical found in muscles) react at high cooking temperatures. Researchers have identified 17 different HCAs resulting from the cooking of <b>muscle</b> <b>meats</b> that may pose human cancer risk. The United States National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics found a link between individuals with stomach cancer and the consumption of cooked meat, and other studies for colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer is associated with high intakes of well-done, fried, or barbecued meats. People who eat medium-well or well-done beef were {{more than three times}} as likely to suffer stomach cancer as those who ate rare or medium-rare beef. Other sources of protein (milk, eggs, tofu, and organ meats such as liver) have very little or no HCA content naturally or when cooked.|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} {{connective}} tissue research in meat science {{has been conducted}} on the properties of intramuscular connective tissue of meat. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate histological properties of intramuscular connective tissues of left and right Quadriceps femoris <b>muscle</b> (as red <b>meat)</b> and Pectoralis superficialis <b>muscles</b> (as white <b>meat)</b> in the native chickens and the influence of sex on these properties. A total of 40 adult healthy native chickens (56 days) of both sexes (20 female and 20 male) were used. After fixation in 10 % buffered formalin solution, sections were prepared, using routine histological techniques. Tissue samples were stained by hematoxylin eosin and a variety of special techniques for determination of types of connective tissue fibers. The conventional histological study revealed that except the endomysium which was similar in both muscles, the other intramuscular connective tissues layers varied between leg and breast muscles and affected by sex. All the connective tissue fibers observed in the all intramuscular connective tissues of both red and white meats. Tenderness in the leg muscle was higher than the breast muscle in native chickens, as well as in males than females.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} the main structural and biochemical changes of muscles during post-mortem process implicated with meat tenderness. Taking into account complexity of biochemical and structural changes in <b>muscles,</b> <b>meat</b> tenderness is associated with the amount and quality of connective tissue, intramuscular lipid content (marbling), sarcomere length, and myofibrillar protein degradation. In short, more tender meat is associated with lower connective tissue content, higher collagen solubility, greater intramuscular lipid content, longer sarcomeres and greater myofibrillar protein degradation. However, it must be considered that the interactions among the listed factors are complex and dependent on numerous processes during post-mortem such as chilling regime, electrical stimulation, carcass suspension, aging, mechanical tenderization, different marinades, and thermal processing conditions...|$|R
5000|$|PhIP (2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} heterocyclic amines (HCAs) in cooked meat. PhIP is formed at high temperatures from the reaction between creatine or creatinine (found in <b>muscle</b> <b>meats),</b> amino acids, and sugar.

40|$|Lean finely {{textured}} pork (LFTP) is {{a low-fat}} protein source produced from fresh pork fatty trimmings. LFTP has similar protein and fat contents as lean meat, but is more economical for processed meat formulations. In order to recommend best utilization of this inexpensive meat ingredient, we studied the protein composition and functionality of LFTP. The protein composition of LFTP {{was different from}} that of <b>muscle</b> <b>meats,</b> containing more connective tissue proteins and less functional proteins. Difference in gelation characteristics of the proteins were shown to result in a soft texture and lower yield when used in frankfurters at 50 % of the formulation. Addition of tripolyphosphate, kappa-carrageenan or isolated soy protein improved product stability. The softness produced by LFTP could be an advantage in very low-fat meat products where toughness and firmness are often a problem. The successful use of LFTP could improve economic returns to swine producers and reduce the cost of processed meat products to consumer...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{removing}} adductor <b>muscles</b> (<b>meat)</b> through manual shucking of Iceland scallops and sea scallops at sea results in loss of meat {{yield to the}} fishing industry. In the study of Iceland scallops, this loss was negatively correlated with shell size and decreased from about 30 % at 60 mm (shell height) to 11 % at 90 mm, with an average loss of 23 %. Meat recovery was somewhat more efficient from sea scallops, but paradoxically the loss in yield increased slightly with shell size from 8 % at 60 mm to 10 % at 90 mm. The average loss for commercial-sized sea scallops (~ 100 mm) {{was estimated to be}} 11 %. In addition to such factors as experience, speed and shucking habits of the fishermen, relative efficiency of meat extraction from the shells of the two species appears to be related to shell size, tenacity of shell closure and shell morphology (curvature) ...|$|R

40|$|Antioxidant {{peptides}} {{are gradually}} being accepted as food ingredients, supplemented in functional food and nutraceuticals, to positively regulate oxidative {{stress in the}} human body against lipid and protein oxidation. <b>Meat</b> <b>muscle</b> and <b>meat</b> by-products are rich sources of proteins and can be regarded as good materials for the production of bioactive peptides by use of enzymatic hydrolysis or direct solvent extraction. In recent years, there has been a growing number of studies conducted to characterize antioxidant peptides or hydrolysates derived from <b>meat</b> <b>muscle</b> and by-products as well as processed meat products, including dry-cured hams. Antioxidant peptides obtained from animal sources could exert not only nutritional value but also bioavailability to benefit human health.

We focus on the procedure for the generation of peptides with antioxidant capacity including the acquisition of crude peptides, the assessment of antioxidant activity, and the purification and identification of the active fraction. It remains critical to perform validation experiments with a cell model, animal model or clinical trial to eliminate safety concerns before final application in the food system. In addition, some of the common characteristics on structure-activity relationship are also reviewed based on the identified antioxidant peptides...|$|R
50|$|Goat breeders' clubs {{frequently}} hold shows, where goats {{are judged}} on traits relating to conformation, udder quality, evidence of high production, longevity, build and <b>muscling</b> (<b>meat</b> goats and pet goats) and fiber {{production and the}} fiber itself (fiber goats).

However, the accuracy of his analysis has been since called into question, as the Inuit diet has not been shown to be a ketogenic diet and roughly 15-20% of its calories are from carbohydrates, largely from the glycogen found in the raw meats. Stefansson and a friend later volunteered for a one-year experiment at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City to prove he could thrive on a diet of nothing but meat, meat fat, and internal organs of animals. [...] His progress was closely monitored and experiments were done on his health throughout the year. At the end of the year, he did not show any symptoms of ill health; he did not develop scurvy, which many scientists had expected to manifest itself only a few months into the diet {{due to the lack of}} vitamin C in <b>muscle</b> <b>meat.</b> However, Stefansson and his partner did not eat just <b>muscle</b> <b>meat</b> but also fat, raw brain, raw liver (a significant source of vitamin C and others), and other varieties of offal.
