It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could <b>multiply</b> two numbers automatically.|$|E

Booth's algorithm can be reduced by half using booth recoding. But in the hybrid multiplication technique, the partial products can still be reduced which in turn reduces the switching activity and power consumption.
