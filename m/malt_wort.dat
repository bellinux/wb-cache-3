50|$|In the {{production}} of baker's yeast from <b>malt</b> <b>wort</b> or molasses it has been recognized since early 1900s that ethanol is produced even {{in the presence of}} sufficient dissolved oxygen (DO) if an excess of sugar is present in the culture liquid. Ethanol is a main cause of low cell yield. Aerobic ethanol formation in the presence of glucose concentration is known as glucose effect or Crabtree effect. To reduce this effect, a fed-batch process is generally employed for baker's yeast production. In aerobic cultures of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, organic acids such as acetic acid, (and in lesser amounts, lactic acid and formic acid), are produced as byproducts when sugar concentration is high, and these acids inhibit cell growth as well as show deteriorating effect on the metabolic activities. The formation of these acids are called bacterial Crabtree effects.|$|E

The effect on wort phenols {{of two different}} wort separation technologies, a mash filter (Meura 2001) and a lauter tun (Steinecker FVAS 26), were also investigated. The results obtained showed that total phenols are lower in maize-adjunct, than in all-malt worts (542 mg/L and 730 mg/L, respectively), and that non tannins are the main phenolic components: 91 % of the total in all-malt and 82 % in maize-adjunct worts, respectively. The overall brewing process reduces the initial content of total phenols by 50 %, and the highest reduction is on tannins and flavonoids. After the brewing process, total phenols in beer were 336. 5 mg/L in all-malt and 280 mg/L in maize adjunct. In moderate drinkers they contribute to 10 – 20 % of the total phenolic daily intake accounting for around 4 – 8 % of the total antioxidant capacity of the diet. As regards the influence of lauter tun and mash filter on phenols, our results showed their great depletion when using lauter tun, and suggested that the brewing process may be adapted in order to overcome the high impact of lauter tun on phenols...|$|R

40|$|Hydrolysis {{of barley}} {{proteins}} into peptides and amino acids {{is one of}} the most important processes during barley germination. The degradation of the endosperm stored proteins facilitates water and enzyme movements, enhances modification, liberates starch granules and increases soluble amino nitrogen. Protease activity is the result of the activities of a mixture of exo- and endo-proteases. The barley proteins are initially solubilized by endo-proteases and the further by exo-proteases. Four classes of endo-proteases have been described: serine-proteases, cysteine-proteases, aspartic-proteases and metallo-proteases. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and colorimetric enzymatic assay to determine the endo-proteolytic activity of the four endo-protease classes using two different substrates: azo-gelatin and azo-casein. Optimum conditions for the assays such as: pH,reaction time and temperature and absorbance scale were determined. Azo-gelatin presented several difficulties in standardizing an “in solution” assay.

40|$|Most breweries collect yeast from a {{previous}} fermentation cycle for further use in a subsequent cycle. However, the cropped cells are deficient in membrane sterols and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) which are required for good fermentation performance in the next cycle. Consequently, the cellular levels of these compounds must be restored to obtain an optimal fermentation performance. There are currently three possibilities to satisfy this requirement. The common practice is aeration of the wort before pitching, thus providing oxygen needed for lipid synthesis during the first stages of fermentation. Oxygenation (aeration) of cropped yeast slurries is a second alternative. Finally, {{the addition of the}} required lipids to wort is sometimes suggested as an alternative to aeration. We examined a fourth possibility, namely the supplementation with UFA of cropped cells. Previously, we reported that the supplementation of stationary phase cropped brewer's yeast with linoleic acid is a good alternative to wort aeration. This conclusion resulted from results obtained with a well-defined stir-red synthetic fermentation medium. We also showed that cells cropped from non-stirred tall-tube fermented <b>malt</b> <b>wort</b> incorporated linoleic acid into different cellular lipid fractions, when suspended and supplemented in fermented wort. Now, we report that such yeast, pitched in <b>malt</b> <b>wort</b> in non-stirred tall-tubes, showed growth and attenuation profiles comparable to unsupplemented yeast in pre-aerated wort. Moreover, the synthesis of acetate esters, which is known to be affected when UFAs are added directly to the wort, was not significantly affected. We hypothesize that the active uptake of linoleic acid during fermentation and its activation by coenzyme A (CoA) and phospholipid synthesis are responsible for the effects on ester synthesis, through repression of the alcohol acetyltransferase-encoding gene, ATF 1. In supplemented cropped yeast, these reactions occur prior to fermentation, thus avoiding interferences with acetate ester synthesis. In serial repitching experiments with repeated linoleic acid supplementation of the cropped yeast, the fermentation performances of the yeast remained comparable to those of non-supplemented yeast in pre-aerated wort. However, due to a progressive increase of cellular UFA, negative effects on acetate ester synthesis appeared. Nevertheless, the supplementation of cropped yeast with UFAs can be considered as an interesting alternative to wort oxygenation to restore optimal membrane functions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The most {{sensitive}} and time-consuming technological step of beer production is the fermentation of wort. Problems during fermentation {{will not only}} prolong production time but {{it will lead to}} the deterioration of beer quality. Most often it is due to low zinc concentration of the wort or the yeast. Due to lack of zinc the fermentation lasts longer, composition of fermentation by-products changes, maltose intake slows down, sedimentation ability and heat sensitivity of the yeast increase. In Part I of our work, the factors affecting the degree of zinc supply of wort were examined. During the examination of zinc supply of wort two kinds of beer were produced: all-malt beer and beer with adjunct. Change of zinc concentration was followed throughout the brewing process at every technological step.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Sorghum types {{suitable}} for brewing and bioethanol production are required. The effect of sorghum type (white non-tannin versus white type II tannin) on {{free amino nitrogen}} (FAN) production from sorghum grain and malt using exogenous protease enzymes was investigated over extended incubation at moderate temperature (45 oC). RESULTS : With grain {{in the absence of}} exogenous proteases, white non-tannin sorghum produced substantially higher levels of FAN than white type II tannin sorghum, due to the tannins in the latter. Incubating sorghum grain with neutral proteinase and amino-peptidase in combination, improved FAN production. The two sorghum types produced similar FAN levels when malted and incubated {{in the absence of the}} exogenous proteases. When both sorghums were malted and incubated with neutral proteinase alone substantially more FAN yield (124 - 126 mg 100 g- 1) occurred than with grains (61 - 84 mg 100 g- 1). The combination of amino-peptidase and proteinase did not improve further. Neither, did <b>malting</b> influence <b>wort</b> free amino acid profile. Group B amino acids constituted the highest percentage (42 - 47 %).

The results have shown that zinc accumulation by wine yeast was very rapid with all zinc being removed from the medium by yeast cells within the fi rst two hours. Zinc uptake was stimulated by the presence of sucrose. Zinc affected fermentation progress at defi ned levels, with optimal concentrations at 1. 5 – 2. 5 ppm, depending on yeast strain and zinc bioavailability. The bioavailability of metal ions in grape must and the roles of metals in wine yeast physiology are aspects poorly understood by enologists. In brewing, it has long been recognized that <b>malt</b> <b>wort</b> may be zinc defi cient and brewers often carry out zinc supplementations to avoid sluggish and incomplete fermentations. In winemaking, zinc levels in grape musts may be compromised depending on the bioavailability of zinc ions in vineyard soils as well as treatments with fertilizers and fungicides during grape growing.

To assess the effects of trial year and location on quality evaluation data, a data base consisting of quality data from Dutch malting and brewing trials of new malting barley varieties during the period 1989 - 1995 was analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. It was also determined which parameters gave little or no discrimination among varieties over the years. The analysis showed that strong annual effects occurred over the period observed. A considerable list of 23 analytical parameters from barley, <b>malt,</b> <b>wort,</b> and beer analysis were relevant to explain 50 % {{of the variance in}} the data set. Seven parameters showed hardly any variation and possessed no discriminative value. This indicated that the number of parameters could be diminished to some extent without losing resolving power with respect to quality evaluation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{germination}} {{time and temperature}} {{on the quality of}} rye <b>malt</b> and <b>worts</b> derived thereof were investigated using Response Surface Methodology. Amylolytic and proteolytic enzyme activities were increased by long germination periods, while beta-glucanase activity was not influenced. Total and Soluble Nitrogen content were also not significantly affected by the variations in germination conditions. Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN) was found in higher amounts in worts prepared from rye malts with long germination times. Extract contents were higher in rye malt than in the control barley malt and could be increased by a favourable germination regime, while no such impact on wort fermentability was found. High wort viscosities could be significantly reduced by a long germination period at low temperatures, but were still unacceptably high. The same conditions favoured the development of endoxylanase activity. Arabinoxylan (AX) accumulated during the germination process and their extractability increased. The results suggest that longer germination periods resulted in an increased number of AX molecules with lower molecular mass. Optimal rye malt qualities within the limits of this study were found for a germination time of 144 h at 10 degrees C, which resulted in an acceptable FAN content and the lowest measured viscosity.

High and positive correlations were found between myristic acid and HWE (r = 0. 71) and between stearic acid and AAL (r = 0. 76), with intermediate correlations between palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids and AAL (r = > 0. 50) in grain. High and negative correlations were found between stearic acid and HWE (r = – 0. 66), and high and negative correlations were found between palmitic (r = – 0. 74) and linoleic (r = - 0. 60) acids and AAL in the wort. Results from this study showed that lipids, as well as the combination of unsaturated and saturated FA, might play a role in determining differences in HWE and AAL between the barley varieties analyzed. No clear evidence on HWE was observed when grain and malt samples from the same variety were compared.

40|$|The {{development}} of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16 S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were {{largely responsible for the}} final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required <b>malt</b> <b>wort</b> for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS.

40|$|Seven {{strains of}} Lactobacillus {{isolated}} from malt whisky fermentations and representing Lactobacillus brevis, L. crispatus, L. fermentum, L. hilgardii, L. paracasei, L. pentosus, and L. plantarum contained genes for hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid) decarboxylase. With {{the exception of}} L. hilgardii, these bacteria decarboxylated p-coumaric acid and/or ferulic acid, with the production of 4 -vinylphenol and/or 4 -vinylguaiacol, respectively, although the relative activities on the two substrates varied between strains. The addition of p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid to cultures of L. pentosus in MRS broth induced hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mRNA within 5 min, and the gene was also induced by the indigenous components of <b>malt</b> <b>wort.</b> In a simulated distillery fermentation, a mixed culture of L. crispatus and L. pentosus {{in the presence of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae decarboxylated added p-coumaric acid more rapidly than the yeast alone but had little activity on added ferulic acid. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate the induction of hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mRNA under these conditions. However, in fermentations with no additional hydroxycinnamic acid, the bacteria lowered the final concentration of 4 -vinylphenol in the fermented wort compared to the level seen in a pure-yeast fermentation. It seems likely that the combined activities of bacteria and yeast decarboxylate p-coumaric acid and then reduce 4 -vinylphenol to 4 -ethylphenol more effectively than either microorganism alone in pure cultures. Although we have shown that lactobacilli participate in the metabolism of phenolic compounds during malt whisky fermentations, the net result is a reduction in the concentrations of 4 -vinylphenol and 4 -vinylguaiacol prior to distillation...|$|E
40|$|New {{fumigants}} {{are needed}} to control grain insects because methyl bromide is being phased out as an ozone-depleting substance under the Montreal Protocol and because resistance to phosphine is increasing. Alternative fumigants also provide one strategy to manage resistance. To assess the effect of candidate fumigants on barley quality, malting and brewing trials were conducted with malting barley (Schooner), 9. 4 % moisture content, fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS), ethyl formate (EF) and carbon disulphide (CS 2) at concentrations of 20, 90 and 36 mg/L respectively for 7 days at 20 °C in riveted steel silos containing 33 t of barley. The appropriate industry body, the Malting and Brewing Industry Barley Technical Committee (MBIBTC) set the quality parameters to be evaluated and allocated work to the appropriate quality laboratories. Germination of fumigated barley was not affected by the fumigants. Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in outloading barley samples were 0. 085 ± 0. 0052, 0. 4 ± 0. 1 and 2. 22 ± 0. 07 mg/kg respectively, which were below the experimental permits of maximum residue levels (MRL). Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in <b>malt,</b> <b>wort</b> and beer were indistinguishable from those in unfumigated (or non-fumigated) barley. Ethyl formate and CS 2 affected wort in increasing the apparent attenuation limit (AAL) and CS 2 affected barley colour. Sulphur volatiles in the trial beer made from EF and CS 2 (unlike COS) fumigated barley decreased significantly. Beer from COS, EF and CS 2 fumigated barley had a somewhat higher 24 -hour chill haze level (0. 62 – 0. 84) than beer from the untreated barley (0. 53). The total alcohols and isoamyl acetate increased in beer made from EF fumigated barley. Carbonyl sulphide, EF and CS 2, however, {{had no effect on}} beer flavour or quality...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{were taken}} {{at each stage}} of brewing (<b>malt,</b> milling, mashing, <b>wort</b> separation, hop addition, boiling, whirlpool, dilution, fermentation, warm rest, chill-lagering, beer filtration, {{carbonation}} and bottling, pasteurization, and storage). The level of antioxidant activity of unfractionated, low-molecular-mass (LMM) and high-molecular-mass (HMM) fractions {{was measured by the}} 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfortic acid) radical cation (ABTS(. +)) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) procedures. Polyphenol levels were assessed by HPLC. The LMM fraction (0. 001) in catechin and ferulic acid levels. Increases in antioxidant activity levels were observed after mashing, boiling, fermentation, chill-lagering, and pasteurization, in line with previous studies on lager. Additionally, increases in the level of antioxidant activity occurred after wort separation and carbonation and bottling and were accompanied by increases in levels of most monitored polyphenols. Data from the ABTS(. -) and FRAP assays indicated that the compounds contributing to the levels of antioxidant activity responded differently in the two procedures. Levels of ferulic, vanillic, and chlorogenic acids and catechin accounted for 45 - 61 % of the variation in antioxidant activity levels...|$|R
40|$|Antifungal {{compounds}} {{produced by}} Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) metabolites can be natural and reliable alternative for reducing fungal infections pre- and post-harvest with {{a multitude of}} additional advantages for cereal-base products. Toxigenic and spoilage fungi are responsible for numerous diseases and economic losses. This thesis includes {{an overview of the}} impact fungi have on aspects of the cereal food chain. The applicability of LAB in plant protection and cereal industry is discussed in detail. Specific case studies include Fusarium head blight, and the impact of fungi in the malting and baking industry. The impact of Fusarium culmorum infected raw barley on the final malt quality was part of the investigation. In vitro infected barley grains were fully characterized. The study showed that the germinative energy of infected barley grains decreased by 45 % and grains accumulated 199 μg. kg- 1 of deoxynivalenol (DON). Barley grains were subsequently malted and fully characterized. Fungal biomass increased during all stages of malting. Infected malt accumulated 8 -times its DON concentration during malting. Infected malt grains revealed extreme structural changes due to proteolytic, (hemi) -cellulolytic and starch degrading activity of the fungi, this led to increased friability and fragmentation. Infected grains also had higher protease and β-glucanase activities, lower amylase activity, a greater proportion of free amino and soluble nitrogen, and a lower β-glucan content. Malt loss was over 27 % higher in infected malt when compared to the control. The protein compositional changes and respective enzymatic activity of infected barley and respective malt were characterized using a wide range of methods. F. culmorum infected barley grains showed an increase in proteolytic activity and protein extractability. Several metabolic proteins decreased and increased at different rates during infection and malting, showing a complex F. culmorum infection interdependence. In vitro F. culmorum infected malt was used to produce lager beer to investigate changes caused by the fungi during the brewing processes and their effect on beer quality attributes. It was found, that the <b>wort</b> containing infected <b>malt</b> had a lower pH, a higher FAN, higher β-glucan and a 45 % increase in the purging rate, and led to premature yeast flocculation. The beer produced with infected malt (IB) had also a significantly different amino acid profile. IB flavour characterization revealed a higher concentration of esters, fusel alcohols, fatty acids, ketones, and dimethylsulfide, and in particular, acetaldehyde, when compared to the control. IB had a greater proportion of Strecker aldehydes and Maillard products contributing to an increased beer staling character. IB resulted in a 67 % darker colour with a trend to better foam stability. It was also found that 78 % of the accumulated mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in the malt was transferred into beer. A LAB cell-freesupernatant (cfs), produced in wort-base substrate, was investigated for its ability to inhibit Fusarium growth during <b>malting.</b> <b>Wort</b> was a suitable substrate for LAB exhibiting antifungal activity. Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 inhibited 104 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 120 h of fermentation, while Lactobacillus reuteri R 29 inhibited 105 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 48 h of fermentation. Both LAB cfs had significant different organic acid profiles. Acid-base antifungal compounds were identified and, phenyllactic, hydroxy-phenyllactic, and benzoic acids were present in higher concentrations when compared to the control. A 3 °P wort substrate inoculated With L. reuteri R 29 (cfs) was applied in malting and successfully inhibited Fusarium growth by 23 %, and mycotoxin DON by 80 %. Malt attributes resulted in highly modified grains, lower pH, higher colouration, and higher extract yield. The implementation of selected LAB producing antifungal compounds can be used successfully in the malting process to reduce mould growth and mycotoxin production...|$|R
2500|$|With {{the coming}} of war in 1793, the need to {{eliminate}} scurvy acquired a new urgency. But the first initiative came not from the medical establishment but from the admirals. Ordered to lead an expedition against Mauritius, Rear Admiral Gardner was uninterested in the <b>wort,</b> <b>malt</b> and elixir of vitriol which were still being issued to ships of the Royal Navy, and demanded that he be supplied with lemons, to counteract scurvy on the voyage. [...] Members of the Sick and Hurt Board, recently augmented by two practical naval surgeons, supported the request, and the Admiralty ordered that it be done. [...] There was, however, a last minute change of plan. The expedition against Mauritius was cancelled. [...] On 2 May 1794, only HMS Suffolk and two sloops under Commodore Peter Rainier sailed for the east with an outward bound convoy, but the warships were fully supplied with lemon juice and the sugar with which {{it had to be}} mixed. Then in March 1795, came astonishing news. Suffolk had arrived in India after a four-month voyage without a trace of scurvy and with a crew that was healthier than when it set out.|$|R
