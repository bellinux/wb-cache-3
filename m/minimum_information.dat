5|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>information</b> {{produced}} from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E

40|$|Repayment decisions—how much of {{the loan}} to repay and when to make the payments—directly {{influence}} consumer debt levels. The authors examine how minimum required payment policy and loan information disclosed to consumers influence repayment decisions. They find that though presenting <b>minimum</b> required payment <b>information</b> has {{a negative impact on}} repayment decisions, increasing the minimum required level has a positive effect on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U. S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U. K. credit card field data indicates that these effects are also moderated by borrowers’ credit limit and balance due. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting <b>minimum</b> payment <b>information.</b> In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including <b>minimum</b> payment <b>information</b> and has no substantial positive effect on repayments.

Results indicate that interference degrades the capacity by increasing the required <b>minimum</b> energy per <b>information</b> bit and reducing the wideband slope.
