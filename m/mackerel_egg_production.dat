40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of our study}} were to propose a new definition for persistency of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> {{and to develop a}} mathematical model to describe the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curve, one that includes a new measure for persistency, based on the proposed definition, for use as a selection criterion to improve total <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Persistency of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> is an important determining factor for total <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Hens with the same total production, however, can exhibit different <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curves because of differences in persistency. We propose a new definition for persistency of egg production: the number of weeks during which a level of constant production is maintained. No <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> model exists that includes a measure of persistency in terms of duration of time or that allows this measure of persistency to be derived from model parameters. It was necessary, therefore, to develop a new model to describe an <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curve for a flock: Please see model within the full paper, due to the limits of computer coding. and for an individual: where yt = <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> at time t, t 1 and t 2 = times at transition, r = duration of transition, yP = level of constant production, b 4 = rate of decline in production, and P = persistency of constant production. These parameters measure directly the important biological characteristics of an <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> curve. To illustrate the model, six data sets were used: two from flocks (one pullet flock and one hen flock) and four from two pairs of individuals. The proposed definition of persistency should be important for genetic selection because it might be desirable to select for increased persistency. The novel approach to the definition and measure of persistency presented here should provide {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between the new measure of persistency and other characteristics of <b>egg</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R

The objectives were: i) to validate whether BS is cold tolerant and whether <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> and cold tolerance of crossbreds could be improved; and ii) to determine the physiological characteristics that underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance in cold environments. Methods A total of 916 chickens were reared in warm and natural cold environments (daily mean ambient temperature varied from 7. 4 °C to 26. 5 °C in the warm environment and from − 17. 5 °C to 27. 0 °C in the cold environment). To investigate their adaptability to the cold environment, the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance and body weight were monitored and compared between breeds and environments. The cloacal temperature and serum biochemical parameters were monitored to reveal the physiological characteristics underlie cold tolerance and favorable <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance in the cold environment. Results The warm environment experiment showed that RIR had the highest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance, and that the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance than BS. While in the cold environment RIR had the lowest <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance, and the reciprocal crossbreds had a higher <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance than BS. In the cold environment BS and reciprocal crossbreds had higher triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine levels than RIR. At 35 and 39 wk of age, when the ambient temperature was extremely low (varied from − 20 °C to 0 °C), serum glucose, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol of BS and crossbreds were higher than RIR. Conclusion Bashang Long-tail chicken has a favorable cold tolerance ability. Crossbreeding with RIR and BS is {{an effective way to}} develop cold tolerant chickens with improved <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} aimed to improve <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> by decreasing the intersequence pause days between the sequences of egg lay in girirani birds through chemical control of prolactin by using bromocriptine (an anti prolactin chemical) through feed. At 12 weeks of age, forty two girirani birds were randomly divided into control (n= 21) and treated (n= 21) groups. Birds in the treated group were fed bromocriptine through feed @ 350 µg/bird/day from 17 - 36 weeks of age and controls were fed the same ration without bromocriptine. Birds fed with bromocriptine through feed significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced the prolactin concentration compared to control birds. Estradiol and progesterone were quantified in both the groups. Treated birds showed higher (P< 0. 01) concentration of estradiol and progesterone concentration from 19 th to 72 weeks of age with intermittent fluctuations. <b>Egg</b> <b>production,</b> pause days, and hormonal parameters were correlated between the two groups. Prolactin is negatively correlated with <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> (r =- 0. 89), estradiol (r =- 0. 59) and progesterone (r =- 0. 37) hormones and positively correlated with inter sequence pause days with concomitant decrease in <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> Birds fed bromocriptine through feed showed significantly (P< 0. 01) less pause days and more <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The results of this study showed that, controlling the prolactin secretion by chemical means resulted in 5. 12 % increase in <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> over control birds, further such an approach is more promising, practicable, economical without any traces of chemical in meat, egg and blood to improve <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in backyard poultry farming. It is concluded that chemical control of prolactin plays a major role on pauses days, prolactin secretion and <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in native breed of birds. Key words: Chemical control of prolactin secretion; steroid hormones, <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in girirani bird...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{described}} and analysed changes {{in the numbers of}} large ovarian follicles (diameter 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm) and in the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol- 17 beta (E 2 beta) in relation to individual <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> figures of farmed ostriches (Struthio camelus spp.) throughout one year. Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling for plasma hormone analysis were performed in 9 hens on a monthly basis during the breeding season and in two periods of the non-breeding season. Our data demonstrated that: (1) large follicles were detected and LH concentrations were elevated already 1 month before first ovipositions of the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season took place; (2) E- 2 beta concentrations increased as soon as the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season started; (3) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations were elevated during the entire <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season; and that (4) numbers of large follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations decreased simultaneous with or following the last ovipositions of the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season. By comparing these parameters during the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season with their pre-and post-seasonal values, significant differences were found in the numbers of large follicles and E- 2 beta concentrations between the pre-seasonal, seasonal and post-seasonal period; while LH concentrations were significantly different between the seasonal and post-seasonal period. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that changes in numbers of large follicles and in concentrations of LH and E- 2 beta closely parallel individual <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> figures and provide some new cues that <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> in ostriches is confined to a marked reproductive season. Moreover, our data provide indications that mechanism, initiating, maintaining and terminating the <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> season in farmed breeding ostriches are quite similar to those already known for other seasonal breeding bird species.
