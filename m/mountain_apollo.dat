40|$|Spatial {{population}} theory predicts that synchrony in {{the dynamics of}} local populations should decrease as dispersal among populations decreases. Thus, it would be expected that the extinction of local populations and the attendant loss of immigrants to surrounding populations would reduce synchrony. We tested this hypothesis through a large-scale experiment, simulation of the experimental system and general models. Experimental removal of two adjacent subpopulations of the Rocky <b>Mountain</b> <b>Apollo</b> butterfly, Parnassius smintheus within a network consisting of 15 other local populations resulted in a decrease in immigration to surrounding populations that was proportional to their connectivity to the removal populations. These populations also showed {{a significant increase in}} synchrony during population removal. The spatial extent of the synchrony showed good agreement with the predicted loss of immigrants owing to the removals. Simulation of the Parnassius system showed a similar short-term result and also indicated that permanent loss of populations produces structural changes increasing synchrony. General models indicate that an increase in synchrony following extinction occurs when populations undergoing extinction have different carrying capacities than surrounding populations. The result is not owing to biased migration per se, but rather is {{because of the number of}} immigrants relative to the carrying capacity. Synchrony following extinction should be most common for patchy populations, but can occur in any situation where carrying capacities differ. Overall, our results indicate that local extinction can create a positive feedback for extinction risk, increasing the probability of extinction for population networks by synchronizing their dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change has}} been {{attributed}} as a driver of changes to ecological systems worldwide and understanding the {{effects of climate change}} at individual, population, community, and ecosystem levels has become a primary concern of ecology. One avenue toward understanding the impacts of climate change on an ecosystem is through the study of environmentally sensitive species. Butterflies are sensitive to climatic changes due to their reliance on environmental cues such as temperature and photoperiod, which regulate the completion of life history stages. As such, the population dynamics of butterflies may offer insight into the impacts of climate change on the health of an ecosystem. In this paper we study the effects of rearing temperature on the alpine butterfly Parnassius smintheus (Rocky <b>Mountain</b> <b>Apollo),</b> both directly through individual phenological changes and indirectly through adult reproductive success at the population level. Our approach is to formulate a mathematical model of individual development parameterized by experimental data and link larval development to adult reproductive success. A Bernoulli process model describes temperature-dependent larval phenology, and a system of ordinary differential equations is used to study impacts on reproductive success. The phenological model takes field temperature data as its input and predicts a temporal distribution of adult emergence, which in turn controls the dynamics of the reproductive success model. We find that warmer spring and summer temperatures increase reproductive success, while cooler temperatures exacerbate a demographic Allee effect, suggesting that observed yearly fluctuations in P. smintheus population size may be driven by inter-annual temperature variability. Model predictions are validated against mark-recapture field data from 2001 and 2003 − 2009...|$|E
40|$|The {{well-developed}} {{systems of}} lineaments that suggest regional fracturing or layering of the bedrock in the <b>mountains</b> at the <b>Apollo</b> 15 site may be illusions created by oblique lighting rather than expressions of true geologic structure. Supporting evidence includes: (1) occurrence of similar dominant lineament trends {{on many of}} the slopes even though the slope orientations differ widely; (2) presence of a thick mantling regolith that should conceal bedrock structures; (3) approximate symmetry of some of the lineament sets about the sun line; (4) lack of clear-cut topographic expression for many of the lineaments; and (5) general similarity of the lunar lineaments to lineament patterns produced by low oblique lighting on model surfaces mantled by fine sifted powder. Locally, as at Silver Spur, some lineament trends are related to distinct topographic features and are more confidently interpreted to reflect underlying geologic structures...|$|R
40|$|In {{an ancient}} story told by Ovid in the Metamorphoses, the Phrygian king Midas, freshly {{released}} from his famous golden touch, retreats {{to the hills}} and becomes a devotee of the rustic god Pan. Enjoying the acclaim of the nymphs and of Midas for his piping, Pan challenges Apollo—another, much greater, god of the countryside—to a musical contest. The judge of the contest, the <b>mountain</b> Tmolus, declares <b>Apollo</b> the winner; but Midas disagrees, holding Pan to be the better musician. In anger, Apollo changes Midas’ ears into those of an ass. The argument {{of this study is}} that the myth of the Judgement of Midas was presented and encountered by Italians ca. 1520, in both literary and visual modes, reshaped and retold in ways that engaged with the broader contemporary discourse on musical judgement. In studying Renaissance treatments of the myth, we are also studying articulations of the operation of musical judgement, which can reveal important features of elite musical culture in Italy and the values in which it was founded. Ultimately, to study the Judgement of Midas in Italy ca. 1520 is to study musical taste and its construction through myth, as a component of the social ideology of elite culture...|$|R
40|$|Large impact basins {{are natural}} drill holes into the Moon, and their ejecta carries unique {{information}} about the rock types and stratigraphy of the lunar crust. We have conducted an electron microprobe study of mineral fragments in the poikilitic melt breccias collected from the Taurus <b>Mountains</b> at the <b>Apollo</b> 17 landing site. These breccias are virtually unanimously agreed to be impact melt produced in the Serenitatis impact event. They contain lithic fragments and much more abundant mineral fragments of crustal origin. We have made precise microprobe analyses of minor element abundances in fragments of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase to provide new information on the possible source rocks and the crustal stratigraphy in the Serenitatis region. These data were also intended to elucidate {{the nature of the}} cryptic geochemical component in breccias such as these with low-K Fra Mauro basalt compositions. We chose the finest-grained (i. e., most rapidly quenched) breccias for study, to avoid reacted and partly assimilated fragments as much as possible. Most of the mineral fragments appear to have been derived from rocks that would fall into the pristine igneous Mg-suite as represented by lithic fragments in the Apollo collection, or reasonable extensions of it. Gabbroic rocks were more abundant in the target stratigraphy than is apparent from the Apollo sample collection. Some pyroxene and plagiociase, but probably not much olivine, could be derived from feldspathic granulites, which are metamorphosed polymict breccias. Some mineral fragments are from previously unknown rocks. These include highly magnesian olivines (up to Fo(sub 94)), possibly volcanic in origin, that exacerbate the difficulty in explaining highly magnesian rocks in the lunar crust. It appears that some part of the lunar interior has an mg*(= 100 x Mg/(Mg/Fe) atomic) greater than the conventional bulk Moon value of 80 - 84. Other volcanic rocks, including mare basalts, and rapidly- cooled impact melt rocks do not contribute significantly to the fragment population. Nor do ferroan anorthosites contribute more than a tiny part of even the plagiociase fragment population. A few mineral fragments that are consistent with the cryptic low-K Fra Mauro chemical component were found, and these appear to be from gabbroic sources. The mineral fragment populations cannot be mixed in their observed proportions to produce the whole rock composition, because the fragments are more refractory and deficient in Ti, P, and alkalis. A preferential contribution to the melt from a rock similar to sodic ferrogabbro can partly resolve the discrepancy. The population of mineral fragments requires a very diverse population of igenous rocks that are not all related to each other, demonstrating the existence of a complex crust built of numerous separate igneous plutons. Many of these plutons may have crystallized at shallow depths. The chemical composition of the melt breccias, in combination with the mineral fragment data and an understanding of the cratering process, suggests that the deepest crust sampled by the Serenitatis impace (not necessarily the deepest crust) was basaltic in composition, including KREEP and gabbroic rocks like sodic ferrogabbro, and lacking abundant olivine-rich material. These were overlain by Mg-suite rocks of varied types, including norites and troctolites that supplied most of the olivine mineral fragments. Granulities, which are metamorphosed and more feldspathic breccias, were abundant near the surface. Remote sensing indicates that the entire Serenitatis region lacks ferroan anorthosite, consistent with the results of our study...|$|R
