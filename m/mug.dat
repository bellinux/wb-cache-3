5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee <b>mug,</b> since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E

After several incidents of private lessons that Thomas gave to female instructors of the Model <b>Mugging</b> program in his home led to allegations that he had acted inappropriately, the national board of Model <b>Mugging</b> instituted new rules prohibiting the practice.

5|$|Beer is {{consumed}} {{out of a}} variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a <b>mug,</b> a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer {{is consumed}} can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style. Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and <b>Mug</b> House.|$|E

40|$|The {{endowment}} effect, which predicts undertrading and a willingness-to-accept {{greater than}} willingness-to-pay, is studied using responses that remove all reference to buying or selling and focuses only on choice tasks.

5|$|While {{much of the}} {{construction}} in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. <b>Mug</b> House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mug</b> House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.|$|E

50|$|Cups and <b>mugs</b> may {{be adapted}} or bought {{to help with}} daily living. The most common assistive {{drinking}} utensil is the straw. This is inexpensive and allows for the user to not need {{to pick up the}} cup at all. The same principles for assistive dinnerware may also be utilized for <b>mugs</b> or cups. Non-slip bases are common so they do not slip on the table, while cup holders are used to prevent the cup from being knocked over. In case the cup gets knocked over, no spill lids may be used. Some cups are sold with lids, but there are also lids {{that can be used for}} several different types of cups and <b>mugs.</b> Weighted <b>mugs</b> are also common for the individual that suffers with tremors.|$|R
5000|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of those clay <b>mugs</b> was thick walls unfit for the mouth. The walls were thinned with development of metalworking techniques.
