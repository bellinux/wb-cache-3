The gravimetric and magnetic maps show {{a series of}} prominent positive anomalies, which in outcrops coincide with mafic Devonian–Dinantian volcanites.

In the area of Mundolsheim, a gravimetric and magnetic low, which is at least partly due to the deepening of the basement (Fig.  1 a), interrupts the volcano-sedimentary belt. Between Mundolsheim and Truchtersheim, the gravimetric low may indicate the presence of granite possibly covered by Permian layers. According to the very smooth bedding (Fig.  7), the low-to-intermediate magnetic anomalies have no sub-vertical contacts and are rather due to the presence of layered magnetic bodies consisting of volcanic or volcano-sedimentary strata overlying the granite.

40|$|International audienceChirality is an {{important}} element of biology, chemistry and physics. Once symmetry is broken and a handedness is established, biochemical pathways are set. In DNA, the double helix arises from the existence of two competing length scales, one set by the distance between monomers in the sugar backbone, and the other set by the stacking of the base pairs. Here we use a colloidal system to explore a simple forcing route to chiral structures. To do so we have designed magnetic colloids that, depending on both their shape and induced magnetization, self-assemble with controlled helicity. We model the two length scales with asymmetric colloidal dumbbells linked by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>belt</b> at their waist. In the presence of a magnetic field the belts assemble into a chain and the steric constraints imposed by the asymmetric spheres force the chain to coil. We show that if the size ratio between the spheres is large enough, a single helicity is adopted, right or left. The realization of chiral colloidal clusters opens up a new link between colloidal science and chemistry.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the solar/stellar {{activity}} cycles is presented, based on the mean-field concept in magnetohydrodynamics. A new approach to the formulation of the electromotive force {{as well as the}} theory of differential rotation and meridional circulation is described for use in dynamo theory. Activity cycles of dynamos in the overshoot layer (BL-dynamo) and distributed dynamos are compared, with the latter including the influence of meridional flow. The overshoot layer dynamo is able to reproduce the solar cycle periods and the butterfly diagram only if α = 0 in the convection zone. The problems of too many <b>magnetic</b> <b>belts</b> and too short cycle times emerge if the overshoot layer is too thin. The distributed dynamo including meridional flows with a magnetic Reynolds number Rm> ∼ 20 (low magnetic Prandtl number) reproduces the observed butterfly diagram even with a positive dynamo-α in the bulk of the convection zone. The nonlinear feedback of strong magnetic fields on differential rotation in the mean-field conservation law of angular momentum leads to grand minima in the cyclic activity similar to those observed. The 2 D model described here contains the large-scale interactions as well as the small-scale feedback of magnetic fields on differential rotation and induction in terms of a mean-field formulation (Λquenching, α-quenching). Grand minima may also occur if a dynamo occasionally falls below its critical eigenvalue. We expressed this idea by an on-off α function which is non-zero only in a certain range of magnetic fields near the equipartition value. We never found any indication that the dynamo collapses by this effect after it had once been excited.

30|$|The {{second and}} most {{prominent}} heat contribution {{is attributed to}} {{the composition of the}} upper crust, in particular to the elevated concentration of heat-producing elements (HPE) in Palaeozoic granitoids (Vilà et al. 2010). Already in the 1970 s, the magnetic surveys at the ground level of the graben between Strasbourg–Lahr and Wissembourg–Baden-Baden had shown a clear correlation of the magnetic anomalies with temperature anomalies in the Soultz and Eschau ridge areas (Edel et al. 1980). In the northern Vosges, Baden-Baden area, Odenwald and Spessart massifs, the geophysical investigations revealed that these strong magnetizations are related to arc magmatic granites, granodiorites, diorites and associated volcanites (Edel and Weber 1995) emplaced in the range 340 – 330  Ma above the southeast dipping subduction of the Rhenohercynian ocean (Krohe 1991; Oncken 1997; Altherr et al. 1999) (Figs.  1 b, 4). The 500 -km long, 80 -km wide <b>magnetic</b> <b>belt</b> consists of a succession of narrower kilometric anomalies. Three of such magnetic belts cross the Palaeozoic northern Vosges and continue towards the NE beneath the sedimentary cover of the Rhinegraben. Baillieux et al.

40|$|Matter accreting {{onto the}} {{magnetic}} poles of {{a neutron star}} spreads under gravity towards the magnetic equator, burying the polar magnetic field and compressing it into a narrow equatorial belt. Steady-state, Grad-Shafranov calculations with a self-consistent mass-flux distribution (and a semi-quantitative treatment of Ohmic diffusion) show that, for ≳ 10 ^- 5, the maximum field strength and latitudinal half-width of the equatorial <b>magnetic</b> <b>belt</b> are B_ max = 5. 6 × 10 ^ 15 (/ 10 ^- 4) ^ 0. 32 G and Δθ = [3 ^∘ (/ 10 ^- 4) ^- 1. 5, 3 ^∘ (/ 10 ^- 4) ^ 0. 5 (Ṁ_ a/ 10 ^- 8 yr^- 1) ^- 0. 5] respectively, where is the total accreted mass and Ṁ_ a is the accretion rate. It is shown that the belt prevents north-south heat transport by conduction, convection, radiation, and ageostrophic shear. This may explain why millisecond oscillations observed in the tails of thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts in low-mass X-ray binaries are highly sinusoidal: the thermonuclear flame is sequestered in the magnetic hemisphere which ignites first.

40|$|Abstract. The most {{conspicuous}} {{feature of the}} large-scale magnetic field in the Andromeda nebula (M 31) is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>belt</b> centred at a galacto-centric radius of about 10 kpc. We suggest a nonlinear dynamo model for M 31, which associates this belt with the gas density profile {{as well as with}} the kinematic parameters of M 31. Our model is based on the observed density profile and vertical structure of the gas disc of M 31, and on a recent rotation curve. The traditional explanation of the belt in kinematic dynamo theory was connected with a double-peaked form of the rotation curve of M 31. We show that this explanation fails with recent determinations of the rotation curve of M 31. Furthermore, it is unsatisfactory because it underestimates, even in the kinematic (linear) regime, the interplay of magnetic fields generated at different galacto-centric radii. Our model predicts an extended belt of magnetic field between 7 and 12 kpc radius, in accordance with observations. However, our models typically also have another maximum of the regular magnetic field between 2 and 6 kpcradius which is not obvious in the synchrotron emission. We discuss possible reasons why it could avoid detection if it is real, and suggest a search for the field in this region, e. g. via Faraday rotation of polarized radio sources behind M 31. A further generic feature of our models is that the scale height of the regular magnetic field is significantly larger than that of the gas, and has a steeper increase with galacto-centric radius. This can be important, e. g., for cosmic ray confinement and vertical gas balance.

While the dependence of the wave number with the largest growth rate on the magnetic field strength and the magnetic Prandtl number is small, the dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number Rm indicates that lowest azimuthal modes are excited for very high Rm. Upon varying the latitudinal position of the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>belts,</b> we find slightly lower stability limits for high latitudes, and very large stability limits at latitudes below 10 ◦, with little dependence on latitude in between.

30|$|The {{processed}} magnetic and gravimetric maps of {{this study}} are interpreted in terms of structural and lithological discontinuities of the pre-Permian basement. In addition to the global N 60 - 65 ° trend of the Palaeozoic structures observed in the northern Vosges, the tectonic network of the basement beneath the Mesozoic–Cenozoic cover is dominated by N 30 ° discontinuities, the effect of which is particularly visible on the truncation of the southern <b>magnetic</b> <b>belt</b> (Figs.  6, 7, 8, 9). The most important faults belong to the Upper-Rhine-Shear-Zone (URSZ), which shifts the Lalaye–Lubine fault zone by approximately 40  km northeastward, where it is relayed by the Baden-Baden fault zone (Edel and Fluck 1989; Edel et al. 2007). The sinistral URSZ that extends from the southeastern Vosges to the Mid-German Crystalline Rise was conjugated with the large-scale dextral faults of Bray and northern Bavaria (Edel and Weber 1995). The major N 30 ° URSZ faults mark the eastern limit of the northern Vosges western Rhinegraben magnetic plutonic belt. The NE–SW fabric of the Andlau, Soultz-sous-Forêts and Baden-Baden granites implies that the granitoids were emplaced in the sinistral transcurrent regime active approximately 330  Ma (Edel et al. 2006). The plutonic complex is also affected by a series of sub-meridian faults. The best example illustrated as well by the magnetic as by gravimetric maps is the “Bois d’Illkirch-Graffenstaden-Eschau” N–S oriented horst (Figs.  8, 9). N–S faults are also present all along the western border of the Rhinegraben, from Molsheim to Dambach. The tectono-magmatic context of the southern plutonic belt looks very {{similar to that of the}} Odenwald massif, which belongs to the same Rhenohercynian magmatic arc that coincides with the Mid-German Crystalline Rise (Edel and Schulmann 2009). There, the I-type granitoids were emplaced in a WSW–ENE sinistral transtensional regime and affected in a late stage by the N–S normal Otzberg fault (Krohe 1991, 1992). To a lesser extent, NNW–SSE and NW–SE discontinuities conjugated with the ENE–WSW and NW–SE discontinuities are also present in the basement. Such discontinuities were active as dextral strike-slip faults in the area of the Champ du Feu Massif (Figs.  4, 9).|$|E

JumpSat mission was proposed by ISAE in 2012. Their main objectives are both in-orbit technological demonstration and scientific research [1], through an elliptical Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The students are entirely involved in this mission, beyond both technological and scientific objectives, from the early stage to the disposal. ONERA, in Toulouse, is developing Dynagrad, a radiation sensor for trapped particles in the Earth’s <b>magnetic</b> <b>belts,</b> especially in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), to improve the current models of radiation and their accuracy. Space qualification for a low-cost Star Tracker is under development at ISAE-SUPAERO.

Another technological demonstration will accomplish a space qualification for the three-axis attitude control sub-system (AOCS) within the JumpSat mission. The acquired knowledge will help future CubeSatsAOCS sub-systems, while other components are COTS. Moreover, a consortium with Thales Alenia Space, LAAS and ISAE-SUPAERO designed NIPMH (Nanosatellite Investigate Microwave Photonic Hardware), an experimental payload based on opto-microwave technology. It would be embedded in a 3 U CubeSat for testing different components sensitivity to radiations in space, especially the optical fiber doped with erbium. Furthermore,due to the similarities among both missions, it was analyzed the possibility of the combination of both projects: NIMPH as an additional payload to JumpSat mission. It increases the mission duration up to a minimum of two years, with respect to French law for Space Operations (maximal mission duration: 25 years). This paper will focus on mechanical and thermal aspects that were completely redesigned for JumpSat to comply with all requirements of both missions. From that point comes out the idea of building the first 6 U CubeSat by ISAE-SUPAERO. As those studies are present in all design phases, they have important impact on the optimal architecture design within all the subsystems. Finally, temperatures gradients are such a great problem in space that it is even more important with strong radiation doses, like for this mission.

In addition, the occurrence of postsunset scintillations at all the stations is found to be conditional on their prior occurrence at the equatorial station. If no postsunset scintillation activity is seen at the equatorial station, no scintillations are seen at other stations also. The occurrence of scintillations is explained as caused by rising plasma bubbles and associated irregularities over the magnetic equator and the subsequent mapping of these irregularities down the magnetic field lines to the F region of higher latitudes through some instantaneous mechanism; and hence an equatorial control is established on the generation of postsunset scintillation-producing irregularities in the entire low-latitude belt...|$|R

Such time scales get well separated for strong magnetic fields, so that Nekhoroshev-Neishtadt perturbation methods can be applied. As a result, one finds that the system admits two adiabatic invariants (namely, the magnetic moment and a second quantity, related to the energy of the motion along the field lines), which turn out to be preserved for time scales growing exponentially with the field intensity.

In the present paper the main attention is focused on i) the parity of the solution, ii) the form of the butterfly diagram and iii) the phase relation of the resulting field components. If the helioseismologically derived internal solar rotation law is considered, a model without meridional flow of high magnetic Reynolds number (corresponding to low eddy diffusivity) fails in all the three issues in comparison with the observations.

We have {{developed}} a high-precision code which solves the kinematic dynamo problem both for given rotation law and meridional flow {{in the case of}} a low eddy diffusivity of the order of 10 11 cm 2 /s known from the sunspot decay. All our models work with an α-effect which is positive (negative) in the northern (southern) hemisphere. It is concentrated in radial layers located either at the top or at the bottom of the convection zone. We have also considered an α-effect uniformly distributed in all the convection zone. In the present paper the main attention is focused on i) the parity of the solution, ii) the form of the butterfly diagram and iii) the phase relation of the resulting field components. If the helioseismologically derived internal solar rotation law is considered, a model without meridional flow of high magnetic Reynolds number (corresponding to low eddy diffusivity) fails in all the three issues in comparison with the observations. However, a meridional flow with equatorial drift at the bottom of the convection zone of few meters by second can indeed enforce the equatorward migration of the toroidal <b>magnetic</b> field <b>belts</b> similar to the observed butterfly diagram but, the solution has only a dipolar parity if the (positive) α-effect is located at the base of the convection zone rather than at the top. We can, therefore, confirm the main results of a similar study by Dikpati & Gilman (2001). Key words: magnetohydrodynamics – Sun: interior – Sun: magnetic fieldA&A manuscript no.
