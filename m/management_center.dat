40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we try {{to monitor}} and {{optimize}} the productivity of network operations and <b>management</b> <b>centers</b> in a big telecommunication company. To achieve this goal, we apply linear programming and simulation techniques and propose a system architecture. Linear programming and simulation are most frequently used techniques in management science field. We apply these techniques to obtain the best staffing level of network operations and <b>management</b> <b>centers</b> and verify the result. We also propose a system architecture that implements the linear programming model in the real situation and monitor the productivity of network operations and <b>management</b> <b>centers.</b> This research will help to increase the competitiveness of a telecommunication company {{as well as other}} organizations by reducing the operating expenditure in today’s fierce competitive environment...|$|R
