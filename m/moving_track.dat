40|$|LOCALIZATION, mapping and <b>moving</b> object <b>tracking</b> {{serve as}} the basis for scene understanding, which is a key {{prerequisite}} for making a robot truly autonomous. Simultaneous localization, mapping and <b>moving</b> object <b>tracking</b> (SLAMMOT) involves not only simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in dynamic environments but also detecting and tracking these dynamic objects. It is believed by many that a solution to the SLAM problem would open up a vast range of potential applications for autonomous robots. Accordingly, a solution to the SLAMMOT problem would expand robotic applications in proximity to human beings where robots work not only for people but also with people. This thesis establishes a new discipline at the intersection of SLAM and <b>moving</b> object <b>tracking.</b> Its contributions are two-fold: theoretical and practical. From a theoretical perspective, we establish a mathematical framework to integrate SLAM and <b>moving</b> object <b>tracking,</b> which provides a solid basis for understanding an...|$|R

50|$|In an {{interview}} {{shortly after the}} ride's opening, John Wardley, Ride Consultant for Merlin Entertainments, spoke {{about the development of}} Thirteen. The initial idea for the secret element originated from a previous rollercoaster plan that he designed for Alton Towers, in which a piece of track tilted back and forth during the ride. The ride, if it had been built, would have been similar to Winjas Fear and Force at Phantasialand, Germany, and therefore not a world's first ride. The plan never came to fruition, but the idea of <b>moving</b> <b>track</b> was kept and later developed into the world's first freefall dropping track element for Thirteen.|$|E

5000|$|Disc {{organisation}} limitations: Hi-MD units store non-audio information (such as {{start and}} end time of tracks) in the [...] "system file" [...] {{area of the}} disc. The system file is updated after any recording or edits on disc (like new recordings, <b>moving</b> <b>track</b> positions, adding tracks, removing tracks, track titling, etc.). For example, recording and then pressing [...] "stop" [...] on the unit {{will result in the}} unit saving any in-memory audio data to disc, then updating the [...] "system file" [...] area of the disc. [...] "SYSTEM FILE WRITING" [...] is commonly seen on the display of a Hi-MD unit at this time ("DATA SAVE" [...] may appear instead, when edited track names, disc name, artist names, etc. are being saved). In both cases, it is at this point the recorder spends several seconds updating the system file area of the disc. Sony warns not to shock the unit at this time or remove the power to the unit because the entire recording can be 'lost' if the system file area is not written to or updated properly. To avert power-related problems when writing, the Hi-MD estimates whether the battery power is adequate in advance of any recording or editing taking place on the unit. [...] "NotENOUGH POWER TO REC" [...] and [...] "NotENOUGH POWER TO EDIT" [...] are two messages that may appear in the display when the recorder estimates the power to not be enough. Power-related problems are largely averted this way, but shocking the unit still may be an issue at this critical stage of writing.|$|E

30|$|For {{complexity}} {{and efficiency of}} the multi-objective optimization, we proposed the mobile distance field-driven adaptive crowd optimization algorithm. In space, we modify the surface parameters based on the corresponding changes of the distance field to obtain the moving target’s <b>moving</b> <b>track</b> and moving surface. When {{the curve of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>track</b> is changed, the x axis and the y axis of the <b>moving</b> <b>track</b> are adjusted adaptively. In this paper, the moving process is divided into three processes: the target dynamic crowd control, the crowd model algorithm, and the predictive control of linear time domain based on the moving target prediction and crowd control algorithm. Then, the multi-objective optimization algorithm of moving objects is proposed by using the crowd model to predict the status and the position of the target. The experimental results show the high accuracy, low complexity, and high efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm.|$|E

30|$|We {{present the}} {{distance}} field-driven adaptive mobile goals in intelligent optimization algorithms {{to solve the}} multi-objective optimization complexity and efficiency issues. First, based on the corresponding changes in the distance field, we modify the surface parameters in the airspace. In this way, the <b>moving</b> <b>track</b> and surface of the object can be obtained. Secondly, based on the curve structure of the <b>moving</b> <b>track,</b> we adaptively adjust the x axis and the y axis structure of the moving trajectory. Then, we decompose the process into three processes, which are target dynamic crowd control, crowd model algorithm control and linear time domain predictive control. The three processes {{are based on the}} cooperative control of the moving target prediction and crowd control algorithm to form a multi-objective optimization framework. Finally, the multi-objective optimization algorithm of moving objects is proposed by using the crowd model to predict the status and the position of the target. The results of the five test functions show that the proposed algorithm has higher localization accuracy, lesser iteration times, and smaller surface area than the target optimization algorithm based on mobile search.|$|E
