5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features <b>multimedia</b> <b>equipment</b> and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} of <b>multimedia</b> <b>equipments</b> has allowed a significant {{growth in the}} production of videos through professional and amateur cameras, smartphones, and other mobile devices. Examples of applications involving video processing and analysis include surveillance and security, telemedicine, entertainment, teaching, and robotics. Video stabilization refers to the set of techniques required to detect and correct glitches or instabilities caused during the video acquisition process due to vibrations and undesired motion when handling the camera. In this work, we propose and evaluate a novel approach to video stabilization based on an adaptive Gaussian filter to smooth the camera trajectories. Experiments conducted on several video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, which generates videos with adequate trade-off between stabilization rate and amount of frame pixels. Our results were compared to YouTube’s state-of-the-art method, achieving competitive results.|$|R
