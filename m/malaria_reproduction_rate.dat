Although multiregional mathematical demography has been extensively explored {{since the beginning of}} the 1970 s, its key concept, the multiregional net <b>reproduction</b> <b>rate,</b> has been long neglected.

A significantly female pupal weight forms the response of H. armigera to sublethal HaNPV infection on the concentration tested.

Both growth and fecundity were significantly different bewteen isolates. F. cubensis raised in the presence of resistant P. columella showed a diminished shell growth and fecundity compared to snails raised in the presence of susceptible P. columella or a conspecific partner (uniformly-paired). Susceptible P. columella increases its shell growth rate when snails are raised with either F. cubensis or resistant P. columella but its fecundity rate is not significantly altered; resistant P. columella does not seem to suffer any changes in growth or fecundity when snails are raised {{in the presence of a}}ny partner.
