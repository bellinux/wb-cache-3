40|$|Abstract—On a router-port basis, our {{previous}} study [1] found that lightpath bypass strategy can significantly save power consumption over the lightpath non-bypass strategy. However, in real network systems, router ports are organized by network line cards or modules; on each line card {{there are multiple}} router ports.

We develop mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for power consumption minimization under the lightpath bypass strategy. We also compare the cases of lightpath bypass and non-bypass. It is found that for modularized route ports, the strategy of optical bypass can significantly outperform the strategy of non-bypass.
