50|$|Gender mainstreaming, {{according}} to the United Nations, is a globally accepted strategy for promoting gender equality. Mainstreaming is not {{an end in itself}} but a strategy, an approach, a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities - policy development, research, advocacy/ dialogue, legislation, resource allocation, and planning, implementation and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> and projects. A strong, continued commitment to gender mainstreaming {{is one of the most}} effective means for the United Nations to support promotion of gender equality at all levels - in research, legislation, policy development and in activities on the ground, and to ensure that women as well as men can influence, participate in and benefit from development efforts.|$|E

40|$|Master of EducationThis {{thesis is}} based on a study of {{teachers}} at Preston East Technical School. The purpose of the interviews was to illicit information about teachers' perceptions of themselves as compared with their given role in the state system. This is then analyzed against what is offered as the ideal role of a teacher. It is suggested that if it is the teacher's role to improve educational opportunity, then teachers should be concerned with the outcome of exiting students. This would involve detailed <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> possible delivery of additional programmes and industrial campaigns not only for necessary educational resources but also for job creation for youth. This thesis demonstrates that teachers are too involved in the psychic reward of their job and this, combined with the undermining of their conditions, is preventing further curriculum development. Processes, such as the participatory model used by the Ministry of Education which involve teachers in anything other than viewing student outcome, are time-consuming and divert attention from the issue of equity. What is recommended as an ideal learning situation is the formation of a partnership between student and teacher, where both work as if part of a research team, who will call upon the wider community for clarification of values and information.

Demographic and socio-economic data were collected and the results have enabled government and all other users of this information to make informed decisions.

A decision was therefore taken to carry out the Community Survey in 2007. The Community Survey (CS) is a nationally representative, large-scale household survey which was conducted from February to March 2007. The Community Survey is designed to provide information on the trends and levels of demographic and socio-economic data, such as population size and distribution; the extent of poor households; access to facilities and services, and the levels of employment/unemployment at national, provincial and municipality level. The data can be used to assist government and the private sector in the planning, evaluation and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> and policies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyse the impact of forced migration on women and development in northern Uganda. The armed conflict in northern Uganda, which started in 1986, led to gross violations of human rights against women forcing them to flee their homes and ftnd refuge in overcrowded resettlement camps. The main objective {{of the study was to}} critically analyse the causes of displacement and the experiences of internally displaced women so as to contribute to available knowledge on women and development Qualitative and feminist research techniques were carried out in Erute Camp located in Lira Municipality among intemally displaced women, using observation and interviews. The findings reveal that forced migration was caused by the armed conflict between the LRA rebels and the government solders. The conflict destroyed in:frastructw·e and socio-economic service delivery systems. This consequently par·alysed the northern Uganda's development as many civilians were forced to abandon their homesteads due to traumatic experiences of killings, torture and abductions. This resulted in human disintegration and the collapse of economic and social development in the region that was based on agriculture. The prolonged insecurity disrupted education, health, communication and commercial activities resulting in absolute poverty and underdevelopment Despite effo 11 s by government and some humanitarian agencies to provide the needs of the affected civilians, peace and reconciliation seems to be hard to achieve. Insecurity continues to spread making normal life, relief and economic activities impossible. Due to lack of effective implementation, coordination and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> the situation poses great challenges to government and international h agencies present such as: WFP, UNHCR, WHO, World Bank and others. Therefore, forced migration has a significant impact on women's social, economic, cultural and environmental development. However, a positive impact regar·ding women's empowe 1 ment and gender equality due to changed roles was eminent. I conclude by recommending that the stakeholders need to increase the capacity to restore peace. There is need to coordinate the development projects and programmes through increased flexibility and transparency.

40|$|Argentina’s debt default in 2001 {{moved the}} {{international}} community to launch initiatives to develop procedures for the orderly restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debt. These initiatives come {{against the backdrop of the}} increase in public debt in emerging market economies over the last decade, of large-scale fi nancial crises linked to the level or structure of sovereign debt and, a recent development, of several cases of sovereign default on international bonds. These developments pose two challenges. Firstly, the complexity of sovereign debt dynamics makes it necessary to strengthen international institutions’ assessment capacity. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has thus launched initiatives to improve the assessment of debt sustainability and balance sheet weaknesses. Secondly, the developments have prompted the re-examination of IMF facilities for managing debt crises. The absence of a clear framework in this area could create a moral hazard risk, as {{the international community}} could be tempted to avoid necessary restructuring by granting substantial fi nancial assistance. In practice, defining such a framework is complex, given that reforms in the area of restructuring influence the way in which debts are structured. In fact, the features of sovereign debt aim to reconcile two requirements: first, ensuring that the sovereign debtor honours the terms of the debt contract if it has the means to do so (ex ante efficiency); second, making sure that the cost of default is not excessive when the sovereign debtor is effectively unable to pay back (ex post effi ciency). The international community currently favours a market-based approach. Its first pillar is a result of the development and spread of collective action clauses (CAC), following the Quarles Report by the Group of 10. Incorporated into debt contracts, CAC aim to reduce the problems arising in inter-creditor co-ordination, by defi ning, in advance, the decision rules applicable in the event of re-negotiation. The “Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets”, whose defi nition was fostered notably by the Governor of the Banque de France and the Group of 20, form the second pillar. They supply guidelines for the parties involved to steer the exchange of information and facilitate co-ordination between debtors and creditors. The market-based approach is not exclusive of a formal regime, e. g. the IMF’s Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM), where such a regime is feasible. In the market-based approach, the IMF acts as an expert via the supply of information and analyses, and also as a “monitor” via the negotiation and <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes.</b> The provision of loans, which is in principle limited, aims mainly to facilitate renegotiation by giving credibility to the sovereign’s policy. By contrast, a more formal regime would suppose limiting IMF involvement, so as to guarantee the independence of the mechanism. Whatever the case, the efficiency of the overhauled restructuring framework, which is built on contractual provisions and general principles rather than on a formal regime, will depend on the Fund’s capacity to fully perform its three functions. ...|$|E

A Bridging Year Programme (BYP) {{designed by the}} South African Education and Environment Project (SAEP) seeks {{to address this problem}} by offering intensive tuition to post-high school learners who have failed to gain sufficient points for entry into a tertiary institution. The BYP prepares those learners to re-write core National Senior Certificate (NSC) subjects and assists them in applying for entrance into a university or college. A formative evaluation was conducted to assess whether the programme is designed and implemented as intended and whether programme design and delivery takes into account evidence based practices, established in the literature for <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> this nature. A review <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> records was undertaken, interviews were conducted with the programme manager and programme coordinator, and selfreport questionnaires were administered to course tutors and programme beneficiaries.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{applicability}} of relational contract theory in situations where government departments contract with non-government welfare organisations to deliver human service programmes. Its limits are highlighted by an assessment <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> for domestically violent men that epitomise “management of incomplete contracts” central to the theory. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on an evaluation <b>of</b> contracted-out <b>programmes</b> for perpetrators <b>of</b> domestic violence in Australia that set out to compare and contrast distinct models of service delivery by documenting programme logic, service delivery effectiveness and effects on programme participants. It reflects on the difficulties <b>of</b> <b>monitoring</b> such <b>programmes</b> and considers the implications of this for contracting theory and for human service practice. Findings – In contrast to critiques of contracting-out in a neo-liberal environment that emphasise how accountability and reporting requirements limit the autonomy of contracted agencies, this paper highlights considerable variation in how programmes were managed and delivered despite standardised service delivery contracts developed by the government department funding the programmes. This leads to a consideration of “incomplete contracts” where service delivery outcomes are hard to measure or there is limited knowledge of the contracted agencies by the contracting government department. Originality/value – The paper highlights a situation in which the recommendations of relational contracting theory can exacerbate the difficulties of quality assurance rather than minimise them. It then argues a need for workforce development in the government departments and the contracted agencies, to enable a nuanced <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>programmes</b> 2 ̆ 7 service delivery and promotion of quality assurance processes. <br /...|$|R
