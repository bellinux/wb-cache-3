5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potato</b> pie is {{a popular}} variety of pie eaten in England. A <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potato</b> pie has a similar filling to a Cornish Pasty and differs from a meat pie in that its content is often minced and usually less than 50% meat.

"Believe me, {{there is}} nothing like a female singer who can step up and belt out the lines, yet has enough Sauvé Fair to finesse the lighter side of the material, and [...] "Panic In The Year Zero" [...] {{is a perfect example of}} that. If the vocals are the constancy, the guitar is the <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potatoes,</b> {{delivering}} resounding lines that drive the material and vary the intensity nicely; one moment giving meaningful power chords, the next moving with an asynchronous line. The bass uses space appropriately, developing astute lines that emphasize relationships to the drums here and the guitar there, always keeping it interesting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Drowned in Sound's Sammy Maine, however, {{gave the}} album a mixed review, writing: [...] "There's flashes of Jimmy Eat World {{brilliance}} {{and even a}} few classics in there, but this is an album that's also prone to a few fillers and cheesy one liners. This is a band that should be beyond mediocre offerings but sadly, there's just one too many on Damage." [...] The A.V. Clubs Kyle Ryan gave the album a mostly negative review, stating: [...] "While the group's predictability has traditionally been a positive assurance of quality, it's now more indicative of stasis. Damage doesn't offend, but it doesn't offer much that's memorable, either." [...] Rolling Stones Nick Catucci gave the album a negative review, stating: [...] "On their first album since 2010, the Arizona guys still sound sweet. They're also hall-monitor dull – these <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potatoes</b> sure could use some fresh gravy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} views on Unbound Sagas gameplay. [...] The {{reviewer}} from Spazio Games, an Italian gaming site, compared {{the game to}} Double Dragon and Final Fight. [...] The reviewer felt that the game felt rushed, and this affected gameplay. [...] Carolyn Petit of GameSpot was more critical of the game, calling it [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "mindless. [...] IGN's Greg Miller noted the inclusion of combos and upgradeable character statistics, but felt that they [...] "never really amplify the fun in alternating between punch and kick." [...] Destructoid's Jim Sterling noted [...] "While there are more complex combos to unlock {{during the course of}} the game, the <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potatoes</b> of Unbound Saga is the endless hammering buttons to punch, kick and throw enemies around each level." [...] Co-reviewer Nick Chester called it [...] "classic beat-’em-up game". [...] Although giving the simple gameplay high marks, Chester felt that the PSP version of the game should have received cooperative play. Mike Jackson of GamesRadar appreciated the addition of cooperative gameplay on the Xbox 360 version, but wished players could join or leave on the fly.|$|E

6000|$|So it {{had been}} with Victor. Under {{instruction}} {{he had come to}} speak of electricity as a fluid, of steel as a metal, as though calling them by these names explained them. He discussed the ether, calmly considering it a sort of finely attenuated jelly, something which quivered to every blow and was capable of transmitting motion instantaneously. Sound, heat, and light were modes of motion, he had been told, and these words satisfied him. Food taken into the body produced power, and this power was transmitted from the stomach to the brain, and from the brain to the muscles, and so the limbs were moved. But just how the <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potatoes</b> got finally from the brain to the nerves and so into the swing of a baseball bat did not trouble him. Why should it? ...|$|E

60|$|This {{seems to}} be the normal {{condition}} of the working-man, from the zest with which he addresses himself to the board. Eating is a necessity, and there are no frills about it. He brings in with him a primitive voraciousness, and, I am confident, carries away with him a fairly healthy appetite. When you see such a man, on his way to work in the morning, order a pint of tea, which is no more tea than it is ambrosia, pull a hunk of dry bread from his pocket, and wash the one down with the other, depend upon it, that man has not the right sort of stuff in his belly, nor enough of the wrong sort of stuff, to fit him for big day's work. And further, depend upon it, he and a thousand of his kind will not turn out the quantity or quality of work that a thousand men will who have eaten heartily of <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potatoes,</b> and drunk coffee that is coffee.|$|E

Mrs. Grover went to see them, and, though a {{hard-working}} creature, did all she could for them. This winter she has plenty of time to sew, for Grandpa needs little done for him except at night and morning, and that kind woman spent her own money, and got warm flannel and cotton and stuff, and made each child a good suit. Lotty had come for hers, and when the bundle was in her arms she hugged it close, and put up her little face to kiss Grover so prettily, I felt that I wanted to do something too. So I hunted up Min's old waterproof and rubbers, and a hood, and sent Lotty home as happy as a queen, promising to go and see her. I did go, and there was my work all ready for me. Oh, girls! such a bare, cold room, without a spark of fire, and no food but a pan of bits of pie and bread and meat, not fit for any one to eat, and in the bed, with an old carpet for cover, lay the three children. Tot and Caddy cuddled in the warmest place, while Lotty, with her little blue hands, was trying to patch up some old stockings with bits of cotton. I didn't know how to begin, but Lotty did, and I just took her orders; for that wise little woman told me where to buy a bushel of coal and some kindlings, and milk and meal, and all I wanted. I worked like a beaver for an hour or two, and was so glad I'd been to a cooking-class, for I could make a fire, with Lotty to do the grubby part, and start a nice soup with the cold <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>potatoes,</b> and an onion or so. Soon the room was warm, and full of a nice smell, and out of bed tumbled 'the babies,' to dance round the stove and sniff at the soup, and drink milk like hungry kittens, till I could get bread and butter ready.|$|E
