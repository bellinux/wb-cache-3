40|$|Active {{genes are}} {{insulated}} from developmentally regulated chromatin condensation in terminally differentiated cells. We mapped the topography of a terminal stage-specific chromatin-condensing protein, MENT, across the active chicken β-globin domain. We observed two sharp transitions of MENT concentration {{coinciding with the}} β-globin boundary elements. The MENT distribution profile was opposite to that of acetylated core histones but correlated with that of histone H 3 dimethylated at lysine 9 (H 3 me 2 K 9). Ectopic MENT expression in NIH 3 T 3 cells caused a large-scale and specific remodeling of chromatin marked by H 3 me 2 K 9. MENT colocalized with H 3 me 2 K 9 both in chicken erythrocytes and NIH 3 T 3 cells. Mutational analysis of MENT and experiments with deacetylase inhibitors revealed the essential role of the reaction center loop domain and an inhibitory affect of histone hyperacetylation on the MENT-induced chromatin remodeling in vivo. In vitro, {{the elimination of the}} histone H 3 N-terminal peptide containing lysine 9 by trypsin blocked chromatin self-association by MENT, while reconstitution with dimethylated but not acetylated N-terminal domain of histone H 3 specifically restored chromatin self-association by MENT. We suggest that histone H 3 modification at lysine 9 directly regulates chromatin condensation by recruiting <b>MENT</b> <b>to</b> chromatin <b>in</b> a fashion that is spatially constrained from active genes by gene boundary elements and histone hyperacetylation...|$|R

40|$|Information {{retrieval}} {{systems for}} documents normally {{rely on the}} use of keywords that describe the text in some fashion or another, or are contained in the text itself, for indexing and searching. These keywords may be associated with standard boolean operators, where presence or absence in the text or text description is used as the truth value, or other oper ators indicating their proximity <b>to</b> one another <b>in</b> the text. Another emerging approach is the use of content or knowledge based indexing and retrieval. In this approach the text is not represented or treated as a collection keywords, rather its meaning or semantic content is abstracted and the meaning is used to search for the text desired. This approach may have several advantages over the standard keyword approach. Both precision and recall of the search may be improved, increasing the likelihood that relevant texts will be found while decreasing the probability of finding irrelevant ones. The knowl edge based approach may also allow more sophisticated query techniques, for instance queries based on the purpose for which the text will be used. This thesis will explore the possibility and usefulness of applying case based reasoning to the problem of text search and retrieval. An easy-to-use expert system for information retrieval that utilizes case-based reasoning to improve, over time, its capability to find those items that are relevant and useful, and only those items that are relevant and useful will be implemented. It will support formulation of a search in an intuitive manner that avoids complicated command syntax and occult operators.

40|$|Semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor {{field effect}} {{transistor}} (SISFET) devices have a simpler disorder environment at low temperature (< 300 mK) than other MBE-grown GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, and SISFET devices can be measured over a range of electron densities. Despite the these benefits, SISFET devices are not commonly studied {{as a number of}} hurdles need to be overcome. First, though the disorder envir- onment seems simpler in SISFETs, disorder can be difficult to quantify. This makes it challenging to compare SISFETs to other types of GaAs devices. Second SISFETs are difficult to fabricate and have a low yield. Finally SIS- FET devices are not expected <b>to</b> work <b>in</b> high frequency measurements due to their architecture. Disorder can cause electrons <b>to</b> scatter <b>in</b> the 2 DEG, affecting the elec- trical transport properties of a device. Disorder can be classified using the ratio of the transport to the quantum scattering times. Quantifying disorder can be difficult due <b>to</b> a divergence <b>in</b> the calculation of the quantum scat- tering time. I show this divergence in the quantum lifetime is due to the nonphysical assumption of an infinitely thick heterostructure. I derive a non- divergent scattering lifetime for finite thickness structures and calculate the quantum and transport lifetimes for electrons in a generic GaAs-AlGaAs het- erostructures. I then compare theoretical results with experimental data from a GaAs 2 DEG and obtain excellent agreement between the calculations and experimental data. Due to their complex fabrication process SISFETs typically have a low yield. Furthermore the transport properties of SISFETs are very sensitive <b>to</b> any changes <b>in</b> the fabrication process. I develop a reliable fabrication method for SISFETs to improve their yield and electrical performance. I then demonstrate the electrical reproducibility of transport measurements which are possible with SISFET devices. Finally we demonstrate rf reflectometry is compatible with SISFET quantum dots. SISFET nanostructures have large overall top-gates and thus the rf sig- nal is expected to shorted to the top-gate. Reflectometry is used almost ex- clusively on modulation doped nanostructures in GaAs devices for a range of applications, including fast charge read-out. Being able to integrate SISFET nanostructures into reflectometry measurements may enable similar measure- <b>ments</b> <b>to</b> be performed <b>in</b> SISFET nanostructures...|$|R
