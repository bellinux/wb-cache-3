50|$|The editing {{site was}} {{previously}} {{believed to be}} a single nucleotide polymorphism. The editing site is found at amino acid 5 of transmembrane domain 3 of exon 9. The predicted double-stranded RNA structure is interrupted by three bulges and a mismatch at the editing site. The double-stranded region is 22 base pairs in length. As with editing of the KCNA1 gene product, the editing region and the editing complementary sequence are both found in exonic regions. In the pre=mRNA of GABRA3, both are found within exon 9. The other subunits of the receptor are thought not to be edited, as their predicted secondary structure is less likely to be edited. Also, alpha subunits 1 and 6 have a uridine instead of an adenosine at the site corresponding to the editing site in alpha subunit 3. Point mutation experiments determined that a Cytidine 15 nucleotides from the editing site is the base opposite the edited base. Using a GABRA3 <b>mini-gene</b> that encodes for exon 9 cotransfected to HEK293 cells with either ADAR1 or -2 or none, it was determined that both active ADARs can efficiently edited the site in exon 9.|$|E
40|$|A pentapeptide open {{reading frame}} {{equipped}} with a canonical ribosome-binding site {{is present in the}} Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA. Overexpression of 23 S rRNA fragments containing the <b>mini-gene</b> renders cells resistant to the ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic erythromycin. Mutations that change either the initiator or stop codons of the peptide <b>mini-gene</b> result in the loss of erythromycin resistance. Nonsense mutations in the <b>mini-gene</b> also abolish erythromycin resistance, which can be restored {{in the presence of the}} suppressor tRNA, thus proving that expression of the rRNA-encoded peptide is essential for the resistance phenotype. The ribosome appears to be the likely target of action of the rRNA-encoded pentapeptide, because in vitro translation of the peptide <b>mini-gene</b> decreases the inhibitory action of erythromycin on cell-free protein synthesis. Thus, the new mechanism of drug resistance reveals that in addition to the structural and functional role of rRNA in the ribosome, it may also have a peptide-coding function...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of very short open reading frames in Escherichia coli {{can lead to}} the inhibition of translation and an arrest in cell growth. Inhibition occurs because peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase fails to recycle sufficiently rapidly peptidyl-tRNA released from ribosomes at the stop signal in competition with normal termination, causing starvation for essential species of tRNA. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} last sense codon, the strength of the Shine–Dalgarno sequence and the nature and context of the stop codon affect the toxicity associated with <b>mini-gene</b> expression. Here, several important parameters are studied as a function of the length of the <b>mini-gene</b> coding sequence. The rate of peptidyl-tRNA drop-off catalysed by translation factors decreases dramatically for peptides longer than a hexamer. The probability that ribosomes recycle without dissociation of the <b>mini-gene</b> mRNA varies strongly with the length of the coding sequence. The peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase rap mutant, unlike the wild-type enzyme, is highly sensitive to the length and sequence of the peptide. Together, these parameters explain the length dependence of <b>mini-gene</b> toxicity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mini-genes</b> for 5 S-like rRNA were constructed. These genes had a {{sequence}} which largely {{resembles that of}} the naturally occurring 5 S rRNA of a bacterium, Halococcus morrhuae, which phylogenetically belongs to the Archaea. Plasmids carrying the <b>mini-genes</b> were transformed into Escherichia coli (Ec). Ribosomal incorporation was not a prerequisite for stable accumulation of the RNA product. However, only those constructs with a well-base-paired helix I accumulated RNA product. This result strongly implies that {{this aspect of the}} structure is likely to be an important condition for stabilizing 5 S rRNA-like products. The results are consistent with our current understanding of 5 S rRNA processing in Ec. When used in conjunction with rRNA probe technology, the resulting chimeric RNA may be useful as a monitoring tool for genetically engineered microorganisms or naturally occurring organisms that are released into the environment...|$|R

Pth 1 cleaves the ester bond between the peptide and nucleotide of peptidyl-tRNA generated from aborted translation, expression of <b>mini-genes,</b> and short ORFs. We have determined {{the shape of the}} Pth 1 :peptidyl-tRNA complex using small angle neutron scattering. Binding of piperonylpiperazine, a small molecule constituent of a combinatorial synthetic library common to most compounds with inhibitory activity, was mapped to Pth 1 via NMR spectroscopy. We also report computational docking results, modeling piperonylpiperazine binding based on chemical shift perturbation mapping. Overall these studies promote Pth 1 as a novel antibiotic target, contribute to understanding how Pth 1 interacts with its substrate, advance the current model for cleavage, and demonstrate feasibility of small molecule inhibition...|$|R
30|$|Running the {{sequences}} C and T of the SNP {{region in}} different servers {{we found that}} the two alleles could display differential recognition by splicing factors. The C variant showed the possible inclusion of an unknown exon. This unknown exon contained a stop codon and thus could induce NMD. We then determined that the splicing pattern in isolated mouse islets and MIN 6 cells was similar to that in human pancreatic islets. Therefore, we used MIN 6 cells to study the splicing of human intron 4 : two <b>mini-genes</b> of intron 4 containing either the C/C genotype or the T/T genotype were transfected into MIN 6 cells. Our constructs were spliced normally, excluding intron 4, but we did not observe the presence of an extra exon with either construct.|$|R
40|$|Mutational {{screening}} of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA 1 leads to the identification of numerous pathogenic variants such as frameshift and nonsense variants, as well as large genomic rearrangements. The screening moreover identifies {{a large number of}} variants, for example, missense, silent, and intron variants, which are classified as variants of unknown clinical significance owing to the lack of causal evidence. Variants of unknown clinical significance can potentially have an impact on splicing and therefore functional examinations are warranted to classify whether these variants are pathogenic or benign. Here we validate a <b>mini-gene</b> splicing assay by comparing the results of 24 variants with previously published data from RT-PCR analysis on RNA from blood samples/lymphoblastoid cell lines. The analysis showed an overall concordance of 100 %. In addition, we investigated 13 BRCA 1 variants of unknown clinical significance or putative variants affecting splicing by in silico analysis and <b>mini-gene</b> splicing assay. Both the in silico analysis and <b>mini-gene</b> splicing assay classified six BRCA 1 variants as pathogenic (c. 80 þ 1 G 4 A, c. 132 C 4 T (p.), c. 2131 G 4 A, c. 670 þ 1 delG, c. 4185 þ 1 G 4 A, and c. 50751 G 4 C), whereas six BRCA 1 variants were classified as neutral (c. - 19 - 22 _- 19 - 21 dupAT, c. 30215 C 4 G, c. 547 þ 14 delG, c. 467620 A 4 G, c. 498721 G 4 T, and c. 527814 C 4 G) and one BRCA 1 variant remained unclassified (c. 670 þ 16 G 4 A). In conclusion, our study emphasizes that in silico analysis and <b>mini-gene</b> splicing assays are important for the classification of variants, especially if no RNA is available from the patient. This knowledge is crucial for proper genetic counseling of patients and their family members...|$|E

40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} that can confer novel properties, such as metal resistance, to a host bacterium. This same process {{can also be used}} to produce RNAs and peptides that have novel properties, such as the ability to bind particular compounds. It is inherent in the method that the peptide or RNA will behave as expected in the target organism. Plasmid-born <b>mini-gene</b> libraries coding for either a population of combinatorial peptides or stable, artificial RNAs carrying random inserts are produced. These libraries, which have no bias towards any biological function, are used to transform the organism of interest and to serve as an initial source of genetic variation for stress-driven evolution. The transformed bacteria are propagated under selective pressure in order to obtain variants with the desired properties. The process is highly distinct from in vitro methods because the variants are selected in the context of the cell while it is experiencing stress. Hence, the selected peptide or RNA will, by definition, work as expected in the target cell as the cell adapts to its presence during the selection process. Once the novel gene, which produces the sought phenotype, is obtained, it can be transferred to the main genome to increase the genetic stability in the organism. Alternatively, the cell line can be used to produce novel RNAs or peptides with selectable properties in large quantity for separate purposes. The system allows for easy, large-scale purification of the RNAs or peptide products. The {{process has been}} reduced to practice by imposing sub-inhibitory concentrations of NiCl 2 on cells of the bacterium Escherichia coli that were transformed separately with the peptide library and RNA library. The evolved resistant clones were isolated, and sequences of the selected <b>mini-gene</b> variants were established. Clones resistant to NiCl 2 were found to carry identical plasmid variants with a functional <b>mini-gene</b> that specifically conferred significant nickel tolerance on the host cells. Sequencing of the selected <b>mini-gene</b> revealed a propensity of the encoded peptide to bind transient metal ions. Expression of the <b>mini-gene</b> markedly improved growth parameters of the evolved clones at sub-inhibitory concentrations of NiCl 2 while being slightly detrimental in the absence of stress. Similar results have been obtained with the RNA libraries. Overall, the results demonstrate a very natural outcome of the selection experiments in which the mini-genes were expected to be either successfully integrated into bacterial genetic networks, or rejected depending upon their effect on host fitness. This described approach can be useful as a laboratory model to study the dynamics of bacterial adaptive evolution on the molecular level. It can also provide a strategy for screening expressed DNA libraries in search of novel genes with desirable properties...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} dystrophin intron 11 rearrangement in one family with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, causing incorporation of an aberrant exon in a tissue-specific manner. In {{this study we}} analyzed the role of different intron 11 genomic regions in the regulation of splicing by using <b>mini-genes</b> based approach, in C 2 C 12 (skeletal muscle) myoblasts and myotubes, H 9 C 2 cardiomyocytes, and HeLa cells. We show that inclusion of the aberrant exon is favored in H 9 C 2 and differentiated C 2 C 12 myotubes. These {{data suggest that the}} aberrant exon undergoes a differentiation-specific splicing. Unexpectedly, length of intron has a favorable effect in inclusion of the aberrant exon in the cardiac cells, suggesting that cardiac cells might be more prone to steric hindrance of trans-acting factors, involved in the inclusion of the aberrant exon. Furthermore, the cultured cell system used can serve as a suitable model to study human alternative splicing...|$|R
30|$|Intron 4 {{of human}} TCF 7 L 2 is unusually long; {{therefore}} we created two <b>mini-genes</b> of this intron {{with either the}} C/C or T/T genotype. Since the SNP rs 7903146 {{is thought to be}} associated to altered insulin processing and secretion we chose to investigate its effect in beta-cells. We opted for MIN 6 cells for two reasons: firstly, as shown here, they splice Tcf 7 l 2 mRNA similarly to human TCF 7 L 2 and secondly {{they do not have the}} corresponding genomic region for human rs 7903146 in the Tcf 7 l 2 gene. Transfecting our constructs into MIN 6 cells showed that, indeed, exon 4 spliced correctly into exon 5, but the existence of an extra exon within intron 4 was not detected. However, it is important to consider that, by excluding the majority of the intron (78, 000  bp), we might have eliminated important information, and the existence of an extra exon could still be likely. Another approach will be to inhibit NMD in human beta-cells, to better address the existence of this exon.|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{position}} effects {{combined with}} transgene silencing of multi-copy plasmid insertions lead to highly variable and usually quite low expression levels of mini-genes integrated into mammalian chromosomes. Together, these effects greatly complicate obtaining high-level expression of therapeutic proteins in mammalian cells or reproducible expression of individual or multiple transgenes. Here, we report a simple, one-step procedure for obtaining high-level, reproducible <b>mini-gene</b> expression in mammalian cells. By inserting mini-genes at different locations within a BAC containing the DHFR housekeeping gene locus, we obtain copy-number-dependent, position-independent expression with chromosomal insertions {{of one to}} several hundred BAC copies. These multi-copy DHFR BAC insertions adopt similar large-scale chromatin conformations independent of their chromosome integration site, including insertions within centromeric heterochromatin. Prevention of chromosome position effects, therefore, {{may be the result}} of embedding the <b>mini-gene</b> within the BAC-specific large-scale chromatin structure. The expression of reporter mini-genes can be stably maintained during continuous, long-term culture in the presence of drug selection. Finally, we show that this method is extendable to reproducible, high-level expression of multiple mini-genes, providing improved expression of both single and multiple transgenes...|$|E

GRMD is not caused by deletion mutation but results from a point mutation in the consensus splice acceptor in intron 6 of the canine dystrophin gene. As a result exon 7 is skipped during processing of the GRMD dystrophin messenger RNA. We have developed a rapid test which makes direct use of exon 7 specific genomic PCR products. We have undertaken preliminary experiments on gene therapy using the <b>mini-gene</b> and the full length gene alone and in combination with lipofectin and/or the bacterial β-galactosidase reporter gene Lac Z. Following direct injection of the Lac Z plasmid, either alone or with lipofectin, about 50 % of the sites showed expression when biopsied some 14 days later. The β-galactosidase activity was present in muscle and granulation tissue but was never abundant. Pups injected intraperitoneally with Lac Z were found to have positive material in their mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Those injected with Lac Z and lipofectin also had positive material in the diaphragm, intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles, but again only a small amount of positive material was present at any of the sites. In animals directly injected into the muscle with the dystrophin <b>mini-gene,</b> half had positive staining for dystrophin in biopsies taken 14 days later.

With large numbers of genes discovered in genome analyses, rapid identification of cancer or viral antigens would facilitate better exploitation of CD 8 + T lymphocyte-mediated immune protection. Reverse transfection microarray technology allows expression of individual cDNAs at defined positions in a cell monolayer and direct detection of corresponding phenotypic changes of transfected cells at specific locations. In this study, we have integrated reverse transfection with image-based fluorometric detection of antigen-specific CTL-mediated cytotoxicity on transfected cell microarrays. As a result, the antigen recognition of cloned CTL cells has been successfully detected on the cell microarray, in which the specific or non-specific <b>mini-gene</b> DNA in the expression vector or vector alone was spotted. Moreover, the cellular capability of antigen processing and presentation on microarray has also been evaluated by using chimeric DNA constructs containing the antigen-encoding <b>mini-gene</b> sequence.

RNase-assisted pull down as-say coupled with mass spectrometry revealed that the mutant RNA probe specifically recruits hnRNPA 1, hnRNPA 2 /B 1 and DAZAP 1. Functional studies in a human myoblast cell line transfected with DMD <b>mini-genes</b> confirmed the splicing inhibitory activity of hn-RNPA 1 and hnRNPA 2 /B 1, and showed that DAZAP 1, also known to activate splicing, acts negatively {{in the context of}} the mutated exon 39. Furthermore, we uncovered that recognition of endogenous DMD exon 39 in muscle cells is promoted by FUSE bind-ing protein 1 (FUBP 1), a multifunctional DNA- and RNA-binding protein whose role in splicing is largely unknown. By serial deletion and mutagenesis stud-ies in minigenes, we delineated a functional intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) in intron 38. FUBP 1 recruit-ment to the RNA sequence containing the ISE was established by RNA pull down and RNA EMSA, and further confirmed by RNA-ChIP on endogenous DMD pre-mRNA.

40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} recognition of splice sites during pre-mRNA splicing {{is essential for}} proper transcriptome expression. Splice site usage can be modulated by secondary structures, but it is unclear if this type of modulation is commonly used or occurs to a significant degree with secondary structures forming over long distances. Using phlyogenetic comparisons of intronic sequences among 12 Drosophila genomes, we elucidated a group of 202 highly conserved pairs of sequences, each at least nine nucleotides long, capable of forming stable stem structures. This set was highly enriched in alternatively spliced introns and introns with weak acceptor sites and long introns, and most occurred over long distances (> 150 nucleotides). Experimentally, we analyzed the splicing of several of these introns using <b>mini-genes</b> in Drosophila S 2 cells. Wild-type splicing patterns were changed by mutations that opened the stem structure, and restored by compensatory mutations that re-established the base-pairing potential, demonstrating that these secondary structures were indeed implicated in the splice site choice. Mechanistically, the RNA structures masked splice sites, brought together distant splice sites and/or looped out introns. Thus, base-pairing interactions within introns, even those occurring over long distances, are more frequent modulators of alternative splicing than is currently assumed...|$|R

A SIN vector (called dsSIN), designed for transient expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins, was engineered by inserting a second subgenomic mRNA promoter sequence into a nonessential region of the SIN genome. By using this vector, dsSIN recombinants have been constructed that express either bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, a truncated form of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA), or <b>mini-genes</b> encoding two distinct immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) HA epitopes. Infection of murine cell lines with these recombinants resulted in the expression of approximately 10 (6) - 10 (7) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polypeptides per cell and efficient sensitization of target cells for lysis by appropriate major histocompatibility complex-restricted HA-specific CTL clones in vitro. In addition, priming of an influenza-specific T-cell response was observed after immunizing mice with dsSIN recombinants expressing either a truncated form of HA or the immunodominant influenza CTL epitopes. This SIN expression system allows the generation of high-titered recombinant virus stocks {{in a matter of days}} and should facilitate mapping and mutational analysis of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell epitopes expressed via the endogenous pathway of antigen processing and presentation...|$|R

The RNA species in lung, brain, and spleen was 400 to 500 bases larger than that in the other tissues. Transcription in lens, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain initiated at the same position. A mouse alpha B-crystallin <b>mini-gene</b> was constructed and was introduced into the germ line of mice, and its {{expression was}} demonstrated to parallel that of the endogenous gene. Transgene RNA was always detected in lens, heart, and skeletal muscle, while expression in kidney and lung was variable; it remains uncertain whether there is transgene expression in brain and spleen. These results demonstrate that regulatory sequences controlling expression of the alpha B-crystallin gene lie between sequences 666 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site and 2. 4 kilobase pairs downstream of the poly(A) addition site and are not located within the introns.

The LEE 1 operon regulatory region has been dissected. LEE-encoded transcription factor, GrlA, activates the LEE 1 P 1 promoter by binding to a target located within the 18 base pair spacer between the promoter 10 and 35 elements. Shortening this spacer to 17 base pairs increases P 1 promoter activity and short-circuits GrlA dependent activation, suggesting that GrlA functions like MerR family transcription activators. It was also found that the LEE 1 P 1 promoter is overlapped by a cryptic promoter, designated P 1 A. A single base substitution in the P 1 consensus - 35 element unmasks P 1 A promoter activity. In contrast, P 1 A activity is much less when P 1 is inactivated by a mutation in its - 10 hexamer element. Hence, even when P 1 is inactive, the consensus - 35 element sequesters RNA polymerase and prevents its access to the P 1 A promoter.

In an attempt to define regulatory sequences involved in the utilization of the CT-specific terminal exon, we performed deletion and mutation analyses of a <b>mini-gene</b> construct that contains the CT terminal exon and mimics the CT processing choice in vivo. These studies identified a 127 -nucleotide intron enhancer located approximately 150 nucleotides downstream of the CT exon poly(A) cleavage site that is required for recognition of the exon. The enhancer contains an essential and conserved 5 ' splice site sequence. Mutation of the splice site resulted in diminished utilization of the CT-specific terminal exon and increased skipping of the CT exon in both the <b>mini-gene</b> and in the natural CT/CGRP gene. Other components of the intron enhancer modified utilization of the CT-specific terminal exon and were necessary to prevent utilization of the 5 ' splice site within the intron enhancer as an actual splice site directing cryptic splicing. Conservation of the intron enhancer in three mammalian species suggests an important role for this intron element in the regulation of CT/CGRP processing and an expanded role for intronic 5 ' splice site sequences in the regulation of RNA processing...|$|E

In Fugu tissue, the Fugu HD gene was found to be expressed as predicted from the gene sequence but three differentially spliced forms were also detected. Despite the absence of conserved promoter sequences, the Fugu promoter was found to be functional in mouse cells. We have generated mice transgenic for the Fugu HD gene and conducted a detailed expression analysis across the entire 10 kb transcript.

Thus, {{it is time to}} test in vivo long-term efficacy and toxicity of oligos against the most clinically-relevant exons of human dystrophin gene. Pregnant mothers and littermates could be treated and the latter studied from two weeks after birth. Biopsies of leg muscles at one- three- and six-month will be studied after inducing muscle damage by exposing mice to spontaneous run in wheel-cage. At one-year-age respiratory muscles (diaphragm) will be also studied. Beside effects of oligo treatments on dystrophin expression at protein level, micromethods allow to quantify muscle damage/regeneration on thin needle biopsies, small enough to be performed on muscle of mice. Relevance to DMD therapy is obvious. On the light of potential risks of viral-gene therapy, major drawback of the antisense approach (i. e., lifelong frequent administrations) represents a major advantage in safety, since treatments could be temporary discontinued in case of side-effects. We are confident to pave the way to human trials by showing that the approach is safe, muscle-selective and effective, if DMD TEST will increase resistance to exercise-induced muscle injury and therefore substantially prolong viability of the dystrophic muscle...|$|R

Patient A was treated with two courses of rituximab, and B-cell regeneration was followed over 27 months by analysing more than 680 Ig-VH sequences. Peripheral B-cell depletion lasted 7 months and 10 months, respectively, and each time was accompanied by a clinical improvement. Patient B received one treatment course.

B cells regenerated well in both patients, and the repopulated B-cell repertoire was characterised by a polyclonal and diverse use of Ig-VH genes, as expected in adult individuals. During the early phase of B-cell regeneration we observed the expansion and recirculation of a highly mutated B-cell population. These cells expressed very different Ig-VH genes.

In conclusion, our study emphasizes that in silico splicing prediction and <b>mini-gene</b> splicing analysis are important for the classification of BRCA 1 missense variants located close to exon/intron boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Previously, {{transgenic}} mice {{were prepared}} that developed a lethal phenotype of fragile bones because they expressed an internally deleted <b>mini-gene</b> for the pro alpha 1 (I) chain of human type I procollagen. The shortened pro alpha 1 (I) chains synthesized {{from the human}} transgene bound to and produced degradation of normal pro alpha 1 (I) chains synthesized from the normal mouse alleles. Here we assembled an antisense gene that {{was similar to the}} internally deleted COL 1 A 1 minigene but the 3 ' half of the gene was inverted so as to code for an antisense RNA. Transgenic mice expressing the antisense gene had a normal phenotype, apparently because the antisense gene contained human sequences instead of mouse sequences. Two lines of mice expressing the antisense gene were bred to two lines of transgenic mice expressing the <b>mini-gene.</b> In mice that inherited both genes, the incidence of the lethal fragile bone phenotype was reduced from 92 % to 27 %. The effects of the antisense gene were directly demonstrated by an increase in the ratio of normal mouse pro alpha 1 (I) chains to human mini-pro alpha 1 (I) chains in tissues from mice that inherited both genes and had a normal phenotype. The results raise the possibility that chimeric gene constructs that contain intron sequences and in which only the second half of a gene is inverted may be particularly effective as antisense genes...|$|E

The reaction is complete within several minutes at 0 °C In buffer. The resulting <b>mini-gene</b> was cloned and expressed In vivo and In vitro. We {{have also found}} that the polymerase inhibition technique (toe-printing) {{is a good way to}} ascertain that translation initiation complexes form in the case of single-stranded DNAs as well. Thus, along with the fully chemical assembly of synthetic genes, a rapid and sufficiently reliable method for determining their ribosome-binding properties was developed...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{interactions}} between dopamine D 1 -like receptors and NMDA subtype glutamate receptors have {{been implicated in}} the maintenance of normal brain activity and neurological dysfunction. Although modulation of NMDA receptor functions by D 1 receptor activation {{has been the subject}} of extensive investigation, little is known as to how the activation of NMDA receptors alters D 1 function. Here we report that NMDA receptors regulate D 1 receptor function via a direct protein–protein interaction mediated by the carboxyl tail regions of both receptors. In both cotransfected cells and cultured hippocampal neurons the activation of NMDA receptors increases the number of D 1 receptors on the plasma membrane surface and enhances D 1 receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation via a SNAREdependent mechanism. Furthermore, overexpression of <b>mini-genes</b> encoding either NR 1 or D 1 carboxyl tail fragments disrupts the D 1 –NR 1 direct protein–protein interaction and abolishes NMDA-induced changes in both D 1 cell surface expression and D 1 -mediated cAMP accumulation. Our results demonstrate that the D 1 –NR 1 physical interaction enables NMDA receptors to increase plasma membrane insertion of D 1 receptors and provides a novel mechanism by which the activation of NMDA receptors upregulates D 1 receptor function. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which D 1 and NMDA receptors functionally interact may provide insight toward elucidating the molecular neurobiological mechanisms involved in many neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia.

40|$|The folding of {{interphase}} chromatin into large-scale chromatin {{structure and}} its spatial organization within nucleus {{has been suggested}} to have important roles in gene regulation. In this study, we created engineered chromatin regions consisting of tandem repeats of BAC transgenes, which contain 150 - 200 kb of defined genomic regions, and used them as a model system to study the mechanisms and functional significance of large-scale chromatin organization. The BAC transgene arrays recapitulated several important features of endogenous chromatin, including transcription level and intranuclear positioning. Using this system, we showed that tandem arrays of housekeeping gene loci form open large-scale chromatin structure independent of their genomic integration sites, including insertions within centromeric heterochromatin. This BAC-specific large-scale chromatin conformation provided a permissive environment for transcription, {{as evidenced by the}} copy-number dependent and position independent expression of embedded reporter <b>mini-genes.</b> This leads {{to the development of a}} novel method for reliable transgene expression in mammalian cells, which should prove useful in a number of therapeutic and scientific applications. 	 We also demonstrated that BAC transgene arrays can be employed as an effective system for dissecting sequence determinants for intranuclear positioning of gene loci. We showed that in mouse ES and fibroblast cells a BAC carrying a 200 kb human genomic fragment containing the beta-globin locus autonomously targets to the nuclear periphery. Using BAC recombineering, we dissected this 200 kb region and identified two genomic regions sufficient to target the BAC transgenes to nuclear periphery. This study represents a first step towards elucidation of the molecular mechanism for the nuclear peripheral localization of genes in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{computer-assisted}} reverse immunology {{approach was}} utilized {{in order to}} identify potentially antigenic peptides derived from the differentiation antigen TRP- 2, a melanosomal protein frequently expressed in melanoma. Among the seven peptides complying with HLA-A 2. 1 -binding motifs, two induced specific CD 8 (+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes. HLA-A 2. 1 (+) melanoma cells expressing TRP- 2 were lysed by clones specific for TRP- 2 (360 - 368) (TLDSQVMSL) peptide, thus identifying it as a naturally processed epitope. Other T-cell clones directed against TRP- 2 (476 - 484) (VMGTLVALV) were unable to lyse HLA-matched TRP- 2 (+) cell lines. The role of intracellular proteolytic processing in the generation of this epitope was investigated by transfecting <b>mini-genes</b> encoding the TRP- 2 (476 - 484) peptide alone or carrying N- or C-terminal extensions. Specific T-cell clones recognized target cells expressing the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) -defined epitope or its C-terminally extended precursor, but failed to recognize cells expressing the N-terminally extended TRP- 2 (476 - 484) peptide, suggesting the presence of a negative processing signal (NPS). Regarding C-terminus-flanking regions, mutational analysis indicates that the GLY 485 residue {{plays a key role in}} the processing of the TRP- 2 (476 - 484) epitope. Interestingly, proteasome inhibitors preventing the generation of the MART- 1 /Melan-A(27 - 35) immunodominant melanoma tumor-associated antigen (TAA) promoted detectable presentation of TRP- 2 (476 - 484) epitope in HLA-A 2. 1 (+) and TRP- 2 (+) tumor lines, as witnessed by cytokine release by specific T-cell clones...|$|R
40|$|Neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF 4) is {{component}} of the nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex, {{a key factor in}} biochemical pathways and innate immune responses. In this study, splice variants and functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of NCF 4 were identified to determine the variability and association of the gene with susceptibility to bovine mastitis characterized by inflammation. A novel splice variant, designated as NCF 4 -TV and characterized by the retention of a 48 bp sequence in intron 9, was detected in the mammary gland tissues of infected cows. The expression of the NCF 4 -reference main transcript in the mastitic mammary tissues was higher than that in normal tissues. A novel SNP, g. 18174 A>G, was also found in the retained 48 bp region of intron 9. To determine whether NCF 4 -TV could be due to the g. 18174 A>G mutation, we constructed two <b>mini-gene</b> expression vectors with the wild-type or mutant NCF 4 g. 18174 A>G fragment. The vectors were then transiently transfected into 293 T cells, and alternative splicing of NCF 4 was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. <b>Mini-gene</b> splicing assay demonstrated that the aberrantly spliced NCF 4 -TV with 48 bp retained fragment in intron 9 could be due to g. 18174 A>G, which was associated with milk somatic count score and increased risk of mastitis infection in cows. NCF 4 expression was also regulated by alternative splicing. This study proposes that NCF 4 splice variants generated by functional SNP are important risk factors for mastitis susceptibility in dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{properties}} of the glutamate receptor subunits 1 – 4 (GluR 1 – 4) {{are influenced by the}} alternative splicing of two homologous and mutually exclusive exons flip and flop. The flip form is most abundant during early development, while the flop form is dominant in adults. From transfections with a GluR 2 <b>mini-gene</b> we show that flip is the preferred splice form in all tested cell lines, but coexpression of the SR-proteins ASF/SF 2 and SC 35 increases the flop to flip splice ratio. The increased flop incorporation depends on ASF/SF 2 - and SC 35 -dependent enhancer elements located in the flop exon, which stimulate the splicing between the flop exon and the preceding exon 13...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We have {{generated}} mice transgenic {{for a human}} multidrug resistance (MDR) 3 <b>mini-gene</b> driven by a hamster vimentin promoter. The MDR 3 gene encodes a P-Glycoprotein that resembles the mouse multidrug resistance 2 P-Glycoprotein shown {{to be involved in}} the translocation of the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine through the hepatocyte canalicular membrane (Smit et al., 1993. Cell. 75 : 451 - 462). The vimentin promoter drives expression of the MDR 3 transgene in mesenchymal tissues and in the eye lens. We show here that the presence of human multidrug resistance 3 P-Glycoprotein in the lens results in a severe lenticular pathology. Lens structural abnormalities initiate at a late embryonic stage and increase during postnatal lens development. Differentiation of the primar...|$|E
40|$|We report two novel hypofibrinogenemias, Shizuoka III and Kanazawa II, {{which are}} caused by {{heterozygous}} mutations in FGG. Shizuoka III showed c. 147 delT and 147 _ 149 insACA in FGG exon 3 and a subsequent frameshift mutation, resulting in mature protein γ 23 X (native protein: γ 49 X), and Kanazawa II showed c. 1205 G>A in FGG exon 9, resulting in γ 376 X (native protein: γ 402 X). To determine whether the truncated γ-chains, γ 23 X and γ 376 X, were synthesized and participated in the assembly of fibrinogen, mutant-type cDNA vectors were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Significant levels of mutant fibrinogen were not detected by ELISA in the culture media and cell lysates. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates revealed that the mutant γ-chain of γ 376 X was observed but intact fibrinogen was not. On the other hand, mutant γ-chain was not observed in γ 23 X-expressing cells. To demonstrate {{the involvement of the}} mechanisms of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), we cloned wild- and mutant-type <b>mini-genes</b> containing γ 23 or γ 376 codon and transfected these into CHO cell lines in the absence or presence of cycloheximide as an NMD inhibitor. mRNA levels were determined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR in CHO cells. In the absence of cycloheximide, levels of mRNAs transcribed from the mutant gene were lower than from the wild-type gene whereas, in the presence of cycloheximide, levels of mRNAs transcribed from the mutant gene increased dose-dependently. Finally, these results demonstrated that mRNAs containing γ 23 X or γ 376 X are degraded by the NMD system and translation of the truncated γ-chain polypeptide decrease in patients' hepatocytes, resulting in hypofibrinogenemias. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{inheritance}} of germline immunoglobulin genes must ensure {{the recognition of}} prevalent pathogens {{and the ability to}} adapt to new pathogens. The current understanding of the generation of diversity of immunoglobulin binding sites involves the recombination of the B-lymphocyte germline genes during development. In general, the production of immunoglobulins proceeds with the help of T-lymphocytes through a process called "affinity maturation" involving mutations that increase antigen specificity. Carbohydrate epitopes, however, do not illicit such a response, and so are more dependent on the primary germline repertoire. Although anti-carbohydrate antibodies exhibit exquisite specificity, to date there have been few structural reports of complexes due to their low binding affinities. Here, high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of antigen-binding fragments from two highly homologous immunoglobulins S 25 - 2 and S 45 - 18 in their unliganded forms and bound to several carbohydrate epitopes of 3 -deoxy- D-manno-oct- 2 -ulosonic acid (Kdo) found in Gram-negative bacteria including members of the family Chlamydiaceae. The combining sites of both immunoglobulins are similarly composed of a common germline-conserved "pocket" that binds a non-reducing terminal Kdo monosaccharide, and a "groove"-like remainder of the binding site that uses the same residues multiply in interactions with different epitopes {{in the case of the}} germline-conserved S 25 - 2, or that has undergone mutations that enhance the specificity for a single epitope in the case of S 45 - 18. The structural basis of this adaptability is accomplished firstly, by the combination of a specific set of germline VH and Vkappa genes that encodes a binding pocket that recognizes the non-reducing terminal Kdo; secondly, by a difference in the nature of the D and JH <b>mini-genes</b> between S 25 - 2 and S 45 - 18; and thirdly, by the contributions of conserved germline residues compared to regions of amino acid mutation. Furthermore, the strategy of coupling a strict binding pocket with a more adaptive region demonstrates how anti-carbohydrate immunoglobulins can bind a limited range of related epitopes without necessarily incurring the entropic penalty of immobilisation of flexible regions...|$|R
40|$|Muscleblind (Mbl) is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{family of}} proteins involved in {{many aspects of}} RNA metabolism, including alternative splicing. Disruption of Muscleblind in several animals lends {{to a variety of}} defects and disease, including the multi-systemic disorder Myotonic Dystrophy (DM). Though much is known about the involvement of Muscleblind in DM, there is much basic knowledge of the protein's function to be discovered. We approach this problem by exploring the functional conservation of a diverse subset of Muscleblind homologs. The functions of Muscleblinds from a basal metazoan, Trichoplax adhaerens, a primitive chordate, Ciona intestinalis, and the model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans were compared to human Muscleblind-like (MBNL). The zinc finger RNA-binding domains are the most conserved region between homologs, suggesting a conserved role in RNA binding and splicing regulation. To test this, we used splicing reporter assays with validated human MBNL-regulated <b>mini-genes</b> and performed RNA sequencing experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Additionally, we accessed the subcellular localization of the homologs to determine conservation of extra-nuclear functions. Reporter assays in HeLa cells showed that the homologs can positively and negatively regulate splicing. Our RNA-seq experiments led us to discover hundreds of endogenously regulated splicing events, including the identity of the transcripts, direction of splicing regulation, types of splicing events, and the magnitude of alternate exon inclusion in the spliced mRNAs. Additionally, we identified a spectrum of splicing events, from those uniquely regulated by a single Muscleblind, to events regulated by all Muscleblinds, and, characterized the variation in splicing activity that exists between homologs. A subset of events regulated by mammalian Muscleblind were oppositely regulated by non-mammalian homologs. Muscleblinds show nuclear-cytoplasmic localization, which suggests conservation in extra-nuclear functions. In conjunction with exon and intron sequences, this information provides a future tool to discover conserved and novel RNA regulatory elements used by diverse Muscleblinds to regulate splicing and in putative cytoplasmic functions. These data could also be used to determine functionally important residues in Muscleblind proteins and help us better understand the protein family. by Julia C. Oddo. Thesis: S.
