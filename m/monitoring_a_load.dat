40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{developed}} with the aim to explore thoroughly potential and limit of the GPR and ERT methods for monitoring heterogeneous structures where different construction materials are combined together. Firstly we analysed the GPR response, in various construction materials related to different modern, historical or archaeological structures. In particular, three real examples were investigated during the thesis, namely: the Pyramid of Caius Cestius, the Passage of Commodus and the Colle Oppio Ninpheum, all in Rome. According to {{the different types of}} material and frequency antennas, different GPR responses and therefore dissimilar degree of resolution and of attenuation was obtained. In light of this, the interposition between the surface of the investigated medium and the GPR antenna of a dielectric material (e. g. Plexiglas) was performed in order to improve the resolution. Furthermore, an application of the GPR and ERT methods for <b>monitoring</b> <b>a</b> <b>load</b> test executed on masonry samples was presented. This panels were built up in the laboratory controlled conditions using tuff and bricks (widespread materials employed in Italy for decades for masonry buildings) and also were reproduced in the phase of theoretical modeling. The laboratory samples are reinforced with a conductive fibre fabric, where a high-conductive material (steel wires) is combined together with a dielectric material (basalt fibre). In order to improve the sample-antenna coupling in the presence of conductive reinforcements, a Plexiglas (polimetilmetacrilato - PMMA) plate was added underneath a 2 GHz antenna. GPR data were acquired along profiles spaced 0. 1 m apart and ERT measurements were executed on a 0. 1 m regular spaced grid with a dipole-dipole array operating in a three-dimensional configuration. GPR datasets were also analysed in non-conventional mode, by means of the picking of the reflection time of the EM wave from the rear face of the wall samples. Results show that GPR and electrical resistivity tomography were both able to detect fractures and weakness zones caused by the load application, even though with a higher resolution for the georadar with respect to the geoelectrical method. Moreover, mapping the GPR data in terms of the dielectric constant and mean absolute amplitude is particularly diagnostic to detect the effective fracturing pattern, after the application of the diagonal load. Therefore, GPR and ERT methods can reduce the degree of uncertainty in the detection of fractures, voids or cavities, with respect to the standard processing, by the combined analysis of radargrams, time-slices and resistivity ERT models. Furthermore, for the GPR laboratory data acquired directly on the reinforced face of samples, it is demonstrated how interposing a layer of dielectric material between the antenna and the structure can substantially improve the antenna coupling and consequently the capability to detect fractures and to reach the rear face of the sample, despite losing resolution in the case of shallow high-conductive layers. Finally, three-dimensional synthetic simulations on the same samples validate the experimental evidences. Therefore, we demonstrate that this approach can be a reliable tool to monitor static load tests and it can be further extended to the whole load cycle (before, during and after the experiment) ...|$|E

40|$|Online load {{tracking}} is {{the problem}} of <b>monitoring</b> <b>an</b> in-dividual electrical <b>load’s</b> energy usage by analyzing a build-ing’s smart meter data. The problem is important, since many energy optimizations require fine-grained, per-load en-ergy data in real time; it also differs from the well-studied problem of load disaggregation in that it emphasizes effi-cient, online operation and per-load accuracy, rather than accurate disaggregation of every building load via offline analysis. In essence, tracking <b>a</b> particular <b>load</b> creates <b>a</b> vir-tual power meter for it, which mimics having a networked-connected power meter attached to it.

In fact, for beams with a given concrete compressive strength, a decrease in beam’s deformation was measured for higher steel-bar-reinforcement percentages.

As such, knowledge of the friction and wear performance of commonly used ceramic materials is {{of interest to the}} bio-tribology community. In this paper, three commonly-used material combinations were tested to assess their wear performance for use in biomedical applications. Testing was performed in a pin-on-disk tribometer constructed by the Cardiff Tribology Group. The material combinations tested were (A) zirconia pin on alumina disk, (B) zirconia pin on zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) disk, and (C) ruby pin on ZTA disk.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the design of reflective load management services for middleware, tackling the main problems in existing load management services. The system is designed using a modular architecture. The two key benefits of the approach are th a t modules can be dynamically activated and deactivated as required, enabling the minimisation of the overhead introduced by the system, and th a t new modules with enhanced functionality can easily (and dynamically) be introduced into the system. The system comprises of <b>a</b> <b>load</b> <b>monitoring</b> module, <b>a</b> <b>load</b> prediction module, <b>a</b> <b>load</b> evaluation module and <b>a</b> <b>load</b> distribution module. Each module has a clearly defined role in the system and a well defined interface. The load evaluation module offers the possibility of dynamically changing the distribution algorithm. The modularity of the system is further extended to the monitoring, workload prediction and load distribution components, so that new monitors and algorithms can be added at runtime. A novelty of the proposed approach consists in the inclusion of QoS in the load management system, thus making it transparent to the managed applications. This approach offers increased flexibility and reusability because QoS can be added to existing (non QoS-aware) applications without the hurdle of changing the code. The response time metric is used for QoS level differentiation. An important characteristic of our load management service is that it is transparent to distributed application developers. The design of the load management system ensures high availability by including <b>a</b> simple <b>load</b> distribution mechanism in the distribution module. Another novelty of this approach is the automatic selection of the optimal load distribution algorithm at runtime, according to current system state and workload. It is considered th a t the most important performance metric for system performance is the response time. An important achievement of such <b>a</b> reflective <b>load</b> management service is that it adapts itself at runtime to workload/environment changes without user intervention. A simulation model was created to evaluate existing load distribution algorithms. The model was extended to offer simulation scalability (e. g. the number of servers can be easily changed) and to support the evaluation of the newly proposed load distribution algorithm. The influence of the workload on the performance of the distribution algorithm was also investigated. The research approach employed carrying out an extensive literature survey in order to identify the main problems in existing load management services. These problems represented the ground for the framework proposed in this thesis. It {{is beyond the scope of}} this thesis to validate the entire framework thus only the key elements of the framework have been investigated in detail and validated using simulations...|$|R

A piezoelectric disk for recording muscle sounds was placed over rectus femoris at approximately mid-thigh and secured with a rubber electromyography (EMG) strap. Contact pressure was <b>monitored</b> by <b>a</b> <b>load</b> cell placed between the AMG device and the strap. With the subject seated, force at different percentage levels of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were held for 5 s each. Both AMG and EMG recordings were full-wave rectified and integrated (IAMG and IEMG) and expressed {{as a percentage of}} activity at MVC. Two contraction series were performed with 2 different contact pressures. Pressure 1 (P 1), of 180 Pa was applied in all subjects. A higher pressure of either 790 Pa (P 2; in 5 subjects) or 1200 Pa (P 3; in 15 subjects) was also applied. No significant changes in IAMG activity (P > 0. 1) occurred between P 1 and P 2 but P 3 produced increases in IAMG at all force levels (P < 0. 05 at 10, 50 and 75 % MVC). Both linear and non-linear relationships between force and IAMG were observed in different subjects but the relationship also varied with the 2 contact pressures within some subjects. The force/IEMG relationship was linear in all cases. These results provide quantitative evidence that contact pressure can influence the degree of IAMG activity if the pressure is high enough. The change in the force/IAMG relationship with pressure in some subjects suggests that the different relationships observed are not determined by physiological differences between subjects but rather by technical factors...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} the autoignition of wood is performed. In the experiment, a wood sample (redwood) of 4 by 4 cm surface area with 4 cm thickness is exposed vertically to a heater panel in a cone calorimeter. The surface temperature is continuously measured by an infrared thermocouple and mass loss is <b>monitored</b> by <b>a</b> <b>load</b> cell. Incident heat flux is varied until glowing ignition could not occur. Times to glowing ignition and flaming autoignition are measured. It is found experimentally that the critical heat flux for flaming autoignition is 20 kW/m 2 and for glowing ignition is 10 kW/m 2. A theoretical model for autoignition of wood is developed. The model considers the processes occurring in both solid and gas phases. In the solid phase, a one-dimensional heat conduction model is employed. Char surface oxidation, {{which can lead to}} glowing ignition, is taken into account at the solid-gas interface surface. By "glowing ignition", it means the onset of surface combustion. Criteria for glowing ignition are developed based on a surface energy balance. A numerical result shows that according to the present glowing ignition criteria, an inflection point of the surface temperature history can indicate glowing ignition. In the gas phase, a transient two-dimensional laminar boundary layer approximation for gas phase transport equations is constructed. The gas phase model is coupled with the solid phase model via the solid-gas interface surface. Flaming autoignition occurs when the maximum gas reaction rate exceeds a critical value. A numerical result from the coupled gas phase and solid phase models shows that autoignition of the combustible gases behaves in two fashions as autoignition type I at high heat flux and autoignition type II at low heat flux. In the type I autoignition, the flaming occurs just an instant after glowing ignition is initiated, while in the type II autoignition, the solid undergoes glowing ignition long before the flaming is achieved. Comparisons between the {{theoretical and}} experimental results are presented to demonstrate capabilities and limitations of the proposed model...|$|R

The NILM is a device that measures an electrical component's performance by applying a single voltage and current transducer to a ship's existing power distribution system. The NILM was originally developed to monitor electrical power usage in buildings where it was noticed that it could disaggregate and report the operation of individual loads when many loads were present. The limits of this capability are explored by employing a signal processing script in MATLAB using component data gathered on the USCGC SENECA (WMEC- 906). The plausibility of using a few NILMs to provide machinery <b>monitoring</b> information for <b>an</b> entire engineering space, and the resulting opportunity to reduce sensor growth on future Navy ships is explored. Then efforts to monitor naval propulsion plant machinery with the NILM are discussed. Two NILMs were constructed and installed on selected individual components at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia DDG- 51 Land Based Engineering Site (LBES). (cont.) Monitoring of the Fuel Oil and Low Pressure Air Service Systems was conducted during a week long certification of the pre-commissioning crew of the USS BAINBRIDGE (DDG- 96). Data collected was then used to explore {{the use of}} the NILM as a diagnostic device for shipboard systems through the evaluation of mechanical transients in the Fuel Oil system and a test leak inserted into the Low Pressure Air System. Additionally, a brief overview of the Multi-function <b>Monitor</b> (MFM), <b>a</b> type of electrical protection equipment installed on many US Navy ships, is provided. The MFM could provide a natural installation point on the ship's power distribution system to <b>monitor</b> <b>a</b> multiple <b>loads.</b> Finally, <b>an</b> evaluation of the NILM as an enabling technology for Navy CBM was conducted. The Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) is the U. S. Navy's "Program of Record" for CBM and is currently installed on over 97 ships fleet wide. NILM data from individual components at the LBES was monitored simultaneously with ICAS and the results are compared. by William C. Greene. Thesis (S. M.)

30|$|The MAG i {{performs}} <b>a</b> <b>load</b> {{balancing procedure}} according to three cases. Therefore, when <b>a</b> <b>load</b> of MAG i exceeds a specific threshold or if its cluster head HMAG j sends <b>a</b> <b>load</b> balancing request {{or if the}} LMA orders the HMAG j, to perform <b>a</b> <b>load</b> balancing, which in turn moves this order to the related MAG i. After that, the MAG i starts to perform <b>a</b> <b>load</b> balancing procedure by choosing the appropriate HMN from the overlapped area to perform a handover action. This HMN selection is performed as presented earlier.|$|R
40|$|An open-dug caisson shaft {{is a form}} of {{top-down}} {{construction in}} which a concrete shaft is sunk into the ground using the weight of the shaft and additional kentledge, if required. Excavation {{at the base of the}} caisson shaft wall allows the structure to descend through the ground. A thorough understanding of the interaction between the caisson shaft and soil is essential to maintain controlled sinking of the caisson. In this paper, the failure mechanisms developed beneath caisson blades in sand are investigated. A series of laboratory tests were carried out at the University of Oxford to explore how varying blade angles affect the performance of the bearing capacity beneath the caisson. Cutting angles of 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 ° and 90 ° (flat) were penetrated into sand under plane strain conditions; forces were <b>monitored</b> using <b>a</b> Cambridge-type <b>load</b> cell while soil displacements were recorded using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The aim of this study is to understand how the soil failure mechanism develops and to determine the optimum cutting angle. The results of the laboratory tests can be scaled to predict the likely behaviour in the field. Results show that the bearing capacity is significantly dependent on the cutting angle; in a dense sand a steep cutting angle may be used to aid sinking of the caisson...|$|R
