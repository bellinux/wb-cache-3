This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract A Ru-catalyzed <b>mono-arylation</b> in a-position of saturated cyclic amines is reported employing a Câ€“H activation protocol. Substitution of the pyridine directing {{group with a}} bulky group, e. g., trifluoromethyl in the 3 -position, proved to be crucial to avoid bis-arylation. This highly selective transformation can be performed with different amines and arylboronate esters. Additionally, the directing group can be cleaved, taking advantage of an unprecedented detrifluoromethylation reaction...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} palladium-catalyzed site-selective arylation of gamma-vinyl-gamma-lactone by aryl boronic acid {{has been}} developed. gamma-Vinyl-gamma-lactone la has been contemplated as allyl electrophile donor for allylic arylation via pi-allyl palladium intermediate using 1. 5 equiv of aryl boronic acid 2. Using 3. 0 equiv {{of the latter}} resulted in <b>mono-arylation</b> by allylic substitution and subsequent site-selective second arylation by directed allylic C-H activation giving stereoselectively anti-gamma-(aryl,styryl) -beta-hydroxy acids. Presence of O- 2 was crucial for the second arylation via Pd(II) catalysis. Thus, a good synergy of dual catalysis by Pd(0) and Pd(II) was observed. This methodology has been elaborated to synthesize highly substituted tetrahydrofurans including aryl-Hagen's gland lactone analogues via intramolecular iodoetherification...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of C-H functionalization to medicinally important 2 -pyridyl-based N-heterocycles suffers from severe challenges {{owing to the}} high Lewis basicity of the N-atom. This arrests catalytic activity and yields undesirable positional selectivity due to preferential chelate formation. In this regard, we report a novel palladium(II) -catalyzed arylation strategy on multiple-N-containing pyridazines by over-riding the functionalization due to a chelated palladacycle. We report a regioselective <b>mono-arylation</b> at the 8 -position of diphenyl azolopyridazines without any ortho-C-H activation on the proximal phenyl groups. This methodology presents a broad arylation scope with uncompromised yield and positional selectivity, including the heteroarylation of N-heterocycles, which is an unprecedented feat for these types of molecules...|$|E
