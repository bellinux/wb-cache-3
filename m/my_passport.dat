In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on <b>my</b> <b>passport,</b> that's all you need to know. I would stay away from that subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. I knew it would be like a label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E

60|$|In {{this manner}} some {{ten or fifteen}} {{thousand}} were swept away in a few weeks. Not only hotels, but, in some instances, nearly whole streets were depopulated. As every one fled, who could with convenience or propriety quit the town, you may feel surprised that we chose to remain. When the deaths increased to eight or nine hundred a day, and our own quarter began to be visited, I felt {{it to be a}} duty to those under my charge, to retire to some of the places without the limits of the disease. The trunks were packed, the carriage was in the court, and <b>my</b> <b>passports</b> were signed, when A---- was suddenly taken ill. Although the disease was not the cholera, I began to calculate the chances of any one of us being seized, myself for instance, in one of the villages of the environs, and the helpless condition of a family of females in a foreign country, under such circumstances. The result was a determination to remain, and to trust to Providence. We have consequently staid in our apartments through it all, although two slight cases have occurred in the hotel, and hundreds around it.|$|R

60|$|When I {{went to the}} American {{consulate}} to regularise <b>my</b> <b>passports,</b> I {{was capable}} of expecting the American consulate to be American. Embassies and consulates are by tradition like islands of the soil for which they stand; and I have often found the tradition corresponding to a truth. I have seen the unmistakable French official living on omelettes and a little wine and serving his sacred abstractions under the last palm-trees fringing a desert. In the heat and noise of quarrelling Turks and Egyptians, I have come suddenly, as with the cool shock of his own shower-bath, on the listless amiability of the English gentleman. The officials I interviewed were very American, especially in being very polite; for whatever {{may have been the}} mood or meaning of Martin Chuzzlewit, I have always found Americans by far the politest people in the world. They put in my hands a form to be filled up, to all appearance like other forms I had filled up in other passport offices. But in reality it was very different from any form I had ever filled up in my life. At least it was a little like a freer form of the game called 'Confessions' which my friends and I invented in our youth; an examination paper containing questions like, 'If you saw a rhinoceros in the front garden, what would you do?' One of my friends, I remember, wrote, 'Take the pledge.' But that is another story, and might bring Mr. Pussyfoot Johnson on the scene before his time.|$|R
