25|$|Reproductive {{advantages}} of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the {{advantages of}} the hermaphrodite forms – in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of {{at least half of the}} diversity. So, the <b>main</b> <b>question</b> is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.|$|E
25|$|Among the 5 million, 771,844 were {{military}} casualties {{killed in}} action and other causes. The military only covers 15% of the total casualties. The <b>main</b> <b>question</b> {{is what happened to}} 85% (spread over all millets) of the casualties, which is more but not less than 4,000,000. Ottoman statistics analyzed by Turkish Kamer Kasim (Manchester University, Ph.D.), claims that cumulative percentage was 26.9% (higher than 25% reported by western sources) of the population, which this size stands out among the countries that took part in World War I. To understand the size of the issue, Kamer Kasım's %1.9 increase on the totals adds 399,000 civilians to the total number, which has not been reported in western sources.|$|E
25|$|In 1897 Victor Berger {{decided to}} work at {{converting}} the Social Democracy of America, an organization established {{with the goal of}} constructing a socialist colony in some western American state into a full-fledged socialist political party. He gathered together Debs, Stedman, and others for this cause, which came to a climax at the heated June 1898 convention of the organization. The battle over the <b>main</b> <b>question</b> of colonization versus independent political action was won by the colonization faction by a vote of 53 to 37, a result that caused Berger, Debs, Stedman, and their co-thinkers to bolt the convention and establish a new political organization of their own — the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP).|$|E

25|$|Su Shi {{seems to}} have {{represented}} himself, as according with the legal tradition in China at the time, as {{would have been the}} case also with the other accused. His defence relied on admitting that he criticized the New Policy legislation, and its partisans at court. This criticism was legal, and his poetry would not have been needed to demonstrate that he was critical of these policies. Su Shi had in fact memorialized the emperor explicitly detailing his thoughts and feelings in this regard, in forceful prose (for a sample translation, see de Bary, 425-431). To avoid conviction, it was necessary for Su Shi to avoid the prosecution being able to prove that he had criticized or demeaned the emperor or his dynasty: using poetry to give indirect advice to the emperor which involved criticism of his subordinates and suggested policy improvements could be construed as a service to the state, and indeed there was a time-honored tradition of doing so, dating back through the earliest phases of the Chinese poetic tradition. The <b>main</b> <b>question</b> was: did Su Shi's poems cross the line from criticizing the imperial subordinates and their actions, or did his criticism extend to actually defaming the emperor himself? Whether Su Shi had crossed this line was also key {{in the case of the}} other persons accused, as their indictments centered around publishing or disseminating Su Shi's poems, which if illegally found to defame the emperor, automatically made them guilty of criminal conspiracy, if found that they were even merely aware of the poems and failed to report them to the authorities.|$|E
25|$|June 2005 saw the Billy Wright inquiry open, {{chaired by}} Lord MacLean. Also {{sitting on the}} inquiry were {{academic}} professor Andrew Coyle from the University of London and the former Bishop of Hereford, the Reverend John Oliver. On 14 September 2010, {{the findings of the}} panel were released publicly at Stormont House in Belfast and found that {{there was no evidence of}} collusion between the authorities and the INLA. The inquiry, which had cost £30 million, did find a number of failings within the security of the prison. There was the <b>main</b> <b>question</b> of how the weapons were successfully smuggled inside the prison to the killers. There was also the issue regarding the decision to house the INLA and LVF in H Block 6, when it was known that they were deadly rivals, neither of which was on ceasefire, and the INLA had vowed to kill Wright given the opportunity. McWilliams and Kennaway had been transferred to the Maze from Maghaberry the previous May. One month before their transfer, when Wright had still been at Maghaberry, they had organised an unsuccessful hostage-taking incident at the prison. This was meant to end in the assassination of Wright; he was subsequently moved to the Maze. Other questions were raised after the discovery that on the morning of the killing, Prison Officer Raymond Hill was stood down from his post in the watchtower overlooking A and B wings of H-Block 6 where the INLA prisoners were housed. The CCTV camera placed in the area was also found to have been nonfunctioning for several days prior to the shooting. The visitors lists for 27 December 1997 had been circulated in both the LVF and INLA wings the day before thereby giving Wright's assassins time to prepare for the killing as the list clearly stated that Wright was scheduled to receive a visit on 27 December. The LVF prison van had been parked outside the INLA wing that morning instead of following the normal procedure which was to park outside the LVF wing. And the gates leading from the forecourt were automatically locked as soon as the killers were spotted on the roof. This had prevented the van from driving off and thus effectively trapped Wright in the rear.|$|E
500|$|Boys Don't Cry {{has been}} widely {{discussed}} and analyzed by scholars and others. Roger Ebert described the film as a [...] "romantic tragedy" [...] embedded in a working class American setting, calling it [...] "Romeo and Juliet set in a Nebraska trailer park". Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued {{that the question of}} identity—particularly Brandon's—is alluded to frequently in Boys Don't Cry and that Peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the film's <b>main</b> <b>question.</b> Journalist Janet Maslin said the film is about accepting identity, which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity. Paula Nechak called the film a [...] "bold cautionary tale"; she regarded the film as a negative, dismal depiction of Midwestern America, writing that [...] " [...] captured the mystique and eerie loneliness" [...] and [...] "isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to violence and despair".|$|E

500|$|The {{referendum}} {{question which}} the party proposed was announced on 28 November 1996: [...] "Do {{you want the}} United Kingdom {{to be part of}} a federal Europe or do you want the United Kingdom to return to an association of sovereign nations that are part of a common trading market?" [...] The political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh noted that this question was often mocked for its [...] "unrealistic ambiguity", and some journalists referred to Goldsmith's venture as the [...] "Referendum Only Party". Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was [...] "wholly agnostic" [...] about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue. However, the wording of the party's <b>main</b> <b>question</b> led one group of political scientists to note that it [...] "clearly revealed Goldsmith's Eurosceptic colours" [...] and that the wider pronouncements of the party became increasingly Eurosceptic as time went on.|$|E
500|$|As Hardwicke {{had decided}} to {{interpret}} the Statute of Anne as for the public good, the <b>main</b> <b>question</b> of the case became which [...] "any such book or books" [...] the act referred to and protected. The defendants argued that his abridgement must be considered separate from the original work published by Gyles. The defendant's lawyers furthered pushed the court to try the case as if the abridgement had been recorded in the Stationers' Register, an action {{that would have given}} Wilcox and Nutt the right to publish their book, and the lawsuit brought against a second, unique book. Therefore, the only question before the court was whether the second book differentiated sufficiently from the first. Further, the attorneys for the defendants argued that the book was not a direct transcription, but that several chapters had been omitted, while other, original sections had been added to the Wilcox and Nutt publication. They further pointed {{to the fact that the}} Gyles' publication consisted of 275 sheets, whereas the abridgement contained only 35 sheets.|$|E
500|$|For Georgian England, {{the story}} of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. [...] Little {{attention}} was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to [...] "go their way"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). [...] The author Kristina Straub compares {{the case with the}} more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a [...] "childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws", or [...] "a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds". [...] The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal [...] "her own criminal Transactions in the Dark". [...] Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather [...] "the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order." [...] In the end, however, such modern theorizing is only a distraction from the <b>main</b> <b>question</b> – innocent or guilty? ...|$|E
