5|$|After Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds</b> {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many {{physicists}} began studying these <b>manifolds.</b> In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds</b> giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the <b>manifolds</b> are called mirror <b>manifolds,</b> and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds.</b> The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds</b> look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.|$|E
5|$|By {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds</b> and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came {{from the work of}} Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds</b> by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.|$|E
50|$|In {{dynamical}} systems, {{a branch}} of mathematics, an invariant <b>manifold</b> is a topological <b>manifold</b> that is invariant under {{the action of the}} dynamical system. Examples include the slow <b>manifold,</b> center <b>manifold,</b> stable <b>manifold,</b> unstable <b>manifold,</b> subcenter <b>manifold</b> and inertial <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
25|$|Note that Sp(n) ⊂ SU(2n) ⊂ U(2n) ⊂ SO(4n), {{so every}} hyperkähler <b>manifold</b> is a Calabi–Yau <b>manifold,</b> every Calabi–Yau <b>manifold</b> is a Kähler <b>manifold,</b> and every Kähler <b>manifold</b> is orientable.|$|R
50|$|A {{combinatorial}} <b>manifold</b> {{is a kind}} of <b>manifold</b> {{which is}} discretization of a <b>manifold.</b> It usually means a piecewise linear <b>manifold</b> made by simplicial complexes. A digital <b>manifold</b> is a special kind of combinatorial <b>manifold</b> which is defined in digital space i.e. grid cell space.|$|R
5|$|Homotopy {{groups of}} spheres {{are closely related}} to cobordism classes of <b>manifolds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Riemannian <b>manifolds</b> are <b>manifolds</b> whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a {{suitable}} inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E
5|$|Immersed curves on Riemannian <b>manifolds,</b> with finitely many self-crossings, become self-tangent {{only at a}} {{discrete}} set of times, at each of which they lose a crossing. As a consequence the number of self-crossing points is non-decreasing.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, an {{analytic}} <b>manifold</b> is a topological <b>manifold</b> with analytic transition maps. Every complex <b>manifold</b> is an analytic <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, {{a digital}} <b>manifold</b> {{is a special}} kind of {{combinatorial}} <b>manifold</b> which is defined in digital space i.e. grid cell space. A combinatorial <b>manifold</b> is a kind of <b>manifold</b> which is a discretization of a <b>manifold.</b> It usually means a piecewise linear <b>manifold</b> made by simplicial complexes.|$|R
50|$|The real <b>manifold</b> {{underlying}} any Kähler <b>manifold</b> is a symplectic <b>manifold.</b> The strong Lefschetz theorem {{tells us}} that {{it is also a}} strong Lefschetz <b>manifold,</b> and hence a Lefschetz <b>manifold.</b> Therefore we have the following chain of inclusions.|$|R
5|$|Spacetime {{events are}} not {{absolutely}} defined spatially and temporally but rather are known {{relative to the}} motion of an observer. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian <b>manifolds</b> of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. String theory postulates the existence of additional dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The set of {{one-dimensional}} subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional {{vector space}} V {{is known as}} projective space; it {{may be used to}} formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity. Grassmannians and flag <b>manifolds</b> generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension k and flags of subspaces, respectively.|$|E
5|$|More recently, <b>manifolds</b> {{have become}} {{available}} which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These <b>manifolds</b> may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These <b>manifolds</b> can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{learning}} the geometry of a non-linear <b>manifold</b> in the ambient Euclidean space into which the <b>manifold</b> is embedded. We propose a bottom-up approach to <b>manifold</b> approximation using tangent planes where the number of planes is adaptive to <b>manifold</b> curvature. Also, we exploit the lo-cal linearity of the <b>manifold</b> to subsample the <b>manifold</b> data before using it to learn the <b>manifold</b> geometry with negligible loss of ap-proximation accuracy. In our experiments, our proposed Geometry Preserving Union-of-Affine Subspaces algorithm shows more than a 100 -times decrease in the learning time when compared to state-of-the-art <b>manifold</b> learning algorithm, while achieving similar approx-imation accuracy.

50|$|The unit pseudoscalar of {{the vector}} <b>manifold</b> is a (pseudoscalar-valued) {{function}} of the points on the vector <b>manifold.</b> If i.e. this function is smooth then one says that the vector <b>manifold</b> is smooth. A <b>manifold</b> {{can be defined as}} a set isomorphic to a vector <b>manifold.</b> The points of a <b>manifold</b> do not have any algebraic structure and pertain only to the set itself. This is the main difference between a vector <b>manifold</b> and a <b>manifold</b> that is isomorphic. A vector <b>manifold</b> is always a subset of Universal Geometric Algebra by definition and the elements can be manipulated algebraically. In contrast, a <b>manifold</b> is not a subset of any set other than itself, but the elements have no algebraic relation among them.|$|R
25|$|<b>Manifolds</b> with a {{vanishing}} Ricci tensor, , {{are referred}} to as Ricci-flat <b>manifolds</b> and <b>manifolds</b> with a Ricci tensor proportional to the metric as Einstein <b>manifolds.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} differentiable <b>manifolds</b> are smooth and analytic <b>manifolds.</b> For smooth <b>manifolds</b> the transition maps are smooth, that is infinitely differentiable. Analytic <b>manifolds</b> are smooth <b>manifolds</b> {{with the additional}} condition that the transition maps are analytic (they can be expressed as power series). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Whitehead torsion is {{important}} in applying surgery theory to non-simply connected <b>manifolds</b> of dimension>4: for simply-connected <b>manifolds,</b> the Whitehead group vanishes, and thus homotopy equivalences and simple homotopy equivalences are the same. The applications are to differentiable <b>manifolds,</b> PL <b>manifolds</b> and topological <b>manifolds.</b> The proofs were first obtained in the early 1960s by Stephen Smale, for differentiable <b>manifolds.</b> The development of handlebody theory allowed much the same proofs in the differentiable and PL categories. The proofs are much harder in the topological category, requiring the theory of Kirby and Siebenmann. The restriction to <b>manifolds</b> of dimension >4 are due to {{the application of the}} Whitney trick for removing double points.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, {{and more}} {{specifically}} in differential geometry, a Hermitian <b>manifold</b> is the complex analogue of a Riemannian <b>manifold.</b> More precisely, a Hermitian <b>manifold</b> is a complex <b>manifold</b> with a smoothly varying Hermitian inner product on each (holomorphic) tangent space. One can also define a Hermitian <b>manifold</b> as a real <b>manifold</b> with a Riemannian metric that preserves a complex structure.|$|R
50|$|The term complex <b>manifold</b> is {{variously}} used to mean {{a complex}} <b>manifold</b> in the sense above (which can be specified as an integrable complex <b>manifold),</b> and an almost complex <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{is because}} special holonomy <b>manifolds</b> admit covariantly {{constant}} (parallel) spinors and thus preserve some {{fraction of the}} original supersymmetry. Most important are compactifications on Calabi–Yau <b>manifolds</b> with SU(2) or SU(3) holonomy. Also important are compactifications on G2 <b>manifolds.</b>|$|E
25|$|Geometric {{topology}} primarily studies <b>manifolds</b> {{and their}} embeddings (placements) in other <b>manifolds.</b> A particularly active area is low-dimensional topology, which studies <b>manifolds</b> {{of four or}} fewer dimensions.

25|$|For <b>manifolds</b> of {{dimension}} at most 6, any {{piecewise linear}} (PL) structure can be smoothed in an essentially unique way, so {{in particular the}} theory of 4 dimensional PL <b>manifolds</b> {{is much the same}} as the theory of 4 dimensional smooth <b>manifolds.</b>|$|E
