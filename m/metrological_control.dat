40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the most important innovations introduced by the Metrology Act 2014, which is structured into three thematic blocks: measurement units, <b>metrological</b> <b>control</b> and a penalty system. This act has a continuist character and collects, merges and perfects the prior national regulation background. In addition, it incorporates issues related to technical developments, the standardisation of international organisations, as well as it covers relevant gaps. As for measurement units, its greatest contribution is the regulation of reference materials, which plays an important role, primarily in the area of chemical measurements. Regarding the State <b>metrological</b> <b>control,</b> without prejudice to certain developments such as those related to “witness instruments”, the authorisation to set their useful life or the prohibition of repairing certain measuring instruments, the most notable aspect is the profound transformation introduced in the organisation of the State <b>metrological</b> <b>control.</b> In particular, the transformation in the intervention of third parties who will be able to act throughout the national territory, thus eliminating the scope for decisions that the autonomous communities have had until now in order to define the organisational model. Finally, the Act establishes a new disciplinary framework, which offers a wide range of infringements and the introduction of appropriate rules concerning the determination of a penalty. This is intended to solve the originated problems from a legalistic perspective. Grupo de investigación de la Junta de Andalucía SEJ- 196.

Nuclear forensics deals with consistency of information, coherence between materials or samples, conformity of findings with declared processes and comparison of external and internal data. Representative samples are measured by respective networks of laboratories. For nuclear safeguards these are the Euratom safeguards and the IAEA Network of Analytical laboratories (IAEA-NWAL). For nuclear forensics, the laboratories are mainly members of the Nuclear Forensics International Technical Working Group (ITWG). <b>Metrological</b> quality <b>control</b> tools are a means to establish accurate, traceable and comparable measurement results. The European Commission-Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC) has therefore put effort into the development of certified reference materials and the provision of conformity assessment tools, particularly for "age-dating" of uranium and plutonium samples, which is of importance to both communities. In this context the new IRMM- 1000 a and IRMM- 1000 b, certified for the production date based on the 230 Th/ 234 U radiochronometer, will be presented, and the results from the Regular European Inter-laboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP- 22) on 'U Age Dating' will be discussed.

However there are few specific regulations for cork. Therefore metrological strategies to assure reliability of analytical measurement results are crucial {{to ensure that the}} quantification of chemical contaminants are effectively in line with limits established in law. In this work a general approach is described for implementation of metrological traceability covering all analytical procedure for determination of Arsenic, Lead, Nickel, Chromium and Cadmium contents in cork stoppers with the potential to migrate to beverages. A flowchart diagram to identify the critical points of experimental procedure that need to be under metrological conditions is described. The experimental procedure encompasses the test conditions to simulate migrations for beverages, digestion procedure and determination by ICP-MS. The most important <b>metrological</b> <b>control</b> points to assure that measurements will be traceable to SI were: validation of analytical method to assure correct identification and quantification of metal under study; measurement of recovery of the spikes to estimate analyte lost during the digestion of samples; use of appropriate calibrants to calibrate the ICP-MS; regular participations in PT schemes for contaminants under study; estimation of associated measurement uncertainties.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this article}} were: to test the hydrometric accuracy of some water level variation measuring and recording devices using a metal measuring tank with weir, and to automatically determine runoff intensities and elements. These field tests were performed {{in order to ensure}} high accuracy and low uncertainty of studies at hydrological micro-scale (plot scale). Hydrometric tests targeted two level measurement conditions: (i) rise and storage - without overflowing, volumetric measurement V= f (H); and (ii) rise and overflowing, weir measurement Q = f (H). Hydrometric accuracy was evaluated by comparing the measured and recorded level using three instruments with a tell-tale level. This field experiment was conducted in Voineşti Experimental Basin, belonging to the National Institute of Hydrology and Water Management. Levels series data were processed with the software application ParExp v 1, in order to automatically convert them into discharges (Q). Hydrometric and hydrological test results highlighted certain aspects. The accuracy estimated for water fluctuation measurement and recording instruments in a weir water tank, for both level measurement conditions revealed accuracy errors (insufficient accuracy) when the runoff hydraulics was changed (storage Qacum ÷ overflowing Qdev). To remedy such instrumental deficiencies, a <b>metrological</b> <b>control</b> shall be performed under specific operational conditions (e. g., water tank) in order to meet increasing needs for high quality hydrological data. The hydrological data processing using the ParExp v 1 software application, at the junction of specific “rise and storage” and “rise and overflowing” flows indicated a temporal error (delay). The user may remedy this error by eliminating data from the Qacum-Qdev junction range until reaching the maximum/stabilized level. Finally, we estimate that through the improvement of some technical elements, hydrological data obtained at a micro-scale level can be used for hydrological models of calibration...|$|E
40|$|The IFMIF (International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility) project aim is {{to build}} a {{facility}} for the mechanical characterization of material that will constitute the wall of the nuclear reactor for DEMO (DEMOnstration power plant). The complexity of this facility, containing numerous components with peculiar specifications, requires the development of a preliminary stage for the engineeristic evaluation that will led to outline the framework of the activities, the so called EVEDA (Engineering Validation Engineering Design Activities) phase, including the LIPAc prototype construction that involve many research institutes around the world each one has in charge the realization of a line components. The description of the IFMIF project and also each contribution of the participating research institutes are briefly reported on chapter 1. Such facility require the realization of a RFQ four-vane particle accelerator, composed of 18 modules, whose part of mechanical design and construction has been entrusted respectively to mechanical design office and workshop of the I. N. F. N. Padova Unit (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). Since the mechanical design of the accelerator ha almost completed, we faced on the production covering over all metrological quality control phases. Metrologic control and qualification stages are strictly related to the cavity behaviour therefore we focus our attention to its working principle. Thus, in the second chapter it has been summarised the basics to understand the basic working principles of such machines, the main parameter affecting their performances and finally the main geometrical parameter of the accelerator concerned. The most critical issues arise from the production concerning the brazing process which does not permit adjustment except with re-brazing causing a strong deterioration of the mechanical properties of the copper components. It should be mentioned that brazing {{turned out to be an}} uncertainty source for the quality of the pieces, therefore, part of the activities have been carried out on the resolution of such problems. The possible causes of defect on brazed geometries have been found and one-dimensional considerations about thermal expansion as well as 3 d thermo-structural simulation confirm all the statements. Such problematics has been reported on third chapter which, moreover, consists on their resolutions: the design of a new brazing cycle with an intermediate plateau. All the remaining modules are then brazed with this new cycle that permitted the disappearance of the brazing distortion. This confirms the reliability of the production phases and methods for the obtainments of modules respecting the project specifications. The quality control of the modules include: vacuum tightening test of the cavity, the coolant circuits seal test, Ultrasonic Test (UT) of the brazed joints, dimensional inspection using a CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) and Radio-Frequency (RF) test that identifies the electromagnetic behaviour of the single modules. These two last quality controls are strictly correlated each other in such a way that the deviations from the nominal dimensions could be used to predict the electromagnetic ones. Therefore in the last chapter, along with descriptions of the production phases and their metrological controls, it exposes a method for predicting the frequency deviation based on the deviations of measurements. The method validation is done thank to the comparison between <b>metrological</b> <b>control</b> results and those of the RF test. To sum up, the first chapter talks about the IFMIF project, its purpose and its main components; the second summarizes the principle of operation of the four-vane RFQ and describes the main parameters of the one used for the project IFMIF / EVEDA; the third introduces the basic concepts of the brazing process, the identification of defects and determining causes by means of a thermal-structural simulation and finally outlines a new brazing cycle; the last chapter describes the main stages of production, the <b>metrological</b> <b>control</b> between them, culminating in an metrological characterization method to predict the electromagnetic behaviour of the cavity...|$|E

Errors of manufacturing special thread of such details greatly affect the load carrying capacity, precision, reliability, and endurance of RS. That is why the challenge is highly accurate <b>metrological</b> <b>control</b> of errors, which have the greatest influence on specified parameters, and processing of measurement results. Major errors include deviations of real pitch of thread from nominal ones and deviations of real thread profiles from nominal ones. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine abovementioned errors, which were measured by high-precision computerized devices, namely: MITUTOYO CV- 2000 contour measurement instrument; Form Talysurf PGI 420 contour measurement instrument. Both have a measurement range of 100 mm and resolution of 0. 2 μm. As far as a rental cost of the contour measurement instrument was rather high and a software of this device did not allow us to obtain all required information on the thread profile errors of interest, a thread profile was measured using a contour measuring device on the sampling length. Measurement results were copied to the USB flash drive, and then conversion of obtained results and calculation of all errors of interest were carried out on ECM by means of specially designed software. For example, when using a contour measurement instrument MITUTOYO CV- 2000, to make measurement of RS screw on the sampling length of 100 mm along one path, the longitudinal and transverse coordinates of 57411 points of thread profile were obtained. Specially developed mathematical support was used as the basis for software.
