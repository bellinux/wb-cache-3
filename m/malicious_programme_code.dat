5000|$|The {{state-owned}} MediaCorp comprises all free-to-air terrestrial local TV channels {{licensed to}} broadcast in Singapore, {{as well as}} 13 radio stations. In July 2011, Singapore relaxed the Subscription Television <b>Programme</b> <b>Code</b> guidelines allowing Pay TV operators to screen up to M18-rated content programmes containing more graphic content (e.g. sex scenes/nudity, graphic violence, strong language) and mature or sensitive subject matter relating to political issues, racial/religious issues and homosexuality. R21-rated content was still restricted to only Pay TV Video-on-Demand (VOD) services. In July 2016, the MDA officially greenlit R21-rated content for Over-the-Top (OTT) services.However, the English language Pay-TV channels currently available for scheduled broadcast in Singapore comprises only Asian regional channels such as Fox Channel Asia, Star World and WarnerTV, which are outside the editorial control of the Media Development Authority (MDA) as they operate on a regional scale and the same standard of censorship is carried out across the entire region because these channels have to conform with laws from the more conservative areas in Asia, meaning most territories in Asia watch the same censored version. At the moment, only Singapore-owned Video-On-Demand services offer English language programmes that can be regulated by the MDA and therefore, passed uncut under classification ratings such as NC16, M18 and R21. The popular HBO series Sex and the City was pulled from broadcast originally in the late 90s when the series debuted but the ban was later lifted after an earlier relaxation of guidelines in the Subscription Television <b>Programme</b> <b>Code</b> in 2004. Private ownership of satellite dishes is illegal, though international TV news broadcasts (such as CNN, BBC, Fox News Channel, RT, etc.) are available on services such as Starhub TV and SingTel IPTV Singtel TV.The Media Development Authority, through its four Programme Advisory Committees (PAC) {{for each of the}} four official languages, monitors and provides feedback on broadcast content. Permissible content on free-to-air Singaporean TV is regulated by the MDA's Free-to-Air Television <b>Programme</b> <b>Code.</b> The Free-to-Air Television <b>Programme</b> <b>Code</b> states that [...] "all programmes broadcast between 6am and 10pm must be generally acceptable for family audiences. The transition from family-oriented to more adult programming after the watershed time of 10pm should also be executed gradually" [...] Hence, locally produced dramas aired before 10pm tend to be more family-based, with crime-horror-thrillers; etc. at a minimum. PG13 content, which is allowed only after 10pm to 6am, is the maximum rating available for free-to-air television in Singapore. NC16 and M18-rated content are available only on Pay TV channels under the editorial control of the MDA such as Singapore channels E City and VV Drama, both of which owned by Starhub.Part 13.3 of the Code states that use of the local English-based creole Singlish [...] "should not be encouraged and can only be permitted in interviews, where the interviewee speaks only Singlish." [...] The popular Singlish sitcom Phua Chu Kang was singled out in a National Day rally speech. The Programmes Advisory Committee for English TV and Radio Programmes also singled out the use of Singlish in local sitcoms in its 2005 annual report, saying they [...] "contain excessive Singlish" [...] and [...] "this should be avoided as it could give the wrong impression, especially among the young, that Singlish is the standard of spoken English in Singapore" [...] Part 13.4 of the Code states that [...] "All Chinese programmes, except operas or other programmes specifically approved by the Authority, must be generally in Mandarin." [...] Dialects in dialogues and songs may be allowed provided the context justifies usage and is sparingly used. More leeway of dialects is given for Pay TV channels.In February 2008, the Academy Awards acceptance speech for the short documentary Freeheld was censored by Mediacorp in the rebroadcast of the program due to the filmmakers' mention of equal rights for same-sex couples as it violated the Free-to-air TV <b>Programme</b> <b>Code.</b>|$|R

However, this degree of intuitive representation and corresponding design techniques is something that at present relies on an understanding of the mathematics, the allowable Temporal Equations (TE's), their corresponding event controlled gates, and the functions that these gates perform. Coupled with this a knowledge of error avoidance is essential to the design of error free (with regards to the event control) circuits.

The sweeping provisions under the aforementioned act ask channels not to offend good taste, decency or attack religions or communities. Nor should they carry anything that is likely to encourage or incite violence or anything that goes against the maintenance of law and order. Specifically, the <b>code</b> says <b>programmes</b> should not telecast anything amounting to contempt of court; They should contain aspersions on the integrity of the President and the judiciary, criticise, malign, or slander any individual in person or certain groups,segments of social, public and moral life of the country. This is the code that the EMMC follows as it looks for transgressions and airtime to ministers. According to sources, [...] "It is the tracking of ministers that consumes all the time, and prevents a proper monitoring of channels" [...] It is here that officials watch out for television channels, about 600 of them, tripping on the <b>programme</b> <b>code,</b> drawn up by the government, offering the I&B ministry reasons to serve show cause notices on the channels. The EMMC monitors 'around 600' TV channels on a day-to-day basis. The penalties vary, depending on the degree of violation. On 2 March 2015, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, the Minister of State for the Information and Broadcasting Ministry in a query stated that there were at least three instances in 2015 against channels over violations of the Programming and Advertising Code: While in one case, an order was issued to take a channel off air for seven days, in another case, a warning was issued. In another instance, a show cause notice was issued. According to Arun Jaitley, over 20 channels were banned for flouting of rules over the last 20 years. In January 2015, an amount of Rs.20 krore was allocated in the financial year 2014-15 for facilitating augmentation of the monitoring capacity of the EMMC.
