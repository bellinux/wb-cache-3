50|$|Centrifuge tubes (also {{referred}} to as Eppendorf Tubes, Microfuge Tubes, and <b>Microcentrifuge</b> Tubes) are precision-made, high-strength tubes of glass or plastic made to fit exactly in rotor cavities. They may vary in capacity from 50 mL down to much smaller capacities used in microcentrifuges used extensively in molecular biology laboratories. Microcentrifuges typically accommodate disposable plastic <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes with capacities from 250 μL to 2.0 mL.|$|E
5000|$|Add 100 µL {{of each of}} {{the above}} to {{separate}} tubes (use <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes) and add 1.0 mL of Coomassie Blue to each tube.|$|E
50|$|Microcentrifuges {{are used}} to process small volumes of {{biological}} molecules, cells, or nuclei. <b>Microcentrifuge</b> tubes generally hold 0.5 - 2.0 mL of liquid, and are spun at maximum angular speeds of 12,000-13,000 rpm. Microcentrifuges are {{small enough to fit}} on a table-top and have rotors that can quickly change speeds. They {{may or may not have}} a refrigeration function.|$|E
50|$|Ultracentrifugation {{makes use}} of high {{centrifugal}} force for studying properties of biological particles. Compared to <b>microcentrifuges</b> or high-speed centrifuges, ultracentrifuges can isolate much smaller particles, including ribosomes, proteins, and viruses. Ultracentrifuges {{can also be used}} in the study of membrane fractionation. This occurs because ultracentrifuges can reach maximum angular velocities in excess of 70,000 rpm. Additionally, while <b>microcentrifuges</b> and supercentrifuges separate particles in batches (limited volumes of samples must be handled manually in test tubes or bottles), ultracentrifuges can separate molecules in batch or continuous flow systems.|$|R
5000|$|Disposable plastic [...] "microlitre tubes" [...] of 0.5ml to 2ml are {{commonly}} used in <b>microcentrifuges.</b> They are molded from a flexible transparent plastic similar to polythene, are semi-conical in shape, with integral, hinged sealing caps.|$|R
40|$|The {{specificity}} was {{studied by}} com-paring results obtained with the pro-posed procedure with those obtained with lipoprotein electrophoresis for 80 normolipidemic or hypertriglyceridem-ic (> 4. 0 gIL) samples. A reasonable percentage of false negatives was de-tected in hypertriglyceridemic sera with lipoprotein electrophoresis, {{owing to the}} lesser sensitivity of this proce-dure. We conclude that our proposed modi-fication of Chapman’s procedure (2) offers the following advantages: (a) se-rum can be used instead of plasma (in general, serum is more widely used in clinical chemistry laboratories); (b) the instrumentation (capillary tubes and hematocrit <b>microcentrifuges)</b> is avail-able in all such laboratories; (c) micro-scopic detection of chylomicrons is easi-er and more objective; (d) no false positives were demonstrated in sam-ples with fibrin debris or other “artifac-tual ” particles; and (e) the microproce-dure {{appears to be more}} sensitive than lipoprotein electrophoresis...|$|R
50|$|Using high {{pressure}}, pressure injection {{cells are}} used for two applications: densely packing nanobore capillary columns (micro-columns) with solid-phase particles for use in LC/MS analysis; and precisely infusing microliter samples directly from <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes into mass spectrometers without additional transfers, wasted sample, or contact with metallic surfaces which adsorb some negatively charged molecules such as phosphopeptides.|$|E
50|$|When {{working with}} agarose beads, the beads must be {{pelleted}} {{out of the}} sample by briefly spinning in a centrifuge with forces between 600-3,000 x g (times the standard gravitational force). This step may be performed in a standard <b>microcentrifuge</b> tube, but for faster separation, greater consistency and higher recoveries, the process is often performed in small spin columns with a pore size that allows liquid, but not agarose beads, to pass through. After centrifugation, the agarose beads will form a very loose fluffy pellet {{at the bottom of}} the tube. The supernatant containing contaminants can be carefully removed so as not to disturb the beads. The wash buffer can then be added to the beads and after mixing, the beads are again separated by centrifugation.|$|E
50|$|During {{incubation}} DNA {{and some}} salts will precipitate from solution, {{in the next}} step this precipitate is collected by centrifugation in a <b>microcentrifuge</b> tube at high speeds (~12,000g). Time and speed of centrifugation has the biggest effect on DNA recovery rates. Again smaller fragments and higher dilutions require longer and faster centrifugation. Centrifugation can be done either at room temperature or in 4 °C or 0 °C.During centrifugation precipitated DNA has to move through ethanol solution {{to the bottom of}} the tube, lower temperatures increase viscosity of the solution and larger volumes make the distance longer, so both those factors lower efficiency of this process requiring longer centrifugation for the same effect.After centrifugation the supernatant solution is removed, leaving a pellet of crude DNA. Whether the pellet is visible depends on the amount of DNA and on its purity (dirtier pellets are easier to see) or the use of co-precipitants.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{a large amount of}} {{analysis}} techniques have been scaled down to the microfluidic level. However, in many cases the necessary sample preparation, such as separation, mixing and concentration, remains to be performed off-chip. This represents a major hurdle for the introduction of miniaturized sample-in/answer-out systems, preventing the exploitation of microfluidic’s potential for small, rapid and accurate diagnostic products. New flow engineering methods are required to address this hitherto insufficiently studied aspect. One microfluidic tool {{that can be used to}} miniaturize and integrate sample preparation procedures are microvortices. They have been successfully applied as <b>microcentrifuges,</b> mixers, particle separators, to name but a few. In this work, we utilize a novel corner structure at a sudden channel expansion of a microfluidic chip to enhance the formation of a microvortex. For a maximum area of the microvortex, both chip geometry and corner structure were optimized with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. Fluorescent particle trace measurements with the optimized design prove that the corner structure increases the size of the vortex. Furthermore, vortices are induced by the corner structure at low flow rates while no recirculation is observed without a corner structure. Finally, successful separation of plasma from human blood was accomplished, demonstrating a potential application for clinical sample preparation. The extracted plasma was characterized by a flow cytometer and compared to plasma obtained from a standard benchtop centrifuge and from chips without a corner structure...|$|R

40|$|Smith and Azam (1992) {{introduced}} {{a version of}} the leucine incorporation method (Kirchman et al. 1985) for measuring bacterial production where the entire procedure is conducted in <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes. In this assay an environmental sam-ple is mixed with radiolabeled leucine in a tube and incubated. Incorporation of the label into protein is measured by count-ing the retention of radioactivity {{on the walls of the}} microcen-trifuge tube after extraction and washing of the sample with trichloroacetic acid. This method allows rapid bacterial pro-duction estimates at reduced cost and decreases the quantity of radioactive waste generated. In addition, the variance of repli-cate determinations is lower with the <b>microcentrifuge</b> method than with the previous method, which required concentrating samples on filters (Kirchman 2001).

40|$|The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) {{has been}} {{described}} as a technology for the rapid and reproducible assay of biofilm susceptibilities to antibiotics. In this study a simple and inexpensive alternative to the CBD was developed from polypropylene (PP) <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes and pipette tip boxes. The utility of the device was demonstrated using Candida glabrata, a yeast that can develop antimicrobial-resistant biofilm communities. Biofilms of C. glabrata were formed on the outside surface of <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes and examined by quantitative analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Growth of three C. glabrata strains, including a clinical isolate, demonstrated that biofilms could be formed on the <b>microcentrifuge</b> tubes. After 24. h incubation the three C. glabrata strains produced biofilms that were recovered into cell suspension and quantified. The method was found to produce uniform and reproducible results with no significant differences between biofilms formed on PP tubes incubated in various compartments of the device.

40|$|This study {{involved}} the rapid, direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (BACTEC, Johnston Laboratories, Inc.) {{by using the}} AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) culture confirmation test. This method uses a chemiluminescent DNA probe that detects the rRNA of the target organisms. The manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. Two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed {{in order to obtain}} the pellet. The first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml) from the blood culture bottle. The second method used a <b>microcentrifuge</b> and less volume (1 to 1. 5 ml).

The cellulose pellet was quantified gravimetrically after being dried overnight at 100  °C (Liu et al. 2008). pH was measured using a B 10 P SympHony pH meter (VWR®). Ethanol, glucose, cellobiose, and lactic, formic, acetic, and butyric acids, were measured as follows: supernatants for metabolites analysis were filtered through 0.2  µm and measured using an HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) consisting of a Dionex GP 50 Gradient pump and a Dionex LC 25 Chromatography oven equipped with an Aminex HPX- 87 H column (Bio-Rad) at 30  °C and 9  mM H 2 SO 4 at 0.6  ml min− 1 as mobile phase, connected to a Perkin Elmer 200 series refractive index detector (RID).
