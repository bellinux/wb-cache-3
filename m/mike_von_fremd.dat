50|$|Michael Brett Adkisson (March 2, 1964 - April 12, 1987) was an American {{professional}} wrestler {{under the}} ring name <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich.

50|$|The 4th Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions {{was a major}} {{professional}} wrestling event held by Dallas, Texas based World Championship Wrestling Association (WCWA) on May 3, 1987 at the Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas. The {{event was}} held by WCCW promoter Fritz Von Erich in memory of his sons David <b>Von</b> Erich and <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich.|$|R
50|$|Adams later {{competed in}} a six-man tag team match {{alongside}} Jake Roberts and Gino Hernandez, defeating Kerry <b>Von</b> Erich, <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich and Bobby Fulton (subbing for the injured Kevin Von Erich). During that match, the fans chanted Chris is a traitor! while others held Benedict Adams signs. However, he often competed as a face in Bill Watts' Mid South (later UWF) promotion.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to WCCW in 1984 and feuded with the <b>Von</b> Erichs; <b>Mike,</b> Kevin and Kerry Von Erich. In the summer, he was paired with Nickla Roberts, who was billed {{at the time}} as Andrea the Lady Giant. The duo was paired in a series of mixed tag team matches between Sunshine and <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich, with Sunshine's aunt Stella Mae French also getting involved.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1985, when <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich {{was unable}} to wrestle due to toxic shock syndrome, Vaughan went to World Class Championship Wrestling {{to take his place}} in the feud against the Fabulous Freebirds. He adopted the name Lance Von Erich and was billed as the son of Fritz Von Erich's [...] "brother" [...] Waldo. In reality, neither Vaughan nor Waldo were related to the Adkisson family.|$|R
50|$|The Fabulous Freebirds won several {{titles and}} moved on to World Class Championship Wrestling in late 1982 and began a {{high-profile}} feud with the Von Erich family. They wrestled David Von Erich, Kerry <b>Von</b> Erich, <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich and Kevin Von Erich numerous times in 1986. Roberts also had a long-standing feud with Von Erich ally Chris Adams, which lasted on and off for more than five years.|$|R
50|$|As {{his sons}} began to launch wrestling careers {{of their own}} in the mid-to-late 1970s, Fritz {{gradually}} cut back on his in-ring appearances and concentrated on promoting, finally retiring from the ring altogether after a 1982 NWA American Title win over King Kong Bundy at Texas Stadium in Irving. By then, the promotion had switched to the World Class name and was centered on Fritz's sons, Kevin, David, Kerry, and later, <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich.|$|R
50|$|Performing {{under the}} ring name Andrea, the Lady Giant (a {{reference}} to André the Giant), Roberts was booked to dominate {{both male and}} female wrestlers in the ring. Her character had a punk haircut and typically wore leather pants, a leather jacket, metal studded belts, spiked dog collars and wristbands and scarves and T-shirts relating to rock bands such as Aerosmith and Mötley Crüe. Hernandez and Roberts feuded with <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich and his manager, Sunshine.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the top}} {{angles of}} the summer of 1984 was a mixed feud between Gino Hernandez and Nickla Roberts (aka Baby Doll, billed as Andrea The Lady Giant) against <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich and Stella Mae French. The angle reached new heights {{in the fall of}} 1984 when Sunshine, {{arriving}} on a helicopter at the Cotton Bowl, interfered in a match, allowing French to pin Roberts. This angle, which also involved Chris Adams, ended in 1985.|$|R

5000|$|Gower {{was trained}} to wrestle by Fritz Von Erich, debuting in 1979. Adias appeared, mistakenly billed as [...] "Brian Adidas", at Starrcade 84 {{defeating}} Mister Ito. Fan magazines like Pro Wrestling Illustrated continued to list him in their regional rankings as Adidas {{for the next two}} years, but he was referred to as Adias in WCCW. Adias continued his alliance with the Von Erich family until the fall of 1986, when he turned heel against <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich in a singles match.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} Monday in Fort Worth on October 1, 1984; Adams {{was selected}} as the mystery partner in a six-man tag match for Hernandez and Roberts in a match against Kerry and <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich, with Buck Zumhofe subbing for Kevin. As Adams gave Mike a backdrop from the canvas using his legs, Kevin stormed the ring and attacked Adams, resulting in a brawl between the former friends and tag partners until David Manning, Bronco Lubich, Rick Hazzard and Gary Hart separated the two.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, World Class {{went on a}} major tour to the Middle East (including Israel). The tour, {{which ran}} from August 3 through August 7, was held mostly in Tel Aviv, and proved to be {{extremely}} successful, but was also the start of another episode for the Adkisson family, as {{it was during this}} tour that <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich suffered a separated shoulder (in a tag team match with Kevin against Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams) that led to his near-fatal bout with toxic shock syndrome following surgery. In an ill-advised desperation move that would later infamously backfire, Fritz brought in Pacific Northwest Wrestling Champion, Ricky Vaughn [...] as [...] "cousin" [...] Lance Von Erich to fill the gap while Mike was recovering. Fritz billed Lance as the [...] "son" [...] of Waldo Von Erich, with whom Fritz tagged years earlier, but was not related to Fritz in any way. Vaughn made his WCCW debut at the 1985 Cotton Bowl event. To this day, it was considered to be the worst idea that Fritz came up with. Among the main participants on the Israel tour included Kevin and <b>Mike</b> <b>Von</b> Erich, Chris Adams, Gino Hernandez, Iceman King Parsons, Freebird Buddy Roberts, Scott Casey, Brian Adias, Rip Oliver, Kelly Kiniski and Johnny Mantell.|$|R
50|$|A {{period of}} {{activism}} {{in which he}} attempted {{to work within the}} existing mores of the conventional art world culminated in 'Earthscape' (1991), a large scale performance/installation created {{in the form of an}} International Competition on a theme of 'Environmental Solutions' where artists such as Andrew Bick and Luke Elwes were invited to submit works implying a positive response to the burgeonning environmental crisis. Curated with Christine Goldschmidt for the Hastings Trust, this project involved a wide range of collaborators including <b>Mike</b> <b>von</b> Joel, Laetitia Yhap, Andrew Graham-Dixon (who were the judges of the competition), Art in Ruins, Lynne Green, Nick Wates and the book and exhibition designer Jeremy Brook.|$|R
40|$|This {{position}} statement, {{initiated by}} the Early Childhood Division of NAGC, focuses on creating optimal environments for recognizing, developing, and nurturing the strengths and talents of young gifted children, age 3 through 8. Characteristics of these young gifted children can include (but are not limited to) : the use of advanced vocabulary and/or the development of early reading skills, keen observation and curiosity, an unusual retention of information, periods of intense concentration, an early demonstration of talent in the arts, task commitment beyond same-age peers, {{and an ability to}} understand complex concepts, perceive relationships, and think abstractly (Clark, 2002; Smutny, 1998; Smutny & <b>von</b> <b>Fremd,</b> 2004). Although many individuals are influential in the lives of young children, this position statement targets those who care for and are responsible for teaching young gifted children, including parents, caregivers, teachers, administrators, {{and other members of the}} community. Early childhood gifted education focuses on recognizing, developing, and nurturing the strengths and talents of all children age 3 through 8. Early childhood educators and family members have mutual goals to develop children’s capacity and passion for learning to the fullest potential. In addition, research indicates that an interactive and responsive environment in early childhood supports both cognitive and affective growth and establishes a pattern of successful learning that can continue throughout children’s lives (Clark, 2002; Smutny...|$|R
50|$|The 3rd Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions {{was a major}} {{professional}} wrestling event held by Dallas, Texas based World Championship Wrestling Association (WCWA) on May 4, 1986 at the Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas.

On the show the Great Kabuki was to have faced four wrestlers in this handicap match, one at a time. The fourth wrestler he was to have faced was Chris Adams. Michael Hayes began berating Adams after Steve Simpson defeated Kabuki, prompting Adams to superkick both Hayes and Kabuki out of the ring.|$|R
