5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, <b>methodology,</b> <b>and</b> policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of <b>methodology</b> <b>and</b> research methods.|$|E

The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins, {{with at least one}} from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964. This study was one of eleven such in the contemporary literature, and the book detailed the <b>methodology</b> <b>and</b> analytic detail differentiating it from the others.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus needs to find right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental <b>methodology,</b> <b>and</b> generalized attack target states and found a few practical target states that were previously unknown.|$|E
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, {{the first was a}} scholarly look at the <b>methodology</b> <b>and</b> scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{historical}} and current population levels of the Southern fin whale. The IWC officially estimates that the Southern Hemisphere pre-whaling population was 400,000 whales and that the population in 1979 (at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling) was 85,200. Both the current and historical estimates should be considered as poor estimates because the <b>methodology</b> <b>and</b> data used in the study are known to be flawed. Other estimates cite current size to be between 15,000 (1983) and 38,000 (1997). As of 2006, there is no scientifically accepted estimate of current population or trends in abundance.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, <b>methodology,</b> <b>and</b> sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E
5|$|Born in Somerset to {{a wealthy}} family, Lethbridge was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, {{during the course}} of which he {{attended}} an expedition to Jan Mayen island, becoming part of the first group to successfully climb the Beerenberg. After a failed second expedition to the Arctic Circle, he became involved in archaeology. In his capacity as Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Lethbridge carried out excavations at various sites around Britain. His claims regarding the existence of Iron Age hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in Cambridgeshire caused significant controversy within the archaeological community, with most archaeologists believing that Lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature. Lethbridge's <b>methodology</b> <b>and</b> theories were widely deemed unorthodox, and in turn he became increasingly critical of the archaeological profession.|$|E
