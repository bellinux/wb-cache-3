50|$|From {{the end of}} 2006 conflict, MAG Lebanon's {{capacity}} grew to 22 Mine Action Teams (MATs), 5 Mechanical Teams, 2 <b>Mine</b> <b>Dog</b> Detection teams, 3 Community Liaison Teams (responsible for {{gathering information}} from the community on remnants of conflict), 1 Technical Survey Team, 1 Reconnaissance Team (responsible for surveying battle areas), and 1 Quality Control/ Quality Assurance Team (responsible for training and monitoring operations quality). Since {{the end of the}} 2006 conflict, MAG has cleared more than 9.8 million square metres of land, destroyed almost 21 000 remnants of conflict, cleared 294 dangerous areas, and assisted 450,000 people at risk from death or injury from remnants of conflict. The scope of activities carried out by MAG Lebanon's programme includes rapid survey and demarcation of landmine and UXO contaminated areas, clearance of priority routes and land, and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tasks. Alongside this, integration of MAG Lebanon's activities with those of the NDO (National Demining Office) and other organizations operating in the region remains a priority.|$|E
40|$|A <b>mine</b> <b>dog</b> {{evaluation}} project {{initiated by}} the Geneva International Center for Humanitarian Demining is evaluating the capability and reliability of mine detection dogs. The performance of field-operational mine detection dogs will be measured in test minefields in Afghanistan and Bosnia containing actual, but unfused landmines.

Soil samples will be obtained adjacent to the buried targets repeatedly {{over the course of}} the test. Chemical analysis results from these soil samples will be used to evaluate correlations between <b>mine</b> <b>dog</b> detection performance and seasonal weather conditions.

40|$|<b>Mine</b> {{detection}} <b>dogs</b> have a demonstrated {{capability to}} locate hidden objects by trace chemical detection. Because of this capability, demining activities frequently employ <b>mine</b> detection <b>dogs</b> to locate individual buried landmines or for area reduction. The conditions appropriate {{for use of}} <b>mine</b> detection <b>dogs</b> {{are only beginning to}} emerge through diligent research that combines dog selection/training, the environmental conditions that impact landmine signature chemical vapors, and vapor sensing performance capability and reliability. This report seeks to address the fundamental soil-chemical interactions, driven by local weather history, that influence the availability of chemical for trace chemical detection. The processes evaluated include: landmine chemical emissions to the soil, chemical distribution in soils, chemical degradation in soils, and weather and chemical transport in soils. Simulation modeling is presented as a method to evaluate the complex interdependencies among these various processes and to establish conditions appropriate for trace chemical detection. Results from chemical analyses on soil samples obtained adjacent to landmines are presented and demonstrate the ultra-trace nature of these residues. Lastly, initial measurements of the vapor sensing performance of <b>mine</b> detection <b>dogs</b> demonstrates the extreme sensitivity of dogs in sensing landmine signature chemicals; however, reliability at these ultra-trace vapor concentrations still needs to be determined. Through this compilation, additional work is suggested that will fill in data gaps to improve the utility of trace chemical detection...|$|R

25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine <b>mine</b> detecting <b>dogs</b> were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence.

40|$|Abstract: Metals in mine effluents, {{especially}} metal mines, {{have been}} a major environmental concern. High mobility of the metals in solution and the subsequent lowering of discharge limits by the EPA have necessitated expensive chemical treatment of the effluent. Bacteriological reactions, particularly by Sulfate Reducing Bacteria, have been known to reduce metals content in water by precipitating them as metal sulfides. The technique was used on samples of untreated mine plant water (prior to treatment for disposal) from the Teck-Cominco Red <b>Dog</b> <b>Mine</b> in northern Alaska. Further experiments were conducted to determine bioreactor design parameters. Bioreactor lab tests revealed that metal content was reduced by over a hundred fold. Pilot scale test cells were established in the Red <b>Dog</b> <b>mining</b> area and their performance was monitored. ______________________ 1 Poster paper presented at the 7 t...|$|R
