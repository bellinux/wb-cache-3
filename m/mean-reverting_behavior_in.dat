40|$|This paper reexamines the {{empirical}} evidence for <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> stock prices. Comparison of data {{before and after}} World War II shows that mean reversion is entirely a prewar phenomenon. Using randomization methods to calculate significance levels, the authors find that the full sample evidence for mean reversion is weaker than previously indicated by Monte Carlo methods under a normal assumption. Further, the switch to mean-averting behavior after the war {{is about to be}} too strong to be compatible with sampling variation. The authors interpret these findings as evidence of a fundamental change in the stock returns process. Copyright 1991 by The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} uses variance {{ratio analysis}} {{to test whether}} Middle Eastern, North African (MENA) and Pacific Basin emerging equity markets follow a martingale behavior during the period 1980 - 2004. The conventional Lo and MacKinlay variance ratio test, the multiple variance ratio test of Chow and Denning, rank- and sign-based test of Wright, and wild bootstrap of Kim are used for the monthly return series. The problem of thin trading was addressed using Miller, Muthuswamy, and Whaley’s adjusting procedure. Results have shown traces of a martingale behavior at high holding horizons. However, overall conclusions indicate that the null martingale hypothesis is strongly rejected for the whole sample and considered sub-periods at a 5 % significance level. The pattern of the variance ratio estimates signify that the selected stock markets exhibit persistent <b>mean-reverting</b> and predictable <b>behavior</b> <b>in</b> their monthly adjusted returns series.

Prior work on gut microbial time series has largely focused on autoregressive models (e. g. Lotka-Volterra). However, we show {{that most of the}} variance in microbial time series is non-autoregressive. In addition, we show how community state-clustering is flawed when it comes to characterizing within-host dynamics and that more continuous methods are required. Most organisms exhibited stable, <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior</b> suggestive of fixed carrying capacities and abundant taxa were largely shared across individuals. This <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior</b> allowed us to apply sparse vector autoregression (sVAR) -a multivariate method developed for econometrics-to model the autoregressive component of gut community dynamics. We find a strong phylogenetic signal in the non-autoregressive co-variance from our sVAR model residuals, which suggests niche filtering. We show how changes in diet are also non-autoregressive and that Operational Taxonomic Units strongly correlated with dietary variables have much less of an autoregressive component to their variance, which suggests that diet is a major driver of microbial dynamics. Autoregressive variance appears to be driven by multi-day recovery from frequent facultative anaerobe blooms, which may be driven by fluctuations in luminal redox. Overall, we identify two dynamic regimes within the human gut microbiota: one likely driven by external environmental fluctuations, and the other by internal processes...|$|R

We obtain evidence supporting random growth against the alternative of mean reversion (convergence) in city sizes using panel unit root tests. We also examine mobility within the distribution to try to extract growth patterns different from the general unit root trend detected. We find evidence of high mobility when we model growth as a first-order Markov process. Finally, using a cluster procedure we find strong evidence in favor of conditional convergence in city growth rates within convergence clubs, which we interpret as “local” <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We interpret the high mobility and the results of the clustering analysis as signs of a sequential city growth pattern. ...|$|R

Based on this, commodity modeling has been applying models with this property since long time ago [1]. In that sense, the most basic and simplified stochastic process that describes the characteristic of the process to drift toward a long-term value is known as the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process [8].

Second, using quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, we demonstrate that those indexes that are located outside the no-arbitrage band are a nonlinear stationary process of mean-reversion to the no-arbitrage band. However, index and futures that are located within the no-arbitrage band are non-stationary. Third, we confirm an earlier finding that futures price leads the nonlinear <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior</b> of the index but not vice versa.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} outlier treatment on the estimation of the seasonal component and stochastic models in electricity markets. Typically, electricity spot prices exhibit features like seasonality, <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior,</b> extreme volatility and the occurrence of jumps and spikes. Hence, an important issue in the estimation of stochastic models for electricity spot prices is the estimation of a component to deal with trends and seasonality in the data. Unfortunately, in regression analysis, classical estimation routines like OLS {{are very sensitive to}} extreme observations and outliers. Improved robustness of the model can be achieved by (a) cleaning the data with some reasonable procedure for outlier rejection, and then (b) using classical estimation and testing procedures on the remainder of the data. We examine the effects on model estimation for different treatment of extreme observations in particular on determining the number of outliers and descriptive statistics of the remaining series after replacement of the outliers. Our findings point out the substantial impact the treatment of extreme observations may have on these issues. ...|$|R

We raise three fundamental questions which are; first, does profit growth over time exhibit a <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior?</b> Second, how volatile are profits and does this volatility obscure the message of profit growth? Finally, do profit growth rates vary between decades / sub-samples? Our efforts suggest that since 1970 the mean and standard deviation of profit growth had actually been decreasing up until 1990 s. For the most recent (2000 - 08) period, the profit growth shows an up-tick in both the mean and the standard deviation. For the entire period, 1970 - 2008, we find that the trend coefficient is statistically insignificant. We apply the traditional unit root tests, efficient unit root tests, and unit root tests with structural break on the profits series. In addition, we follow Hamilton’s approach and apply an ARCH approach on the profits series.

This paper seeks to exploit the momentum profitability from the perspective of the excursion patterns in the stock price movements. A theoretical framework is developed for momentum strategy analysis and the long memory process in the financial markets. To test the null hypothesis of the Random Walk Hypothesis and the Efficient Market Hypothesis, we employ the Hurst exponent to detect the long-term memory existed in the stock return series. A time series with 0 < H < 0. 5 shows negative correlations between points and a <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior,</b> while a series with 0. 5 < H < 1 indicates positive correlations and a long memory process. Basic momentum strategies are further applied to the past stock price data, and the back testing results show that there is a U-shaped relationship between {{the strategy}} returns and Hurst exponent. This paper also builds on earlier model of a rule-based naïve trading strategy using Hurst exponent as a signal. The strategy generates remarkably higher profitability compared with the benchmark returns. These findings provide new evidence against the random walk assumption and present challenges to a number of rational asset pricing theories. 	   ii 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to model the behavior of the exchange rates of five partner countries of Tunisia, namely, (Germany, the United States, France, Italy, the UK, Morocco and Libya) relative to its fundamentals over the period 1990 - 1999.

We are trying to discriminate between the adjustment dynamics with long memory (but linear) and a dynamics of a short memory (nonlinear). Given the important role of the exchange rates in the successful experience of open economies, we are interested, in this work, in analyzing the dynamics of the exchange rates in the long run. The econometric results obtained through the GPH tests, make us consider the PPP as an event in the long run if significant short-term deviations from the PPP cannot exist.

By allowing deviations from equilibrium to follow a fractionally integrated process, fractional cointegration analysis captures {{a wider range of}} <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior</b> than traditional cointegration. Under the assumption that the integration orders of the underlying series are equal, based on the memory estimates from observed series and the regression residual, we propose a residual-based test for the null hypothesis of no fractional cointegration against the alternative of fractional cointegration. Under some regular conditions, the test statistic has an asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null and diverges under the alternative. The test is easy to implement and performs well in Monte Carlo experiments. A necessary condition for fractional cointegration is that the integrated orders of underlying series are equal. We present a procedure to test for the equality of integration orders of the underlying series. Wang, Bin. Adviser: Ngai Hang Chan.

40|$|National Taiwan University The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to use stock return and price-earnings ratio to study the impacts of earnings shocks on stock prices. We assume that the stochastic process of earnings and stock price consist of a permanent and a transitory components. What distinguishes this paper from most accounting and finance research is that the permanent part of stock price or earnings need not be random walk. The stock valuation model in Miller and Modigliani (1961) and Miller and Rock (1985) helps link a company’s earnings and stock price. Since we do not assume that the permanent part of earnings is random walk, there will be an identification problem with building a bivariate time series model, which can be handled by invoking the aforementioned theoretical relation. Through variance decomposition and impulse response analysis, we are able to see how stock return and price-earnings ratio dynamically respond to the permanent and temporary shocks to accounting earnings, which tells us how stock returns are determined. The results of the analysis show that a considerable part of the variation in stock returns {{can be explained by the}} transitory shocks to earnings, which suggests that the investors fail to distinguish between the permanent and transitory parts of earnings unmistakably. The <b>mean-reverting</b> <b>behavior</b> of stock returns can also be explained by the existence of a significant temporary component in the stock returns. The price-earnings ratios are mainly explained by the temporary shocks to earnings. This signifies that, induced by the temporary component of earnings, stock prices respond excessively to earnings...|$|R
