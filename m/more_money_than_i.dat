500|$|The case {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On {{the advice of his}} clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including The Daily Mail which described Birkett as [...] "the greatest legal discovery of the year" [...] and called his speech [...] "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting Miles Malleson, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said in surprise [...] "did you know, Miles, that I am making <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought existed in the world!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{addition}} of Maryland and Rutgers [...] "gives us 40 to 50 million more viewers, makes the BTN Ten Network worth <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> God. <b>I</b> did say that. It’s {{a very powerful}} instrument for us." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You see, Christopher,' said Mr Garland, 'this is a {{point of}} much {{importance}} to you, and you should understand and consider it in that light. This gentleman is able to give you <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> I--not, <b>I</b> hope, to carry through the various relations of master and servant, more kindness and confidence, but certainly, Christopher, to give you more money.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, it must be. I have <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can spend--without Vange. And I have painful {{associations}} {{with the house}} which disincline me ever to enter it again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'O, I can {{put some}} {{in out of}} this house; it is too full; and we can buy the rest. They tell me I'm to have <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> shall {{know what to do}} with.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This equestrianism," [...] he began, [...] "is {{a matter}} of time and money--time even <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>money.</b> <b>I</b> want to read. I want to deal with ideas....|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget," [...] she said, {{looking up}} at him with a faint smile, [...] "that under the cloak of her name I am earning <b>more</b> <b>money</b> a week <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could ever have earned in a year by my own labours." ...|$|R
6000|$|Camerado, I {{give you}} my hand!

[...] Shall we stick by each other {{as long as we}} live? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] he said slowly. [...] "I fancy. Fothergill {{is a bit}} {{too good}} for us. I shan't be very keen on cards to-night, I can tell you. I lost <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> cared about {{last time he was}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{answered}} Geoffrey, [...] "I daresay {{that you}} have some debts to pay. Thank Heaven, I can get on very well and earn <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> want. Not enough clothing--it is shocking to think of!" [...] he added, more to himself than to his listener.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' says I, ''tis {{a little}} hard upon me, and 'tis harder upon you. I am told that Captain ----' (meaning my friend's husband) 'has told you I {{had a great deal}} <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever pretended to have, and I am sure I never {{employed}} him to do so.' ...|$|E

6000|$|To see if {{all things}} are right, I go and tell my money over, and there, to my surprise, I find £194, 10s. 6d. in cash, so that I have £18 there more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> should have. Now, far from being pleased that I have <b>more</b> <b>money</b> by me <b>than</b> <b>I</b> should have, my inquiry is plain, 'How comes this to pass?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Waller was {{treating}} striker Emile Heskey when Houllier {{asked for}} help. During the incident Houllier stated [...] "Don't worry. He is worth <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> me, but <b>I</b> am more urgent". Waller took {{his blood pressure}} and immediately called an ambulance. Houllier was then transferred by ambulance to the {{accident and emergency department}} of Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Prompt recognition of the problem and emergency surgery probably saved Houllier's life.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the next}} day, I fully {{expected}} {{to receive a}} visit from Mrs. Tenbruggen. She knew better than that. I only got a polite little note, thanking me for the address, and adding an artless concession: [...] "I earn <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{know what to do}} with; and I adore Irish lace." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hatherly made {{a little}} deprecatory gesture. [...] "I am not exactly poor; in fact, I have <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> shall live to spend, and I always meant to leave it to Muriel. It {{seems to me that}} it would be wiser to spend some of it on her now. You will let me give you what you want, Mr. Austin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But as he {{went through}} the {{corridor}} of the Reeves Building he sighed, [...] "Poor old Paul! I got to--Oh, damn Noel Ryland! Damn Charley McKelvey! Just because they make <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do, they think they're so superior. I wouldn't be found dead in their stuffy old Union Club! I--Somehow, to-day, I don't feel like going back to work. Oh well--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR TIT,--I {{arrived at}} Cally, {{as they call}} it, this day, or, rather, yesterday; for it is past midnight, as I sit {{thinking}} of a wonderful adventure that has just befallen me. A woman in course; that's always the case with ME, you know: but oh, Tit! if you COULD but see her! Of the first family in France, the Florval-Delvals, beautiful as an angel, and no <b>more</b> caring for <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do for split peas.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{do get a}} {{good deal}} <b>more</b> for their <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> thought they did," [...] said I; [...] "but I wonder if those rich sportsmen ever {{think that if they}} would take the money that they pay for {{shooting}} thirty or forty stags in one season, they might buy a rhinoceros, which they could set up on a hill and shoot at every morning if they liked. A game animal like that would last them for years, and if they ever felt like it, they could ask their friends to help them shoot without costing them anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And," [...] I went on, enthusiastically, [...] "do {{you know}} the value of ducks besides their beauty and {{intelligence}} and order and sweetness of voice? Picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and never-ceasing income. On a farm that I know the feathers were sold for $400 in one year. Think of that! And the ones shipped to the market will bring in <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> that. Yes, <b>I</b> am for the ducks and the salt breeze coming over the bay. I think I shall get a Chinaman cook, and with him and the dog and the sunsets for company I shall do well. No more of this dull, baking, senseless, roaring city for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure, I wouldn't {{give up all}} {{notion of}} a lark. A sailor with money,--and I don't believe there ever was an able-bodied seaman with <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had,--who doesn't lark, {{at least to some}} degree, has no right to call himself a whole-souled mariner; so I made up my mind to have one lark and then stop." ...|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. No: I am my mother's daughter. I am like you: I {{must have}} work, and must make <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> spend.

5000|$|Jonny {{made his}} {{television}} debut with an uncredited {{appearance in the}} BBC series Doctor Who {{at the age of}} nine in the 1982 episode Kinda. The following year he appeared in Jemima Shore and had a role as Charles Price in the serial drama Mansfield Park. He then appeared in various television shows throughout the 1990s. These included two separate guest roles in the ITV procedural The Bill as well as single episode roles in the BBC drama Between the Lines and the medical drama Casualty. He also featured in Keeping Up Appearances, Inspector Morse and Minder. His first notable acting role came in the soap opera EastEnders where he played Jonathan Hewitt. Miller later revealed he had been offered a contract to remain on the show but declined: [...] "It was five weeks' work and <b>I</b> made <b>more</b> <b>money</b> there <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever had in my life. Then they offered me a year's contract. I said no, thank God. I thought I should get out of there while I still could." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{more you}} saw of Alick, the more, {{it must be}} owned, you learned to despise him. His natural talents were of no use either to himself or others; for his {{character}} had degenerated like his face, and become pulpy and pretentious. Even his power of persuasion, which was certainly very surprising, stood in some danger of being lost or neutralised by over-confidence. He lied in an aggressive, brazen manner, like a pert criminal in the dock; {{and he was so}} vain of his own cleverness that he could not refrain from boasting, ten minutes after, of the very trick by which he had deceived you. [...] "Why, now <b>I</b> have <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> came on board," [...] he said one night, exhibiting a sixpence, [...] "and yet I stood myself a bottle of beer before I went to bed yesterday. And as for tobacco, I have fifteen sticks of it." [...] That was fairly successful indeed; yet a man of his superiority, and with a less obtrusive policy, might, who knows? have got the length of half a crown. A man who prides himself upon persuasion should learn the persuasive faculty of silence, above all as to his own misdeeds. It is only in the farce and for dramatic purposes that Scapin enlarges on his peculiar talents to the world at large.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shooting a man. It {{was a case}} of self-defence, but {{his family}} had <b>more</b> <b>money</b> and {{influence}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> did, so I went down the road. As soon as I was out I started north--just the way a dog will point toward home. I didn't intend to come here, but some way I couldn't keep away. I shied round the outskirts of the Fork, picking up jobs of sheep-herding just to have time to turn things over. I know what you're thinking about--you're saying to yourself, 'Well, here's a nice father-in-law?' Well, now, I don't know anything about your people, but the Wetherfords are as good as anybody. If I hadn't come out into this cursed country, where even the women go shootin' wild, I would have been in Congress; but being hot-headed, I must mix in. I'm not excusing myself, you understand; I'm not a desirable addition to any man's collection of friends, but I can promise you this--no one but yourself shall ever know who I am. At the same time, you can't deceive my girl without my being named in the funeral that will follow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well! I have <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> {{need and}} {{have been looking for}} a chance to use my talents. So far I've kept them buried, and if I don't dig them up soon, they might rust away. If you agree, I'd like to make a start now and try a {{business}} speculation." [...] He named a sum and added: [...] "You promised you'd take my help when you saw how you could use the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; Mr. Carr {{spent half}} his long life, and <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can tell you, in getting this {{collection}} together. It was {{the passion of}} his life, and he had this cave hollowed at enormous cost, because {{he thought that the}} air here {{would be less likely to}} injure them than the English fogs. I have added to it, however. I got those papyri and that beautiful bust of Berenice, the one in black marble. Did you ever see such hair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{is nothing}} to me now, Trot--less than nothing. But, sooner than have him punished for his {{offences}} (as he would be if he prowled about in this country), I give him <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> can afford, at intervals when he reappears, to go away. I was a fool when I married him; and I am so far an incurable fool on that subject, that, {{for the sake of}} what I once believed him to be, I wouldn't have even this shadow of my idle fancy hardly dealt with. For I was in earnest, Trot, if ever a woman was.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Cuellar has {{sometimes}} been criticized by fellow Democrats for being too close to Republicans. It has occasionally been suggested during his career that he would switch to the Republican Party. In an interview in September 2014, Cuellar said: [...] "I'm a Democrat, and I will die as a Democrat ... if a person, an elected official, puts party before their country or their state, it's wrong. We're certainly seeing that in Washington, where party comes first, and if you’re not loyal to the party, there’s something wrong with you. The easy for thing for me is to always {{go along with the}} Democratic Party, but that would not serve my state and that would not serve the district itself... I'm the first Democrat that pays my dues the DCCC... <b>I</b> pay more <b>than</b> anybody, any other Democrat, congressional member, in the state of Texas. I've done that {{for the last couple of}} years. I don’t go around and say, ‘I give <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>than</b> anybody,’ but <b>I</b> support my party. If you are going to have a litmus test — out of 100 votes, you support your party and that makes you a good member of Congress? I think that’s the wrong litmus test. What’s good for America and what’s good for Texas, that should be the litmus test." ...|$|R
60|$|The Dowager Countess of Castlewood, now {{established}} {{in her house}} at Kensington, gave us that kind of welcome which genteel ladies extend to their poorer relatives. We went once or twice to her ladyship's drums at Kensington; but, losing <b>more</b> <b>money</b> at cards, and spending <b>more</b> <b>money</b> in coach-hire <b>than</b> <b>I</b> liked to afford, we speedily gave up those entertainments, and, I dare say, were no more missed or regretted than {{other people in the}} fashionable world, who are carried by death, debt, or other accident out of the polite sphere. My Theo did not in the least regret this exclusion. She had made her appearance at one of these drums, attired in some little ornaments which her mother left behind her, and by which the good lady set some store; but I thought her own white neck was a great deal prettier than these poor twinkling stones; and there were dowagers, whose wrinkled old bones blazed with rubies and diamonds, which, I am sure, they would gladly have exchanged for her modest parure of beauty and freshness. Not a soul spoke to her--except, to be sure, Beau Lothair, a friend of Mr. Will's, who prowled about Bloomsbury afterwards, and even sent my wife a billet. I met him in Covent Garden shortly after, and promised to break his ugly face if ever I saw it in the neighbourhood of my lodgings, and Madam Theo was molested no further.|$|R
5000|$|Gentlemen of the Jury, {{you are to}} consider, that Mr. Savage is a {{very great}} Man, a much greater Man <b>than</b> you or <b>I,</b> Gentlemen of the Jury; that he wears very fine Clothes, much finer Clothes <b>than</b> you or <b>I,</b> Gentlemen of the Jury; that he has {{abundance}} of Money in his Pocket, much <b>more</b> <b>Money</b> <b>than</b> you or <b>I,</b> Gentlemen of the Jury; but, Gentlemen of the Jury, {{is it not a}} very hard Case, Gentlemen of the Jury, that Mr. Savage should therefore kill you or me, Gentlemen of the Jury? Judge Page's speech to the Jury as reported in Johnson's Life of Mr. Richard savage On the night of 20 November 1727, Savage ran into two acquaintances, James Gregory and William Merchant. After staying out drinking until past midnight, they demanded a room at Robinson's coffeehouse near Charing Cross. Merchant, not being satisfied with being told to wait for a party of guests to depart, started a brawl in which Savage, amid the chaos, apparently stabbed and mortally wounded one James Sinclair, as well as injuring a maid. The following day, all three were committed in Newgate Prison, where they assured themselves that they would be charged with manslaughter, since no premeditation was involved in Sinclair's death. However, on 6 December, when they appeared at court at the Old Bailey, they were charged with murder. Sinclair's friends and the employees of Robinson's coffeehouse, moreover, proved pitiless in their testimony for the prosecution. A Mr. Nuttal, although not having seen Savage inflict the wound, suggested Sinclair had already surrendered when Savage attacked him, while Mr Limery, another of Sinclair's friends, saw Savage physically attack but reported that Sinclair still had his sword in hand. Further statements by Nuttal and Jane Leader, an employee at Robinson's, clearly established that in his final dying words Sinclair explicitly identified Savage as the man who stabbed him. The defence, on the other hand, tried to establish Savage's innocence by stressing the ill reputation of the Coffeehouse, by claiming that Savage acted in self-defence, and by insisting on the trustfulness and considerable social standing of the accused. The judge, Francis Page, was not impressed by their attempts, and in a speech filled with sarcastic comments made it clear to the jury what verdict he was expected to see delivered. At the end of an exceptionally long trial lasting eight hours, the jury thus sentenced that Savage and Gregory were guilty of murder, and Merchant of manslaughter.|$|R
