25|$|The <b>mole</b> <b>plow</b> allows {{underdrainage}} to {{be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers which impede drainage. It is a very deep plow, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a drain. Modern <b>mole</b> <b>plow</b> may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drainâ€“ {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. A simple check can be made to find if the subsoil is in the right condition for mole ploughing. Compact a tennis ball sized sample taken at moling depth by hand, then push a pencil through. If the hole remains intact without splitting the ball the soil is in an ideal condition for the mole plough.|$|E
