50|$|A {{reciprocal}} <b>link</b> is a <b>mutual</b> <b>link</b> {{between two}} objects, commonly between two websites, to ensure mutual traffic. For example, Alice and Bob have websites. If Bob's website links to Alice's website and Alice's website links to Bob's website, the websites are reciprocally linked. Website owners often submit their sites to reciprocal <b>link</b> <b>exchange</b> directories {{in order to}} achieve higher rankings in the search engines. Reciprocal linking between websites is no longer {{an important part of the}} search engine optimization process. In 2005, with their Jagger 2 update, Google stopped giving credit to reciprocal links as it does not indicate genuine link popularity.|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of link reciprocity, the non-random {{presence}} of two <b>mutual</b> <b>links</b> between pairs of vertices. We propose a new measure of reciprocity that allows the ordering of networks according to their actual degree of correlation between <b>mutual</b> <b>links.</b> We find that real networks are always either correlated or anticorrelated, and that networks of the same type (economic, social, cellular, financial, ecological, etc.) display similar values of the reciprocity. The observed patterns are not reproduced by current models. This leads us to introduce a more general framework where <b>mutual</b> <b>links</b> occur with a conditional connection probability. In some of the studied networks we discuss the form of the conditional connection probability and the size dependence of the reciprocity.

In our experiment, a “contribution phase” {{is followed by a}} “network phase”: individuals first decide whether to contribute and then decide with whom to form a <b>link.</b> An <b>exchange</b> of contributions between individuals occurs only if a bilateral link is established. We identify the effect of revealing one's name on the probability of link formation by letting individuals choose to signal – at the linking stage – their willingness to later reveal their name. Our results indicate that this decision significantly affects partner selection and the consequent structure of the network. Individuals who reveal their name build up smaller individual networks but attain higher profits.

It presents an analytical framework which argues that, in a fully credible exchange rate target zone regime, the spot exchange rate normally stays inside the band but does not have a natural tendency to converge towards the centre of the zone. While a certain level of interest rate differential between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar may persist, it should not grow significantly larger than what is implied by the width of the Convertibility Zone. Judged against this framework, the developments since May 2005 point to increased credibility of the refined <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{results show}} that after {{the introduction of the}} three refinements to the <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system in May 2005 the Hong Kong dollar follows a bounded process that is consistent with a fully credible exchange rate band. The bounded process will limit the movements of the exchange rate to between the strong- and weak-side limits because its variance vanishes at the Convertibility Undertakings making it inaccessible to the limits. The Hong Kong dollar does not show any strong tendency to revert towards the centre of the Convertibility Zone. This is perhaps not surprising as there have been no interventions in the foreign exchange market since May 2005. There may be few forces or incentives for market participants to drive the exchange rate towards 7. 80. <b>Linked</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate system, target zone, mean reversion, bounded process...|$|R
