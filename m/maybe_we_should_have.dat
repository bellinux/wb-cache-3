5000|$|In December 2013, remarks made by Kelly in {{reaction}} to a Slate article drew controversy. On The Kelly File, she said, [...] "For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also <b>have</b> a black Santa," [...] adding, [...] "But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it." [...] Kelly also stated that Jesus was a white man later in the segment. Soon after, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Maddow, Josh Barro, and others satirized her remarks. Two days later, she made additional on-air statements, characterizing her original comments as [...] "tongue-in-cheek", and that the skin color of Jesus is [...] "far from settled".|$|R

5000|$|About {{three months}} after the release of Gods of Violence, Petrozza {{mentioned}} a follow-up album, saying, [...] "Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> work with a different producer. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> go to a different country to record the album. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> write a more metal or more full-on thrash metal. Whatever we feel, first and foremost, that is the most important thing. Time will tell." [...] In late April, the band announced an Australian tour with Vader, which will take place in September.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Alter Ego, Ordway explains: [...] "Northwind is shown--but at his side (see P. 33) is a new, young, male Harlequin, who Jerry's notes suggest might become [...] "comics' first gay character. Or we could just assume it." [...] Not a bad idea, and <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> played it that way; but we were already going to have two Green Lantern-derived heroes in Infinity, Inc." ...|$|E
5000|$|Really, after '78 {{things went}} {{downhill}} for us. I don't {{know what it}} was. We'd {{been doing it for}} so long, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> had a break then, rather than in '83 when we did have a break, or brought new blood in or done something. And even as the things were getting bad, we thought, 'Ah, it's gonna be all right, don't worry about it, it'll be great'.|$|E

5000|$|... "The {{bands are}} {{starting}} to kind of merge together. We wrote that song together and we liked it so we're thinking that <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> write some more songs together. I think that is where it's leading to now." ...|$|R

5000|$|Gouldman later {{admitted}} greater involvement by Gold might have lifted the band's early 1980s output from its mediocrity. [...] "We should either {{have tried to}} change direction, which we didn't, or got {{someone else in the}} band, which we almost did. The albums weren't really bad, there was always the integrity, and the production values, but in retrospect, I find them rather dour, rather lacklustre. That's why I thought we should have got someone else in, to kick us up the arse. We didn't {{see what was going on}} around us, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> got a producer at that point." ...|$|E
5000|$|Over {{one hundred}} {{thousand}} people marched in Dink's Funeral to protest against his assassination, holding placards that said [...] "We are all Armenian" [...] and [...] "We are Hrant Dink" [...] in both Turkish, Kurdish and Armenian.(See funeral above.) Later, these placards were protested by the far-right MHP. The leader of MHP described the placards saying [...] "We are all Armenian" [...] as [...] "a freak show organized by {{those who do not}} participate in martyr funerals". On the other hand, a party council member of the main-opposition CHP, a member of Socialist International, said [...] "We became ashamed of being Turkish. I am Turkish and I protest the assassination. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> carried the placards saying 'We are all Human' instead of 'We are all Armenians'. The placards that say [...] "assassin 301" [...] are also wrong. As long as {{we do not want to}} denigrate Turkishness, we cannot call 301 an assassin." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alex Navarro of GameSpot {{called the}} game [...] "broken", [...] "terrible", [...] "worst of the worst", and [...] "atrocious", declaring that Big Rigs is [...] "as bad as your mind {{will allow you}} to comprehend" [...] and imploring of viewers, [...] "Please do not play this game. We cannot stress this enough." [...] Considering the game to be [...] "blatantly {{unfinished}} in nearly every way", Navarro's video review consisted solely of footage from the game interspersed with scenes showing him staring in disbelief, crying, beating his head on a desk and finally exiting the building and lying {{down in the middle of}} an alley in disgust. In the Halloween video Frightfully Bad Games, Navarro stated [...] "This game received the lowest score in the history of GameSpot, a 1.0 (Abysmal). And by lowest, I mean it can't go any lower. We don't hand out zeros, but <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing." [...] For the next nine years, Big Rigs remained the only game to have scored a 1.0 on GameSpot, until this score was shared with Ride to Hell: Retribution in 2013. Navarro later revisited the game in 2015, performing a speedrun of it for the annual Awesome Games Done Quick charity event.|$|E

40|$|Rising {{inequality}} is {{the elephant}} in the European room: everybody knows it is there {{and that it is}} an obvious problem, but no one wants to either discuss the problem or address it. Macroeconomic issues have taken the front seat, andinequality might be dropped in the conversation when it has relevance from a macroeconomic perspective: <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> reduce inequality to fight secular stagnation (Fitoussi and Saraceno, 2011), especially because inequality can be self-reinforcing through secular stagnation; <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> reduce inequality toenhance growth in a world of credit-constraint households, because growth is the final goal of our policies (Birdsall et al. 1996). The fact that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> aim for socio-economic equality for itself and not for some other macroeconomic objective seems to have disappeared in th epresence of other urgencies. Paradoxically, Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the 21 st Century has spurred a global debate, but not a European one. The Capital is on everybody’s lips from New-York to Hong-Kong through Rio, but not in Brussels—although it is in everybody’s mind, hence the Elephant in the Room. But, perhaps it is so because Piketty has placed attention on high and very high income, which is less of a subject in stagnatingeconomies...|$|R

40|$|Although {{it seems}} we are {{reaching}} {{a point at which}} we can effectively suppress auto-immune inflamma-tory disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) by using increasingly active immunomodulatory thera-pies (at the cost of side-effects in a few patients), it is apparent that, because of preceding, already estab-lished, neuro-axonal injury, we also need to use some form of neuroprotective therapy in this disease. We have all seen the patient with highly active MS (iden-tified perhaps tardily) with numerous cerebral plaques, in whom, although we have now got on top of the disease, there are cognitive problems and increasing motor disability. A sense of failure descends upon the clinician; perhaps guilt. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been more persuasive and prescriptive in advo...|$|E
50|$|Shortly thereafter, Maven {{acquired}} a tile duplication evaluator. The {{idea was to}} vary a rack depending on the chance of drawing duplicates.

40|$|No {{matter how}} draconian, gun control laws are weakly {{enforced}} (at {{least in the}} United States) and seldom of any significant effect in reducing crime. So the question becomes, “Why enact them?” Is there a hidden political dynamic? But “hidden” means hard to find. So <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> look for the answer in a related jurisdiction [Britain]that keeps more extensive records of its government’s inner deliberations...|$|R

5000|$|On a {{possible}} reunion, drummer Fred Estby told Invisible Oranges in August 2016: [...] "People {{were telling me}} that all the time. So <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> try to do some shows and get everything back. We always owned our rights to the albums and shirts, but there's still loose ends to tie up.

5000|$|The writer, Thomas Pynchon, {{articulated}} the following about {{the scope and}} structure of one's ignorance: [...] "Ignorance {{is not just a}} blank space on a person's mental map.

So as a corollary to advice of writing about what <b>we</b> know, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for writing a good story." ...|$|R
