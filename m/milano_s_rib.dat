40|$|Abstract Detailed {{data from}} {{statistical}} {{analyses of the}} structural properties of the inter-domain linker peptides of the bacterial regulators of the family MocR are herein reported. MocR regulators are a recently discovered subfamily of bacterial regulators possessing an N-terminal domain, 60 residue long on average, folded as the winged-helix-turn-helix architecture responsible for recognition and binding, and a large C-terminal domain (350 residue on average) that belongs to the fold type-I pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes such aspartate aminotransferase. Data show the distribution of several structural characteristics of the linkers taken from bacterial species from five different phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Interpretation and discussion of reported data refer to the article “Structural properties of the linkers connecting the N- and C- terminal domains in the MocR bacterial transcriptional regulators” (T. <b>Milano,</b> <b>S.</b> Angelaccio, A.

One sebaceous fingerprint was deposited onto twenty-five of each size of cartridge to enable a statistical evaluation of the enhancement methods for each cartridge size to be undertaken. The enhancement methods compared were superglue followed by BY 40, superglue followed by gun blue followed by BY 40, gun blue only, superglue followed by palladium deposition, palladium deposition only, and powder suspension. The six different cartridges {{used in this study}} were. 22 s,. 32 s, 9 mm,. 38 <b>s,</b> <b>ribbed</b> shotgun, and smooth shotgun. The study found that more potentially identifiable fingerprints were enhanced on the larger cartridge cases.

This showed that the combination of the cyanoacrylate fuming and the metal oxidation reactions is increasing the yield of potentially identifiable fingerprints compared {{with the use of the}} techniques separately. Both techniques were also found to give reproducible results. These two enhancement techniques were also compared statistically and no statistical difference in their effectiveness was found suggesting both techniques are equally as effective at enhancing fingerprints on brass cartridge cases...|$|R

40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} {{are known for}} their gender equality agenda and policies. There have been different processes of collaboration on this issue conducted between the Nordic countries and Russia. In today s globalized world, the processes of learning from other countries experiences and transferring best practices in order to solve problems have become more common. However, the concept of universality of provided policy models have been criticized by various researchers since contexts play a great role in adaptation of transferring policies on the ground. Due to the fact that Nordic countries and Russia represent different political, social, and cultural contexts, domestication of the gender equality agenda occurs. Thus, this research, using the postcolonial critique on universality and Alasuutari s concept of domestication, examines how this domestication of the Nordic gender equality norms takes place in the Russian context. The research, first, presents conceptual and theoretical discussion, starting from the critique of universal understanding of knowledge, and the concept of contextuality. Then, the thesis moves on to discuss the main concepts of the study: policy transfer and domestication of transnational models. This is followed by discussion on the Nordic and Russian gender orders. I have chosen two cases to analyse policy transfer and domestication of Nordic gender models in Russia: the case of collaboration between the Nordic Council of Ministers and North-West Russia and the case of the activist Eve <b>s</b> <b>Ribs</b> project have been studied through means of interview conduction, participant observation and searching documents, websites, etc. for primary data. Case study enables to capture a vivid and rich picture of collaborative processes and draw conclusions on domestication of equality ideas by representative actors. Moreover, as a conclusion, a comparison between two cases presenting different layers of public relations has been made. This research found that domestication of the gender equality agenda is possible only regionally into current Russia. In general, the importance of local communal contexts and their peculiarities are underlined throughout the research. Moreover, the conclusion about differences in two layers of analysis has been made. Whereas the governmental officials, implementing the Nordic policies, put a big emphasis on the social and labour rights of women and indicate the importance of supporting the issues of motherhood (alike with the historical understanding of gender issues based on biological differences), the feminist activists express more solidarity among themselves sharing almost the same feminist discourse...|$|R

Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (Weaver), S. neuquensis (Burckhardt) and S. quintucoensis (Weaver). S. quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank <b>ribs.</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae.

40|$|Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes are {{two related}} human {{pathogens}} causing different diseases. This thesis {{focuses on a}} number of surface proteins expressed by S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes and, more specifically, the molecular and biological characterization of these proteins. The first paper describes the novel Blr protein of S. agalactiae, which together with the previously described Slr protein of S. pyogenes identifies a family of streptococcal proteins with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Characterization of Blr and Slr revealed that the two proteins are efficiently camouflaged by other surface components. In S. agalactiae, exposure of Blr was increased ~ 100 -fold in a mutant lacking the polysaccharide capsule, whereas S. pyogenes mutants lacking M protein and/or protein F displayed ~ 20 -fold increased surface exposure of Slr. It seems possible that the camouflaging structures are downregulated during some parts of the infection process, thus exposing the Blr and Slr proteins on the streptococcal surface. In the second paper, we analyzed a key problem in the vaccine field, the identification of antigens that elicit protective immunity. Our studies were focused on the immune response to the <b>S.</b> agalactiae proteins <b>Rib</b> and alpha. These proteins contain a unique N-terminal region and long repetitive C-terminal sequences. The immune response against pure Rib or alpha was almost exclusively directed against the repeat region, i. e. very few antibodies were directed against the N-terminal regions. Thus, the N-terminal region is nonimmunodominant in both Rib and alpha. Nevertheless, a fusion protein comprising the N-terminal regions of Rib and alpha elicited antibodies that were protective. Importantly, studies of the S. pyogenes M 22 protein showed that the N-terminal region, which is targeted by opsonic antibodies, was also nonimmunodominant. Together, these results indicate that nonimmunodominant regions are of general interest for vaccine development. The third paper addresses the role of fibrinogen (Fg) in bacterial virulence. We characterized the Fg-binding B repeat region of the S. pyogenes M 5 protein. In a mouse model, a mutant lacking the Fg-binding domain was severely attenuated, indicating that binding of Fg {{plays a key role in}} virulence. Similarly, a bacterial mutant lacking the most N-terminal part of the M 5 protein was avirulent. Together, these data indicate that two separate regions of M 5 are important for virulence. The function of bacteria-bound Fg is not known, but our data support the notion that bound Fg protects the bacteria against complement deposition and thereby against phagocytosis...|$|R

TRIP ablation results in early embryonic lethality in mice. To investigate TRIP function in epidermis, we examined its expression and the effect of TRIP knockdown (KD) in keratinocytes. TRIP mRNA expression was strongly downregulated in primary human keratinocytes undergoing differentiation triggered by high cell density or high calcium. Short-term phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (TPA) treatment or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase signaling in proliferative keratinocytes suppressed TRIP transcription. Inhibition by TPA was protein kinase C dependent. Keratinocytes undergoing KD of TRIP expression by lentiviral short-hairpin RNA (shRNA; T 4 and T 5) had strongly reduced proliferation rates compared with control shRNA. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that TRIP-KD caused growth arrest in the G 1 /S phase. Keratinocytes with TRIP-KD resembled differentiated cells consistent with the augmented expression of differentiation markers keratin 1 and filaggrin. Luciferase-based reporter assays showed no increase in NF-κB activity in TRIP-KD keratinocytes, indicating that NF-κB activity in keratinocytes is not regulated by TRIP. TRIP expression was increased by ∼ 2 -fold in basal cell carcinomas compared with normal skin. These results underline the important role of TRIP in the regulation of cell cycle progression and the tight linkage of its expression to keratinocyte proliferation...|$|R
