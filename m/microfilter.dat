25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat labile pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A <b>microfilter</b> with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms.

In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of DSL, {{installation}} required a technician to visit the premises. A splitter or <b>microfilter</b> was installed near the demarcation point, from which a dedicated data line was installed. This way, the DSL signal is separated {{as close as possible to}} the central office and is not attenuated inside the customer's premises. However, this procedure was costly, and also caused problems with customers complaining about having to wait for the technician to perform the installation. So, many DSL providers started offering a [...] "self-install" [...] option, in which the provider provided equipment and instructions to the customer. Instead of separating the DSL signal at the demarcation point, the DSL signal is filtered at each telephone outlet by use of a low-pass filter for voice and a high-pass filter for data, usually enclosed in what is known as a <b>microfilter.</b> This <b>microfilter</b> can be plugged by an end user into any telephone jack: it does not require any rewiring at the customer's premises.|$|E

S. aureus and L. garvieae were co-cultivated in broth buffered at pH 6. 8, and in raw, pasteurized and <b>microfiltered</b> milk, in presence and absence of catalase. Although H(2) O(2) production by L garvieae was detected only in agitated broth, the inhibition of S. aureus by L garvieae was reduced by catalase both in static and shaking cultures by 2. 7 log, pasteurized milk (similar to 0. 7 log), <b>microfiltered</b> milk (similar to 0. 6 log) and raw milk (similar to 0. 2 log).

50|$|Ice Protection {{with the}} TKS Ice Protection system is {{achieved}} by mounting laser-drilled titanium porous panels on the leading edges of the airframe. The panel skin is perforated with eight hundred 0.0025-inch-diameter laser-drilled holes per square inch. TKS fluid exudes through the panels on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizers. Fluid is also thoroughly distributed from the slinger-ring on the propeller and from the windshield spraybar. Secondary fairings or structures such as lift struts can also be protected. Engine inlets may be protected, as well. The fluid is pumped from a tank by an electrically-driven metering pump through a <b>microfilter</b> to proportioning units. Proportioning units contain calibrated capillary tubes that divide the flow to the individual needs of the porous panels and the slinger ring. One metering pump is provided for inadvertent systems. For systems certified for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI), two pumps are installed for redundancy and can be selected individually. Fluid for the windshield spraybar system is provided by an on-demand gear pump. One or two windshield pumps are provided depending on the certification basis. As the TKS Ice Protection system is used, any accumulation of debris is flushed out. Glycol has cleaning properties and will not harm the paint finish of the aircraft. No performance is lost from the system; only significant ice protection capabilities are added.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} and separation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are crucial in early cancer diagnosis and cancer prognosis. Filtration through {{a thin film}} {{is one of the}} size and deformability based separation methods, which can isolate rare CTCs from the peripheral blood of cancer patients regardless of their heterogeneity. In this paper, volume of fluid (VOF) multiphase flow models are employed to clarify the cells’ filtering processes. The cells may deform significantly when they enter a channel constriction, which will induce cell membrane stress and damage if the area strain is larger than the critical value. Therefore, the cellular damage criterion characterized by membrane area strain is presented in our model, i. e., the lysis limit of the lipid bilayer is taken as the critical area strain. Under this criterion, we discover that the <b>microfilters</b> with slit-shaped pores do less damage to cells than those with circular pores. The influence of contact angle between the <b>microfilters</b> and blood cells on cellular injury is also discussed. Moreover, the optimal film thickness and flux in our simulations are obtained as 0. 5 μm and 0. 375 mm/s, respectively. These findings will provide constructive guidance for the improvement of next generation <b>microfilters</b> with higher throughput and less cellular damage...|$|R

40|$|The {{excimer laser}} {{micromachining}} process has displayed numerous advantages as an efficient tool for fabricating 2 D and 3 D micro-components, {{such as a}} high-resolution power (up to sub-micrometer range) and ablation without thermal damage. This work investigates the suitability and limitations of the process for the fabrication of <b>microfilters</b> using excimer laser micromachining. Their successful fabrication requires precise control over the work parameters, and deals {{with a number of}} challenges. Three <b>microfilters</b> of mean pore sizes 14. 4 mu m, 18. 3 mu m and 25. 6 mu m but with the same opening ratio, and containing up to 14 000 holes, have been fabricated.

The Reynolds number based on hole diameter covered is 0. 0086 - 0. 21. The key findings include development of a successful method of fabrication, a positive correlation between pressure drop and flow rate during testing, and an increase in slope of the pressure curve with a decrease in pore size. The correlation available in the literature shows a large deviation with respect to the experimental data and a new correlation has been proposed.

Importantly, the captured cells retained normal morphology by scanning electron microscopy and could be readily manipulated, further analyzed, or expanded on- or off-filter. Telomerase activity—a well-recognized universal cancer marker—was reliably detected by quantitative PCR from as few as 25 cancer cells added into 7. 5 mL of whole blood and captured on the <b>microfilter.</b> Moreover, significant telomerase activity elevation was also measured from patients' blood samples and from single cancer cells lifted off of the <b>microfilter.</b> Live CTC capture and analysis is fast and simple yet highly quantitative, versatile, and applicable to nearly all solid tumor types, making this a highly promising new strategy for cancer detection and characterization...|$|E
40|$|The rotary <b>microfilter</b> is an {{alternative}} filter technology that offers increased filter flux over conventional filtration technologies. The filter system combines centrifugation with membrane filtration. Solids are removed from the liquid at the membrane surface, and the centrifugal force acts to keep the surface clean, minimizing {{the formation of a}} filter cake. The centrifugal force minimizes solids buildup, allowing more flow through the filter membrane. The effect is the same as increasing the axial velocity of a crossflow filter without increasing system pressure requirements. Centrifugal filter systems are commercially available and have been used in radioactive service both at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (for Low-Level Waste) and in Russia (for High-Level Waste).
