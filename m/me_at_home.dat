500|$|Matthews' autobiography, The Way It Was, was {{released}} by Headline in 2000. The book is dedicated to his wife Mila, who died the year before its publication. Matthews, then 84, collaborated with Les Scott, his friend of 10 years, {{in the writing of}} the book over an 18-month period on an almost daily basis. [...] "Stan, as he had been all his life, was an early riser," [...] wrote Scott in the epilogue. [...] "Our collaborations were over by eleven in the morning and, without fail, took place in his den. He loved working on his book and, after I had left him, he would give the morning's session more applied thought — more often than not ringing <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> to provide additional thoughts or anecdotes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{performed}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] for {{the first}} time in November 2010 on the BBC music show. Later, with Jools Holland before the release of the album. As the performance finished, there was a notable stunned silence from the audience, before bursting into applause. Adele has since described this performance as a career defining moment. [...] Later, she performed the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 15 February 2011. She appeared on stage backed just by her pianist while [...] "special effects were limited to a shower of glitter and Adele's own tears, as she almost broke down delivering her lovelorn plea to an ex-boyfriend" [...] as stated by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph. Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she had cried at the end of the performance saying, [...] "I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, and then I had a vision of my ex, of him watching <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and he's going to be laughing at me because he knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed." [...] A writer of Daily Mirror said that [...] "Adele stole the show [...] with her praised performance of Someone Like You." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked [...] "everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You." [...] Later, the song was performed during a VH1 special called [...] "Unplugged". Adele also performed the song at Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 24 February 2011. The same day she performed [...] "Someone like You" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.|$|E
