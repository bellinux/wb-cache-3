40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} EC budget over the period 1985 - 89. It begins from the premise that economic variables influence both a <b>member</b> <b>state’s</b> <b>contributions</b> to the finance of the budget and its receipts under the various spending programmes. We examine this hypothesis using data from 5 years relating to all EC members. A regression model is fitted {{in order to establish}} whether (and to what degree) a <b>member</b> <b>state’s</b> <b>contributions</b> to the budget and the receipts it can expect under the main budget heads, are likely to increase with the country’s income. The principal findings are that a country’s GDP is an accurate guide to the contributions it can expect to make but a much less reliable guide to receipts. The result is that net contributions are not strongly correlated with GDP. We find also that economic indicators such as unemployment rates and the proportion of the population employed in agriculture have limited additional explanatory power. The paper extends the analysis by exploring how the position might have changed had recent moves to switch more EC spending from agricultural price support to structural measures taken place earlier. This simulation assumes that the structural part of the budget had been expanded while the agricultural price support remained the same, the extra spending being financed by a proportionate increase in contributions. It emerges that such measures would have made a member’s net contributions slightly more sensitive to GDP. But {{it would not have been}} sufficient to give the budget a significant role in terms of redistributing income from poorer <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to richer ones...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The EU {{has several}} aspects which {{allow us to}} speak about an {{emerging}} Federal System. Generally, the EU budget is not mentioned to be among them. The budget has been characterised as poor-sized, inflexible and dependent on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>contributions.</b> But {{there are several reasons}} for considering an evolution of the EU budget towards a genuine budget with federal characteristics. This is noticeable with regard to its spending structure, concerning the production of public goods, and the budgetary decision making process, especially regarding the role of the European Parliament. The main argument of this text is that the EU budget is evolving towards a budget in a federal sense based on the rational that all <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and the Union have common objectives rooted in common values...|$|R

Therefore we employ several algorithmic ideas of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis in order to support the solution of distribution problems, in particular the ideas underlying the Multiplicative AHP which was designed to process ratio information.

Two examples, (a) the establishment of the <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>contributions</b> to the European Union, and (b) the allocation of seats in the European Parliament to the <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> show that the proposed method produces contributions and allocations with a higher degree of fairness and equity than the solutions adopted so far...|$|R

40|$|After {{extensive}} {{flooding in}} 2002, the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was created as an ex post loss-financing vehicle for EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate {{countries in the}} case of disasters that exceed the government's resources to cope. The USF is viewed as a valuable instrument for pooling risk among countries in Europe and potentially as a model for financing loss and damage from climate change in vulnerable countries worldwide. This paper assesses its future prospects taking account of reforms adopted in 2014. Our analysis is based on three recognized aims of the Solidarity Fund: its promotion of solidarity with those countries having the least capacity to cope wth major disasters; its contribution to proactive disaster risk reduction and management (climate adaptation); and its robustness with regard to its risk of depletion (stress testing). Using a simulation approach for future disasters, we conclude that the reformed EUSF's risk of depletion, although it is reasonably robust to more frequent disasters, could be reduced by increasing <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>contributions</b> and/or engaging in risk transfer. The European Commission has taken important steps in linking the fund to proactive risk reduction; yet, by changing its budgeting practices, the commission could be more proactive in encouraging risk management in <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> In its current form, the EUSF does not embed needs-based solidarity. Lower-income "new" <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have received disproportionately less compensation in terms of eligible losses, although on average, they have received more disaster aid than what they contribute to the fund. Solidarity could be enhanced by changing the rules for disbursing aid. After briefly describing alternative risk-pooling models in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe, we suggest how design features of the EUSF as compared to other regional risk pools can inform discussions on the Warsaw International Loss and Damage Mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of solidarity {{is embedded in the}} foundations of the European Union (EU) legal system and is integral to the very ethos that has made the Union possible. However, as <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> struggle with contemporary challenges such as high migration flows, terrorism and economic turmoil they have predominantly adopted individualist and protectionist strategies which undermine the character of the Union. Those strategies include, for instance, building walls and securitising internal borders. This contribution argues that solidarity is inextricably linked with responsibility.

Stepwise linear regression is employed to detect variables useful in explaining the degree of agricultural market integration of farm households.

The proportion of consumption from own production, manual cultivation techniques, and distance to an urban center are negatively correlated with output sales.

40|$|The Radio Regulations (RR) is an {{international}} treaty with which the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> comply when managing the spectrum to avoid harmful interference. The RR is {{the outcome of the}} World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) and is based on <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>contributions</b> and negotiations. <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> must implement the RR provisions carefully. However, national interpretations of the provisions are typically complex, leading to conflicts. Improved knowledge of the rationale behind the provisions would reduce tensions between <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Unfortunately, the ITU archives contain only the final input and output documents of the WRC proceedings and RR versions, nothing on the informal deliberations that form the rationale and missing information. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the information needs of spectrum policy setting, including the relevant ITU processes and archives (WRC proceedings and RR versions). The study also proposes possible solutions to handling the missing information from the ITU archives in this policy setting. To address the purpose, the study explores the contents of the ITU archives in terms of the WRC and RR developments. The author attended several meetings to document observations on meeting dynamics. Meeting observations were conducted through national and regional preparatory meetings and the WRC- 12 on Agenda Items 1. 19 and 1. 22. The observations identify the particular form and nature of the information missing from the archives. An analysis of WRC- 12 Agenda Items 1. 2 and 1. 19 from Thailand’s perspective illustrates the gains that would accrue if this information were to be made available. The main study results are the WRC and RR developments, including key definitions, important provisions, frequency bands in specified services, and the WRC preparatory process. These processes include the agenda-setting and study processes (national and regional activities). Many aspects of these processes are not documented. Using the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework to understand the decision-making process inside the WRC activities yields a broad list of questions. This list includes questions about action situations. Much of the information that has not yet been documented could improve the resolutions. To improve the archive resources, the study proposes that an information record form with webcast archives, minutes of meeting below the level of plenary session, and full use of a SharePoint website be completed and lodged with the archives. <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> networking would also provide an option to reduce the information deficit and compensate for <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> that do not attend the relevant meetings. Enhanced archives and <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> networking would assist Low Income countries and <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> that are unable to participate in meetings due to resource constraints by providing argumentations and issue summaries.

It illustrates how there could be potential for 70 - 80 European biorefineries, but not hundreds.

According to the incentive-based explanation that dominates the literature, conditionality has been particularly effective when the EU offered a credible membership incentive and when governments did not consider the domestic costs of compliance threatening to their hold on power. This volume challenges much of the existing work on EU enlargement and postcommunist transition, however, by testing the conditionality thesis in the post-accession setting. Whereas a conditionality hypothesis would predict deteriorating compliance among the newest <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> several <b>contributions</b> here actually find the opposite. Enduring compliance among postcommunist states with the acquis, as well as with less formally institutionalized EU preferences for economic liberalization and minority protection, calls into question the role that conditionality plays in eliciting conformity. Simultaneously, support for the conditionality hypothesis in areas such as political party development and EU relations with Turkey and the western Balkans suggests conditionality's effects vary across countries and issues. As the first study to systematically examine the relationship between international institutions and postcommunist states after enlargement, this volume provides new insights into how external actors exercise their power in domestic politics.
