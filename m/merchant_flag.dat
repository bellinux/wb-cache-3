5|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Tokugawa shogunate, Japanese ships {{were ordered to}} hoist the Hinomaru to {{distinguish}} themselves from foreign ships. Before then, different types of Hinomaru flags were used on vessels that were trading with the U.S. and Russia. The Hinomaru was decreed the <b>merchant</b> <b>flag</b> of Japan in 1870 and was the legal national flag from 1870 to 1885, making it the first national flag Japan adopted.|$|E

25|$|A civil ensign is an ensign used by {{civilian}} {{vessels to}} denote their nationality. It {{can be the}} same or different from the state ensign and the war ensign (or naval ensign). It's {{also known as the}} merchant ensign or <b>merchant</b> <b>flag.</b> Some countries have special civil ensigns for yachts, and even for specific yacht clubs, known as yacht ensigns.|$|E

50|$|In 1844, the {{proposals}} {{of a joint}} committee were enacted for both countries by King Oscar I. A union mark was created, combining the flag colours of both countries, equally distributed.

The two countries received separate, but parallel flag systems, clearly manifesting their equality.|$|R
25|$|The {{current state}} flag of Tasmania was officially adopted {{following}} a proclamation by Tasmanian colonial Governor Sir Frederick Weld on 25 September 1876, and {{was first published}} in the Tasmanian Gazette the same day. The governor's proclamation here were three official flags, they being the Governor's flag, the Tasmania Government vessel flag, and a Tasmania <b>merchant</b> <b>flag.</b> Up until 1856 when Tasmania was granted responsible self-government, the Union flag and the British ensign were primarily used on state occasions.|$|E
25|$|On 15 March 1822, the Provisional Government, by Decree Nr. 540, {{laid down}} the exact pattern: white cross on blue (plain) for the land flag; nine alternate-coloured stripes with the white cross on a blue field in the canton for the naval ensign; and blue with a blue cross on a white field in the canton for the civil ensign (<b>merchant</b> <b>flag).</b> On 30 June 1828, by decree of the Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, the civil ensign was discontinued, and the cross-and-stripes naval ensign became the {{national}} ensign, worn by both naval and merchant ships. This design became immediately very popular with Greeks and in practice was often used simultaneously with the national (plain cross) flag.|$|E
500|$|Passed in 1870, the Prime Minister's Proclamation No.57 had two {{provisions}} {{related to}} the national flag. The first provision specified who flew the flag {{and how it was}} flown; the second specified how the flag was made. The ratio was seven units width and ten units length (7:10). The red disc, which represents the sun, was calculated to be three-fifths of the hoist width. The law decreed the disc to be in the center, but it was usually placed one-hundredth (...) towards the hoist. On October 3 of the same year, regulations about the design of the merchant ensign and other naval flags were passed. For the <b>merchant</b> <b>flag,</b> the ratio was two units width and three units length (2:3). The size of the disc remained the same, however the sun disc was placed one-twentieth (...) towards the hoist.|$|E

As Leander closed, a gun was {{seen on the}} ship's forecastle and its silhouette resembled an Italian Ramb-class fruit carrier. Leander went to action stations at 11:15a.m. and when ordered ten minutes later, the vessel hoisted a British <b>merchant</b> <b>flag.</b> When ordered to give its signal letters, the ship hoisted four letters which were not listed in British signal books. Leander made the secret challenge but received no reply and the ship maintained its course and speed. A boarding party was standing by and at 11:45a.m., the ship was ordered to stop instantly but no reply was received. A few minutes later, the ship hoisted the Italian <b>merchant</b> <b>flag</b> and laid its guns on Leander.

2500|$|A few shell {{splinters}} hit Leander, which fired five salvoes in a minute, then ceased fire {{to observe}} results. Leander made the flag signal [...] "Do you surrender?", the <b>Merchant</b> <b>flag</b> {{was seen to}} be lowered and the crew began to abandon ship. Leander had hit the ship {{several times in the}} forepart and through a large hole in the side, a fire burned. A boat was lowered from Leander with a boarding party to try to save the ship and two lifeboats were seen leaving the vessel, as men jumped overboard or scrambled down the side. An Italian officer in the water called out that the boarding party should not approach the ship, as it was burning and laden with ammunition. The boarding party laid off and as the fire spread, a big explosion before the bridge shot flames and smoke high into the sky, the ship settling bows first. At 12:43p.m., there was another explosion and five minutes later the ship sank under a cloud of black smoke. Leander recovered the boarding party and the Italian lifeboats while edging away.|$|E
6000|$|I {{dwell on}} the effect on Tamasese. Whatever the faults of Becker, he was not timid; he had already braved so much for Mulinuu that I cannot but think he might have {{continued}} to hold up his head even after the outrage of the pigs, and that the weakness now shown originated with the king. Late in the night, Blacklock was wakened to receive a despatch addressed to Leary. [...] "You have asked that I and my government go away from Mulinuu, because you pretend a man who lives near Mulinuu and who is under your protection, has been threatened by my soldiers. As your Excellency has forbidden the man to accept any satisfaction, and as I {{do not wish to}} make war against the United States, I shall remove my government from Mulinuu to another place." [...] It was signed by Tamasese, but I think more heads than his had wagged over the direct and able letter. On the morning of the 11th, accordingly, Mulinuu the much defended lay desert. Tamasese and Brandeis had slipped to sea in a schooner; their troops had followed them in boats; the German sailors and their war-flag had returned on board the Adler; and only the German <b>merchant</b> <b>flag</b> blew there for Weber's land-claim. Mulinuu, for which Becker had intrigued so long and so often, for which he had overthrown the municipality, for which he had abrogated and refused and invented successive schemes of neutral territory, was now no more to the Germans than a very unattractive, barren peninsula and a very much disputed land-claim of Mr. Weber's. It will scarcely be believed that the tale of the Scanlon outrages was not yet finished. Leary had gained his point, but Scanlon had lost his compensation. And it was months later, and this time {{in the shape of a}} threat of bombardment in black and white, that Tamasese heard the last of the absurd affair. Scanlon had both his fun and his money, and Leary's practical joke was brought to an artistic end.|$|E
