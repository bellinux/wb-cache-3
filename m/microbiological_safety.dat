40|$|<b>Microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> is a complex, {{fundamental}} issue of continuing concern. Contributing to this complexity {{and the emergence}} of food safety issues are ongoing changes in demographics, geographic origin of food, food production and processing, food consumption patterns, and microorganisms themselves.

40|$|European food {{industries}} {{are responsible for}} the safety of the food products brought on the market. Therefore, a legal demanded food safety management system (FSMS) or self-checking system (SCS) is implemented in companies, often based on commercial quality assurance standards as ISO 22000, BRC or IFS. The Belgian government provides the possibility for food business operators to have their SCS approved by means of audits conducted by either the competent food safety authority, FASFC, or by a commercial certification body, recognised by the government. The audits are based on specifically developed guides for self-checking per sector, approved by the Belgian government. In view of evaluating the effect of the self-checking system certification on the performance of an implemented FSMS and the companies’ <b>microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> output, this paper presents the results of an independent self-assessment conducted by eighty-two food business operators in Belgium. The study was conducted in spring/summer of 2010. The outcome of this study is discussed against national inspection results by the FASFC of the year 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Belgian food companies. The enforcement of a SCS by the Belgian government on the performance of a FSMS, their food safety output and their inspection results is less clear for food processing companies compared to the positive effect for the distribution sector. The majority of food processing companies were already certified for a voluntary system next to the legal demanded SCS. No significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified companies; large, medium or small scale companies and the sector in which they are working for food processing companies. Five clusters could be identified in the performance of a FSMS and <b>microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> output.

40|$|The Belgian {{food safety}} {{authority}} has provided incentives for food business operators to set-up a certified self-checking system (SCS), based upon good practices and HACCP principles. A selection of food processing companies in Belgium {{was invited to}} take part in a self-assessment study to evaluate the effect of SCS certification on the performance of an implemented food safety management system (FSMS) and on company’s <b>microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> output according to their sector and company size and to compare the added value of SCS against voluntary standard certification. Results revealed that the majority of food processing companies (90 %) were already certified for a voluntary standard such as BRC or IFS prior to or next to the Belgian SCS certification (50 %). Although five clusters could be identified among the eighty-two participating companies in the performance profiles of their food safety management system and <b>microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> output, overall no significant difference could be identified between SCS certified and non-certified SCS food processing companies. However, assurance activities (i. e. set-up of sampling plan, validation and verification of the FSMS) were elaborated at a more advanced, tailored level in SCS certified companies. No significant differences were found according to company size, but depending on the sector more robust FSMS could be identified (e. g. animal products processing sector). The benefits of the widespread presence of a third party certified food safety management system (whether voluntary standard or national SCS) as a basis for governing food safety are also reflected in the favourable inspection results obtained by Belgian food safety authority (76. 90 %e 78. 71 % compliance in years 2009 e 2011; 12 823 SCS certified companies being visited) at the processing level. Whereas higher non-compliance in inspection results is noted (47. 55 e 52. 45 % compliance in years 2009 e 2011; 4 415 SCS certified companies being visited) in the distribution sector, encompassing a large amount of small food service operations and retail outlets. The introduction of certified SCS is still exceptional in that sector (4. 11 % in 2011) and the introduction of voluntary standards is less common due to lack of incentives, capacity and resources. Thus, there are indications that a certification system based on audits is an appropriate approach in pro-actively governing food safety and supporting the implementation of control and assurance activities at advanced level, hence increasing the robustness of the food safety management systems as a basis for good <b>microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> output...|$|R
40|$|The current quality {{assurance}} and control tools and methods to prevent and/or to control microbiological {{risks associated with}} fresh produce are challenged due to the following pressures upon the food supply chain, i. e. changing consumption patterns, globalization and climate change. It demonstrates the need for {{scientific research and development}} of new and/or improved tools, techniques and practices to adapt the current risk management systems. In this paper, a conceptual research approach is presented to analyse the complexity of the climate change and globalization challenge on the fresh produce supply chain taken as a case study. The factors which affect the vulnerability of the fresh produce chain demand a multidisciplinary research approach. The proposed knowledge-based modelling system is believed to be a most appropriate way to identify problems and to offer solutions to monitor and prevent <b>microbiological</b> food <b>safety</b> risks during all phases of food production and supply. To explore the potential impact of climate change and globalization, baseline information can be obtained by surveillance and performance measurement of implemented food safety management systems. Simulation of climate change scenarios and the logistic chain of fresh produce, along with mathematical models to optimize packaging technology to maintain quality and safety of fresh produce are tools to provide insights in the complex dynamic ecosystem. They are the basis for elaboration of risk assessment studies to scientifically support management options and decisions to new microbiological threats related to globalization and climate change in the fresh produce supply chain. This research concept as such will contribute to develop strategies in order to guarantee the (<b>microbiological)</b> food <b>safety</b> of fresh produce on the long ter...|$|R

Increasingly, biopolymers are used as the material basis for packaging, replacing fossil-based polymers. Yet, new packaging types tend to face issues like a higher price and hence, difficulties in competition with the cheaper fossil-based materials.|$|E
