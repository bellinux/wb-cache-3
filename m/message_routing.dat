50|$|MTP3 {{provides}} routing functionality {{to transport}} signaling messages through the SS7 network to the requested endpoint. Each network {{element in the}} SS7 network has a unique address, the Point Code (PC). <b>Message</b> <b>routing</b> is performed according to this address. A distinction is made between a Signaling Transfer Point (STP) which only performs MTP <b>message</b> <b>routing</b> functionalities and a Signaling End Point (SEP) which uses MTP to communicate with other SEPs (that is, telecom switches). MTP3 is also responsible for network management; when the availability of MTP2 data links changes. MTP3 establishes alternative links and re-routes traffic away from failed links and signaling points and propagates information about route availability through the network. Also controls traffic when congestion occurs.|$|E

40|$|Mobile ad-hoc {{networks}} (MANET) rely on wireless {{connections between}} mobile nodes, which mean limited bandwidth & {{high rate of}} disconnections between nodes. So {{there is a great}} need for a new routing protocol that have low <b>routing</b> <b>message</b> overhead to enhance the performance of MANET. The reduction of <b>routing</b> <b>message</b> overhead will decrease the wasted portions of bandwidth that used for exchange <b>routing</b> <b>messages</b> between nodes, and increase the bandwidth available for transferring data, which in turn increases the network throughput and decreases the latency. This paper proposes a new MANET routing protocol that decreases both of the <b>routing</b> <b>message</b> overhead and the average end to end delay by on average 27. 9 %, 13. 7 % respectively less than the well known AODV routing protocol. This led to increase the throughput by 23. 87 % more than AODV routing protocol...|$|R

40|$|We propose in {{this paper}} a {{response}} to the problem of cooperation and collaboration between nodes in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) for intelligent data relays from one source to a destination. In their operation, each routing protocol relies on the support of each node for end-to-end <b>messages</b> <b>routing</b> by completely ignoring the autonomous nature of the node that is to be free to accept, reject, relay or otherwise simply manipulate the protocol’s principle. This random and unpredictable behavior of the node impacts on the routing effectiveness in the global network.
