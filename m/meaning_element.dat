A vast number of logograms are needed to write Chinese characters, cuneiform, and Mayan, where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—("logoconsonantal" [...] {{in the case of}} hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese [...] "radicals", hieroglyphic [...] "determiners"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for [...] "fin", pronounced [...] "ka'", was also used to represent the syllable [...] "ka" [...] whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (<b>meaning)</b> <b>element</b> called a radical with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a phonetic. However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.|$|E

40|$|Basic speech-act distinctions apply quasi-universally across languages, {{but little}} {{attention}} has been paid so far to formally modelling the evolution of these. Even worse so, standard models of language evolution from evolutionary game theory deliver functionally ambiguous meanings: evolved meanings in Lewisean signalling games seem hybrids between assertions and directives. This has been noted by Lewis (1969) already, but has only recently received renewed attention (Huttegger, 2007; Blume and Board, 2011; Zollman, 2011). Contrary to previous modelling attempts this paper argues that a functional distinction in formal models should be based on criteria that linguistic typology uses to distinguish clause types cross-linguistically. The paper then offers two simple models that delineate assertoric and imperative meanings once by semantic denotation and once by pragmatic effect. The latter requires us to go beyond standard modelling techniques: in order to account for the dynamic <b>meaning</b> <b>element</b> of "giving a directive" we need a mechanism of co-evolving meanings and norms...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{language}} has occupied {{a special place}} in the history of Indian thought. Indian philosophers give particular attention to the analysis of the cognition obtained from language, known under the generic name of śābdabodha. This term is used to denote, among other things, the cognition episode of the hearer, the content of which is described {{in the form of a}} paraphrase of a sentence represented as a hierarchical structure. Philosophers submit the meaning of the component items of a sentence and their relationship to a thorough examination, and represent the content of the resulting cognition as a paraphrase centred on a <b>meaning</b> <b>element,</b> that is taken as principal qualificand (mukhyaviśesya) which is qualified by the other meaning elements. This analysis is the object of continuous debate over a period of more than a thousand years between the philosophers of the schools of Mimāmsā, Nyāya (mainly in its Navya form) and Vyākarana. While these philosophers are in complete agreement on the idea that the cognition of sentence meaning has a hierarchical structure and share the concept of a single principal qualificand (qualified by other meaning elements), they strongly disagree on the question which <b>meaning</b> <b>element</b> has this role and by which morphological item it is expressed. This disagreement is the central point of their debate and gives rise to competing versions of this theory. The Mïmāmsakas argue that the principal qualificand is what they call bhāvanā ̒bringing into being̒, ̒efficient force̒ or ̒productive operation̒, expressed by the verbal affix, and distinct from the specific procedures signified by the verbal root; the Naiyāyikas generally take it to be the meaning of the word with the first case ending, while the Vaiyākaranas take it to be the operation expressed by the verbal root. All the participants rely on the Pāninian grammar, insofar as the Mimāmsakas and Naiyāyikas do not compose a new grammar of Sanskrit, but use different interpretive strategies in order to justify their views, that are often in overt contradiction with the interpretation of the Pāninian rules accepted by the Vaiyākaranas. In each of the three positions, weakness in one area is compensated by strength in another, and the cumulative force of the total argumentation shows that no position can be declared as correct or overall superior to the others. This book is an attempt to understand this debate, and to show that, to make full sense of the irreconcilable positions of the three schools, one must go beyond linguistic factors and consider the very beginnings of each school's concern with the issue under scrutiny. The texts, and particularly the late texts of each school present very complex versions of the theory, yet the key to understanding why these positions remain irreconcilable seems to lie elsewhere, this in spite of extensive argumentation involving a great deal of linguistic and logical technicalities. Historically, this theory arises in Mimāmsā (with Sabara and Kumārila), then in Nyāya (with Udayana), in a doctrinal and theological context, as a byproduct of the debate over Vedic authority. The Navya-Vaiyākaranas enter this debate last (with Bhattoji Dïksita and Kaunda Bhatta), with the declared aim of refuting the arguments of the Mïmāmsakas and Naiyāyikas by bringing to light the shortcomings in their understanding of Pāninian grammar. The central argument has focused on the capacity of the initial contexts, with the network of issues to which the principal qualificand theory is connected, to render intelligible the presuppositions and aims behind the complex linguistic justification of the classical and late stages of this debate. Reading the debate in this light not only reveals the rationality and internal coherence of each position beyond the linguistic arguments, but makes it possible to understand why the thinkers of the three schools have continued to hold on to three mutually exclusive positions. They are defending not only their version of the principal qualificand theory, but (though not openly acknowledged) the entire network of arguments, linguistic and/or extra-linguistic, to which this theory is connected, as well as the presuppositions and aims underlying these arguments...|$|E
40|$|There is {{no effect}} of form which {{the effect of}} {{material}} could not enhance" George S. T In {{as much as the}} physical makeup (characteristics) of the human body control the movements of a anger,the question of the amount !availability of building materials is among the most powerful factors that determine the kind of form, that a built form should take. In education, it can be said, that this phenomenon has played a per- eminent role, in building activities, form the earliest time to the contemporary, modem times. It is most important, that a built form and a choice of materials should have a close relationship; as such an arrangement will facilitate the full realization of the expectation of a designer through the use of materials. Such success and standards will require the use of materials, in a way that helps to bring out its native, intrinsic and hitherto untapped possibilities. An important point to note, is that whilst the resources of early builders covered a limited selection of simple materials, the architects and builders of modern times, have been endowed with a virtual glut of resources various choices, combinations, innovations, synthesis, etc, {{that could be used for}} building activity. An equally important point to note, is that the remarkable expansion, in material resources is not a phenomenon, that has grown of its own accord, but is actually a positive response to a stupendous and a ceaseless increase in building activities housing,commercial, industrial, that has taken place, the would over ever since, the expansion of economic activities following on the industrial revolution in Europe in the 15 th century. Concurrently cognizance, has to be given to the supplementary factor, i. e. that the boon, in the production of new and innovative materials, has actually, served as a strong stimulus to the problems on the score of as weather the full rang of new materials! sophisticated material would really meet an actual builders consumer demand or not. Not withstanding the above, the principal point to note, is that the plethora of new material and technology, that has entered the market, over the years has proved a effective means of aiding new built forms and appurtenant spaces to be completed to comply with contemporary need an ideas. The advent of the new material, technology, such as the steel, concrete and more significantly. Prefabricated and pre stress concrete contribute to complete revolution in the building industrial with the completion of bigger, higher, stronger and more fascinating built forms, to meet both housing and commercial needs. They opened the way to dramatic changes in architectural disciplines, styles and the character of urban and city landscape. It is also important to state that this unprecedented growth, new trends and dimension in the use of materials and technology also made a sizeable contribution to the generation of the desired. Architectural expression and the ensuring of the user comfortable environment in the built forms that were completed in the contemporary world. That this synopsis on the topic of dissertation "an examination of significance of materials in creation of architecture expression" can not be considered as completed without a brief comment on three elements/ components meaning, materials and expression are inextricably and inseparably intertwined and it is not possible to attach, any real significance or position to them, special in the context of their relationship with the user and people, unless they exit and operate together in unison. However it is correct, at the same time to take note of the fact, that the <b>meaning</b> <b>element</b> is the key and leading one among the three. It may be likened to the source or spring of the built form out of which the other elements flow and form which they derived strength and vitality of course taking this view does not imply, that the other two elements are not significant and act as essential agents for strengthen the <b>meaning</b> <b>element,</b> making it more meaningful and conveying it is message to its user/ observe and vice versa. These factors collectively help to throw light and establish the magnitude and depth of the subject that have undertaken, for the purpose of this dissertation. None the less regard it as an exciting challenge to probe in to a field that is both complex and rich form which certain valuable impressions and conclusion could be drawn. In the circumstances, it is sincere hope that this dissertation, the diverse ideas and observations, set out in it, will be found acceptable, simulation and thought – provoking to the learned body of persons who will best on honor of reading appreciating and evaluating it...|$|E

Four types of sequences are identified: ‘basic’, ‘framed’, ‘dialogic’ and ‘concessive’.
