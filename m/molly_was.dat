5|$|Molly Holly's final WWE {{pay-per-view}} appearance {{occurred at}} Taboo Tuesday in 2004 as {{she appeared in}} the Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal {{along with many other}} WWE Divas. The fans voted online for the Divas to wear schoolgirl uniforms, as opposed to French maid or nurse outfits. In contrast to the other girls who wore sexy schoolgirl uniforms, Molly wore a demure 1980s-style schoolgirl uniform with large pink panties underneath. Molly failed to win the match when Stratus eliminated her by tossing her through the ropes for the win. Molly's efforts in subsequent attempts to regain the title failed. Due to several wrestlers from the company's women's division being released in late 2004 and the introduction of the Raw Diva Search program, <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> mostly left off television, only occasionally appearing on Sunday Night Heat and Raw in losing efforts to the likes of Lita, Victoria, Trish Stratus, and Christy Hemme.|$|E
5|$|When Davidson {{returned}} home {{he found that}} <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent {{that he was not}} the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory {{in the latter part of}} 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail to arrive at all.|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} adventures {{he was to}} fictionalise in 1903 as The Riddle of the Sands, his most famous book and a huge bestseller. In 1903 Childers, now {{accompanied}} by his new wife <b>Molly,</b> <b>was</b> again cruising in the Frisian Islands, in Sunbeam, a boat he shared with William le Fanu and other friends from his university days. Molly's father, Dr Hamilton Osgood, arranged for a fine 28-ton yacht, Asgard, to be built for the couple as a wedding gift and Sunbeam was only a temporary measure while Asgard was being fitted out.|$|E
50|$|The Gold panda <b>molly</b> <b>is</b> a <b>molly</b> {{found in}} the {{aquarium}} trade. The <b>molly</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to have been}} a hybrid of the Gold Dust Molly and possibly the Dalmatian molly. It most likely does not live in the wild. The sailfin <b>molly</b> (Poecilia latipinna) <b>is</b> included in the cross, and some breeders have considered the Latin name of the gold panda <b>molly</b> to <b>be</b> Poecilia latipinna.|$|R

25|$|On October 8, 1979, a {{few days}} after the primary, Voinovich's nine-year-old {{daughter}} <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> struck by a van and killed. The event brought the Voinovich campaign to a virtual halt and made it difficult for Kucinich to attack his opponent. Still, he challenged Voinovich to a series of debates to be held in various Cleveland neighborhoods. Voinovich declined the invitations, saying they would be unproductive, although they eventually did meet in a debate on November 3 at the City Club. Voinovich went on to win the election with 94,541 votes to Kucinich's 73,755.|$|E
25|$|Fibber McGee and <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> an American radio comedy series. A {{staple of}} the NBC Red Network for the show's entire run {{and one of the}} most popular and {{enduring}} radio series of its time, the prime time situation comedy ran as a standalone series from 1935 to 1956, then continued as a short-form series as part of the weekend Monitor from 1957 to 1959. The title characters were created and portrayed by Jim and Marian Jordan, a real-life husband and wife team that had been working in radio since the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|In 1759, Johnson began a common-law {{relationship}} with Molly Brant, a Mohawk woman who moved into Johnson Hall {{and lived with}} Johnson as his consort {{for the rest of}} his life. <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> the older sister of Joseph Brant; her younger brother joined the household when he was young. Johnson's {{relationship with}} Molly gave him additional influence with the Mohawk. The couple had eight children, all of whom received land from Johnson in his will. A grandson of William Johnson and Molly Brant was William Johnson Kerr who married Elizabeth Brant a daughter of Joseph Brant and granddaughter of George Croghan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Molly</b> Bloom <b>is</b> {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the novel Ulysses by James Joyce. The wife of main character Leopold Bloom, she roughly corresponds to Penelope in the Odyssey. The major difference between <b>Molly</b> and Penelope <b>is</b> that while Penelope <b>is</b> eternally faithful, <b>Molly</b> <b>is</b> not. <b>Molly</b> <b>is</b> {{having an affair with}} Hugh 'Blazes' Boylan. Molly, whose given name is Marion, was born in Gibraltar on 8 September 1870, the daughter of Major Tweedy, an Irish military officer, and Lunita Laredo, a Gibraltarian of Spanish descent. <b>Molly</b> and Leopold <b>were</b> married on 8 October 1888.

25|$|Radio {{historian}} Gerald S. Nachman {{has written}} that the Jordans anticipated renewing their contract with NBC for another three years when Marian's battle against ovarian cancer ended with her death in 1961. In the 1970s, Jim Jordan briefly returned to acting. An episode of NBC's Chico and the Man featured a surprise appearance by Jordan as a friendly neighborhood mechanic. Jordan also lent his voice to Disney's animated film, The Rescuers (1977) and reprised his role as Fibber McGee (complete with the closet gag) in an advertisement for AARP. He died in 1988—a year before Fibber McGee and <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 2016 {{the first}} part of a {{television}} series called 'Molly' aired on Australian television. It featured flashbacks of Molly's life and some actual footage of videos seen on Countdown. <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> played by Samuel Johnson. The unaired footage from his interview with Prince Charles showed Johnson as Molly but actual footage of Prince Charles himself. Part two of the miniseries aired on 14 February 2016. The final scene was a very moving salute to Molly as he returns to public life after a lengthy hospital stay. Actual footage of Molly himself receiving a standing ovation as he walks out {{with the aid of a}} walking stick ends the series.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} future {{version of}} an adult Molly Hayes appeared in the X-Men crossover event Battle of the Atom. Initially arriving {{under the guise of}} a team of future X-Men, Molly and her companions were later revealed to be members of a new Brotherhood of Mutants led by Raze - the shape shifting son of Wolverine and Mystique. Molly appears in the comic as a tall, muscular woman with an armored arm and is no longer be affected by the fatigue she formerly experienced after using her powers. Following the Brotherhood's defeat, Molly hid with her team.

25|$|Only {{young men}} of the order were chosen to commit murder; above them were older heads holding high office and, {{in a variety of}} ways, {{displaying}} executive ability. They were quick to see what a weapon to their hand was universal suffrage, and, with the aptitude for politics which the Irish have shown in our country, they developed their order into a political power to be reckoned with. Numbering in Schuylkill county only 500 or 600 out of 5,000 Irishmen in a total population of 116,000, the Molly Maguires controlled the common schools and the local government of the townships in the mining sections of the county. They elected at different times three county commissioners and came near electing one of their number, who had acquired twenty thousand dollars worth of property, Associate Judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. In one borough a <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> Chief of Police; another in Mahanoy township, Jack Kehoe, was High Constable.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} his {{convalescence}} Childers {{returned to}} Molly at the Chelsea flat, but a month later he received an invitation to meet the Sinn Féin leadership in Dublin. Anticipating an offer of a major rôle, Childers hurried to Dublin but, apart from Collins, he found the Irish leadership wary, or even hostile. Arthur Griffith, in particular, looked on him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. He was appointed to join the Irish delegation from the as-yet-unrecognised Irish State to the Paris Peace Conference. This unpromising undertaking, as Childers saw it, was intended to advance the cause of Irish self-rule by reminding official representatives at the conference of the ideals of freedom over which Britain had gone to war. In this they were unsuccessful, and Childers returned once again to London. He rented a house in Dublin, but <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> reluctant to join him: mindful of her sons' education, and believing {{that she and her husband}} could best serve the cause by influencing opinion in London. She gave up their London home of fifteen years to settle in Dublin, at the end of 1919.|$|E
500|$|Molly Brant {{was raised}} in a Mohawk culture that had become highly {{influenced}} by their English trading partners. [...] In Canajoharie, the Brants lived in a substantial colonial-style frame house and used many European household goods. The family attended the Church of England. <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> fluent in Mohawk and English. It is not clear whether she was formally educated or whether she could read and write. There are several letters signed [...] "Mary Brant", but these may have been dictated by Molly and written by someone else. A letter from 1782 is signed with [...] "her mark", indicating that she may have been only semi-literate.|$|E

500|$|Much of Brant's {{influence}} {{came from}} her connections to Sir William Johnson and her stepfather Brant Kanagaradunkwa. Additional influence came {{from the fact that}} women in Iroquois society had more political influence than did women in patriarchal societies. Under the Iroquois matrilineal kinship system, inheritance and social status were passed through the maternal line. Women elders influenced the selection of chiefs. [...] Because Brant's ancestry is unclear, historians have apparently disagreed about whether she was born into an influential clan. Brant has been described as the [...] "head of the Six Nations matrons", although historian Robert Allen writes that [...] "there is no substantive evidence to suggest that <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> ever a clan matron or mother within the Iroquois matrilineal society". Fiester and Pulis write that [...] "although not born to the position, she became one of the Mohawk matrons".|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{characters}} went through subsequent changes as well. In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie, a name which would eventually {{be given to the}} character's mother. Her parents were originally real estate agents, as opposed to famous actors. <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> one of the few Runaways to actually keep the name she had in Brian K. Vaughan's original proposal; she is named after Vaughan's younger sister, Molly Hayes Vaughan, and was supposed to be thirteen years old instead of eleven. However, in the original pitch for the series, Molly's parents were Hollywood actors; this would eventually become the cover story of Karolina's parents. Also, Molly's sibling-like relationship with Chase was originally supposed to be with Gert. Nico Minoru was called Rachel Messina. Her parents were still magicians, but posed as wealthy antique dealers; this cover story was ultimately used for Gert's parents. Nico's source of power was not originally going to be her mother's Staff, but Robert Minoru's spellbook. Chase was originally called John, and Gert was called Gertie. Originally, Gert was meant to give Molly the name [...] "Bruiser." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{his wife}} was ill, Jim Jordan had been closing his radio shows by saying [...] "Goodnight, Molly." [...] In early 1938, the Federal Communications Commission ordered him to stop, {{claiming}} it violated a rule about using public airwaves for personal communications. After a few weeks' deliberation, the Commission found that no regulations had been broken, because <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> the name of Marian Jordan's radio character. Jordan was then able to resume his [...] "Goodnight, Molly" [...] signoff. In January 1939, the show moved from NBC Chicago to the new NBC West Coast Radio City in Hollywood.|$|E
2500|$|WMAQ carried {{original}} {{local and}} network programming. Marian and Jim Jordan started at WLS in 1927 with The Smith Family. They came to WMAQ, doing a local show called Smackout and later would {{move on to}} form Fibber McGee and Molly, which was produced at WMAQ from 1935–1939, when the show moved to California. During its first months on the air, Fibber McGee and <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> distributed over NBC's Blue Network, which meant that in Chicago the program was produced at WMAQ but heard over WLS, one of three NBC Blue Network affiliates in Chicago at the time. Amos 'n' Andy was also a popular program that continued being broadcast from Chicago until 1938, when the program moved to Hollywood. [...] Both of these shows moved production to the new NBC West Coast Radio City.|$|E

She died in {{the wreck}} of the Gwynqeathe in 1676 and went to Heaven, where she was able to keep up on {{developments}} in the living world and became interested in modern technology. Roast Beef first met her in Heaven after Pat shot him. Molly now resides on Earth, living in Ray's pool shed with Roast Beef. Roast Beef's lack of social skills means their relationship is often strained, but Molly's extraordinary patience and tolerance (and Beef's willingness to go along with her sexual adventurousness) often win out. Molly may have been a programmer while in Heaven (presumably self-taught), but since she died long before computers and coding were invented she has no [...] "earthly" [...] qualifications as such. She has been working in the service industry since coming back to life; she has implied in her blog that she is unable to get better work because she does not have a social security card. She has held jobs at various bars and restaurants, including Applebee's, Taco Bell (from which she was fired), and The Smoke (a local bar in the Underground). For a time, Molly worked at an [...] "upscale tex-mex place" [...] called Butte, until a fire forced its closure. <b>Molly</b> <b>was</b> involved in [...] "sandwich porn" [...] for Vlad when she worked at his Subway restaurant, eating client-ordered sandwiches on a live webcam show, fully clothed and in a broom closet, though Beef demanded that she stop once he found out. Molly has now secured a job at Starbucks which she claims makes her [...] "the hub of Achewood's social universe." [...] She has been running the [...] "Achewood A-List" [...] off and on since December 2005 (officially named on December 19, 2005). On June 7, 2007, Roast Beef asked Molly to marry him.
