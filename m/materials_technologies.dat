25|$|From 1986 to 1994, roughly {{paralleling}} {{his time}} at UCLA, Conn co-founded a company called Plasma & <b>Materials</b> <b>Technologies,</b> Inc. (PMT), which developed a system known as MORI that was used for plasma etching and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), steps that {{are central to the}} fabrication of semiconductors. The company had an initial public offering, or IPO, on NASDAQ in 1995, and was later acquired. Over the years, Conn has served on the boards of several public companies involved in the semiconductor industry. From 2002 to 2008, after leaving the Jacobs School at UC San Diego, Conn became Managing Director of Enterprise Partners Venture Capital (EPVC), a venture capital firm that invested in both high technology and biotechnology companies.|$|E
25|$|Robert W. Conn (born December 1, 1942) is President and Chief Executive Officer of The Kavli Foundation, a U.S. based {{foundation}} {{dedicated to}} the advancement of basic science research and public interest in science. A physicist and engineer, Conn is also the current Board Chair of the Science Philanthropy Alliance, an organization that aims to increase private support for basic science research, and Dean Emeritus of the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego). In the 1970s and 1980s, Conn participated in some of the earliest studies of fusion energy as a potential source of electricity, and he served on numerous federal panels, committees, and boards advising the government on the subject. In the early 1970s, he co-founded the Fusion Technology Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW), and in the mid-1980s he led the formation of the Institute of Plasma and Fusion Research at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). As a university administrator in the 1990s and early 2000s, Conn served as Dean of the School of Engineering at UC San Diego as it established several engineering institutes and programs, including the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, known as Calit2, the Center for Wireless Communications, and the Whitaker Center for Biomedical Engineering. While at UC San Diego he also led the effort to establish an endowment for the School of Engineering, which began with major gifts from Irwin and Joan Jacobs. Irwin M. Jacobs is the co-founder and founding CEO of Qualcomm. While Conn was dean, the engineering school was renamed in 1998 the Irwin and Joan Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. Conn's experience in the private sector includes co-founding in 1986 Plasma & <b>Materials</b> <b>Technologies,</b> Inc. (PMT), and serving as Managing Director of Enterprise Partners Venture Capital (EPVC) from 2002 to 2008. Over the years he has served on numerous private and public company corporate boards. Conn joined The Kavli Foundation in 2009. He helped establish the Science Philanthropy Alliance in 2012.|$|E
