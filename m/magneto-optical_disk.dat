40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a far-field magneto-optical Kerr effect microscope. An inverted optical microscope was constructed to accommodate Kerr imaging and atomic force microscopy. In Kerr microscopy, magnetic structure is investigated by measuring the polarization rotation of light reflected from a sample {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field. Atomic force microscopy makes use of a probe which is scanned over a sample surface to map the topography. The design was created virtually in SolidWorks, a three-dimensional computer-aided drafting environment, to ensure compatibility and function of the various components, both commercial and custom-machined, required for the operation of this instrument. The various aspects of the microscope are controlled by custom circuitry and a field programmable gate array data acquisition card at the direction of the control code written in National Instrument LabVIEW. The microscope has proven effective for both Kerr and atomic force microscopy.

We also show that direct overwrite by means of interior nucleation is highly unlikely. Rather, we show that the recording process involves a dynamic balance between those pressures which act to move the domain wall and those which act to freeze it into place. Finally we analyze the Nikon bilayer direct overwrite scheme, and then demonstrate an alternative bilayer overwrite scheme which avoids a major problem with the Nikon scheme...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{high-performance}} paradigm for accessing removable media such as tapes and especially magneto-optical disks. In high-performance computing the striping of data across multiple devices {{is a common}} means of improving data transfer rates. Striping has been used very successfully for fixed magnetic disks improving overall system reliability as well as throughput. It has also been proposed as a solution for providing improved bandwidth for tape and magneto-optical subsystems. However, striping of removable media has shortcomings, particularly {{in the areas of}} latency to data and restricted system configurations, and is suitable primarily for very large I/Os. We propose that for fine-grained media, an alternative access method, media pipelining, may be used to provide high bandwidth for large requests while retaining the flexibility to support concurrent small requests and different system configurations. Its principal drawback is high buffering requirements in the host computer or file server. This paper discusses the possible organization of such a system including the hardware conditions under which it may be effective, and the flexibility of configuration. Its expected performance is discussed under varying workloads including large single I/O's and numerous smaller ones. Finally, a specific system incorporating a high-transfer-rate <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disk</b> drive and autochanger is discussed...|$|E

40|$|A new sub-bottom {{profiling}} system, the HI-DAPT II, was designed, {{assembled and}} field tested. The system is adaptable {{to a variety}} of marine acoustic sources thus suited to any aqueous environment. The system uses a digital signal processing (DSP) board with 2 channels of 16 bit analog-to-digital conversion, embedded in a PC chassis, to acquire and process sub-bottom data. Conventional post-stack processing algorithms such as frequency filtering, automatic gain control, swell filter, predictive deconvolution and spiking deconvolution have been coded to run on the DSP to enable processing of the data between successive shots. A two-channel hydrophone streamer consisting of a single hydrophone and a line array is used to collect sub-bottom data. Raw data are stored together with a time stamp and processing parameters on an <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disk.</b> Processed data are displayed on a CRT and output to a thermal plotter. The HI-DAPT II system was field tested over a portion of the West Florida Sand Sheet, 37 km south of Panama City Florida, as part of the Coastal Benthic Boundary Layer Special Research Project. The objective of the HI-DAPT-II survey was to delineate the vertical extent of the sand sheet in the area. Three, 5 km-long, seismic lines were acquired over the long axis of a grid as well as two tie lines. A series of tests was performed to determine the optimum processing parameters. Processed data, displayed in wiggle trace/variable area format, revealed two main reflecting horizons. The shallowest reflector is interpreted to represent an erosional cycle during the deposition of the sand sheet which occurred 10, 000 - 7, 500 ybp. The deepest, high-amplitude reflector exhibits erosional features. This reflector is interpreted to be the top of the Mio-Pliocene Intracoastal Formation.

Clock corrections are performed with respect to a signal delivered every minute from an outer clock. The data storage is performed on an <b>magneto-optical</b> (MO) <b>disk</b> of 640 M bytes linked to the PC. The acquisition programs are written in assembly language on MS-DOS. A special format is used for the acquisition as storing 3 data points on 2 bytes and this permits the acuisition of 30 channels at a rate of 20 samples / sec. One side of an MO disk can continuously store the data for 4 days. Within 4 days the MO disks reversed to the other side and it can store data again for 4 days. A MO disk thus typically contains one week data. Data recorded at a network on a MO disk are mailed to the Data Center of "J-array", a study group for "the Central Core of the Earth", located at the Research Center for Earthquake Prediction, Kyoto University.

40|$|AbstractSeveral Finnigan-MAT mass {{spectrometer}} data systems were networked together {{to achieve the}} following two primary objectives: (1) to allow access to mass spectrometry data and data processing functions from remote locations without affecting simultaneous data acquisition at the instruments, and (2) to electronically archive mass spectrometry data at a central location on a high-capacity, fast-access device that allows rapid retrieval of archived data for all data processing operations at all locations. UNIX workstations, IBM PC/AT-compatible computers, and Data General Nova minicomputers were connected via Ethernet interfaces to allow rapid data transfer among all systems as well as X-Windows access to UNIX-based systems. Bridging techniques were used to isolate possible high-traffic areas of the network and to enable security measures for adequate protection of files. Additionally, serial connections were made through a Northern Telecom phone system to provide remote terminal access to the Data General Nova-based systems. Use of these connectivity techniques significantly improved productivity by allowing retrieval, processing, and printing of data from remote locations, such as office areas, without affecting data acquisition, processing, and printing performed simultaneously at the instruments.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} concordance of expert cardiologists' interpretation of echocardiographic studies recorded on Super-VHS videotape or stored in <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disk,</b> as well as the feasibility and clinical value of intelligent compression and digital storage of echocardiographic data as cine-loops and still-frames for interpretation of transthoracic echocardiographic images in clinical practice. METHODS: All clinical cardiologists experienced in echocardiography in our department (n = 10) reported on a standardized worksheet checklist the echocardiographic data of 7 consecutive patients (140 reports), and recorded them on videotape or magneto-optical disks to compare the interpretation of videotaped studies, acquired in the usual way, with clinically compressed studies stored to magneto-optical disks using a standard (Italian Society of Echocardiography) image acquisition protocol. RESULTS: The time interval between analog and digital study readings was 50 +/- 15 days. Except for tricuspid valve regurgitation grading (k = 0. 28) and for left ventricular global hypokinesia (k = 0. 32), the intraobserver agreement in the interpretation of the 3290 cardiovascular morphological and functional findings found on analog and digitally stored images was good (k value ranging from 0. 66 to 1. 00). The wall motion score index was 1. 56 +/- 0. 53 when interpreting analog studies, and 1. 52 +/- 0. 54 on digital studies (p = 0. 35). Conversely, the interobserver variability of the wall motion score index (Gini index ranging from 0 to 0. 80) was significantly lower when interpreting studies stored digitally than when analog ones were examined (0. 48 +/- 0. 021 and 0. 52 +/- 0. 023 respectively, p = 0. 006). In comparison to videotape recordings, digital storage of echocardiographic studies significantly shortened the time to image access for study review (327 +/- 62 and 30 +/- 4 s, respectively, p < 0. 0001) and the reading time (600 +/- 300 and 540 +/- 300 s respectively, p = 0. 034), rendered study accessibility easier (difficult or good: 73 vs 43 % of observers, fast or optimal: 27 vs 57 % of observers respectively, p = 0. 0011) and improved the recorded image quality perception (poor: 25 vs 10 % of observers, sufficient or good: 75 vs 90 % of observers respectively, p = 0. 022), without loss of study completeness (insufficient: 18 vs 17 % of observers, adequate or complete: 82 vs 83 % of observers, respectively; p = NS). Finally, from September 1, 1999, digital storage has become routine practice for patients admitted to our Department. By December 31, 1999, 411 echo studies had been stored: 7 +/- 3 cine-loop/study, 32 +/- 18 frames/cine-loop, and 3 +/- 2 still-frames/study. The average amount of memory needed for storage was 18. 6 +/- 11. 9 MB/study. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical compression of echocardiographic studies seems to be an accurate summary of the complete examination recorded to videotape for the assessment of patients admitted in the coronary care unit. In addition, digitally stored studies allow a significant improvement in the interobserver reproducibility of wall motion score assessment...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this dissertation is to present a clear physical picture and useful insights of polarization effects in the diffraction of focused beams by grooved, multilayer-coated disks. The reading process of optical disk systems significantly relies on {{the reaction of the}} incident focused beam to the disk structure, may it be the groove profile or coating materials. The resulting complex-amplitude from diffraction is the main source for the readout signal. In the presence of the periodic pattern and the focused beam, however, different polarization states usually result in different complex-amplitudes. A good understanding of polarization effects in grooved multilayer disks is thus required for the optimum design of optical data storage systems. The pursuit of high-density recording inevitably drives the optical data storage industry to reduce the wavelength of light sources, decrease the track pitch of optical disks, and increase the numerical aperture of objective lenses. The track pitch {{and the size of the}} focused spot gradually approach the optical wavelength. Under these circumstances, the analysis of the interaction of focused beams with this type of high-frequency periodic disk using conventional scalar diffraction theory is no longer adequate. Only through vector diffraction study of polarization effects in the interaction of the focused beam with the periodic pattern can the characteristics of an optical disk system be fully understood and improved. Starting from the introduction of various polarization effects in optical disk systems and basic concepts of both scalar and vector diffraction theory, we then focus on the studies of diffraction patterns at the exit pupil of the objective lens and on the disk surface. Different behavior on the baseball pattern and in the effective groove depth is observed for the two polarization states. The use of the solid immersion lens to extensively increase the area density of optical disk systems prompts us to investigate the influence of evanescent-wave coupling on the near-field optical disk system. Finally, we study the feasibility of using a novel differential polarization microscope to reduce polarization effects and to increase the image contrast of magnetic domains on <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Concluding Remarks 5. 1. General Statement 	As {{described}} in Chapter 1, <b>magneto-optical</b> recording <b>disks</b> {{have been used}} in the audio (MiniDisc) and PC as removable disks with high data capacity. Recently, MO disks have been in the competition with the phase-change type of optical disks. Up to now, the materials used in MO disks have been and still are RE-TM amorphous alloy films although Co/Pt multilayer films have been developed and have reached the same level of recording performance as RE-TM materials. It is now waiting for a laser device with a shorter wavelength around 400 nm in order to realise an even higher storage capacity with using Co/Pt multilayer films. CoNi/Pt multilayers have shown an improved recording performance compared with Co/Pt multilayers, for instance, increasing the writing sensitivity and the number of write/erase cycles mainly because of their lower Curie temperatures. Based on this background, Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers were chosen to be studied in this work, not only with a view to their application but also for some basic research interests. The study was mostly concentrated on the structural and magnetic properties according to the available measuring and analysis methods, such as VSM, Kerr spectrometry, XRD and TEM. 5. 2. Preparation of the Multilayers 	The Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers were prepared by sputtering with using the Ar gas. Among the sputtering conditions and the parameters of the deposited films, the thickness of the individual layers in a multilayer is of prime importance because it very sensitively determines the magnetic properties of a multilayer. The methods as well as the effects to determine the layer thickness have been carefully investigated. It was found that XRD measurement, especially low-angle XRD measurement is an accurate method to measure the thickness of a single layer film and the bilayer thickness of a multilayer film. Furthermore, the different Ar sputtering pressure, the different substrate temperature and the different substrates have been applied to modify the magnetic properties of the deposited films. The annealing experiments were also carried out {{in order to determine the}} thermal stability of the multilayers and to study the changes in the structural and magnetic properties. 5. 3. Multilayer Structures 	Magnetic properties of sputtered Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers depend strongly on the film microstructure. The multilayer structures were analysed by using XRD, TEM as well as XPS and AES. 5. 3. 1. Effects of the Ar sputtering pressure 	In the sputtered multilayers, the interface roughness and microstructure are most influenced by the bombardment on the substrate by argon neutrals reflected from the target. At low Ar pressures the reflected neutrals bombard the substrate with a high energy, leading to a dense film which is under compressive stress. At high Ar pressures the reflected neutrals become thermalised before reaching the substrate, the films tend to tensile stress and have a microstructure containing a high density of microvoids. 	As shown in the cross-sectional TEM images, the multilayer deposited at a lower Ar pressure (1. 6 × 10 - 2 mbar) clearly showed that the individual layers are flat and continuous at the bottom of the film. As the film growing, the layers become bent and broken with the formation of columns because of the relaxation of the internal stress. The multilayer deposited at a higher Ar pressure (4. 0 × 10 - 2 mbar) showed the enhanced columnar structures because of the low energy bombardment. However, the most important feature is that the individual layers are still clearly distinguishable within the columns. This means there are still sharper interfaces within the columns which could contribute to the increased perpendicular anisotropy due to the possibly enhanced interfacial strain anisotropy. 	As shown in the plane-view TEM images, the Co(Ni) /Pt multilayer deposited at a lower Ar pressure (1. 6 × 10 - 2 mbar) showed the high dense grain structure without visible voids. However, the multilayer deposited at a higher Ar pressure (4. 0 × 10 - 2 mbar) showed big voids, which correlated with the enhanced columnar structures as shown in cross-section TEM images. Such big voids contributed to the large coercivity because they acted as hard nucleation centres to resistant the magnetic domain reversal. 5. 3. 2. Effects of annealing ¾Interdiffusion and alloying 	It was found that Pt diffused into the Si substrate and Si diffused up to the surface of the films in the annealed multilayers that were deposited on Si substrates. The atomic diffusion of Si through the grain boundaries could contribute to the enhanced coercivity in the annealed films due to the formation of a non-magnetic compound such as CoSix at the grain boundaries besides other non-magnetic compounds such as CoOx. The possible alloying at the interfaces by annealing could contribute to the enhancement in Kerr rotation. 5. 4. Magnetic Properties 5. 4. 1. Individual layer thickness dependence-Curie temperature dependence 	The magnetic properties of Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers are very sensitive to their individual layer thicknesses, not only the thickness of the Co(Ni) layers but also the Pt layer. One of the importance results is that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) depends on the individual layer thicknesses. The Co(Ni) layer thickness dependence of PMA is mainly attributed to the interface anisotropy while the Pt layer thickness dependence is related to the thickness dependence of the Curie temperature. The effect of the Curies temperature on the magnetic properties has been confirmed by the enhancement of magnetic properties when the samples were measured at low temperature. However, the thickness dependence of the Curie temperature is originally related to the layer structures with regard to the interdiffusion at the interfaces and the magnetic coupling between the Co or CoNi layers. 5. 4. 2. Dependence on the number of bilayers-Total thickness dependence 	In addition to the individual layer thickness dependence, the magnetic properties are also dependent on the number of bilayers and the total thicknesses of the film, especially the coercivity and the perpendicular anisotropy decreases with increasing the number of bilayers. This is attributed to the degradation of the interface sharpness and the relaxation of the internal stress which causes the reduction of the interface anisotropy and the volume anisotropy, respectively. However, the Kerr effect is not dependent on the number of bilayers when the total thickness is thicker than the Kerr information depth. 5. 4. 3. Effects of the Pt seedlayer 	The Pt seedlayer contributes to the important effects that increase the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the perpendicular coercivity of the multilayers because of the improvement of the fcc- texture. Furthermore, a Pt seedlayer (thicker than the Kerr information depth) is required for the measurement of the Kerr spectra in order to avoid any influence from the substrates. However, as for the application of a MO disk, the Pt seedlayer must be as thin as possible in order to allow the light to be transmitted through the seedlayer without a significant decrease in the light power on the multilayers. 5. 4. 4. Effects of the Ar sputtering pressure 	The different Ar sputtering pressures cause significant differences in the microstructures and the magnetic properties. With increasing Ar pressure, the coercivity and PMA increased. The increase in coercivity can be explained with regard to the enhanced columnar structures and the pronounced voids in the films which contributed to the domain wall pinning. The increase in PMA is related the increased interfacial magnetoelastic anisotropy because of the enhanced strain at the interfaces. The enhanced column structure could be also one of the origins for the increased PMA. The effect of the Ar pressure on the Kerr effect was not obvious in the thick multilayers but significantly obvious in the thin multilayers. Furthermore, when Ar pressure was too high, the magnetic properties were damaged because of the degradation in the multilayer structures. 5. 4. 5. Thermal stability-Effects of the annealing 	The Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers can be easily affected by the annealing temperature. This was also found during the Curie temperature measurements. This implies that the thermal stability of the Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers is not so suitable. The temperature for thermal stability is only about 250 °C which is lower than the applied thermal writing temperature, usually that is about 300 °C. That could be attributed to the fact that the studied films were very thin (10 - 80 nm). However, two remarkable results were found in the annealed CoNi/Pt multilayers. One is enhancement of coercivity in the annealed multilayers with thinner CoNi layers. Another one is enhancements of Kerr rotation in the annealed multilayers having thicker CoNi layers. 5. 4. 6. Enhancement of coercivity 	Increasing the coercivity in Co(Ni) /Pt multilayers is one of the demands for MO application. Two methods for doing that have been realised in this work. One is to deposit the multilayer at a relatively higher Ar pressure; another one is to anneal the multilayer at 300 °C. However, for the annealing, it is better to be carried out in a vacuum although annealing in air results in an even larger coercivity. Such enhancements are attributed to the rough and columnar structures associated with the segregation and voids at the grain boundaries. However, for the MO application, these two methods are not desirable because the resulting layer structures can cause medium noise during the MO reading. Therefore, other methods to increase coercivity are still required, for instance using a smooth underlayer, such as a SiNx underlayer, associated with sputtering etching. 5. 4. 7.
