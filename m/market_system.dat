5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the <b>market</b> <b>system.</b> As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E

50|$|Chaos Theory {{studies the}} {{behavior}} of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos Theory applied to marketing offers an alternative explanation for the complex, apparently disorderly patterns of behavior in <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> over time which are observed in phenomena such as sales, inventories, brand shares and prices. <b>Marketing</b> <b>systems</b> are identified as being nonlinear in nature because they fail to satisfy the superposition principle (outputs are not directly proportional to inputs). Even though the rules governing behavior in <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> are known, {{it is impossible to}} make accurate long-term predictions of system behavior due to the high sensitivity of initial conditions. This happens even though <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> are fully deterministic. Traditional explanations of marketing phenomena typically rely on assumed patterns of external shocks, random noise or inherently stochastic processes to account for the complex dynamics within <b>marketing</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} evolution of a <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> in a rapidly changing social matrix. It utilises seller-buyer dyads to consider how to position a <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> in terms of internal efficiency and external effectiveness, and the consequences of inter- or intra-system cooperation and competition in macro system performance. Drawing on the theory of <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> propositions are developed to investigate how {{the evolution of}} specialist <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> takes place in a changing environment. The propositions concern the way specialist <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> grow to satisfy distinctive demand patterns, balance cooperation and competition, meet the needs of vulnerable customers, and contribute to higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness. An empirical study is conducted of the contemporary pharmacy <b>marketing</b> <b>system</b> in Fuzhou, a Chinese city, tracing the historic evolution of Chinese pharmacy <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> and in particular, contemporary Fuzhou urban pharmacy <b>marketing</b> <b>systems.</b> Following pretests and interviews in 2009, 114 pharmacies drawn from various pharmacy categories in Fuzhou together with 1833 sampled customers from the sampled pharmacies. As <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> grow and evolve in response to changes in the social matrix, in the institutional, and knowledge environments, specialisation leads different sub-systems to identify niche markets and offer assortments efficiently and effectively. Customer satisfaction reflects the complex interplay of customer attributes, behaviours, assortments offered, store and manager attributes, and acts as a critical measure of system effectiveness. However, the study shows some customer segments with higher vulnerability experience declining satisfaction unless corrective action is taken. The strategies adopted by successful managers within sub-systems differ by sub-systems along the dimensions of competition / cooperation, customer orientation, internal /external emphasis, profit / social goals. Competition and cooperation within and between systems co-exist to influence efficiency and effectiveness outcomes. Correspondingly, marketing sub-systems differ in their internal efficiency and external effectiveness trade-offs. Furthermore, the efficiency-effectiveness mix adopted will determine an overall system&# 146;s efficiency-effectiveness frontier which is in turn responsive to the social matrix and environmental change processes. These results largely confirm the earlier propositions and cast light on the study of <b>marketing</b> <b>systems</b> theoretically, methodologically, and managerially...|$|R

25|$|The revised {{sequence}} concept {{applies only}} to the industrial system – that is, the manufacturing core {{of the economy in}} which each industry contains only a handful of very powerful corporations. It does not apply to the <b>market</b> <b>system</b> in the Galbraithian dual economy. In the <b>market</b> <b>system,</b> composed of the vast majority of business organizations, price competition remains the dominant form of social control. In the industrial system, however, composed of the 1,000 or so largest corporations, competitive price theory obscures the relation to the price system of these large and powerful corporations. In Galbraith's view, the principal function of market relations in this industrial system is, not to constrain the power of the corporate behemoths, but to serve as an instrument for the implementation of their power. Moreover, the power of these corporations extends into commercial culture and politics, allowing them to exercise considerable influence upon popular social attitudes and value judgments. That this power is exercised in the shortsighted interest of expanding commodity production and the status of the few is both inconsistent with democracy and a barrier to achieving the quality of life that the new industrial state with its affluence could provide.|$|E
