25|$|Howard Rheingold cites mobile {{communications}} technology {{as a key}} enabler: The bees sense each other's buzzing and instinctually move in concert in real time. Text messaging on mobile devices and instantaneous file sharing off the internet via PDAs allows groups of people to receive their instructions, <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> nearly instantaneously, without prior planning or forethought. And, the technology allows groups {{to do so without}} a central leader. One modern example is the protesters at the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle, in 1999, who were able to orchestrate their movement effectively in this way.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a {{featured}} {{performer in}} the Ringling Brothers production Bellobration, performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double {{version of the}} Wheel of Steel. At {{the beginning of the}} act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> running at up to 20 miles an hour. Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other was doing. At the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom.|$|E
500|$|In music, {{homophony}} ( [...] ; [...] ὁμόφωνος, homóphōnos, from ὁμός, homós, [...] "same" [...] and φωνή, phōnē, [...] "sound, tone") is a texture {{in which}} a primary part is supported {{by one or more}} additional strands that flesh out the harmony and often provide rhythmic contrast. This differentiation of roles contrasts with equal-voice polyphony (in which similar lines move with rhythmic and melodic independence to form an even texture) and monophony ({{in which a}}ll parts <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> or octaves). Historically, homophony and its differentiated roles for parts emerged in tandem with tonality, which gave distinct harmonic functions to the soprano, bass and inner voices.|$|E

500|$|Michelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, {{authors of}} Femme/Butch, commended the video for showing {{a shift in}} power between the sexes, declaring that [...] "Madonna assertively claimed all {{possible}} gender space like Marlene Dietrich." [...] Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, Experiencing Music Video that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards. In the book The 1980s, authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its [...] "exploitation" [...] of the male body and sexualizing them {{as an object of}} desire. The authors also added that the video [...] "was a colorful homage to the term gaze, but Madonna is the bearer of it—not men." [...] Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. [...] "She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> to her song", Stoddart concluded. Elizabeth Edwards, {{one of the authors of}} Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader, explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by [...] "watching herself". She concluded by saying, [...] "'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons—male and female—and a whole new level of irony." [...] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of On Fashion, deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video [...] "is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics." ...|$|E
60|$|JULIA Nay, you {{are wrong}} entirely. We were {{contracted}} before my father's death. That, and some consequent embarrassments, have delayed what I know to be my Faulkland's most ardent wish. He is too generous to trifle on such a point:--and for his character, you wrong him there, too. No, Lydia, he is too proud, too noble to be jealous; if he is captious, 'tis without dissembling; if fretful, without rudeness. Unused to the fopperies of love, he is negligent of the little duties expected from a lover--but being unhackneyed in the passion, his affection is ardent and sincere; and as it engrosses his whole soul, he expects every thought and emotion of his mistress to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> with his. Yet, though his pride calls for this full return, his humility makes him undervalue those qualities in him which would entitle him to it; and not feeling why he should be loved to the degree he wishes, he still suspects {{that he is not}} loved enough. This temper, I must own, has cost me many unhappy hours; but I have learned to think myself his debtor, for those imperfections which arise from the ardour of his attachment.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{designed}} by Edward Turner in 1928, the dry-sump Ariel Square Four {{was the only}} British motorcycle engine with four cylinders arranged to form a square. The front two cylinders powered one crankshaft while the rear two drove a second. Unlike contemporary British parallel twins, each crankshaft had a 180° configuration, the two crankshafts being linked by a helical gear so that diagonally opposed pistons <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> The engine had even ignition intervals, and {{was said to be}} smooth, with little vibration.|$|R

A bogie check spring, having a single spiral spring, was enclosed in a box secured to the curved plates. The arcs of the leading and trailing radial axle boxes were struck from a centre midway between the coupled wheels.|$|R

50|$|Designed as a {{team effort}} by Brough, 'Ike' Hatch, and Freddie Dixon, the engine has two {{horizontally}} opposed flat twins one above the other and geared together, thus rotating counter to each other forming an H engine. Connecting rods from opposed cylinders were of the fork and blade type and thus shared a common crank pin. All pistons <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> that is {{to the left or}} to the right at the same time. The pistons could thus be counterweighted 100% yielding a perfect balance. Primary, secondary and higher-order sources of vibration canceled each other, as did the gyroscopic effects from each crankshaft.|$|R

40|$|On May 26 and 27, 1994, several {{national}} newspapers {{reported the}} findings of W. Christie and P.

On May 27, dealers in Amgen, Cisco Systems, and Microsoft sharply increased their use of odd-eighth quotes, and mean inside and effective spreads fell nearly 50 percent. This pattern was repeated for Apple Computer the following trading day. Using individual dealer quotes for Apple and Microsoft, the authors find that virtually all dealers <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> to adopt odd-eighth quotes.

50|$|Individual Standardbreds tend {{to either}} trot or pace. Trotters' {{preferred}} racing gait is the trot, where the horses' legs move in diagonal pairs; when the right foreleg moves forward, {{so does the}} left hind leg, and vice versa. The pace is a two-beat lateral gait; pacers' forelegs <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> with the hind legs on the same side. However, the breed also is able to perform other horse gaits, including the canter, though this gait is penalized in harness racing.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} an {{unwieldy}} system {{known as the}} GL Mk. I radar. The Mk. I, like the Chain Home technology it was based on, used separate transmitter and receiver antennas {{that had to be}} <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> to track targets. The system did not provide an accurate bearing measurement, and had no provision for measuring elevation. It did, however, meet the requirement for 50 yard accuracy in range, a measure that was automatically fed into the analog computers that handled the ballistics calculations. Performance of the guns improved immediately; before the arrival of the Mk. I it was estimated that 41,000 shells had to be fired to achieve one destroyed aircraft, Mk. I and improved training reduced this to 18,500 by late 1940.|$|R

50|$|The macrocilia <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> They are angled {{towards the}} gullet and are stacked {{on top of}} each other like roof tiles. By this {{arrangement}} they effectively grip parts of the prey in synchronized waves like a conveyor belt, transporting it to the stomach, and the throat muscles promote this process. The three-toothed tip of the macrocilia is stiff enough for it to rip the outer wall of larger prey such as other ctenophores; at the same time, proteolytic enzymes penetrate into the resulting wounds, rapidly incapacitating the victim.|$|E
50|$|To give {{weight in}} {{figures such as}} an allemande, rollaway or swing, lean {{slightly}} away from your partner and maintain a distinct resistance in your arm, hand and fingers; don't squeeze, but don't let your arms go limp or fully extended, either. This helps {{you and your partner}} <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison.</b> It also allows such figures to be done faster and with extra flair, and may enhance the sense of dancing with the other person and not just near him or her. Weight can also be thought of as springiness or tension.|$|E
50|$|The {{arrangement}} {{gives the}} possibility of setting four routes, but because only one route can be traversed at a time, the four blades {{at each end of}} the crossing are often connected to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison,</b> so the crossing can be worked by just two levers or point motors. This gives the same functionality of two points placed end to end. These compact (albeit complex) switches usually are found only in locations where space is limited, such as station throats (i.e. approaches) where a few main lines spread out to reach any of numerous platform tracks.|$|E
40|$|Contaminants in an {{extended}} medium {{such as the}} wall of a building are mapped by locating neutron excitation source {{on one side of the}} wall and a gamma ray spectrometer, including a gamma ray detector on the opposite side of the wall facing the excitation source. The source and detector are <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> <b>in</b> discrete steps over opposing wall surfaces so as to determine the chemical composition of the elements in a hemispheric region of the wall adjacent the detector with the radius of the region being substantially that of the mean free path distance of gamma rays emitted from elements interacting with neutrons on the detector side of the wall. The source and detector are reversed for relatively thick walls for mapping the distribution of elements on the other side of the wall thickness. The output of the detector is fed to a multichannel pulse height analyzer where the intensity of the various gamma ray spectral lines are indicated relative to a dominant constituent element such as silicon. Resolution of anomalies such as the presence of voids and/or determining the bulk density of the medium is achieved by substituting a gamma ray source technique is also applied to metal alloys, such as iron alloys, in either the solid or molten state...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Apparent polar {{wander in}} the mean-lithosphere (= no-net-rotation = no-net-torque uniform drag) {{reference}} frame is compared with apparent polar wander in the hotspot reference frame {{over the past}} 100 Myr. Palaeo-magnetic poles and plate rotations previously used to determine an apparent polar wander path for the hotspot reference frame are here used to determine an apparent polar wander path in the mean-lithosphere reference frame. We find that the two paths are similar, especially for Late Cretaceous time, when a 10 "- 20 " shift of the pole occurred.

50|$|The basic {{spectrohelioscope}} is {{a complex}} machine that uses a spectroscope to scan {{the surface of the}} sun. The image from the objective lens is focused on a narrow slit revealing only a thin portion of the suns surface. The light is then passed through a prism or diffraction grating to spread the light into a spectrum. The spectrum is then focused on another slit that allows only a narrow part of the spectrum (the desired wavelength of light for viewing) to pass. The light is finally focused on an eyepiece so the surface of the Sun can be seen. The view, however, would be only a narrow strip of the Sun's surface. The slits are <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> <b>unison</b> to scan across the whole surface of the sun giving a full image. Independently nodding mirrors can be used instead of moving slits to produce the same scan: the first mirror selects a slice of the sun, the second selects the desired wavelength.|$|R
