Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the <b>management</b> <b>policy</b> is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E
5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of <b>Management,</b> <b>Policy,</b> and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E

In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, the BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountain herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range {{was said to have}} increased by 17 percent over the 1968 level, but there was strong disagreement over whether the population had actually increased.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Army {{management}} of Yellowstone {{was so successful}} that by 1891 they were also managing Sequoia, Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks in California and Mackinac National Park in Michigan. The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own management strategy. During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park <b>management</b> <b>policy.</b> Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to {{the passing of the}} Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators.|$|E
5|$|Workers in Cairns had {{restored}} {{power and}} water supplies {{within a few}} days of Joy's passage. After the initial flooding from Joy ended, there was additional rainfall in February1991 that caused flooding across the region. Residual flooding cost the coal industry about 60million due to loss of production and hindered exporting. While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding, a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families, after the town experienced food and water shortages. Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20January, when the airport and incoming roads were reopened. The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain <b>management</b> <b>policy</b> {{as a result of the}} effects from Joy. The floods helped fill the drainage basin of the Peter Faust Dam within a few weeks, speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years. Months after the storm, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding, and alleviation of drought conditions. The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms.|$|E

40|$|Full text : [URL] (Author's final draft, 0. 54 Mo) International audienceFishing {{capacity}} <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> {{have been}} traditionally implemented {{at national level}} with national targets for capacity reduction. More recently, capacity <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> have increasingly targeted specific fisheries. French fisheries spatially vary along the French coastline and are associated to specific regions. Capacity <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> however ignore the capital mobility associated with second-hand vessel trade between regions. This {{is not an issue}} for national policies but could limit the effectiveness of regional capacity <b>management</b> <b>policies.</b> A gravity model and a random-effect Poisson regression model are used to analyse the determinants and spatial extent of the second-hand market in France. This study is based on panel data from the French Atlantic Ocean between 1992 and 2009. The trade flows between trading partners is found to increase with their sizes and to be spatially concentrated. Despite the low trade flows between regions, a net impact analysis shows that fishing capacity is redistributed by the second-hand market to regions on the Channel and Aquitaine from central regions. National capacity <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> (constructions/destructions) have induced a net decrease in regional fleet capacity with varying magnitude across regions. Unless there is a change of policy instruments or their scale of implementation, the operation of the second-hand market decreases the effectiveness of regional capacity <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> in regions on the Channel and Aquitaine...|$|R

Further, a new safety parameter, called safety quantity, is introduced and compared to the classical safety stock parameter. A practical approach is proposed to compute this safety quantity...|$|R
