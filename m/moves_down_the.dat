The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconnection}} {{events are}} analogues to the magnetic substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere. The difference {{seems to be}} their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a plasmoid which <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> tail. Conversely, in Jupiter's magnetosphere the rotational energy is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a plasmoid separates from it.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the match}} {{and they had}} first chance of the match in the fourth minute, but the free-kick by midfielder Murphy was caught by United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Defender Henchoz was shown a yellow card in the 12th minute and United midfielder Giggs had the first shot of the match, which was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Twice {{in the next few}} minutes, Liverpool had chances from <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{right-hand}} side of the pitch. On both occasions, however, the pass into the penalty area was intercepted. United had a chance to score in the 20th minute. Keane passed to Scholes, who found Giggs on the left-hand side of the pitch. His cross into the penalty area found striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, but his shot went wide of the Liverpool goal.|$|E

The axis is typically identified according to the Positive Axis Point (PAP), which marks the axis before axis migration has begun.|$|E

25|$|The soils of the Pomerol {{region are}} very diverse {{with a mixture}} of gravel, sand and clay {{scattered}} across the plateau. Roughly speaking the vineyard soils to the north and east, closer to the border of Saint-Émilion tend to have more clay while the soils to the west and south become lighter and more gravelly. The plateau on which Pomerol sits is bordered by three rivers, the Barbanne to the north, the Isle to the west and Dordgogne and the city of Libourne to the south. As the terrain <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slopes of the plateau and towards these rivers the soils become more alluvial and sandy.|$|E
500|$|The video follows {{students}} at a dystopian-based correctional facility who rebel and take over the establishment, intertwined with shots of the band performing outside the prison in a cage, providing a [...] "soundtrack to the chaos." [...] Hoppus described their idea for the facility: [...] "It's kind {{of a combination of}} prep school and reform school, and it's very repressed and kids are being held down. There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regiment, and the kids lash out and take over the school and destroy the place." [...] The band's main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle's input—which [...] "ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hallways"—was regarded by the band as [...] "completely wacked out and twisted, which is exactly what we love." ...|$|E

500|$|Peléan eruptions (or nuée ardente) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named after the volcano Mount Pelée in Martinique, {{the site of a}} massive Peléan eruption in 1902 {{that is one of the}} worst natural disasters in history. In Peléan eruptions, a large amount of gas, dust, ash, and lava fragments are blown out the volcano's central crater, driven by the collapse of rhyolite, dacite, and andesite lava dome collapses that often create large eruptive columns. An early sign of a coming eruption is the growth of a so-called Peléan or lava spine, a bulge in the volcano's summit preempting its total collapse. The material collapses upon itself, forming a fast-moving pyroclastic flow (known as a block-and-ash flow) that <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> side of the mountain at tremendous speeds, often over [...] per hour. These massive landslides make Peléan eruptions one of the most dangerous in the world, capable of tearing through populated areas and causing massive loss of life. The 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée caused tremendous destruction, killing more than 30,000 people and completely destroying the town of St. Pierre, the worst volcanic event in the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Debris slides {{generally}} {{start with}} big rocks that {{start at the}} top of the slide and begin to break apart as they slide towards the bottom. This is much slower than a debris avalanche. Debris avalanches are very fast and the entire mass seems to liquefy as it slides down the slope. This is caused by a combination of saturated material, and steep slopes. As the debris <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope it generally follows stream channels leaving a v-shaped scar as it <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill. This differs from the more U-shaped scar of a [...] slump. Debris avalanches can also travel well past the foot of the slope due to their tremendous speed.|$|E

2500|$|Spinners use a {{style of}} release known {{variously}} as spinning, helicopter, or UFO. Regardless of what it's known as, a spinner releases a ball such that it is rotating along a horizontal axis (the x-axis) in a counter clockwise motion (right-hander) as it <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lane. Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the pin rack, and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown {{in one of the}} three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane. A hook needs friction, in order to allow the ball to [...] "grab" [...] the lane. In spinning, very little of the ball's surface touches the lane, which is what the spinner intends. Spinning does not require friction of any kind.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objective}} in spinning is to depend more on pin deflection (pins hitting other pins) than [...] "carry" [...] (the ball knocking down the pins.) For a right-handed bowler, the ball proceeds down the lane, usually using a left-to-right line, and strikes {{the right side}} of the 1-pin. At this point, the ball will proceed to move down the front row of pins in the direction opposite its spin - the 1-3-6-10 pins. This type of a hit is referred to as [...] "riding the rail" [...] among spinners. A properly thrown spinner will hit the pocket in a way as if the ball was spinning away from the 1-pin. Conventional bowlers who watch this type of spin will actually think the bowler threw a backup ball. As the ball <b>moves</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> row, it creates a domino effect. The 1-pin hits the 2-4-7, the 3-pin hits the 5-8 the 6-pin hits the 9, and the ball eventually hits the 10-pin alone. Even when the ball hits Brooklyn, the reversal of direction allows even more ball and pin deflection (known as [...] "mixing"), allowing a higher chance of messenger strikes.|$|E
