5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady <b>meter</b> <b>and</b> the use of the refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{head-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus's helmet and {{features}} a radar, map, missile ammunition <b>meter</b> <b>and</b> health meter. Several visors are available, and each performs a different function. One, also seen in the previous game, is a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses, interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators and retrieves text entries from certain sources. The others reveal and highlight interdimensional objects or cloaked enemies, and create a visual representation of sound.|$|E
5|$|Alliteration is the {{repetition}} of letters or letter-sounds {{at the beginning of}} two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave <b>meter</b> <b>and</b> alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E

5|$|In Hymns of Divine Love (also called Hymns of Divine Eros) most {{of which}} were {{completed}} during his time in exile, Symeon describes his vision of God as uncreated divine light.

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 <b>meter</b> <b>and</b> 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance.

Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{corpus of}} Kilmer's work was {{produced}} between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry {{fell out of}} favor and Modernism took root—especially with {{the influence of the}} Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen especially in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Kilmer's verse is conservative and traditional, and does not break the formal rules of poetics—he can be considered as one of the last poets of the Romantic era. His style has been criticized for not breaking free of traditional modes of rhyme, <b>meter,</b> <b>and</b> theme, and for being too sentimental to be taken seriously.|$|E
