40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented {{of the ability}} of fine meshes to remove fog drops from an air flow. Specifically, the collection effi-ciency (CE) was measured for fog drops passing through <b>mesh</b> <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Meshes</b> composed of cotton, nylon, and Teflon were inves-tigated, {{and the effect of}} the material as well as mesh porosity was determined. Collection efficiencies ranging from 5 % to 50 % were obtained. The ultimate goal of this work is to employ such meshes in a parachute configuration above power plant cooling towers, so that condensed fog may be collected and returned to the cooling loop. It is shown that the drop diameters and velocities investigated here are similar to those observed above cooling towers. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4031969]...|$|R

A more appropriate definition for geographers would be, a set of geographic elements interconnected into a system by a number of relationships (Kansky, 1963). Network analysis is an examination of a complete network, its elements and their relationships. Networks can be represented in two major ways. The first is graphically, as a map. However, although such a representation can summarize many network characteristics, it often proves too inflexible to permit further analysis. For this reason the second form of network representation is often resorted to. This involves representing the network as a matrix in which the rows and columns represent individual elements, and the entries in the body of teh matrix represent the relationships between the elements...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in the use of fabrics as reinforcements for cement composites. This paper compares the effects of two different processing methods of casting vs. pultrusion on the mechanical properties, fabric-matrix bond, and microstructural characteristics of fabric-cement composites. Bonded glass <b>mesh</b> <b>fabrics,</b> woven polyvinylalcohol (PVA), as well as warp knitted weft insertion polypropylene (PP) fabrics were used in this study. Tensile tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. Pullout tests were carried out to examine the bond between the fabric and the cement matrix. A microstructural analysis was conducted and correlated with the mechanical performance of the composite and bonding. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly indicated in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (not impregnated in epoxy) having open junction points (not glued). This improved mechanical performance was explained due to improve bonding, obtained by the impregnation process of the fabric in the cement chamber during the pultrusion process, which helped fill the spaces between the filaments of the bundled yarns. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — By using self-assembling {{fabrication}} techniques at the cellular, molecular, or atomic scale, it is nowadays {{possible to}} create functional assemblies in a mainly bottom-up way that involve massive numbers of interconnected components. However, such assemblies are often highly irregular, unreliable, and heterogeneous. A grand challenge for future and emerging electronics is thus to reliably and efficiently compute and communicate in such systems. The {{goal of this}} paper is to illustrate why non-traditional network-on-chip paradigms are promising for massive scale systems and what the limits are. We have previously shown that certain irregular 3 D assemblies and interconnects have major advantages over regular 2 D and 3 D <b>mesh</b> <b>fabrics</b> in terms of latency, throughput, scalability, and the robustness against simple link failures. We present these results from a complex network perspective and look into the scaling properties of different interconnect topologies and routing algorithms in an abstract framework. We argue that only small-world topologies will scale up to massive scale systems. The long term goal in using irregular, fabrication-friendly, and non-traditional interconnects is to eventually be able to cheaply and easily assemble massive scale computing devices that are able to solve specific largescale problems competitively with traditional top-down fabricated silicon technology.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in recent years in}} the use of fabrics as reinforcements for cement composites. The present paper addresses the influence of the production processes, casting and pultrusion of fabric-cement composites, on the mechanical properties of the composites, fabric-matrix bond and microstructural characteristics. Bonded glass <b>mesh</b> <b>fabrics,</b> woven polyethylene fabrics and warp knitted weft insertion polypropylene fabrics were studied. Tensile, flexural and fabric-matrix bond tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. SEM observations were carried out to correlate microstructural characteristics with mechanical performance. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly identified in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (not impregnated in epoxy) having open junction points. This improved mechanical performance could be accounted for by the improved bonding, which was induced by the impregnation of the spaces between the filaments in the pultrusion process, and the lack of such effective impregnation is the casting process. However, in the epoxy impregnated fabric and the mono-filament fabric sufficient interfacial bonding could be obtained in the casting process and pultrusion did not yield a significant advantage...|$|R

2500|$|Technological {{developments}} such as crude ceramics {{were developed}} by Archaic societies early during the late Holocene. A total of 792 shards of pottery were found at Indian Knoll. All of which were shell or grit tempered, [...] mainly found within the first {{foot and a half}} of the mound, and closely relate to the later Mississippian culture's pottery. Most vessels had wide mouths and curved or flat bases, which were handmade by building up coils of clay. Pottery contributed to the exploitation and manipulation of wild plants, and more efficiency in food processing and water storage. The most common type of ceramics were shell tempered, representing 78.5% of the total pottery shards found at Indian Knoll, with only 171 grit tempered shards of bowls or jars discovered. Heavy grit tempered pottery appeared in different regions of the Eastern Woodlands, including Ohio Valley, between 2000-500 BC. The grit tempered ceramics that were found show plain and cord marked ware, as well as simple stamped grooved patterns. Several different finishes on shell tempered ceramics were also noted. [...] Nine shards found in one were also cord marked, or tapped with a twisted fibers wrapped [...] paddle, and three shards show signs of roughening, which were individually created by a rectangular object. Other shards show signs of net impressions caused by [...] <b>mesh</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which is common in much of western Kentucky.|$|R
