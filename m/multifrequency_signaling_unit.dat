Analytical formulas to estimate the parameters of a <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signal</b> by IpDFT method with H-term maximum sidelobe decay window (H ≥ 2) are derived. The analytical formula for amplitude estimate is more explicit and simple to implement than the one presented in the scientific literature. Also, an original demonstration of the formula used for {{the determination of the}} fractional part of the recorded cycles by IpDFT method is presented. Furthermore, simulations are used to compare the results obtained by means of the analytical formulas with the ones using the polynomial approximations employed in the IpDFT method with the maximum sidelobe decay windows...|$|R

The frequency bands in use are those of ISM (2. 4 - 2. 48 GHz) and part of the UWB (4. 25 - 4. 75 GHz).

50|$|This {{was also}} an in-band system but, instead of using <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signals</b> for digits, it used four 35 ms pulses of tone, {{separated}} by 35 ms of silence, to represent digits in four-bit binary code, with 2400 Hz as a '0' and 2040 Hz as a '1'. The supervisory signals used the same two frequencies, but each supervisory signal started with both tones together (for 150 ms) followed, without a gap, by a long (350 ms) or short (100 ms) period of a single tone of 2400 Hz or 2040 Hz.
