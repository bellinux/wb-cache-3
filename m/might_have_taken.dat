5|$|According to biographer Vijay Singh, it was {{unheard of}} for Cariappa {{to use his}} power and status for {{personal}} purposes. One example Singh cites occurred when Cariappa went to the Rajput Regimental Centre to pay farewell before he retired. He brought his son and daughter with him, {{and both of them}} stayed at the commandant's house till the next day. According to the rules, children were forbidden to attend the officers' mess. As chief Cariappa <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> them to the mess but he did not.|$|E
5|$|By 1445 Richard {{had become}} a knight, {{probably}} at Margaret of Anjou's coronation on 22April that year. He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449, which makes mention of his services in a grant. He performed military service in the north with his father, and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> part {{in the war against}} Scotland in 1448–1449. When Richard, Duke of York, unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452, both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. Storm runoff that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E

5|$|Robert {{returned}} to Normandy, expecting {{to have been}} given both the Duchy and England, to find that William Rufus had crossed the Channel and been crowned king, as William II. The two brothers disagreed fundamentally over the inheritance, and Robert soon began to plan an invasion of England to seize the kingdom, helped by a rebellion {{by some of the}} leading nobles against William Rufus. Henry remained in Normandy and took up a role within Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling to openly side with William Rufus, or because Robert <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if he had tried to leave. William Rufus sequestered Henry's new estates in England, leaving Henry landless.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of salicylic acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical salicylic acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that they refer to the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E

25|$|From {{this point}} until their baptisms, catechumens are {{dismissed}} after the liturgy {{of the word}} when they attend Mass at the parish at which they had the Rite of Acceptance.

25|$|Touch on / touch off {{has both}} {{benefits}} and costs. On {{the one hand}} it allows fares to be automatically calculated, always giving the passenger the cheapest fare option and special off-peak fares to encourage travel during quiet times could be implemented, which is impossible with Metcard.

25|$|He was {{a lifelong}} {{supporter}} of the Liberal Party, lining up on the Irish Home Rule and non-imperialist sides of the splits in {{the party of the}} late nineteenth century. He supported temperance, and married into a prominent Liberal, aristocratic and temperance family, the Carlisles. He made a number of moves that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> him into parliamentary politics, initially by tentative thoughts about standing in elections during the 1890s. In 1901-2 he was in close contact with the Independent Labour Party. But the overall effect of the Second Boer War was to drive him back into the academic career he had put on hold in 1898, resigning his Glasgow chair (effective from April 1899).|$|E
25|$|Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, often {{shortened}} to Mt. Healthy v.

The Court considered three issues: whether federal-question jurisdiction {{existed in the}} case, whether the Eleventh Amendment barred federal lawsuits against school districts, and whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments prevented the district, as a government agency, from firing or otherwise disciplining an employee for constitutionally protected speech on {{a matter of public}} concern where the same action <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place for other, unprotected activities. Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later Islamic and Byzantine periods, {{it is clear}} that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from Bet She'arim illustrates. These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around {{a relatively small number of}} workshops, where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks. There is only limited {{evidence for}} local glass making, and only in context of window glass. The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but Pliny's Natural History (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD, indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.|$|E
