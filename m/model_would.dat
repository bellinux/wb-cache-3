5|$|In 2017, {{part of the}} {{mezzanine}} {{was closed}} off so the MTA could build a mockup of the proposed R211 subway car. When completed, the <b>model</b> <b>would</b> be publicly accessible so riders could review it. The mockup contains features such as an open-gangway design proposed for this order; digital screens showing next stops and their station layouts; and a blue-and-gold-stripe paint design on its exterior.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). They were {{originally}} intended as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory <b>model</b> <b>would</b> incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the <b>model</b> <b>would</b> be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E
50|$|Another {{challenge}} is identifying the <b>models</b> that <b>would</b> best fit {{the data and}} the complexities of these <b>models.</b> These <b>models</b> <b>would</b> help us predict how societies might evolve over time and provide possible explanations on how things work.|$|R

5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there had been some delay in the {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a <b>model,</b> <b>would</b> follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and omission of important features. However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the level of difficulty and realistic driving <b>model</b> <b>would</b> appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile game port. The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone <b>model</b> <b>would</b> remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.|$|E

50|$|Robert Bigelow {{reviewed}} Cities of Mystery for Dragon magazine #152 (December 1989). Bigelow {{gave the}} product a generally positive review, {{saying that the}} <b>models</b> <b>would</b> be a boon for players who use miniatures. He felt that the package should've included a greater diversity of building styles, and that the assembly instructions were unclear. Bigelow praised the included booklet as an introduction to city-based adventures, and noted that the <b>models</b> <b>would</b> combine well with other companies' products.|$|R
50|$|The Wessex {{was first}} used by the Royal Navy, which {{introduced}} the Wessex HAS.1 to operational service in 1961. Having been satisfied by the favourable initial performance of the Wessex but seeking to improve its avionics and equipment, the Navy soon pressed {{for the development of}} the improved HAS.3, which came into service in 1967. Operationally, younger <b>models</b> <b>would</b> be assigned to perform the key anti-submarine warfare and commando transport missions, while older and less capable <b>models</b> <b>would</b> be typically be assigned to land bases for search and rescue (SAR).|$|R
5|$|The {{light rail}} <b>model</b> <b>would</b> {{have used the}} same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E
5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic <b>model</b> <b>would</b> be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

25|$|The psychosomatic/psychological <b>model</b> <b>would</b> {{also explain}} the similar {{increase}} in cancer deaths around holidays such as Christmas, and {{is supported by}} the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a Passover effect among the Jewish community (which moves with the festival itself), and a Mid-Autumn Festival effect among the Chinese.|$|E
