5|$|A {{few other}} (but not all) species of <b>maple</b> (Acer) are also {{sometimes}} used {{as sources of}} sap for producing <b>maple</b> syrup, including the box elder or Manitoba <b>maple</b> (Acer negundo), the silver <b>maple</b> (A. saccharinum), and the bigleaf <b>maple</b> (A. macrophyllum). Similar syrups may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.|$|E
5|$|As long as <b>maple</b> syrup {{does not}} have an {{off-flavour}} and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade <b>maple</b> syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If <b>maple</b> syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade <b>maple</b> syrup (including a fairly characteristic <b>maple</b> taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} <b>maple</b> syrup and <b>maple</b> sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, <b>maple</b> tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how <b>maple</b> syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves <b>maple</b> sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of <b>maple</b> syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a <b>Maple</b> Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with <b>maple</b> sugar or syrup.|$|E
40|$|Phyllosticta {{leaf spot}} is infesting <b>maples</b> (Acer spp.) in Washoe County, {{specifically}} Amur <b>maples</b> (Figure 1). It may exist elsewhere in Nevada where <b>maples</b> grow.

5|$|<b>Maple</b> {{syrup and}} <b>maple</b> sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with <b>maple</b> syrup and <b>maple</b> sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E
5|$|<b>Maple</b> syrup {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for <b>maple</b> syrup's distinctive flavour, however its primary flavour contributing compounds are <b>maple</b> furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.|$|E

50|$|The {{scientific}} and common names {{refer to the}} superficial similarity of the leaves to those of some <b>maples</b> (Acer); the plant is occasionally mistaken for young <b>maples,</b> but is readily distinguished by the flowers and fruit; the viburnum produces small, purple berries, while <b>maples</b> produce dry, winged seeds.|$|R
5|$|<b>Maple</b> syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar <b>maple,</b> red <b>maple,</b> or black <b>maple</b> trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other <b>maple</b> species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. <b>Maple</b> trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the core}} collections. One site {{contains}} Red <b>Maple</b> (Acer rubrum), Sugar <b>Maple</b> (Acer saccharum), Silver <b>Maple</b> (Acer saccharinum), and Striped <b>Maple</b> (Acer pensylvanicum). Another contains an overstory of Acer x freemanii with an understory of shade-loving maples, including snakebark maples (Acer davidii and Acer tegmentosum) and small trees similar to the Japanese <b>maple,</b> such as Acer shirasawanum and Acer pseudosieboldianum. A third site consists primarily of small Asian Maples.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} species and sub-species that {{comprise}} North American sugar <b>maples</b> has remained in dispute since their first characterization over 100 years ago. The taxonomic distinctiveness of Acer nigrum (black <b>maples)</b> and A saccharum (sugar <b>maples)</b> has been particularly controversial. An analysis of the nucleotide sequences from a non-coding region of the chloroplast genome of Ohio black and sugar <b>maples</b> suggests that these trees are genetically very similar and do not require separate taxonomic designations...|$|R
5|$|Red <b>maple</b> is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of <b>maple</b> syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar <b>maple)</b> and Acer nigrum (black <b>maple)</b> are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar <b>maple</b> with those of the red <b>maple,</b> {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver <b>maple),</b> Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway <b>maple),</b> and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red <b>maple</b> and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar <b>maple,</b> and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red <b>maple</b> can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|The Conn Smythe Trophy was {{introduced}} in 1964 by <b>Maple</b> Leaf Gardens Limited to honor Conn Smythe, the former owner, General Manager, and coach of the Toronto <b>Maple</b> Leafs {{and a member of}} the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder. The centerpiece of the trophy is a stylized silver replica of <b>Maple</b> Leaf Gardens, the arena built under Smythe's ownership of the <b>Maple</b> Leafs, and their home from 1931 to 1999. Backing the arena replica is a large silver botanically-accurate <b>maple</b> leaf. The arena replica and leaf are set atop a square wooden foundation, the front of which bears a dedication plaque. Additional tiers below the foundation, sloping outward, contain <b>maple</b> leaf-shaped plates bearing the inscriptions of the winners' names.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredient}} in <b>maple</b> syrup is the sap from the xylem of sugar <b>maple</b> or various {{other species of}} <b>maple</b> trees.

5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International <b>Maple</b> Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many <b>maple</b> syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} <b>maple</b> syrup to be uniform.
