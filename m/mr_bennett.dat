25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1914, {{at the start of}} World War I, Grand Duke Michael {{requested}} permission to return to Russia to rejoin the army, which was fighting on the Eastern Front. Nicholas II granted his request and George and his family returned to live in a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya, Gatchina, that Michael had bought for Natalia. (Natalia was not permitted to live at any of the imperial palaces.) George's English nanny, Miss Rata, accompanied them to Russia, after marrying Michael's head groom, <b>Mr</b> <b>Bennett.</b> Michael became a general and earned a Cross of St. George, the highest military award, for action in the Carpathian mountains.|$|E

Koenigsberger comments: [...] "The joke in this opening scene involves a confusion of high and popular artistic production: Marge treats the Springfield Pops as 'culture' and expects that the usually boorish Homer {{will need to be}} drawn into the spectacle." [...] However, Koenigsberger notes that Homer actually regards Star Wars as a [...] "classic", implying that a [...] "classic" [...] work must have a musical composer that is deceased, and be devoid of light-shows or glitter balls.

500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as suchâ€“ and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bennett</b> frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hacker {{in general}} finds many {{received}} components of current philosophy {{of mind to}} be incoherent. [...] He rejects mind-brain identity theories, as well as functionalism, eliminativism {{and other forms of}} reductionism. [...] He advocates methodological pluralism, denying that standard explanations of human conduct are causal, and insisting on the irreducibility of explanation in terms of reasons and goals. [...] He denies that psychological attributes can be intelligibly ascribed to the brain, insisting that they are ascribable only to the human being as a whole. [...] He has endeavoured to show that the puzzles and 'mysteries' of consciousness dissolve under careful analysis of the various forms of intransitive and transitive consciousness, and that so-called qualia are no more than a philosopher's fiction. [...] Together with <b>M.R.</b> <b>Bennett,</b> Hacker has stated that the eliminative materialist inevitably [...] "saws off the branch on which he is seated." [...] In the name of reason, truth, and science, he destroys all reason, truth, and science.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unofficial}} {{band was}} first organized in 1935. In 1955, Plano hired University of Arkansas graduate Emmitt Clem, {{who led the}} band for twenty-one years and wrote the school song. The band quickly became widely acclaimed under his direction. The band performed pre-game for the first Dallas Cowboys season and at a nationally televised Cowboys game at the Cotton Bowl in 1962. In June 1976 the Plano band, led by Clem traveled to Washington DC and played {{on the steps of}} the US Capitol during national bicentennial events. [...] In the fall 1976 Mr Clem was moved down to Wilson Middle School and Tom Bennett was brought in as band director for two years ending in the 1978; <b>Mr</b> <b>Bennett</b> led the band to perform in the 1977 State championship football game at Texas Stadium where Plano beat Port Neches Groves 13-10. [...] He was followed by Charles Forque as band director. Forque brought close friend Doc Severinsen, band leader of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, to the high school every year to play with the band. The band has performed in Carnegie Hall and at The Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic. The Plano band is currently under the direction of Jason Lewis, assisted by Michael A. Hernandez and Mark De Hertogh. In 2007, The Plano Wind Ensemble was named a 5A National Wind Honor Band, ranking them fifth in the nation. The Jazz Band at Plano, directed by Jeremy Kondrat, was chosen to attend the Essentially Ellington Competition in New York City in both 2005 and 2010.|$|E
