5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first <b>method</b> <b>is</b> most important for applications, as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second <b>method</b> <b>is</b> that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the current}} time, the most-adopted <b>method</b> <b>is</b> an {{automated}} synthesis on a solid support (e.g., polystyrene beads), using protecting groups (e.g., Fmoc and t-Boc) and activating groups (e.g., DCC and DIC).|$|E
5|$|Thermal {{power plants}} which use oil shale as a fuel mostly employ {{two types of}} {{combustion}} methods. The traditional <b>method</b> <b>is</b> Pulverized combustion (PC) which {{is used in the}} older units of oil shale-fired power plants in Estonia, while the more advanced <b>method</b> <b>is</b> Fluidized bed combustion (FBC), which is used in the Holcim cement factory in Dotternhausen, Germany, and was used in the Mishor Rotem power plant in Israel. The main FBC technologies are Bubbling fluidized bed combustion (BFBC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC).|$|E

50|$|All these {{collocation}} <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> in fact implicit Runge-Kutta methods. The coefficient ck in the Butcher tableau of a Runge-Kutta <b>method</b> <b>are</b> the collocation points. However, not all implicit Runge-Kutta <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> collocation <b>methods.</b>|$|R

25|$|Other methods, {{such as the}} {{midpoint}} method also illustrated in the figures, behave more favourably: the error of {{the midpoint}} <b>method</b> <b>is</b> roughly proportional to {{the square of the}} step size. For this reason, the Euler <b>method</b> <b>is</b> said to be a first-order method, while the midpoint <b>method</b> <b>is</b> second order.|$|E
25|$|This <b>method</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} Clairette de Die AOC where the <b>method</b> <b>is</b> officially {{designated}} as the original dioise process.

25|$|Both {{of these}} {{processes}} are effective for a limited duration; the jetting <b>method</b> <b>is</b> ineffective {{as soon as the}} next leaf falls; the sand deposition <b>method</b> <b>is</b> more durable, although rainfall usually removes the deposited sand quickly. Another <b>method</b> <b>is</b> using a high voltage electrical spark or plasma to volatilize the deposited material, but this method has only been used experimentally, as it is hindered by high power consumption, noise and rail degradation.|$|E

25|$|A third <b>method</b> <b>is</b> by {{palladium}} catalysed {{reaction of}} aryl halides and triflates with diboronyl esters in a coupling reaction. An alternative to esters in this <b>method</b> <b>is</b> {{the use of}} diboronic acid or tetrahydroxydiboron (2).|$|E
25|$|The uniform {{distribution}} {{is useful for}} sampling from arbitrary distributions. A general <b>method</b> <b>is</b> the inverse transform sampling method, which uses the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the target random variable. This <b>method</b> <b>is</b> very useful in theoretical work. Since simulations using this method require inverting the CDF of the target variable, alternative methods have been devised for the cases where the cdf is not known in closed form. One such <b>method</b> <b>is</b> rejection sampling.|$|E
25|$|This <b>method</b> <b>is</b> often acceptably {{accurate}} if {{the standard}} deviation, {{as compared to}} the mean, is not very large. A more accurate <b>method</b> <b>is</b> to perform the calculations on logarithmized values, as described in separate section later.|$|E
