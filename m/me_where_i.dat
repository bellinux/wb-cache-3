Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth!

[...] During the intermediate verses, Madonna sings about making speakers blow, which is accompanied by a subtle sound of an actual speaker blowing up. It also talks about the need to relax as well as the need to have fun.

The opening track [...] "Up in Flames" [...] incorporates a [...] "slow, heavy and melodramatic beat", where Minaj addresses her wealth and delivers negative remarks directed towards her adversaries. The second song [...] "Freedom" [...] was compared to material from her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010); it utilizes minimal production and reflects on Minaj's rise to prominence. The third song [...] "Hell Yeah" [...] features Parker and further criticizes Minaj's opponents. She references her much-publicized on-set tension with fellow American Idol judge Mariah Carey in the line [...] "But I'm quick to check a bitch if she’s outta line" [...] and references the series' personnel in the line [...] "Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel [...] / Why these bums so mad that the queen on Idol".|$|E

2500|$|Owner Tom Gerun {{contracted}} {{for several}} more show runs with Sophie Tucker through the 1940s. The club put on two floor shows a night, one at 9 or 9:30 and one starting around midnight. Gerun took the show some [...] south to Fort Ord to entertain U.S. Army troops for a special engagement in August 1941. Other bands {{taking part in the}} show were Carl Ravazza and his Palace Hotel Band, and Robert Nurok and his band from the Alcazar nightclub. Coming from the Bal Tabarin were Bob Saunders and his band, Señor Wences (a ventriloquist), singer-actress Gertrude Niesen, and the Duncan Sisters with their vaudeville act. After World War II started in earnest for the United States, Martinelli joked with a Billboard reporter that it was easy to get big-name stars to perform at his club, but asked [...] "can you tell <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can get one waiter and two dishwashers? Those are the rare birds these days." [...] After the war, Gerun hosted NBC broadcasts of Ted Lewis and his band, announced by Bill Roddy, performed live from the nightclub's stage. This activity was not enough to keep the club solvent—in 1947 Billboard reported their doors shut for a time so that the owners could save money as they attempted to sign a major musical artist. Gerun and Martinelli also admitted they were seeking a buyer for the place.|$|E

2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn't they just talk (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's a bad thing to be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear <b>me.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a causal}} link is not proven, it is {{observed}} that the countries with the best cycle safety records (Denmark and the Netherlands) have among the lowest levels of helmet use.. Their bicycle safety record is generally attributed to public awareness and understanding of cyclists, safety in numbers, education, and cycling infrastructure. A study of cycling in major streets of Boston, Paris and Amsterdam illustrates the variation in cycling culture: Boston had far higher rates of helmet-wearing (32% of cyclists, versus 2.4% in Paris and 0.1% in Amsterdam), Amsterdam had far more cyclists (242 passing bicycles per hour, versus 74 in Paris and 55 in Boston). Cycle helmet wearing rates in the Netherlands and Denmark are very low. An Australian journalist writes: [...] "Rarities in Amsterdam seem to be stretch-fabric-clad cyclists and fat cyclists. Helmets are non-existent, and when people asked <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was from, they would grimace and mutter: [...] "Ah, yes, helmet laws." [...] These had gained international notoriety on a par with our deadly sea animals. Despite the lack of helmets, cycling in the Netherlands is safer than in any other country, and the Dutch have one-third the number of cycling fatalities (per 100,000 people) that Australia has." [...] Cycling UK say that cycling in the Netherlands and Denmark is perceived as a [...] "normal" [...] activity requiring no special clothing or equipment. Pucher and Buehler state: [...] "The Dutch cycling experts and planners interviewed for this paper adamantly opposed the use of helmets, claiming that helmets discourage cycling by making it less convenient, less comfortable, and less fashionable. They also mention the possibility that helmets would make cycling more dangerous by giving cyclists a false sense of safety and thus encouraging riskier riding behavior." ...|$|E
