Later, Angie learns that Nick had an affair with Julie prior to her attack, but she forgives him for this betrayal. When Julie rejects Danny once <b>more,</b> <b>he</b> attempts suicide by swallowing a large amount of pills. Angie and Nick admit him to the hospital, where he awakens with temporary memory loss and tells Nurse Mona Clark (Maria Cominis), that his name is Tyler.

5|$|Around 212AD, {{soon after}} Vologases VI of Parthia (r. c.208–222AD) took the throne, his brother Artabanus V of Parthia (d.224AD) rebelled {{against him and}} gained control over a greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r.211–217AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once <b>more.</b> <b>He</b> marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the {{marriage}} was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river.|$|E
5|$|Following his draft, {{he joined}} the college hockey ranks with the Dartmouth Big Green of the ECAC Hockey Conference. He missed 8 games in his {{freshman}} year due to mononucleosis, finishing with 11 points over 26 games. He helped the Big Green to the third-place game of the ECAC playoffs, where they lost to the Colgate Raiders. The following season, he improved to 15 points in 33 games. Prior to his junior year, he was named an alternate captain for the Big Green, going on to score a college career-high 12 goals and 28 points over 33 games. Glass made his second appearance in the ECAC's third-place game, winning 3–2 against Colgate. Captaining the team as a senior in 2006–07, Glass matched his career-high 28 points and helped Dartmouth to the third-place game once <b>more.</b> <b>He</b> finished his college career losing to the St. Lawrence Saints.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Marlborough College, Seamer attended Brasenose College, Oxford. Seamer played just one first-class {{match for the}} university in his first year, appearing against Worcestershire at The Parks. He scored 33 before being run out in his only innings, and also bowled six overs, though without claiming a wicket. He appeared eleven times for Somerset that year, but despite regular scores of 20 or <b>more,</b> <b>he</b> did not score a half-century, and averaged 13.06 runs.|$|E

5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for <b>more</b> (<b>he</b> was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; needless to say, Little prospered immensely.|$|E

5|$|The 1954 {{season was}} a {{transitional}} {{one for the}} Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were {{nearing the end of}} their careers. Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the championship, again against the Lions. This time, the Browns won 56–10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three <b>more.</b> <b>He</b> announced his retirement after the game.|$|E
5|$|The armies {{remained}} in their encampments {{for the campaign}} season while men and horses ate all the provisions and forage for miles. Prince Henry wrote to his brother, suggesting they complete their operations by 22 August, at which time he estimated he would have exhausted local supplies of food for his men and fodder for his horses. Frederick agreed. He laid plans to cross the Elbe and approach the Austrian force from the rear, but the <b>more</b> <b>he</b> examined the conditions of Joseph's entrenchments, the <b>more</b> <b>he</b> realized the campaign was already lost. Even if he and Henry executed simultaneous attacks on the Königgrätz heights, such a plan exposed Henry to a flanking attack from Laudon. A coordinated frontal and rear assault was also unlikely to succeed. Even if it did, the Prussian losses would be unacceptable and would demolish his army's capacity to resist other invaders. From Frederick's perspective, the Russians and the Swedes were always ready {{to take advantage of}} any perceived Prussian weakness, and the French also could not be trusted to keep their distance. For Frederick, it was a risk not worth taking. Despite this realization, the four armies—two Austrian, two Prussian—{{remained in}} place until September, eating as much of the country's resources as they could.|$|E
5|$|The {{match at}} Prince's began on Thursday, 6 June and was played over three days, {{ending in a}} draw after being {{impacted}} by the weather. The North won the toss and batted first, scoring 156 all out and 196–5. In their only innings, the South scored 197 all out. Grace opened the bowling for the South and took 4–73 and 2–59. Once <b>more</b> <b>he</b> failed with the bat and was caught and bowled for 4, again losing his wicket to the irrepressible Tom Emmett. The match raised about £100 for the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} cast of Last of the Summer Wine {{also included}} a handful of characters with whom the trio regularly interacted. Kathy Staff was chosen to play Compo's neighbour, Nora Batty. Gilbert was initially sceptical about casting Staff but changed his mind after she padded herself to look bigger and read from a scene between her character and Owen's. This group was rounded out by characters at two locations frequented by the trio: John Comer and Jane Freeman as Sid and Ivy, the quarrelling husband-and-wife owners of the local café; and Blake Butler and Rosemary Martin as Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge, the librarians having a not-so-secret affair. Butler and Martin, however, were dropped as major characters after the first series. According to Peter Sallis, Roy Clarke felt there was little <b>more</b> <b>he</b> could do with them.|$|E

5|$|The win was the 31st in McCoy's collegiate career, {{setting a}} new school record.

That yardage put him at 3,594 yards for the season—another school record. His longest pass of the evening, 68 yarder on a post route to Jordan Shipley late in the third quarter, ended up a yard short of being McCoy’s fifth touchdown of the evening. He finished the 2008 regular season with a 76.7% completion percentage, breaking the mark set by Daunte Culpepper for Central Florida, and was the Longhorns' leading rusher with 576 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} {{out from his}} prison, Brad falls into a moat before coming {{to a halt in}} a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a nearby village; this location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad comes back there after traveling to the various corners of the land, encountering bizarre characters and experiencing absurd adventures: the Edge of the World cliff, the Ice Palace, and the Valley of the Lost (a place where all kinds of things lost on Earth have gone to), all while searching for an unlikely set of items that would help him emerge victorious from the game's final showdown (including a fire extinguisher and a mechanical fan).

5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once <b>more.</b> <b>He</b> urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
5|$|Bostwick {{was offered}} a new deal by Ebbsfleet ahead of the 2008–09 season, but {{rejected}} the offer and instead opted to join Stevenage on a two-year deal, playing under the management of Graham Westley once <b>more.</b> <b>He</b> made his debut for Stevenage in the club's opening match of the season, a 5–0 defeat to Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground. Bostwick was used in both the centre of defence and the centre of midfield {{during the first half}} of the 2008–09 season, as well as playing at full back in the club's 1–0 defeat to Kettering Town in September 2008. Bostwick provided the assist for Lee Boylan's second-minute goal against Forest Green Rovers in a 3–0 victory. A month later, he scored his first goal for the club, scoring in the 80th minute against Mansfield Town to give Stevenage a 3–2 lead. He scored his second goal of the season against Weymouth in February 2009, latching onto a long pass and sliding the ball past the goalkeeper to secure a 3–0 away win. Bostwick also scored Stevenage's first in a 2–0 away win at Crawley Town, scoring with a strike from just outside the area as Stevenage finished in the final play-off spot. He subsequently played in both of Stevenage's Conference Premier play-off matches against Cambridge United in April 2009, as the club lost 4–3 on aggregate. Bostwick played in all seven of the club's successful FA Trophy campaign, as well as playing the whole match in Stevenage's 2–0 win against York City in the Final at Wembley Stadium. The FA Trophy win meant that Bostwick had won the competition in consecutive years. Bostwick made a total of 49 appearances in his first season at Stevenage, scoring three times.|$|E
