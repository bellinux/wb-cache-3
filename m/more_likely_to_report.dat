5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic differences among respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction. Muslims were also <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> this lack of attraction than respondents from Christian religions.|$|E

The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes {{were more likely to have}} anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the extent to}} which type and labeling of harassment have an impact on reporting through official channels. Reinforcing earlier analyses, type of harassment impacted whether individuals reported incidents officially. Environmental harassment was far <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> through official channels. We speculate that “individualized ” forms of harassment (personal, frequently directly physical in nature, leaving little room for misinterpretation by the victim or the perpetrator) may create a negative organizational image and therefore be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be concealed. Since experiencing environmental harassment is strongly related to experiencing individualized harassment and is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> through official channels, it may be the real key to creating zero-tolerance for any type of sexual harassment...|$|R

The students were asked if and how often they had experienced 14 types of behaviors which constitute sexual harassment. They then indicated who harassed them (students, teachers, school employees). Nonphysical sexual abuse (e.g., making sexual jokes) was more prevalent than physical abuse (8.7 and 6.7%). Girls were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> educator sexual harassment than boys (10.3 and 8.8%). 12.3% of black, 12.2% of Latino, 8.4% of white and 1,8 % of Asian students indicated that they had experienced sexual harassment by teachers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} sexual violence, such as gang rape, are {{predominantly}} committed by young men. Sexual aggression {{is often a}} defining characteristic of manhood in the group and is {{significantly related to the}} wish to be held in high esteem. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been linked with gang membership and having delinquent peers. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers are also much <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> coercive or enforced intercourse outside the gang context than men lacking sexually aggressive peers. Gang rape is often viewed by the men involved, and sometimes by others too, as legitimate, in that it is seen to discourage or punish perceived immoral behavior among women, such as wearing short skirts or frequenting bars.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group.

For instance, strongly fused employees were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E

25|$|Measuring the {{percentage}} of applicants who were denied coverage does not capture any effect that occurs before an application is submitted. If individuals with serious health conditions never apply because they expect {{that they will be}} denied coverage, they will not show up in the declination rate. Conversely, if they apply with multiple insurers in hopes of finding one that will issue them a policy, they will be overrepresented in the declination rate. The 2001 Commonwealth Fund study found that a majority of adults reported that it was at least somewhat difficult to find an affordable health insurance policy. Among adults over 30, {{the percentage}} reporting difficulty did not vary significantly by age.

25|$|Typically, {{older men}} and women {{maintaining}} interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; {{it is a way}} of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both aging genders agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.|$|E
25|$|According to the UNDP, {{the most}} common types of {{violence}} faced by {{women and men in}} 2012 were physical attacks (50% of reported crime cases) followed by property crimes (32%). There was a low reported overall rate of sexual violence, with a reported nationwide prevalence rate ranging from 2% to 13%. The UNDP suggested that this was possibly attributable to reluctance on the part of female youth to report such cases due to entrenched cultural and social stigmas, though male youth were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> crimes in general. Most incidents of sexual assault occurred {{within the context of the}} insurgency in southern Somalia. Over the first quarter of 2013, Amnesty International reported that 56.7% of victims in Mogadishu were internally displaced persons. According to Human Rights Watch, the government in 2013 developed comprehensive judicial and security reform plans, but had not yet followed through on those commitments. At least two women who reported rape were also prosecuted for prevarication, but were later released following appeals.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk factors among female street youths involved in prostitution and those with no history of prostitution. Youths aged 14 to 25 years were recruited into the Montreal Street Youth Cohort. Semiannually, youths completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Statistical analyses comparing characteristics and HIV risk factors for girls involved in prostitution and those never involved were carried out using paramet-ric and nonparametric methods. Of the girls, 88 (27 %) reported involvement in prosti-tution, and 177 girls reported no history of prostitution at the baseline interview. Girls involved in prostitution were two times and five times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>reported</b> bingeing on alcohol and on drugs, respectively. A history of injection drug use was four times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been <b>reported</b> by girls involved in prostitution. Further, these girls were 2. 5 times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>reported</b> injected cocaine as their drug of choice. Girls involved in prostitution were younger the first time they had consen-sual sex and were twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>reported</b> anal sex. Consistent condom use for anal, vaginal, and oral sex was low for all girls. Girls involved in prostitution reported more risky sexual partners. In conclusion, girls involved in prostitution may be at increased risk of HIV infection due to their injection drug use and risky sexual behaviors. Unique intervention strategies are necessary for reducing HIV infection among female street youths involved in prostitution...|$|R
40|$|Part of MCMIS Crash File series (as {{noted in}} the series field for these documents); "June 2006 "; Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 31 - 32) This report {{is part of a}} series of reports evaluating the data <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The earlier studies showed that <b>reporting</b> <b>to</b> the MCMIS Crash File was significantly incomplete. This report examines the sources of underreporting for the state of Washington. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the Washington Police Accident <b>Report</b> (PAR) file <b>to</b> determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Evaluation of the Washington data was significantly complicated by the fact that not all of the criteria to identify cases that should be <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> the Crash file are included in the Washington PAR file. However, using reference distributions from other states, it was possible to estimate that between 37. 6 percent and 53. 7 percent of reportable cases are uploaded to the MCMIS Crash file. Crashes involving a fatality are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than crashes in which the most serious injury was an A- or B-injury. Crashes involving large trucks such as tractor-semitrailers or doubles combinations were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than crashes involving single-unit trucks or buses. Crashes covered by the Washington State Police were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reported</b> than those covered by either county sheriffs or local police departments. Missing data rates are low for most variables, although the important body type variable is almost all missing data, and rates are high for some hazardous materials variables. Inconsistencies were identified for some variables. In particular, the vehicle type description in the PAR file differs greatly from the corresponding vehicle configuration variable in the MCMIS Crash file...|$|R

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the {{national}} health ministries of the listed countries reviewed the pertinent studies for causal links among silicone-gel breast implants and systemic and auto-immune diseases. The collective conclusion {{is that there is}} no evidence establishing a causal connection between the implantation of silicone breast implants and either type of disease. The affected women complained of systemic disease manifested as fungal, neurologic, and rheumatologic ailments. The Danish study Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants (2004) reported that women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years were no <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> an excessive number of rheumatic disease symptoms than would the women of the control group. The follow-up study Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update (2006) reported a decreased standardized mortality ratio and an increased risk of lung cancer death among breast implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to tobacco smoking. The study Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2006), about some 25,000 women with breast implants, reported a 43 per cent lower rate of breast cancer among them than among the general populace, and a lower-than-average risk of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances {{in two of the}} domains. Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>report</b> lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT. Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT. Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction— the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%. This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.|$|E

40|$|In 2005, suicide was {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} among youth 10 - 24 years of age in the U. S. —accounting for 4, 482 deaths. Youth suicide is an {{important}} public health problem in the U.

Analyses of the recently released 2007 YRBS data (n= 14, 041; girls= 7, 036; boys= 6, 992) of high school students in 9 - 12 th grades, show that 6. 9 % of adolescents attempted suicide (9. 3 % of girls versus 4. 6 % of boys) and 14. 5 % seriously considered a suicide attempt (18. 7 % of girls versus 10. 3 % of boys). Girls are 2. 89 (95 % CI: 2. 31 - 3. 61) times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than boys <b>to</b> <b>report</b> attempting suicide in the past 12 months. Moreover, girls who reported attempting suicide were significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> also <b>report</b> other risk factors such as depression (OR= 5. 74), weapon carrying (OR= 1. 48), experiencing intimate partner violence (OR= 1. 60), being forced to have sexual intercourse (1. 72), huffing glue (OR= 2. 04), and being a minority (OR 1. 65).
