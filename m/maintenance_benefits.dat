50|$|When code with a {{software}} vulnerability is copied, the vulnerability {{may continue to}} exist in the copied code if the developer is not aware of such copies. Refactoring duplicate code can improve many software metrics, such as lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, and coupling. This may lead to shorter compilation times, lower cognitive load, less human error, and fewer forgotten or overlooked pieces of code. However, not all code duplication can be refactored. Clones may be the most effective solution if the programming language provides inadequate or overly complex abstractions, particularly if supported with user interface techniques such as simultaneous editing. Furthermore, the risks of breaking code when refactoring may outweigh any <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefits.</b> Duplicated code {{does not seem to be}} significantly more error-prone than unduplicated code.|$|E

In this study, water is only injected during the takeoff and initial climb phase of a flight. There is no water injection during engine start or ground operations, nor during climb, cruise, descent, or landing. This study determined the <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefit</b> of water injection during takeoff and initial climb and evaluated the feasibility of retrofitting a current production engine, the PW 4062 (Pratt & Whitney, East Hartford, CT), with a water injection system.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is "Influencing the Payment of Benefits for Parental Care Support after the year 2007 ". These {{benefits}} are intangible social care benefits paid by the Labour Office of the Czech Republic. Parental support is governed by Act No. 117 / 1995 Coll., on State Social Support, while the maintenance benefit is governed by Act No. 108 / 2006 Coll., on Social Services. The goal {{of the study was}} the analysis of legislative changes in parental support and <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefits,</b> concurrent distribution of both contributions and their mutual collision or determination from 2007 to 2013 in České Budějovice. The theoretical part deals with the development of the parental support and the history of <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefits</b> from their introduction to the end of 2013. It captures the most important legislative changes. This section was prepared on the basis of legislation, scientific literature and internet resources. In the practical part, quantitative research was conducted, the task of which was to confirm or refute the pre-defined hypotheses. One of the selected techniques of the research was the analysis of documents, and in its context, a secondary data analysis. We utilised statistics of the Labour Office of the Czech Republic for the then existing České Budějovice region, and from the current České Budějovice contact office and the Czech Statistical Office. The second technique was a 10 -question survey. It was distributed to 7 employees of the Labour Office of the Czech Republic České Budějovice contact office, who are responsible for the pertinent agenda.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the promotion of further vocational training for the unemployed is of major interest not only as to the quantity of subsequent transitions into employment, but also {{with regard to the}} quality of the employments gained. In this report we present an analysis of the transition into sustainable employment in consequence of further vocational training supported by the European Social Fund (ESF <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefit,</b> general education modules) supplementary to promotion according to SGB III (German Social Code Book III). The impact analysis is focused on the transition into non-funded jobs liable to social security of more than half a year and more than one year duration. We use two comparison groups: (1) unemployed non-participants and (2) participants in further vocational training supported according to SGB III without supplementary ESF funding. The analysis covers participants in further vocational training funded by the ESF between 2000 and 2002. The empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data from panel surveys (2003 / 2004 and 2006) of ESF-funded participants (census in every second employment agency district) and comparison persons who were selected by exact pre-matching on the basis of process-produced data from the Federal Employment Agency. Methods of event history analysis were applied (Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regressions) for impact analysis covering an observation period of up to six years. Our results show that participation in further vocational training supported by the ESF increased the transition probability into sustainable employment in the medium and long run compared to non-participation. In this respect ESF-funded participants have proven more successful than unemployed non-participants. Compared to statutory promotion according to SGB III the added value of ESF funding is reflected by the inclusion of unemployed persons who would not have participated without the <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefit</b> paid by the ESF or who, at least, would have participated under harder circumstances only. Participants additionally covered by the ESF were equally successful with respect to sustainability of employment compared to those supported merely along with SGB III.

In this paper we show that this limitation can be solved by a multi-tenancy support layer that combines dependency injection with middleware support for tenant data isolation. Dependency injection enables injecting different software variations on a per tenant basis, while dedicated middleware support facilitates the separation of data and configuration metadata between tenants.

Proper maintenance is usu- ally {{required to achieve}} a suitable performance level of life-cycle. The damage process affecting the systems often suf- fers from uncertainty due to the randomness involved in each environmental attack. Therefore, basing on suitable dam- age modeling {{as well as on}} probabilistic analysis, the main features of time-variant deterioration process are modeled and then the life-cycle is assessed. On the basis of Markov renewal theory (MRT), this paper proposes a combined ap- proach using an appropriate time dependent damage model and probabilistic analysis. Since repairing deteriorated structures requires the arrangement of maintenance strategies, possible selective maintenance scenarios have to be con- sidered. Referring to the relationship between MRT and an appropriate condition index, some repair strategies have been proposed and compared with each other. Those strategies are applied just to seriously deteriorated members. Fur- thermore selective <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefits</b> are economically investigated...|$|E

Methods We assessed patients with RA from the Corrona registry who discontinued treatment with their first tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) while in low-disease activity (LDA) or lower levels of disease activity. Patients were followed until they lost clinical benefit, defined as increased disease activity or change in RA medications. Duration of <b>maintenance</b> of clinical <b>benefit</b> was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were assessed to identify factors related to <b>maintenance</b> of <b>benefit.</b> Results We identified 717 eligible patients with RA from 35656 in the Corrona registry. At discontinuation, patients had a median RA duration of 8 years, mean clinical disease activity score of 4. 30. 11; 41. 8 % were using TNFi as monotherapy. 73. 4 % of patients maintained benefit for > 12 months after discontinuing therapy and 42. 2 % did so through 24 months. Factors predictive of maintaining clinical benefit in multivariate analysis included lower disease activity, less pain and better functional status {{at the time of}} TNFi discontinuation. Among 301 patients initiating their first TNFi within the registry, faster responders (ie, those who achieved LDA in 4 months or less) did better than slower responders (HR 1. 54 (95 % CI 1. 17 to 2. 04)).

This paper studies the effect of crop characteristics on the choice between short-term and long-term tenancy contracts and on the choice between sharecropping and fixed rent contracts when the production process depends on two non-contractibles: effort devoted to current production and effort devoted to plant and soil maintenance. Long-term contracts are effective in providing incentive for non-contractible investment. Since, however, incentive provision is costly because of information rents, long-term contracts will be employed only when <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefits</b> are high enough. The predictions of the theory are tested on a unique data set containing 705 tenancy contracts signed between 1870 and 1880 {{in the province of}} Syracuse (Italy).

GCHP systems are generally comprised of water source heat pumps and ground heat exchangers (GHEs). Consisting of closed-loop of pipes buried in boreholes, ground heat exchangers (GHEs) are devised for extraction or injection of thermal energy from/into the ground. Despite the low energy and lower <b>maintenance</b> <b>benefits</b> of ground-source heat pump systems, little work has been undertaken in detailed analysis. Many models, either numerical or analytical, have been proposed to analyze the thermal response of vertical heat exchangers {{that are used in}} ground coupled heat pump systems (GCHP). In both approaches, most of the models are valid after few hours of operation since they neglect the heat capacity of the borehole.

A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it needs to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals consists on modularity, or else the ability to decouple different components: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes. We have conducted a case study in a large company, analyzing a case of refactoring a component to achieve modularity. We report a comparative study of a refactored against a non-refactored component.
