Biographical {{details about}} her come from two main sources: the Roda Codex and the {{accounts}} of Muslim Andalusi historians, who refer to Onneca by the Arabic name Durr (...) , meaning [...] "pearl". Onneca is primarily known for marrying into the Umayyad dynasty. Although <b>matrimonial</b> <b>unions</b> between Christian slave-concubines and Muslim rulers were common, Onneca's case {{is one of the}} few examples of a Christian princess marrying into Muslim royalty. Her marriage created family ties between the Christian and Muslim ruling families of the Iberian peninsula, initially leading to close collaboration between the Christian House of Íñiguez and the Muslim Umayyads. The political effects resulting from Onneca's marriages continued to be felt long after her death, which occurred at an unknown date.|$|R
40|$|When {{identifying}} the central components that constitute general social structures, one cannot overlook the integral role that marriage, in its many manifestations, {{plays in the}} make-up of human societies. Marriage, or the ultimate extension of pair bonding, developed largely as a cultural adaptation to the reproduction of slowly developing human offspring and hence {{can be viewed as}} a method of maximizing reproductive fitness. If this assumption is correct, then one may presume that it would be beneficial to humans and their reproductive success to engage in marriages of relative stability. Hence, it would be reasonable to assume that there must be methods of stabilizing marriages in all societies. This paper will examine the relationship that exists between romantic love and marriage, as well as the functional role that love may play as a stabilizing agent in certain <b>matrimonial</b> <b>unions...</b>|$|R

Varied sources have been used to reconstruct the genealogies and the marriages of many noble families from 1880 to 1959. British archives, including the lists or the Who's Who and the diaries and correspondence of the British officers present in Tibet during the period, provided most of the information. Data was also collected through interviews with around seventy members of the aristocracy. Biographies and autobiographies, written by Tibetan noblemen and women, provided further data for study. Matrimonial strategies appear to be at the same time a means of distinction and of renewal of the aristocratic group...|$|R

Of course, she did not lead a very happy life in England. Her husband the king, like the {{majority}} of the English people, was a Protestant, and the difference was a far more important circumstance in those days than it would be now; though even now a difference in religious faith, on points which either party deems essential, is, in married life, an obstacle to domestic happiness, which comes to no termination, and admits of no cure. If it were possible for reason and reflection to control the impetuous impulses of youthful hearts, such differences of religious faith would be regarded, where they exist, as an insurmountable objection to a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
60|$|Arsinoe very readily acceded to this proposal. It is true {{that she}} was the {{half-sister}} of Ceraunus; but this relationship was no bar to a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union,</b> according to the ideas that prevailed in the courts of kings in those days. Arsinoe, accordingly, gave her consent to the proposal, and opened the gates of the city to Ceraunus and his troops. Ceraunus immediately put her two sons to death. Arsinoe herself fled from the city. Very probably Ceraunus allowed her to escape, since, as she herself had no claim to the throne, any open violence offered to her would have been a gratuitous crime, which would have increased, unnecessarily, the odium that would naturally attach to Ceraunus's proceedings. At any rate, Arsinoe escaped, and, after various wanderings, found her way back to her former home in her father's court at Alexandria.|$|E

When {{he was a}} very young child, his father, according to the custom of the times, had espoused him to the daughter and heiress of a neighboring earl, a child like himself. Her name was Margaret. The earldom which this little Margaret was to inherit was Maine. It was on the frontiers of Normandy, and it was a rich and valuable possession. It {{was a part of the}} stipulation of the marriage contract that the young bride's domain was to be delivered to the father of the bridegroom, to be held by him until the bridegroom should become of age, and the marriage should be fully consummated. In fact, the getting possession of this rich inheritance, with a prospect of holding it so many years, was very probably the principal end which William had in view in contracting for a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union</b> so very premature.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR MISS BROOKE,--I {{have your}} guardian's {{permission}} to address {{you on a}} subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust, mistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of date {{in the fact that}} a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen contemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with you. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your eminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need (connected, I may say, with such activity of the affections as even the preoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not uninterruptedly dissimulate); and each succeeding opportunity for observation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me more emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus evoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now referred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to you the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to the commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation of thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not conceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with those graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer distinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental qualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet with this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive, adapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant hours; and but for the event of my introduction to you (which, let me again say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with foreshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages towards the completion of a life's plan), I should presumably have gone on to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E

The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and woman as they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity, some sense of the greatness of the <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union</b> exists in all cultures. The well-being of the individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal and family life." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{peculiarity}} of {{the group}} was the custom of marrying its members after partners had been selected, not by courtship, but by a jury of twelve drawing lots. This was to know precisely the will of Heaven concerning their <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union</b> (vide cleromancy). The idea was so extraordinary that even the German poet and philosopher Friedrich von Schiller, in far-away Stuttgart, was moved to write about it, and lamented in a 1781 article, Arme jugend van Calverton!, {{about the lack of}} sentimentality and passion in the arrangement. The Roeites however contended that they had the right to marry, as well as to perform any religious duty, under the Act of Toleration 1689. The Marriage Act of 1753 had tightened the existing ecclesiastical rules, providing that for a marriage to be valid it had to be performed in a church and after the publication of banns. However, Jews and, crucially, Quakers were seemingly exempted from its provisions (Catholics and other dissenting groups were not exempt), {{and it may be that}} John Roe believed, for this reason, that this Act did not apply to his Quaker-like group.|$|E
5000|$|It also says: [...] "The Church {{attaches}} {{great importance}} to Jesus' presence at the wedding at Cana.

In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a concession to the hardness of hearts. The <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union</b> of man and woman is indissoluble: God himself has determined it 'what therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder'. This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy - heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{right to}} {{conjugal}} {{life is not}} just the faculty to enter marriage but a right to live in a dual league of adult individuals for mutual happiness, sharing the burdens and jointly enjoying life’s blessings. It has a double face as both a freedom and a welfare right, although it is mainly the former. In order for it to be fully honoured the law has to provide an adequate frame, allowing and protecting the <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union,</b> correctly regulating the rights and duties it entails (without which the generic right to marry established in art. 16. 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would become empty). Spanish legislation is far from abiding by that rule. In order to solve the problem, I propose a reform supplying a scale of matrimonial covenants with several degrees of reciprocal compromise. Unfortunately my advice will certainly be ignored by the the law-giver. El derecho a vivir en pareja no es la mera facultad de contraer matrimonio, sino un derecho a vivir en una unión dual de individuos adultos para la felicidad mutua, compartiendo las cargas y disfrutando juntos de los goces de la vida. Tiene una doble cara de derecho de libertad y de bienestar, aunque es principalmente lo primero. Para respetarlo plenamente, la ley tiene que brindar un marco adecuado, que permita y ampare la comunidad matrimonial, regulando correctamente en ella los derechos y deberes concomitantes (sin los cuales se vaciaría el derecho genérico del art. 16. 1 de la Declaración Universal de los Derechos Humanos). La legislación española está lejos de respetar ese canon. Para solucionar ese problema, propongo una reforma que ofrezca una escala de pactos de vínculo conyugal, con diferentes grados de compromiso recíproco. Lamentablemente es seguro que el legislador no seguirá este consejo...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} Kant’s {{philosophy of}} matrimonial law. It {{focuses on the}} idea of this law as “possession of a person as a thing and its use as a person”: Kant conceives marriage as an interpersonal relation in an external form of real possession, in the aspect of the objective and subjective goal of such relation, but primarily in the aspect of its legal and ethical possibility. Given the naturalistic interpretation of the constitutive act for this kind of law, the legal deduction of marriage comes in a desperate contradiction with Kant’s ethics of personal dignity, because it seems to lead to a mutual instrumentalization of persons; as a matter of fact, Kant's deduction of marriage rules out the possibility of mutual personal obligations of family members. The naturalistic premise of Kant's family law, provenient from the ancient Roman property law, is as follows: marriage is mutual possession of the other's person as a thing and the use of it as a person for mutual pleasure; it seems to predetermine a necessary connection between legal use and legal posession of a person, the latter presupposing primary acquisition. This premise causes in Kantian family law an antinomy of private law and personalist ethics, which can hardly be eliminated by the own theoretical means of Kant's legal philiosophy. According to the essentials of Kant's ethics, the dignity of the other person, which is (allegedly) acquisited in matrimony, allows no possible equivalent, and its loss cannot be compensated at all events by the fact of mere mutuality of the instrumentalizing relation. The doubtfulness of this naturalistic premise of Kant's family theory means in terms of legal philosophy the doubtfulness of the premise which states the title-establishing status of primary acquisition in the field of personal law. References to the ethical idea of the absolute unity of personality, as well as the accent on “pleasure” as the necessary subjective goal of marital union, which leads the moralist an the philosopher of law upon a false trail, cannot provide a real solution of the problem. The naturalistic premise, in consequence of which the meaning of love is conceived in terms of pleasure, perpetuates the Roman contractualism in matrimonial law by understanding marriage as an external relation of persons, and prepares the soil for the seeds of a nihilistic philosophy of marriage and family. Kant's opinions about the reasons of inacceptability of false and, as a matter of fact, contractually based forms of matrimonial unions, proceed in undermining still more the basics of his positive philosophy of family, and supply additional arguments for a reform of Kantian philosophy of matrimonial law. In the expositions of Kant’s philosophy of marriage, when purified from this naturalistic premise, there can be traced some more integral notion of family union, seen as a moral unity of persons as such, in regard to which the marriage as external union of physical persons is a mere consequence and legal form. The personal union in matrimonial communication creates a relation in which there are two physical persons, but only one moral personality of the family and one legal person; not only a personal {{and at the same time}} property-related union, but a personaltranspersonal union. The specific person as an absolute monadical unity is here absolved by the personality of the family, as the absolute unity of active [...] . between persons, which has no other goal besides of and out of this union itself. When seen that way, it doesn't seem necessary any more to identify the “real-right form” of legal <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union</b> with the essence of the personal union itself, and therefore a merely contractual vision of family law can be overcome. The personalist philosophy of family retains the fruitful contents of Kant's matrimonial law theory: the notion that the <b>matrimonial</b> <b>union</b> is necessary “due to the law of humanity”, and not due to mere natural necessity; the notion of matrimonial acquisition as one accomplished neither factually, nor contractually, but “according to a law”, as a consequence of an obligation to enter a family unity. And yet, just as in Kant’s theory of law there is no ethically enriched concept of this genuine kind of union, in the individual ethics of Kant’s later years there is no ethical notion of family as a personality. Its elaboration became a task for German classical idealism...|$|E
