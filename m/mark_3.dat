5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the Manhattan Project, which created {{a network of}} production facilities, and the weapons research and design laboratory at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two types of bombs were developed: the Mark 1 Little Boy, a gun-type fission weapon using uranium-235, and the <b>Mark</b> <b>3</b> Fat Man, an implosion-type nuclear weapon using plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Both North Carolina and Washington, {{designed}} {{prior to}} radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical range-finders. The former lasted until 1944, {{when it was}} replaced by a Mark 27 microwave radar—though it was supplemented by a <b>Mark</b> <b>3</b> main armament fire control radar. The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two Mark 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search, two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary armament.|$|E
5|$|Groves and {{the wartime}} {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, had begun the move of ordnance functions to Sandia in late 1945. The laboratory's ordnance engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the <b>Mark</b> <b>3</b> Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E
50|$|In January 2008 it {{commenced}} {{a contract}} to hire <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> to First Hull Trains for weekend London King's Cross to Doncaster services. In April 2008, Cargo-D commenced providing <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> to Wrexham & Shropshire while its own <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> were overhauled for service. In December 2008, it commenced {{a contract to}} provide four Mark 2s to First Great Western for a Cardiff to Taunton service.|$|R
25|$|When {{services}} commenced, {{none of the}} carriages {{were ready}} so <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> were hired from Cargo-D and operated in top and tail with a Class 67 at each end. The Driving Van Trailers entered service in October 2008, {{but it would be}} September 2009 before the first <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> were ready. Originally the four sets consisted of three <b>Mark</b> <b>3s,</b> this was later increased to four from May 2009 although these were not refurbished internally.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 the ex-Wrexham & Shropshire <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> were {{overhauled}} {{fitted with}} sliding plug doors (similar to those fitted to South West Trains' Class 444 Desiros) and toilet retention tanks by Wabtec. Once this programme is complete, a further ten <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> will be overhauled by Wabtec {{to create a}} fifth set and bring the existing sets up to six coaches. In 2012 the DB-Regio-owned <b>Mark</b> <b>3s</b> used on the peak-hour Banbury service were given a light overhaul at LNWR, Bristol, and the Virgin-liveried examples repainted into British Rail blue/grey.|$|R
5|$|The South Dakotas {{were able}} to reap the {{benefits}} of developments in radar technology during World War 2. By the end of the war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and radar fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search radar. This radar would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search radar. The main battery directors were fitted with <b>Mark</b> <b>3</b> fire-control radar, which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This radar gave these ships a significant advantage over the Japanese, which for the most part relied on optical systems.|$|E
5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten {{to a side}} with one in the stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious drawback to the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight to a side, as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side. Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt <b>Mark</b> <b>3</b> torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E
