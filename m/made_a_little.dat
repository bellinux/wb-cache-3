5|$|In 1989, Yankovic {{starred in}} a {{full-length}} feature film, co-written {{by himself and}} manager Jay Levey, and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma called UHF. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the movie RoboCop. Although the movie <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over six million domestically – out of a budget of five million – it was considered unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, British film studio, Shepperton Studios, was {{purchased}} by a consortium headed by Tony and Ridley Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds. In 1996, Scott directed The Fan, starring Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Ellen Barkin and Benicio del Toro. Scott's 1998 film Enemy of the State, a conspiracy thriller, starred Will Smith and Gene Hackman, and was his highest-grossing film of the decade. His next film, Spy Game, was released in November 2001. It garnered 63% positive reviews at Metacritic and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over $60m at the US box office. Scott subsequently directed another thriller starring Denzel Washington, Man on Fire, released in April 2004.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} short sight he was {{becoming}} very well known as a gentleman rider, and on 10 October 1868 actually won three races in one day at the Melbourne Hunt Club steeplechase meeting. He rode with great patience and judgment, but his want of good sight was always a handicap. He began riding for money but was not fortunate and {{had more than one}} serious fall. He sold his business and left Ballarat in October 1868 and came to Melbourne and eventually found lodgings at 10 Lewis Street, Brighton. He had succeeded in straightening his financial affairs and was more cheerful. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money out of his racing and {{became a member of the}} Yorick Club, where he was friendly with Marcus Clarke, George Gordon McCrae, and a little later Henry Kendall. On 12 March 1870 Gordon had a bad fall while riding in a steeplechase at Flemington Racecourse.|$|E

25|$|He {{worked with}} great rapidity and long hours, but {{he used his}} colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and week to week, and often from month to month.... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It was as if the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.|$|E
25|$|The Bohairic (dialect of Lower Egypt) {{translation}} was <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later, as the Greek {{language was}} more influential in lower (northern) Egypt. Probably, {{it was made}} {{in the beginning of the}} 3rd century. It was a very literal translation; many Greek words, and even some grammatical forms (e.g. syntactic construction μεν — δε) were incorporated to this translation. For this reason, the Bohairic translation is more helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text than any other ancient translation. It should also be noted that the Bohairic translation was influenced by several variables, including the other dialects, primarily Sahidic and Fayyumic. When the patriarchate moved from Alexandria to Cairo in the 11th century, Bohairic was the dominant language of the Coptic church. As the official dialect of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Bohairic seems to enjoy a strong relationship with mainly the other dialects, Egyptian Arabic and—as it was for several centuries—Greek. The text is mainly Alexandrian, somewhat influenced by the Western text-type. The Bohairic translation is designated by copbo.|$|E
500|$|Developed by the Monotype {{drawing office}} team in Salfords, Surrey, led by Fritz Steltzer, the project veered {{away from a}} purely {{faithful}} revival towards a denser, more condensed design. This differentiated it from the other Janson revivals on the market. Nicholas commented [...] "I think it was Morison's take on Janson - <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> heavier and narrower to give improved legibility and economy." [...] Typesetting expert Yannis Haralambous wrote of being told by a Monotype manager that the typeface was designed particularly for sale in Germany [...] "to appeal {{to those who have}} a weakness for Fraktur" [...] (blackletter or 'Gothic' typefaces, still very popular in Germany in the 1930s). In its dense design it may be able to compliment blackletter well, and Morison in his article on Leipzig printing suggested that this might have been a motivation behind the original's design style. Ehrhardt's technical production followed Monotype's standard method of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by Steltzer, who Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. A wax-copy was made from these drawing, the wax-copy was used to produce a lead plate with the design. These plates were then used as a plan for machining metal punches to stamp matrices in the Benton-pantographs. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{bombardment}} {{began at}} [...] with registration of targets for an hour. At [...] the mines in the Carency {{sector and the}} Lorette Spur were sprung, as an intense bombardment {{of the first two}} German positions continued, until a ten-minute pause at [...] followed by a ten-minute hurricane bombardment. As the infantry began their attack, the bombardment changed to a creeping barrage. At [...] the infantry attack began in bright dry weather. Three of the trench lines on the Lorette Spur were captured by Chasseurs and supporting infantry of XXI Corps with many casualties. A fortified post in the centre of the German line was not captured and German artillery near Angres bombarded the lost trenches, as machine-guns in Ablain swept the French infantry. Fighting continued after dark and the French began to dig in. The German front trenches at Carency were captured and against orders, the French tried to continue into the village but fire from a strong point to the east stopped the French advance. XXI Corps had managed to advance [...] through the maze of fortifications on the Lorette Spur and IX Corps beyond <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> progress.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the degree}} to which it {{impacted}} their relationship is not clear, {{there seemed to be a}} struggle between Abraham's yearning for study and Thomas' understanding about the importance of study to Abraham's life. [...] Abraham seemed particularly critical of his father's lack of education and lack of an earnest drive to see that his children received a good education. Historian Ronald C. White wrote that negative portraits of Thomas Lincoln come [...] "from a son who said his father 'grew up literally without education,' the very value Abraham Lincoln would come to prize the most." [...] Abraham Lincoln, in turn, appears to have been unaware of his father's early struggles, particularly how the death of his grandfather forced Thomas to become a laborer: [...] "Abraham Lincoln never fully understood how hard his father had to struggle during his early years. It required an immense effort for Thomas, who earned three shillings a day for manual labor or <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more when he did carpentry or cabinetmaking, to accumulate enough money to buy his first farm." [...] Father and son also differed in their beliefs about religion; Thomas was a conventional Baptist. [...] Growing up in a nonconformist household Abe developed his own free-thinker. [...] Lastly, some say that Thomas favored John Johnston, his stepson, over Abraham. Their relationship had become strained after Abraham left his father's house and even moreso after Abraham bailed Thomas out of financial situations. His stepbrother, John D. Johnston, with whom Thomas had a closer relationship, also made repeated requests for money.|$|E
