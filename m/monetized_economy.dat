50|$|Even greater {{attention}} has been given to the changes experienced by the Timar System during this era. The breakdown of the Timar System is now seen not as a result of incompetent administration, but as a conscious policy meant to help the empire adapt to the increasingly <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> of the late sixteenth century. Thus, far from being a symptom of decline, this was part of a process of military and fiscal modernization. The army of cavalry which the Timar System had produced was becoming increasingly obsolete by the seventeenth century, and this transformation allowed the Ottomans to instead raise large armies of musket-wielding infantry, thereby maintaining their military competitiveness. By the 1690s, the proportion of infantry in the Ottoman army had increased to 50-60 percent, equivalent to their Habsburg rivals.|$|E
5000|$|In the reified {{perception}} of the political economists and the vulgar Marxists, products have value because they are expressible in money-prices, but Marx argues that in reality {{it is just the}} other way round: because commodities have value, i.e. because they are all products of social labour, [...] their values can be expressed by generally accepted money-prices, accurately or not. The true relationship can, however, be traced out only when the historical evolution of economic exchange is considered from its most simple beginnings to its most developed forms. The end-result of market development is a fully <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> (a [...] "cash economy"), but how its workings appear to the individual at the micro-level, is often different or the inverse of its causal dynamic at the macro-level. According to Marx, this creates a lot of confusions in economic theorizing.|$|E
5000|$|Historians {{such as the}} {{above-mentioned}} Bernard Lewis once referred to the supposed fall {{in the quality of}} the empire's bureaucratic records as an indication of stagnation in the Ottoman administrative apparatus. Historians now recognize that no such decline ever occurred. This change in record-keeping was attributable not to loss in quality, but to a change in the nature of land assessment, as the empire adjusted to the increasingly <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> characteristic of the seventeenth century. The assessment methods in use under Sultan Suleiman were well-suited to ensuring proper distribution of revenues to the army of feudal cavalry that then made up the bulk of Ottoman forces. However, {{by the turn of the}} century, the need for cash to raise armies of musket-wielding infantry led the central government to reform its system of land tenure, and to expand the practice of tax farming, which was also a common method of revenue-raising in contemporary Europe. In fact, the seventeenth century was a period of significant expansion in the Ottoman bureaucracy, not contraction or decline. These changes, contrary to the claims of earlier historians, do not seem to have led to widespread corruption or oppression to a degree greater than that observable among the Ottoman Empire's European contemporaries. The Ottomans, like other European states, struggled throughout the seventeenth century to meet rapidly rising expenses, but by its end were able to institute reforms which allowed them to enter the eighteenth century with a budget surplus. In the words of Linda Darling, [...] "Ascribing seventeenth-century Ottoman budgetary deficits to the decline of the empire leaves unexplained the cessation of these deficits in the eighteenth century." ...|$|E

Monetary needs were initially met by bullion trading in silver sycee, but a shortage of silver in the mid-15th century caused a severe monetary contraction and forced a great deal of trade to be conducted by barter.

40|$|International audienceWe are {{presenting}} {{material flow}} accounting and related indicators for an Indian adivasis village in 1983 (Sarowar, Dangs, Gujarat). It gives {{a point of}} comparison with modern nation-wide material flow accounting. The aim is to test the feasibility of indicators of dematerialization {{of the economy in}} poor economies. We measured the annual material flows within the Sarowar village (670 inhabitants) in 1982 - 1983. The method was a combination of surveys, real time measurements, indirect measurements and laboratory dry matter measurements. The results were translated into recent concepts of material flow accounting (MFA), and compared with nation-wide studies. The total material requirement (TMR) of Sarowar (excluding air and water), USA, Japan, Germany and The Netherlands is respectively about 5, 84, 46, 86 and 84 tons per capita per year. The input (all biotic materials are expressed in tons of dry matter per capita per year) totalised 15. 8 t DM cap y in Sarowar, which consists mainly of air (11 t cap y) and biotic primary materials (4. 1 t DM cap y). The latest was composed of 29 % of pastures, 25 % of branches for field burning, 35 % of fuel wood, 6 % fodder, 1 % of construction wood and 4 % of grains. The outputs (15. 8 t cap y) were dominated by CO 2 (15. 1 t cap y). In contrast, the output of The Netherlands (66. 8 t cap y) is dominated by export with air emissions (19 t cap y), export (16 t cap y) and embedded export (29 t cap y). The apparent eco-efficiency (kg per US dollar, excluding air and water, including hidden flows) is 70, 3, 3, 3 and 3 kg $ respectively for Sarowar, Japan, USA, Germany and The Netherlands. The corrected eco-efficiency using Purchasing Power Parity is less contrasted with respectively 18, 3, 3, 4 and 3 kg $. Traditional human ecosystem measurements can serve as a basic comparison point, and as a test for dematerialization indicators. The limit of the indicator of eco-efficiency resides in the different degrees of monetization of the <b>economies.</b> In less <b>monetized</b> <b>economies,</b> this indicator is highly biased by the underlying non-market material flows. We discuss the use of ratios of non-substitutable factors in dematerialization assessment and we suggest the use of use multi-criteria analysis instead...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} two goals: first to {{describe}} a theoretical model which derives relationships among migration decisions explicitly from utility maximization under uncertainty; and second, to examine why nations vary in their internal migration. To explain variation in internal migration, we hypothesize {{that the degree of}} monetization and industrialization of an economy is inversely related to the family cohesiveness; hence, a given percentage increase in relative income will have higher migratory effect in a relatively more <b>monetized</b> <b>economy.</b> The availability of higher initial information and better transportation systems in these economies strongly complement this effect. These hypothesis are confirmed by the estimates based on the U. S. and Italian data. ...|$|E

Dependence of the Russian economy on the oil price is and will remain strong in the {{foreseeable}} future, although began slipping most recently. This dependence raises concerns over growth sustainability. Low monetization of the economy creates other sort of concerns related to sustainability of growth. Low monetization hampers economic diversification: credit is mostly short-term in the less <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> and the role of the banking sector in financing investments in productive capacities is low. Loan and deposit maturity, as well as the role of banks, will grow in line with growth in monetization. Monetization can not be raised artificially.

40|$|Using the 1992 Bulgarian {{household}} budget survey, the authors analyze {{the distribution of}} income and of the income tax burden by income and expenditure class and by rural-urban sector. They find: 1) Low income inequality (although that is changing rapidly). 2) A progressive income tax system. The poor (the lowest two-income decile) pay only 1. 4 percent of their per capita income in income tax; the rich (the top decile) pay nearly 6 percent. In-kind income and expenditures are excluded from taxation. 3) The urban sector pays proportionately more in taxes than the rural sector. For example, urban households pay 5. 3 percent of their per capita income in income tax, whereas the rural sector pays 2. 4 percent. 3) Income tax contributes significantly to reducing income inequality at both the national and sectoral (rural-urban) level, as the poor pay a smaller share of taxes than their share of national income. These results hold whether income or expenditure is used {{as an indicator of}} economic well-being. The authors caution that as in-kind income becomes <b>monetized</b> and the <b>economy</b> becomes more market-oriented, the system will become less progressive and urban-rural differences will diminish. They contend that the bias toward higher urban taxes is justified to some extent by the fact that urban households benefit more from government services than rural households do.

40|$|The {{government}} has played {{an extremely important}} role in the processes of transitioning the economic system from one track to another over the past twenty years; this is because, on the one hand, while the traditional planned economic system had been completely dominated by the government, on the other hand, reform and opening up had also been initiated and propelled by the government. In addition, in regard to the objectives and modes of reform, the overwhelming majority also believes that we should adopt a mode of reform that will produce a kind of market economic system in which the government will play a very positive role. In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, however, there has been a major change in people's understanding in regard to this particular point. People seem to have begun harboring doubts about others, and, at the same time, their self-confidence has begun to be shaken, and even the very existence of a so-called Asian miracle has been brought into question. What remains certain and has not changed is the affirmation that further steps should be taken to marketize and <b>monetize</b> the national <b>economy,</b> to further standardize and control the government's and the enterprises' behavior, and to continue to enhance the degree of openness to the outside world. Nonetheless, all these are matters of the most general principles, and how to bring these principles to concrete realization remains a matter of a great deal of discussion, debate, and definition. This article is an attempt precisely in this regard. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} key {{findings of}} a household livelihood survey conducted in impoverished African settlements in Cape Town, one of Africa’s wealthiest cities. Poverty in these areas is strongly shaped by {{the history of the}} Eastern Cape’s adverse spatial incorporation into the South African economy. Migrants from the rural areas are highly dependent on and integrated into the increasingly <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> – but are simultaneously marginalized and adversely incorporated within it. Survey findings show the costs and implications of this failure of the formal economy to provide adequate livelihoods. While many eke out a living in a vital yet marginal informal economy, these strategies are thoroughly linked to and dependent on the income that can be secured through participation in the formal job market. Those who are unable to find a foothold in the urban economy are highly vulnerable and are at risk of being confined to long-term poverty traps...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the gendered processes {{of social change}} in Nepal. In particular, I examine how young working class women in urban Nepal articulate their modern subjectivities. In {{the last thirty years}} women have been making significant inroads into Nepal’s public sphere, troubling long-held normative assumptions about women’s place in modern Nepal. In particular, historically dominant high-caste Hindu norms that disapprove women’s public visibility and mobility are challenged by new opportunity structures for women and an emergent structure of feeling advocating women’s equal participation in Nepal’s development projects. Rapid democratization of the political sphere, urbanization, and expansion of capitalist markets has precipitated enormous shifts in Nepal’s social organization including how women from diverse caste and ethnic backgrounds participate in the newly <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> as laborers and consumers. Young working class women have unprecedented access to disposable income. With their wages, they enjoy the pleasures of purchasing power and, through consumptive practices, craft their identity as modern commodity consumers. At the same time, as participants in the public sphere of wage labor, working class women are deeply aware of the social risks they are taking as publicly visible women. These risks include the danger of being labeled “over modern” and “open”–descriptors with undertones of sexual immorality. Drawing on 20 months of ethnographic research conducted with one group of young working class women: female trekking guides, I contextualize my informants’ experiences of wage earning and consumption. I explore the justifications my informants use to legitimate their public visibility and the pleasure they take in commodity consumption as well as the strategies they deploy to counter negative stereotypes associated with their status as public women. I end with a discussion of anxiety as a productive force in the lives of my informants and show how tensions between the pleasures of purchasing power and the dangers of being labeled “over modern” bracket their experiences of day-to-day living...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConcern is {{expressed}} in the literature that as agriculture industrializes, regionality is lost; and with it, social, economic and environmental benefits. The example of oats in western Washington provides an opportunity to examine forces driving agricultural evolution {{during the twentieth century}} and to reflect on whether and to what degree they reveal changes in the extent and nature of regionality in agriculture over time. Research based on historic literature explores five themes which highlight different ways in which the disappearance of the oat crop from western Washington was associated with the decline of regionality in its agriculture. Whereas regionally grown oats as horse feed were once an important energy source for transport and machinery in western Washington, they have been superseded by fossil fuels following mechanization. Oats were eclipsed in importance as livestock and poultry feed by corn and soy, preferred by a professionalized animal feed production industry and better supported by agricultural policy and research. Regional milling operations for food oats have also given way to industrial scale production in national centers. Increased need for farmers to participate in the <b>monetized</b> <b>economy</b> drove them away from the small grains, whose market value has declined as their commoditization progressed. Lastly, the role of oats as an agronomic tool for weed and disease control was undermined by crop protection chemicals. Oats thus exemplify evolution away from regional self sufficiency and towards greater integration with national and global markets by western Washington farmers. While the process was in part compelled by wider developments in agriculture and industry, it was also self-driven: regional farmers and agriculture sector leaders embraced opportunities to grow cash crops and participate in national and global markets from an early stage of western Washington's agricultural history. In a more recent phase of agricultural evolution, social interest in and consumer demand for local and regional agriculture are growing. This phase represents deliberate choice of regionality in the knowledge that it is neither necessary for farmers nor the cheapest possible option for consumers. Reinvented roles for oats are becoming possible in the present context and demonstrate a new and more purposeful approach to regionality which leverages technology and the market...|$|E
