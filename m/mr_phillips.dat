500|$|The same evidences of {{mourning}} were seen along the levee. The Halliday Hotel the City National Bank {{and the gas}} office all bore crepe on their doors, while a number of buildings along the levee were draped in black and flags hung at half-mast.The funeral of the late Capt. Halliday {{was held at the}} Halliday Hotel Tuesday afternoon. [...] Long before two o’clock the crowds commenced to gather and when the services began the parlors and halfway were crowded with people and numbers could not get upstairs but waited in the office or outside on the street. Rev. F. A. DeRosset, rector of the Church of the Redeemer, conducted the last solemn rites and a quartette choir composed of Mr. Buchanan, Miss Lelia Miller, and Messrs. Buchanan and Tunnel sang several beautiful hymns. [...] The funeral address was delivered by Rev. C. T. Phillips, of Princeville, Ill., formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church here. [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Phillips</b> was a close friend of the deceased, and it was the wish of Capt. Halliday that he might assist in the service. [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Phillips</b> spoke of the Captain’s kindness and generosity, how he rendered assistance to so many and did it in such a delicate way that no sensitive or proud natures were hurt. [...] He spoke of the Captain’s loyalty to Cairo. [...] How he aided the city in its struggle against the great floods; how he instructed the bank to cash all paper issued by the city in those dark days; how his fortune was ready to be used in protecting life and property here, and how his barges were always placed in readiness to be sunk opposite weak places in the levee. [...] He told of a conversation the Captain had with him in the panic days of 1892-’93, when banks were failing everywhere, in which the deceased said his entire fortune was ready to preserve the integrity of the bank here and to protect the businessmen from loss. [...] He told what a kind employer Capt. Halliday was, how a position with him was a life job if the employee did his work faithfully. [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Phillips</b> said he had known men at DuQuoin 21 years ago that were still in the service of Capt. Halliday. [...] He told how Capt. Halliday watched the careers of young men who were striving to get ahead in life, and how he helped them to get on by opening the way for them without ever letting them see his hand. [...] All this he told and more of the man whom he termed the best friend Cairo ever had.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence for the identity of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Phillips,</b> {{it is believed that}} he was the French physician Joseph-Pierre Durand de Gros who had been exiled to Britain and who later returned to France using the pseudonym, Dr. Phillips. Durand de Gros was {{a significant part of the}} movement that led to the incorporation and assimilation of [...] "Braidism" [...] (viz., hypnotism à la James Braid; see [...] ) in France and his works on the influence of the mind were later developed by Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. The wolfman trial occurred at the beginning of the golden age of hypnotism.|$|E
2500|$|The drastic remedy of {{liquidation}} was mitigated significantly as the unfair prejudice {{action was}} introduced by the Companies Act 1985. Now under the Companies Act 2006 section 996, a court can grant any remedy, but will often simply require that a minority shareholder's interest is bought out by the majority at a fair value. The cause of action, stated in section 994, is very broad. A shareholder must simply allege they have been prejudiced (i.e. their interests as a member have been harmed) {{in a way that}} is unfair. [...] "Unfairness" [...] is now given a minimum meaning identical to that in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd. A court must at least have an [...] "equitable consideration" [...] to grant a remedy. Generally this will refer to an agreement between two or more corporators in a small business that is just short of being an enforceable contract, for the lack of legal consideration. A clear assurance, on which a corporator relies, which would be inequitable to go back on, would suffice, unlike the facts of the leading case, O'Neill v Phillips. Here Mr O'Neill had been a prodigy in Mr Phillips' asbestos stripping business, and took on a greater and greater role until economic difficulties struck. Mr O'Neill was then demoted, but claimed that he should be given 50 per cent of the company's shares because negotiations had started for this to happen and <b>Mr</b> <b>Phillips</b> had said one day it might. Lord Hoffmann held that the vague aspiration that it [...] "might" [...] was not enough here: there was no concrete assurance or promise given, and so no unfairness in Mr Phillips' recanting. Unfair prejudice in this sense is an action not well suited to public companies, when the alleged obligations binding the company were potentially undisclosed to public investors in the constitution, since this would undermine the principle of transparency. However it is plain that minority shareholders can also bring claims for more serious breaches of obligation, such as breach of directors' duties. Unfair prejudice petitions remain most prevalent in small companies, and are the most numerous form of dispute to enter company courts. But if to hold directors accountable dispersed shareholders do not engage through voting, or through litigation, companies may be ripe for takeover.|$|E
2500|$|Cook's {{men and the}} British Marines {{were confronted}} on the beach by an elderly kahuna who {{approached}} them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began {{to back away from}} the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force him to his feet. Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook tried to get up, the attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed him with a metal dagger, ironically traded from Cook's ship during the same visit. According to John Ledyard, Cook fired the first shot in the skirmish and therefore was responsible for the circumstances that led to his death. [...] Ledyard describes the escalation in his journal: [...] "Cook attended to what this man said, and desired him to show him the Indian that had dared to attempt combat with him, {{and as soon as he}} was pointed out, Cook fired at him with a blank. The indian perceiving he received no damage from the fire rushed from without the crowd a second time, and threatened anyone who should oppose him. Cook perceiving this fired a ball, which entering the Indian's groin he fell and was drawn off by the rest. Cook perceiving the people determined to oppose his designs, and that he should not succeed without further bloodshed ordered the lieutenant of marines (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Phillips)</b> to withdraw his men and get them into the boats.....the instant they began to retreat, Cook was hit with a stone and perceiving the man who hove, shot him dead: the officers in the boats perceiving the guard retreating and hearing this third discharge ordered [...] the boats to fire.....Cook having at length reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats waved with his hat to cease firing and come in, and while he was doing this a chief from behind stabbed him with one of our iron daggers just under the shoulder blade, and passed quite through the body. Cook fell with his face in the water and immediately expired." [...] This caused a close quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's companions. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed, and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines fired as they fled to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing dozens of Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until February 22nd. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. [...] According to John Ledyard's journal's hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions among the natives and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town in the bay, was burned.|$|E
