50|$|Some human minisatellites (~1%) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be hypermutable, with an average mutation rate in the germline higher than 0.5% up to over 20%, making them the most unstable region in the human genome known to date. While other genomes (mouse, rat and pig) contain minisatellite-like sequences, none {{was found to be}} hypermutable. Since all hypermutable minisatellites contain internal variants, they provide extremely informative systems for analyzing the complex turnover processes that occur at this class of tandem repeat. <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR) has been extensively used to chart the interspersion patterns of variant repeats along the array, which provides details on the structure of the alleles before and after mutation.|$|E

The MVR haplotypes of single alleles can be determined either from physically separated alleles or by pedigree analysis of digital diploid codes generated from both alleles simultaneously. We now show that single alleles can be rapidly mapped from total genomic DNA using allele-specific PCR primers directed to polymorphic sites in the DNA flanking the minisatellite. This approach {{can also be used}} to dissect mixed DNA samples such as those often encountered in forensic DNA analysis...|$|E

A <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> PCR (MVR-PCR) system gives Y-specific DNA codes, with a virtual heterozygosity of 99. 9 %, making MSY 1 by far the single most variable locus on the Y. African populations contain the most diverged MSY 1 structures.

40|$|Hypervariable minisatellites {{have found}} {{increasing}} {{use in a}} wide range of applications including linkage analysis, relationship testing and forensic medicine. Conventional length analysis via restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization produces at best, less than 100 resolvable alleles and involves inherently error prone length estimations. Forensic analyses based on such a system have recently been heavily criticised and the population assumptions used to calculate match frequencies questioned. However, allele length is not the only criterion by which minisatellite variability may be assessed. All well characterised hypervariable human minisatellites also show variation in the dispersion patterns of <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeats.</b> At the most well characterised human minisatellite MS 32, MVR variation has been assayed by both restriction analyses and a more direct MVR-PCR approach. Both procedures have shown that allele length analysis seriously underestimates the true variability at minisatellite loci. Many individuals incorrectly typed as homozygous by length analysis have been demonstrated to be heterozygous by internal MVR mapping. MVR allelic analysis has been used to directly show the existence of many hundreds of different alleles, each one absolutely defined, from which we can infer the existence of many thousands of alleles. With a theoretical capacity to define many millions of alleles MVR analysis adds a new dimension to the study of variation in human DNA. The high observed allelic variability is directly reflected in the very high individual specificity obtained when MVR-PCR is applied to total genomic DNA to obtain a diploid code of the two superimposed alleles. MVR diploid code analysis produces a highly portable digital output which provides unambiguous match criteria. Diploid code analysis may be used to obtain highly discriminatory information from mixed DNA samples and, via the use of allele specific flanking primers in knockout MVR-PCR, from admixtures far lower than currently approachable. MVR analysis of allelic variation has revealed the existence of a terminal mutation hotspot which has been confirmed in studies of de novo mutation events in pedigrees. This work has revealed the complex nature of minisatellite mutation, with, for the first time, strong evidence for a role for unequal interallelic exchange and preliminary evidence for a size increase bias...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSimple {{repetitive}} {{tracts of}} DNA are unstable in all organisms thus far examined.

Insertion of a single <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> (either AT or CT) into the middle of the poly(GT) tract results in 100 -fold stabilization. This stabilization requires the DNA mismatch repair system. Alterations within tracts with <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> occur more frequently on one side of the interruption than on the other.

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} variable inherited human disorders. It is characterized by the involvement of multiple tissues and is caused by the expansion of a highly unstable CTG repeat. Variation in disease severity is partially accounted for by the number of CTG repeats inherited. However, the basis of the variable tissue-specific symptoms is unknown. We have determined that an unusual Dutch family co-segregating DM 1, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, encephalopathic attacks and early hearing loss, carries a complex <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> at the DM 1 locus. The mutation comprises an expanded CTG tract at the 5 '-end and a complex array of CTG repeats interspersed with multiple GGC and CCG repeats at the 3 '-end. The complex <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> tract at the 3 '-end of the array is relatively stable in both blood DNA and the maternal germ line, whilst the 5 '-CTG tract remains genetically unstable and prone to expansion. Surprisingly though, even the pure 5 '-CTG tract is more stable in blood DNA and the maternal germ line than archetypal DM 1 alleles of a similar size. Complex <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> were also identified at the 3 '-end of the CTG array of [~] 3 - 4 % of unrelated DM 1 patients. The observed polarity and the stabilizing effect of the <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> implicate a cis-acting modifier of mutational dynamics in the 3 '-flanking DNA. The presence of such <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> very likely contributes toward the unusual symptoms in the Dutch family and additional symptomatic variation in DM 1 via affects on both RNA toxicity and somatic instability...|$|R

In an attempt to add new insights into this hypothesis, MS 205 minisatellite diversity has been investigated by <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>Variant</b> <b>Repeat</b> (MVR) analysis in a sample of > 100 autochthonous individuals from the Basque Country, along with 24 Castilian (N. Spain) and 23 individuals from the United Kingdom. These populations were examined {{in the context of the}} available world database for MS 205 alleles. To deduce the similarities among populations, we have applied a phylogenetic approach that takes into account similarity between alleles. The variability of these populations seems to be a subset of the greater and presumably older African diversity, as has been suggested previously for non-Africans. Within non-Africans, Basques seem to cluster with other Northern European populations; however, some apparently Basque-specific alleles can be dated back to post-Aurignacian times, supporting the continuity of some lineages of this population since the Upper Paleolithic period...|$|E
40|$|Minisatellites {{provide the}} most {{informative}} system for analyzing processes of tandem repeat turnover in humans. However, {{little is known about}} minisatellites and the mechanisms by which they mutate in other species. To this end, we have isolated and characterized 76 endogenous mouse VNTRs. Fifty-one loci have been localized on mouse chromosomes and, unlike in humans, show no clustering in proterminal regions. Sequence analysis of 25 loci revealed the majority to be authentic minisatellites with GC-rich repeat units ranging from 14 to 47 bp in length. We have further characterized 3 of the most polymorphic loci both in Mus musculus subspecies and in inbred strains by using <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> mapping (MVR) by PCR to gain insight into allelic diversity and turnover processes. MVR data suggest that mouse minisatellites mutate mainly by intra-allelic nonpolar events at a rate well below 10 (- 3) per gamete, in contrast to the high-frequency complex meiotic gene conversion-like events seen in humans. These results may indicate a fundamental difference in mechanisms of minisatellite mutation and genome turnover between mice and humans. 7234...|$|E

We previously reported the cloning of the hypermutable minisatellite locus CEB 1 (D 2 S 90), remarkable for its 13 % mutation rate in the male germline (compared to approximately 0. 4 % in female). We have sought to analyse the mechanisms underlying the addition or deletion of motifs at this locus using the <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> mapping technique. This is possible with a high precision due to the extreme sequence polymorphism seen between different motifs. No crossing-over event was observed among 38 informative neomutations. Four of the 19 informative mutant alleles with an addition of motifs are interallelic events, the others are intra-allelic. Overall, the insertion and deletion mutations are spread along the alleles, although the subset of interallelic events shows clustering towards the analysed end. The apparently complex recombination events observed can all {{be interpreted as a}} succession of elementary duplications-deletions of inter- as well as intra-chromosomal origin, suggesting a model in which sister chromatid as well as conversion-like exchanges are involved in these mutation processes...|$|E
40|$|A wide {{divergence}} {{has been}} {{detected in the}} telomeric sequences among budding yeast species. Despite their length and homogeneity differences, all these yeast telomeric sequences show a conserved core which closely matches the consensus RAP 1 -binding sequence. We demonstrate that the RAP 1 protein binds this sequence core, without involving the diverged sequences outside the core. in Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces dairensis specific classes of interspersed <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> are present. We show here that a RAP 1 -binding site is formed in these species by connecting two consecutive 8 bp telomeric repeats. DNase I footprint analyses specify the binding site as the 13 bp sequence CTGGGT-GTCTGGG, The RAP 1 protein also binds the <b>variant</b> <b>repeats,</b> although with a lowered affinity. However, a split footprint is produced when RAP 1 binds a <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> where the two half-sites of the binding site are separated by an additional 6 nt. This is probably caused by the intervening sequence looping out of the RAP 1 -DNA complex. We suggest that the bipartite subdomain structure of the RAP 1 protein allows it to remodel telomeric chromatin, a feature which may be of great relevance for telomeric chromatin assembly and structure in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of human cancers utilise a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM) {{to compensate for the}} gradual telomere shortening that accompanies cellular proliferation, and thereby obtain an unlimited replicative capacity. This can be accomplished by activation of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase which adds telomeric repeats onto the ends of linear chromosomes by reverse transcription of an RNA template molecule, or by the homologous recombination (HR) -mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Telomere length maintenance is a characteristic of almost all cancers, which means there is considerable interest in the use of telomere maintenance inhibitors as a broad-spectrum cancer therapy. Therefore successful therapeutic targeting of telomere maintenance in cancers will encompass the development of ALT inhibitors. This will be facilitated by insights into the molecular details of ALT and how this mechanism is activated. Telomeres in cells that utilise ALT elicit a DNA damage response (DDR) that is partly independent of telomere length, suggesting the existence of underlying structural defects. The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether ALT telomeres contain structural alterations that contribute to ALT activity, and may be targeted by potential ALT inhibitors. It has previously been demonstrated that the proximal 2 kb regions of normal human telomeres contain a non-random distribution of canonical (TTAGGG) and <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> (TCAGGG, TGAGGG and TTGGGG). In addition, ALT-mediated telomere exchange events have been detected within these variant repeat-dense proximal regions. Here we used next generation sequencing to analyse the DNA content of ALT telomeres. We discovered that <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> were interspersed throughout the telomeres of ALT cells. We propose that <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> interspersion is specific to ALT telomeres, and results from HR-mediated telomere copying and spreading of <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> that are normally restricted to the proximal regions. We found that the C-type (TCAGGG) <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> predominated and created a high-affinity binding site for the nuclear receptors COUP-TF 2 and TR 4. Nuclear receptors were directly recruited to telomeres following incorporation of the C-type <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> using a mutant telomerase, and resulted in an undersaturation of shelterin binding and the induction of ALT-associated characteristics. We propose that nuclear receptor binding to <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> within ALT telomeres alters the telomeric architecture to facilitate further recombination. We then demonstrated that the nucleosome remodelling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex was recruited to nuclear receptors by an N-terminal RRK motif within ZNF 827, a zinc finger protein of unknown function. We found that recruitment of the NuRD-ZNF 827 complex resulted in histone deacetylation indicative of chromatin compaction. NuRD-ZNF 827 also recruited HR proteins, and promoted ALT activity. Finally, NuRD-ZNF 827 binding caused telomeres to interact with each other as well as ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). ZNF 827 depletion elevated the telomeric DDR followed by the onset of senescence/apoptosis in ALT cells. We propose that NuRD-ZNF 827 provides a molecular scaffold for telomeric HR, by simultaneously enabling telomeric interactions, recruiting HR proteins, and protecting telomeres from the DDR. Together these data implicate NuRD-ZNF 827 as a potential target in ALT-specific cancer therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Multigene and non-genic DNA {{families}} {{are in a}} state of turnover and hence are continually being replaced throughout a population by new <b>variant</b> <b>repeats.</b> To quantify such molecular processes, in the absence of selection, it is necessary to find and compare stages of transistion during the homogenization of at least two non-genic families evolving in parallel in a closely related group of species. Detailed sequence analysis of patterns of variation, at each nucleotide position considered independently, amongst repeats of two tandem DNA families from seven related Drosophila species, reveals all stages of transition during the spread of randomly produced <b>variant</b> <b>repeats.</b> <b>Variant</b> <b>repeats</b> are found at different stages of homogenization and fixation in a population, irrespective of the loci, chromosomes or individuals from which they were cloned. Differences between the families in the relatively small number of variants at each transition stage and the greater number of fully homogenized and fixed variants between species of greater divergence indicate that the process of spread (molecular drive) is rapid relative to the mutation rate and occurs at seemingly different constant rates for each family. Occasional gene conversions, in addition to unequal exchanges, have contributed to family turnover. The significance of these results to the evolution of functional multigene families and divergence and conservation of sequences is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Convergent {{studies in}} human and yeast model systems {{have shown that}} some {{minisatellite}} loci are relatively stable in somatic cells {{but not in the}} germline, and {{little is known about the}} mechanism(s) that can destabilize them. Unlike microsatellite sequences, mini satellites are not destabilized by mismatch repair mutations. We report here that the absence of Rad 27 and Dna 2 functions but not RNase H(35) or Exo 1, which play an essential role in the processing of Okazaki fragments during replication, destabilize the human minisatellite CEB 1 in mitotically growing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, up to 14 % per generation in rad 27 Δ cells. Analysis using <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> mapping by polymerase chain reaction of the internal structure of 17 variants reveals that the majority of rearrangements in rad 27 Δ cells are extremely complex contraction events that contain deletions, often accompanied by duplications of motif unit. Altogether, these results suggest that the improperly processed 5 ′ flap structures that accumulate when replication is impaired can act as a potent stimulator of minisatellite destabilization and can provoke an unexpectedly broad range of mutagenic events.

40|$|Polymorphic genetic features, such as {{variable}} {{number of}} tandem repeats (VNTRs), {{are regarded as}} the most informative markers due to their intrinsic high variability. Minisatellites are particularly informative, as shown by their early use in forensics and paternity testing in humans [7]. DNA typ-ing of minisatellites provides a powerful and highly discriminating tool. Unlike microsatellites that are comprised of short repeats (1 to 6 bp), minisatellites are intermingled arrays of usually GC-rich variant repeats ranging from [10, 100] bp and with array lengths in [0. 1, 20] kilobases. Intermingled patterns of variant repeats along the array can be charted by <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>Variant</b> <b>Repeat</b> mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR) to {{provide detailed information on}} internal allele structure [1]; see examples on Figure 1.

Systematic isolation has identified human-like minisatellite loci (i. e., GC-rich, highly polymorphic; [2]). However, none were found to be hypermutable. Moreover, mouse sperm mutants arise by simple intra-allelic duplication and deletion [3]. This combination of high polymorphism, lower mutation rate, and relatively simple intra-allelic turnover mechanisms make mouse minisatel-lites potentially highly informative for species-wide population studies. Nevertheless, reconstructing the genealogy of alleles is hampered by the fact that aligning their sequences is difficult. Recentl...|$|E

40|$|Alpha {{satellite}} DNA, {{a diverse}} family of tandemly repeated DNA sequences {{located at the}} centromeric region of each human chromosome, is organized in a highly chromosome-specific manner and {{is characterized by a}} high frequency of restriction-fragment-length polymorphism. To examine events underlying the formation and spread of these polymorphisms within a tandem array, we have cloned and sequenced a representative copy of a polymorphic array from the X chromosome and compared this polymorphic copy with the predominant higher-order repeat form of X-linked alpha satellite. Sequence data indicate that the polymorphism arose by a single base mutation that created a new restriction site (for HindIII) in the sequence of the predominant <b>repeat</b> unit. This <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> unit, marked by the new HindIII site, was subsequently amplified in copy number to create a polymorphic domain consisting of approximately 500 copies of the <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> unit within the X-linked array of alpha satellite.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{analyzed}} telomeres in four hamster {{cell lines}} to investigate how telomeres look in cells grown past the Hayflick limit. In all four cell lines telomeric signals were seen after detection with two different sensitive in situ methods (FISH with PNA probes and PRINS). The telomeric signals {{were not very}} strong, suggesting that the repeats are very short, but were nevertheless clearly visible. With the PRINS technique, it was further possible to probe also {{for the presence of}} <b>variant</b> telomeric <b>repeats</b> at the chromosome ends. With some of the <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> probes, a difference was seen between probes for the C-rich, and probes for the G-rich strand of the repeats. This is similar to findings on normal human chromosomes, and it could therefore be suggested that hamster telomeres are similar to human telomeres in having a discrete domain of <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> centromeric to the (AGGGTT) n repeats. Some differences in staining patterns with the variant probes were observed between the various cell lines, but the significance of this finding is unclear.

40|$|Because of its {{variations}} in length, the AT rich Hyper-Variable Region (HVR) of the 3 ' {{end of the}} Apolipoprotein B gene {{is used as a}} polymorphic maker in genetic studies. It contains a SspI site in its repeated motif and we used this feature to precisely analyse the internal structure of the different alleles found at this locus in a Caucasian population. We performed total digestion on 194 alleles as well as <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>Variant</b> <b>Repeat</b> mapping (MVR mapping: partial digestion) on 54. The results show that the level of length variability (in copy number) of the 5 ' end of this locus is at least two times higher than that of the 3 ' end. This could be correlated with the difference in nucleotide sequence between the two parts of the HVR and suggests the dependence on the primary structure of the mechanism that produces length variability. A molecular model is proposed to explain this result. Moreover, the sharp analysis of the minisatellite structure by the distribution of SspI sites reveals differences between long and short alleles, indicating that in most cases, no recombination occurs between alleles of different sizes. Finally the rare alleles exhibit a non-canonical structure. These important points could explain the bimodal distribution of the frequencies of the alleles in the population...|$|E

Paternal and maternal mutation rates to new length alleles were estimated from pedigrees at 7. 0 and 3. 9 % per gamete, respective-ly, indicating that B 6. 7 {{is one of the}} most unstable mini-satellites isolated to date. Mutation at this locus was also analysed by small pool PCR of sperm and blood DNA. Male germline instability varied from < 0. 8 to 14 % per allele and increased with tandem array size.

This highly informative system revealed a wide variety of changes in allele structure, including simple intra-allelic duplications and deletions and more complicated inter- and intra-allelic transfers of repeat blocks, as seen at other human minisatellites. The main mode of sperm mutation, however, resulted in ex-tremely complex allele reorganization with evidence of inter-allelic transfer plus the generation of novel re-peats by rearrangement at the sub-repeat level, suggesting that recombinational instability at B 6. 7 is a complex multistep process...|$|E

Results: Given the high haplotypic diversity detected (mean He= 0. 962), these minisatellite trees proved to be highly informative for tracing past and present genetic exchanges.

Mechanisms underlying the rapid turnover of repeats at the proximal end of the Xp/Yp telomere include intra-allelic processes, such as slippage during replication.

In Europeans, this locus has four common alleles, {{and a larger}} number of rare alleles; possession of a rare allele has been identified as a risk factor responsible for 5 – 10 % of some cancers. This unusual model of predisposition has been controversial in case–control studies, but also makes characteristic predictions about the population genetics of the locus, which we examine in this study. Using <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> (‘MVR’) mapping, and compound haplotypes composed of the minisatellite and surrounding substitutional polymorphisms, we have reconstructed the main steps in the evolution of this locus in human populations. MVR-calibrated measurements of allele length yield rare allele frequencies significantly higher than most previous studies, and show that most other analyses have not distinguished two common alleles of 84 and 85 repeat units. Alleles classified as ‘rare ’ in European populations predominate (70 %) in the African sample studied. Small-pool PCR (SP–PCR) analysis on common alleles in sperm DNA gives an estimate for the germline minisatellite mutation rate of about 0. 05 % (95 % confidence upper limit 0. 15 %). Overall, our results do not reflect a locus subject to frequent mutation and strong selection, and are difficult to reconcile with the proposed cancer predisposition. Restricted variation at this locus is most simply explained by low mutation rate, and although definitive case–control studies can only be performed using methods capable of reproducibly distinguishing rare and common alleles, our work suggests that most studies to date have not resolved alleles adequately...|$|E

Results Given the high haplotypic diversity detected (mean He = 0. 962), these minisatellite trees proved to be highly informative for tracing past and present genetic exchanges. Examples of identical or nearly identical alleles were found across subspecies and in geographically very distant locations, together with poor lineage sorting among subspecies except for the X-chromosome locus MMS 30 in Mus mus musculus. Given the high mutation rate of mouse minisatellite loci, this picture cannot be interpreted only with simple splitting events followed by retention of polymorphism, but implies recurrent gene flow between already differentiated entities. Conclusion This strongly suggests that, at least for the chromosomal regions under scrutiny, wild house mouse subspecies constitute a set of interrelated gene pools still connected through long range gene flow or genetic exchanges occurring in the various contact zones existing nowadays or that have existed in the past. Identifying genomic regions that do not follow this pattern will be a challenging task for pinpointing genes important for speciation...|$|E

40|$|Two yeast {{minisatellite}} alleles were cloned {{and inserted}} into a genetically defined interval in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of flanking markers {{in combination with}} sequencing allowed {{the determination of the}} meiotic events that produced minisatellites with altered lengths. Tetrad analysis revealed that gene conversions, deletions, or complex combinations of both were involved in producing <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variants.</b> Similar changes were obtained following selection for nearby gene conversions or crossovers among random spores. The largest class of events involving the minisatellite was a 3 : 1 segregation of parental-size alleles, a class that would have been missed in all previous studies of minisatellites. Comparison of the sequences of the parental and novel alleles revealed that DNA must have been removed from the recipient array while a newly synthesized copy of donor array sequences was inserted.

In cases where one or both sides of the insertion could be determined, the insertion endpoints were consistent with the suggestion that the event was mediated by alignment of homologous stretches of donor/recipient DNA...|$|R
40|$|This review assesses {{recent data}} on mutational {{risk to the}} {{germline}} after radiation exposure obtained by molecular analysis of tandemly repeated DNA loci (TRDLs) : minisatellites in humans and expanded simple tandem repeats in mice. Some studies, particularly those including exposure to internal emitters, indicate that TRDL mutation {{can be used as}} a marker of human radiation exposure; most human studies, however, are negative. Although mouse studies have suggested that TRDL mutation analysis may be more widely applicable in biomonitoring, there are important differences between the structure of mouse and human TRDLs. Mutational mechanisms probably differ between the two species, and so care should be taken in predicting effects in humans from mouse data. In mice and humans, TRDL mutations are largely untargeted with only limited evidence of dose dependence. Transgenerational mutation has been observed in mice but not in humans, but the mechanisms driving such mutation transmission are unknown. Some <b>minisatellite</b> <b>variants</b> are associated with human diseases and may affect gene transcription, but causal relationships have not yet been established. It is concluded that at present the TRDL mutation data do not warrant a dramatic revision of germline or cancer risk estimates for radiation...|$|R
40|$|Four hypervariable {{minisatellite}} loci {{were scored}} on a panel of 116 individuals of various geographical origins representing {{a large part of}} the diversity present in House Mouse subspecies. Internal structures of alleles were determined by <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>Variant</b> <b>Repeat</b> mapping PCR (MVR-PCR), to produce maps of intermingled patterns of variant repeats along the repeat array. To reconstruct the genealogy of these arrays of variable length, the specifically designed software MS_Align was used to estimate molecular divergences, graphically represented as neighbour-joining trees. Given the high haplotypic diversity detected (mean He= 0. 962), these minisatellite trees proved to be highly informative for tracing past and present genetic exchanges. Examples of identical or nearly identical alleles were found across subspecies and in geographically very distant locations while monophyly was only detected for the X-chromosome locus MMS 30 in M. m. musculus, This lack of complete lineage sorting and fits well with the likely phylogeographic scenario according to which M. m. castaneus is a recent offshoot from the so-called central populations that would have occupied the speciesÕ ancestral range, while M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus would have diverged earlier when migrating out of it. This strongly suggests that, at least for the chromosomal regions under scrutiny, wild House Mice subspecies constitute a set of interrelated gene pools still connected through long range gene flow or genetic exchanges occurring in the various contact zones existing nowadays or having existed in the past.

40|$|Analysis of trypanosomes {{derived from}} {{laboratory}} crosses showed that minisatellite inheritance is {{in agreement with}} a Mendelian system and that such markers are particularly useful {{for the detection of}} cross and self-fertilization. Examination of the F 1 hybrids from these crosses has identified some hybrids as being trisomic, but that, contrary to previous reports, triploidy is rare. The rate of recombination between homologous chromosomes was also examined and used to estimate the physical distance per centiMorgan (4. 9 - 25 kb/cM). Although sexual recombination has been demonstrated to occur in laboratory experiments the extent of genetic exchange in natural populations remained to be elucidated. Analysis of a series of field samples isolated from tsetse flies indicated that a high proportion of tsetse flies harboured mixed T. brucei infections, a prerequisite for genetic exchange to occur in the field. <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> PCR (MVR-PCR) was employed, to map the interspersion patterns of variant repeat units within a minisatellite locus, a ternary code for a number of different alleles was generated and from this the underlying mechanism of mutation for one minisatellite (MS 42) were inferred. This method of allele mapping was applied to a collection of field samples to study the relationship between T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense populations and the extent of sexual recombination in natural populations in each sub-species. The analysis revealed that there is considerable sub-structuring in T. brucei populations, due to geographical barriers and host specificities. T. b. rhodesiense populations are distinct from T. b. brucei and a T. b. rhodesiense-specific marker has been identified for the Busoga (Uganda) focus...|$|E
40|$|Hypervariable {{minisatellite}} {{regions of}} human DNA are of considerable interest, {{not only as}} highly informative genetic systems, but also as intermediately sized regions of tandem repetition. Methods for the isolation of minisatellite loci from the human genome have been investigated, and 23 new hypervariable loci cloned from an ordered array Charomid library. This method not only allows very efficient isolation of human minisatellites, but {{can also be used}} to observe the degree of overlap between multi-locus DNA fingerprinting probes. The 23 new loci have a mean heterozygosity level of 71 %, and have been characterized and mapped in the genome. The genomic disposition of human minisatellites has been analysed by investigation of cloned examples. The minisatellites studied show a strong tendency to cluster near the ends of chromosomes, and sequence analysis demonstrates a significant excess of dispersed repeat elements in the DNA flanking human minisatellites. <b>Minisatellite</b> <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> (MVR) mapping has also been used to investigate the internal structure of minisatellite alleles. Somatic allele length mutation events have been demonstrated in DNA from colorectal adenocarcinomas, and the mutations observed show many features of general similarity to germline mutation events. A series of human breast tumours has been screened for somatic change, using both multi-locus DNA fingerprinting probes and single-locus minisatellite probes. Somatic change in breast cancers is much less frequent than in colorectal tumours, but some allele losses and mutations have been defined, including a highly unusual mutation, which may be the result of a minisatellite transposition event. Finally, evolution at minisatellite loci has been studied, both by examination of allelic states in current human populations, as well as comparison with non-human primates...|$|E
40|$|Over recent years, {{multiple}} {{groups have}} shown {{that a large number}} of structural <b>variants,</b> <b>repeats,</b> or problems with the underlying genome assembly have dramatic effects on the mapping, calling, and overall reliability of single nucleotide polymorphism calls. This project endeavored to develop an easy-to-use track for looking at structural <b>variant</b> and <b>repeat</b> regions. This track, DangerTrack, can be displayed alongside the existing Genome Reference Consortium assembly tracks to warn clinicians and biologists when variants of interest may be incorrectly called, of dubious quality, or on an insertion or copy number expansion. While mapping and variant calling can be automated, it is our opinion that when these regions are of interest to a particular clinical or research group, they warrant a careful examination, potentially involving localized reassembly.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} a single telomere expansion {{in a case}} of acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia (B-ALL), where half of the cells in the bone marrow sample appeared with a Philadelphia chromosome. Comparing telomere sizes in Philadelphia-positive versus -negative cells, we found generally shorter telomeres in the Philadelphia-positive cells, but with an expansion of the telomere on the long arm of one chromosome 11 homologue. This expansion was also found in a minority of Philadelphia-negative cells. The telomeres in these cells were of the same overall size as the telomeres in the Philadelphia-negative cells without the iiq expansion. Together, these findings suggest that the order of events was: iiq telomere expansion, Philadelphia translocation, overall telomere shortening. The expanded 11 q telomere contained the standard telomeric (AGGGTT) n <b>repeat,</b> but also <b>variant</b> <b>repeat</b> sequences. The single telomere expansion suggests a non-telomerase mechanism behind the expansion which may also explain the presence of <b>variant</b> <b>repeats</b> in the expanded telomere. The present case illustrates that telomere changes may occur at only some chromosome ends in a subset of cells. To reveal such changes, telomere morphology should be studied with in situ methodology...|$|R
