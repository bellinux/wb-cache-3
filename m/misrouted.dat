40|$|PURPOSE: The optokinetic {{system in}} healthy humans is a negative-feedback system that stabilizes gaze: slow-phase eye {{movements}} (i. e., the output signal) minimize retinal slip (i. e., the error signal). A positive-feedback optokinetic system may exist {{due to the}} <b>misrouting</b> of optic fibers. Previous studies have shown that, in a zebrafish mutant {{with a high degree}} of the <b>misrouting,</b> the optokinetic response (OKR) is reversed. As a result, slow-phase eye movements amplify retinal slip, forming a positive-feedback optokinetic loop. The positive-feedback optokinetic system cannot stabilize gaze, thus leading to spontaneous eye oscillations (SEOs). Because the <b>misrouting</b> in human patients (e. g., with a condition of albinism or achiasmia) is partial, both positive- and negative-feedback loops co-exist. How this co-existence affects human ocular motor behavior remains unclear. METHODS: We presented a visual environment consisting of two stimuli in different parts of the visual field to healthy subjects. One mimicked positive-feedback optokinetic signals and the other preserved negative-feedback optokinetic signals. By changing the ratio and position of the visual field of these visual stimuli, various optic nerve <b>misrouting</b> patterns were simulated. Eye-movement responses to stationary and moving stimuli were measured and compared with computer simulations. The SEOs were correlated with the magnitude of the virtual positive-feedback optokinetic effect. RESULTS: We found a correlation among the simulated <b>misrouting,</b> the corresponding OKR, and the SEOs in humans.

40|$|Abstract—High-radix {{hierarchical}} {{networks are}} cost-effective topologies for large scale computers. In such net-works, routers are organized in supernodes, with {{local and global}} interconnections. These networks, known as Dragon-flies, outperform traditional topologies such as multi-trees or tori, in cost and scalability. However, depending on the traffic pattern, network congestion can lead to degraded performance. <b>Misrouting</b> (non-minimal routing) can be em-ployed to avoid saturated global or local links. Nevertheless, with the current deadlock avoidance mechanisms used for these networks, supporting <b>misrouting</b> implies routers with {{a larger number of}} virtual channels. This exacerbates the buffer memory requirements that constitute one of the main constraints in high-radix switches. In this paper we introduce two novel deadlock-free routing mechanisms for Dragonfly networks that support on-the-fly adaptive routing. Using these schemes both global and local <b>misrouting</b> are allowed employing the same number of virtual channels as in previous proposals. Opportunistic Local <b>Misrouting</b> obtains the best performance by providing the highest routing freedom, and relying on a deadlock-free escape path to the destination for every packet. However, it requires Virtual Cut-Through flow-control. By contrast, Restricted Local <b>Misrouting</b> prevents the appearance of cycles thanks to a restriction of the possible routes within supernodes. This makes this mechanism suitable for both Virtual Cut-Through and Wormhole networks.

40|$|In {{albinism}} a {{large proportion}} of nerve fibres originating in temporal retina cross the midline at the chiasm and project to the contralateral hemisphere. Studies in rodents with albinism have suggested that the extent of this <b>misrouting</b> at the chiasm is inversely related to pigmentation levels. Here, we examine whether there is evidence for a similar relationship in humans with albinism. Functional MRI was performed on 18 subjects with albinism, 17 control subjects and six controls with nystagmus as they underwent hemifield visual stimulation of nasal or temporal retina. Functional activation in 16 coronal slices beginning at the posterior occipital lobes were analysed and the extent of hemispheric response lateralization at each slice position was determined. During temporal retina stimulation, the control response was lateralized to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated eye for all slices. In albinos, the response in posterior slices was predominantly in the contralateral hemisphere, consistent with <b>misrouting</b> of temporal retina fibres. However, as slice location became progressively anterior, response lateralization reverted to the ipsilateral hemisphere. The slice location at which the transition from contra- to ipsilateralization occurred provided an estimate of the extent of fibre <b>misrouting</b> in the individual. The slice transition location correlated negatively with pigmentation level, providing the first evidence for a relationship between pigmentation and the extent of <b>misrouting</b> in humans with albinism...|$|R
40|$|Infantile {{nystagmus}} syndrome (INS), {{formerly known}} as congenital nystagmus, is an ocular motor disorder in humans characterized by spontaneous eye oscillations (SOs) and, in several cases, reversed optokinetic response (OKR). Its etiology and pathomechanism is largely unknown, but <b>misrouting</b> of the optic nerve has been observed in some patients. Likewise, optic nerve <b>misrouting,</b> a reversed OKR and SOs with INS-like waveforms are observed in zebrafish belladonna (bel) mutants. We aimed to investigate whether and how <b>misrouting</b> of the optic nerve correlates with the ocular motor behaviors in bel larvae. OKR and SOs were quantified and subsequently the optic nerve fibers were stained with fluorescent lipophilic dyes. Eye velocity during OKR was reduced in larvae with few misprojecting optic nerve fibers and reversed in larvae with a substantial fraction of misprojecting fibers. All larvae with reversed OKR also displayed SOs. A stronger reversed OKR correlated with more frequent SOs. Since {{we did not find}} a correlation between additional retinal defects and ocular motor behavior, we suggest that axon <b>misrouting</b> is in fact origin of INS in the zebrafish animal model. Depending on the ratio between misprojecting ipsilateral and correctly projecting contralateral fibers, the negative feedback loop normally regulating OKR can turn into a positive loop, resulting in an increase in retinal slip. Our data not only give new insights into the etiology of INS but may also be of interest for studies on how the brain deals with and adapts to conflicting inputs...|$|R
