5|$|Stańczyk, {{the male}} figure {{depicted}} in the painting, was the court jester when Poland was {{at the height of}} its political, economic and cultural power during the era of the Renaissance in Poland, during the reign of King SigismundI the Old (reigned 1506–1548). He was a popular figure; besides his fame as a jester he has been described as an eloquent, witty, and intelligent man, using satire to comment on the nation's past, present, and future. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has always been considered as much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> entertainer. Stańczyk's fame and legend were strong in his own time and enjoyed a resurgence in the 19th century, and he remains well-known to this day.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it to be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus {{was always on the}} people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E

25|$|In {{the brutal}} coastal weather, the figurehead {{gradually}} became weathered and eroded. Then, during Hurricane Barbara in 1953, it was significantly damaged and was removed to a city-owned building for safe-keeping. Subsequently, {{a few years}} later, city officials could not locate it, speculating {{that it had been}} stolen, or destroyed by accident. Figureheads had long-since been discontinued as a feature of most ships, but the Norwegian Lady had become <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> ship's figurehead to the people of Virginia Beach; she was a memorial and a community icon.|$|E
25|$|The Hall is the {{principal}} entrance to the house {{which would have been}} used by any eminent guests; entering the house by climbing the double staircase beneath the portico the guest immediately sees, through a gilded doorcase, a short enfilade through the staircase hall to the Octagon drawing room. While the hall in its use was not comparable with the Great Hall of earlier manor houses, it was still <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> entrance vestibule; in the 18th century, it was considered than any house of note required three principal reception rooms when entertaining: one for dancing, one for supper and one for cards. Thus, the hall, dining room and Octagon Drawing Room would fulfil those roles.|$|E

However, critics established it as <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> [...] "Pokémon clone".|$|R
25|$|From one perspective, its {{proximity}} to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought {{to indicate that the}} cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to Ahuramazda, and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda. This would certainly be logical as the city was also adjacent to Istakhr, a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in Pars.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of $24 also fails {{to recognize that}} the concepts of property trading and ownership held by the 17th-century Dutch and East Coast natives were both different from modern conceptions. Comparisons to modern land dealing distort the reality of what Minuit was trying to do. Both the Dutch and the Indians undoubtedly included intangibles along with any hard goods in their concept of the total transactional value. For Indians and Minuit alike, both sides felt they were getting far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> 60 guilders. For instance, the natives most certainly would have thought the trade included the value of the Dutch as potential military allies against rival Indian nations—a 'good' that could not be valued in currency alone. In addition, the value of the sale to Dutch and Indians alike would have included the prospect of future trade.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the stories}} {{began to develop}} a {{slightly}} more farcical vein. From this period {{there are a number}} of ballads in which Robin is severely 'drubbed' by a succession of tradesmen including a tanner, a tinker and a ranger. In fact, the only character who does not get the better of Hood is the luckless Sheriff. Yet even in these ballads Robin is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> simpleton: on the contrary, he often acts with great shrewdness. The tinker, setting out to capture Robin, only manages to fight with him after he has been cheated out of his money and the arrest warrant he is carrying. In Robin Hood's Golden Prize, Robin disguises himself as a friar and cheats two priests out of their cash. Even when Robin is defeated, he usually tricks his foe into letting him sound his horn, summoning the Merry Men to his aid. When his enemies do not fall for this ruse, he persuades them to drink with him instead (see Robin Hood's Delight).|$|E

25|$|Family therapy as a {{distinct}} professional practice within Western cultures can be argued to have had its origins in the social work movements of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and the United States. As a branch of psychotherapy, its roots can be traced somewhat later to the early 20th century {{with the emergence of}} the child guidance movement and marriage counseling. The formal development of family therapy dates from the 1940s and early 1950s with the founding in 1942 of the American Association of Marriage Counselors (the precursor of the AAMFT), and through the work of various independent clinicians and groups - in the United Kingdom (John Bowlby at the Tavistock Clinic), the United States (Donald deAvila Jackson, John Elderkin Bell, Nathan Ackerman, Christian Midelfort, Theodore Lidz, Lyman Wynne, Murray Bowen, Carl Whitaker, Virginia Satir, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy), and in Hungary, D.L.P. Liebermann - who began seeing family members together for observation or therapy sessions. There was initially a strong influence from psychoanalysis (most of the early founders of the field had psychoanalytic backgrounds) and social psychiatry, and later from learning theory and behavior therapy - and significantly, these clinicians began to articulate various theories about the nature and functioning of the family as an entity that was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> aggregation of individuals.|$|E

Drawing parallels with Jovanović's earlier Orientalist works, which she says provide [...] "responses and commentaries", Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the triptych is far from a simple vignette of everyday life. In describing it as a [...] "type of history painting", she argues that it was intended as <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> documentary piece. Jovanović's decision to use the triptych format would have been highly unusual otherwise.|$|E

Unlike the vengeful protagonist in Mazinger Z, {{the hero of}} Karas embodies {{the spirit of the}} city, and acts for the city's interest instead of his own. Screenwriter Shin Yoshida sets up a dualism of this idea in the form of two Karas characters; one who believes events are leading to a revolution, and the other viewing them as simply the passing of an era. Manga Entertainment also promoted the hero in Karas as [...] "a cross between a cyberpunk version of the Crow and Batman".|$|E
500|$|Zelda {{first met}} the future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in July 1918, {{when he had}} volunteered for the army, and was {{stationed}} at Camp Sheridan, outside Montgomery. Scott began to call her daily, and came into Montgomery on his free days. He talked of his plans to be famous, and sent her a chapter of a book he was writing. He was so taken by Zelda that he redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in This Side of Paradise to resemble her. He wrote, [...] "all criticism of Rosalind ends in her beauty," [...] and told Zelda that [...] "the heroine does resemble you {{in more ways than}} four." [...] Zelda was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> muse, however—after she showed Scott her personal diary, he used verbatim excerpts from it in his novel. At the conclusion of This Side of Paradise, the soliloquy of the protagonist Amory Blaine in the cemetery, for example, is taken directly from her journal.|$|E
500|$|The Kirkus Reviews {{described}} Middlesex as a [...] "virtuosic {{combination of}} elegy, sociohistorical study, and picaresque adventure", and Adam Begley in the New York Observer called it [...] "a hybrid form, epic crossed with history, romance, comedy, tragedy." [...] Other reviews also categorized the book under various genres. Covering {{the lives of}} three generations of the Stephanides family, Middlesex is considered a family saga by novelist Geraldine Bedell. The book is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> family saga, according to Samuel Cohen in his paper for Twentieth Century Literature; it depicts the Stephanides' trials and tribulations through historical events. Cohen is not convinced by Eugenides' declaration that Middlesex was not conceived as a historical novel; he said the novel satisfied much of the criterion for the genre. Cal, narrating his story in 2002, describes events from the early 1920s to the mid-1970s. According to Cohen, the difference in timeframes, at least 25years apart, [...] "establishes that the novel is set safely in the past".|$|E

The defendant failed to say why the court should not issue the judgment against him.

500|$|Davies {{found himself}} again {{at odds with}} his party, {{over the issue of}} Welsh self-government. He had championed this cause for many years, to the {{annoyance}} of Labour's Welsh Regional Council. In May 1954 he offered proposals for a Welsh parliament that were rejected by the Regional Council and by the South Wales Area conference of the NUM. Davies persevered, and on 4 March 1955 introduced in the House of Commons a private member's bill proposing self-government for Wales {{on the basis of the}} aborted 1914 act that would have granted home rule to Ireland. Davies claimed to have received thousands of messages of support for his measure, from all parts of Wales, but in the House he could only muster 14 votes in favour. Undeterred, he told MPs: [...] "There is a movement in Wales, an uprising, as it were, that will not only support the bill but will continue to insist upon it until Wales is represented in the United Kingdom as something <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> region." ...|$|E
500|$|Professor Steven B. Lichtman of the {{department}} {{of political science at the}} University of Vermont reviewed the book for the Law and Politics Book Review, and identified Nelson's pluralist theory as a significant contribution. Lichtman commented, [...] "The most important contribution of Beyond the First Amendment is its attempt to offer up a new model for understanding and safeguarding free speech". He praised the author for supporting his model with case history: [...] "As a purely philosophical matter, Nelson’s pluralist framework is certainly intriguing. The model must be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> talking point, though, and Nelson wisely endeavors to show how the pluralist framework can be deployed as a means of resolving actual cases". Lichtman concluded by recommending the work for academic scholars: [...] "Beyond the First Amendment is an intriguing and important contribution to the literature on free speech. While it is likely beyond the grasp of all but the most talented undergraduates, its overview of First Amendment theory is an excellent resource for graduate students beginning to explore the field. For scholars, it is a challenging and provocative work sure to cause us to reassess how we teach and write about the subject".|$|E
500|$|Structurally, Devotions {{consists}} of 23 chronologically ordered sections – representing the length, in days, of Donne's illness. Each one contains a 'meditation', {{in which he}} describes a stage of his illness, an 'expostulation' containing his reaction to that stage, and finally a prayer in which he makes peace with the disease. In the five editions published during the 17th century, the book opens with a Latin preface, titled [...] "Stationes, sive Periodi in Morbo, ad quas referuntur Meditationes sequentes". Also 23 sections long, each line of the preface is followed by what purports to be an English translation of the Latin. Joan Webber argues that these lines constitute a poem, in dactylic hexameter; David Novarr disputes this, arguing that Stationes [...] "has none of Donne's customary wit, drama, and imagination". Instead, it represents the Stations of the Cross, or supplicatio stativa. Mary Arshagouni, writing in Modern Philology, argues that the stationes indeed constitute a poem – or, at least, something <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mere</b> table of contents. The Latin lines play-off the English translations, and contain nuanced meaning {{not found in the}} English that better represents the sections to which they refer.|$|E
