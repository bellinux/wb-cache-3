40|$|Demosaicking (or demosaicing) is {{the problem}} of interpolating full color {{information}} on an image where only one color component is known at each pixel. Most demosaicking methods involve some kind of estimation of the underlying image structure, for example, choosing adaptively between interpolating in the horizontal or vertical direction. This article discusses the implementation details of the method introduced in Getreuer, “Color Demosaicing with Contour Stencils,” 2011. <b>Mosaicked</b> contour stencils first estimate the image contour orientations directly from the <b>mosaicked</b> data. The <b>mosaicked</b> contour stencils are then used to guide a simple demosaicking method based on graph regularization...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of Landsat scenes corresponding to an entire state or {{a major portion}} of a state, are categorized based on ground truth information collected from farmers by USDA enumerators. However, no farmer reported data is revealed or derivable from the categorized Landsat scenes due to confidentiality protections. The individual categorized Landsat scenes need to be geo-referenced and stitched together to a common ortho-rectified base in order to be released as a public use GIS file. EarthSat Inc. ’s GeoCover stock mosaic was chosen as the ortho base, because the GeoCover product offered accuracy and vast coverage over all of our project areas. The registration of the GeoCover <b>mosaicked</b> scene and the individual raw input scenes are used to get an approximate correspondence. A correlation procedure is used on the raw Landsat scenes and the <b>mosaicked</b> scene to get an exact mapping of each pixel from the input Landsat scenes to the <b>mosaicked</b> scene. The results of the correlation are used to remap the pixels from the individual input scenes into the coordinate system of the <b>mosaicked</b> scene. The image analyst then specifies the mosaic priorities for scene placement, and the mosaic process begins by using the polynomials from the correlation to place the categorized pixels. A classified ortho-rectified <b>mosaicked</b> image is then output for distribution into the public domain...|$|R

The process of reconstruction is called demosaicing. There are various issues to reconstruct the <b>mosaicked</b> images.

50|$|Historically cameras {{captured}} two colour filtered {{images from}} the perspective of the left and right eyes which were projected or printed together as a single image, one side through a red filter and the other side through a contrasting colour such as blue or green or mixed cyan. As outlined below, one may now, typically, use an image processing computer program to simulate the effect of using color filters, using as a source image a pair of either color or monochrome images. This is called <b>mosaicking</b> or image stitching.|$|E

40|$|Interest in image <b>mosaicking</b> {{has been}} spurred {{by a wide}} variety of {{research}} and management needs. However, for large-scale applications, remote sensing image <b>mosaicking</b> usually requires significant computational capabilities. Several studies have attempted to apply parallel computing to improve image <b>mosaicking</b> algorithms and to speed up calculation process.

At present, when we mosaic two images, we only use one of the wavelengths and ignore the information from the other wavelengths.

This, {{along with other}} technological advances, has brought about an age of mass storage of information, {{much of it in}} the form of images.

One area of interest is that of image <b>mosaicking,</b> i. e., comparing two overlapping images and finding the proper scaling, angle of rotation, and translation needed to fit one with the other. Early methods for <b>mosaicking</b> images included visual inspection or exhaustive, pixel by pixel, search for the best match. With such large quantities of images as we have today, and the increasing need for accuracy, these methods are no longer feasible. Several new <b>mosaicking</b> methods have been proposed based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

40|$|Data {{products}} from satellite instruments with moderate to high spatial resolution are assessed for their geometric accuracy {{with the help}} of topographic maps or geo-coded satellite imagery generally at 1 : 50, 000 scale. With advancement in high precision attitude and orbital control systems onboard, considerable attention has been paid in the recent past to improve methods for better accurate assessment of geometric quality, especially for Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. These products are in general evaluated {{with the help of}} dense ground control points (GCPs) acquired through ground survey.
