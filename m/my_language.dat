When she first moved by herself to upstate New York as a teenager, Miyagawa said she had difficulty making friends at school and assimilating into American culture. She stated that {{at the beginning of}} her life in America, “For years to come, I would cut myself off from Japan. <b>My</b> <b>language</b> skills deteriorated...I had no contact with its culture”. Now, she describes her identity as a “hybrid of acquired American beliefs and imagined Japanese sentiments”. She became a U.S citizen in 1993.|$|E
500|$|She {{was known}} for having a dynamic vocal range, and was {{described}} as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she [...] "could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language." [...] She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, {{the language of the}} apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated [...] "When Afrikaaners sing in <b>my</b> <b>language,</b> then I will sing theirs." [...] English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride.|$|E

Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like <b>my</b> <b>language</b> and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E

2500|$|The Ehrlichs made {{a number}} of {{specific}} predictions that did not come to pass, for which they have received criticism. They have acknowledged that some predictions were incorrect. However, they maintain that their general argument remains intact, that their predictions were merely illustrative, that their and others' warnings caused preventive action, or that many of their predictions may yet come true (see Ehrlich's response below). Still other commentators have criticized the Ehrlichs' perceived inability to acknowledge mistakes, evasiveness, and refusal to alter their arguments in the face of contrary evidence. In 2015 Ehrlich told Retro Report, [...] "I do not think <b>my</b> <b>language</b> was too apocalyptic in The Population Bomb. <b>My</b> <b>language</b> would be even more apocalyptic today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moving to Lagos, Muma Gee {{settled in}} Surulere, a {{residential}} and commercial area of that city. Shortly after, she met record producer Nelson Brown. Brown was instrumental in putting together most of the songs on Muma Gee's debut full-length. In 2006, the album, entitled Kade was released as a CD to music stores. Muma Gee had explained the meaning of its title in an interview, [...] "it is a courageous word that gives hope. I believe so much in empowerment. So Kade represents advocacy and empowerment towards nation building [...] For example, in <b>my</b> <b>language,</b> we say Kade, meaning go, but its typical meaning is keep moving on and you will get there someday." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} said that they cannot fathom my motive. For the full period of my active life I have been a teacher of {{economics}} to the working classes, and my contention has always been that capitalism is rotten to its foundations, and must give place to a new society. I had a lecture, the principal heading of which was [...] "Thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not kill", and I pointed out that {{as a consequence of the}} robbery that goes on in all civilised countries today, our respective countries have had to keep armies, and that inevitably our armies must clash together. On that and on other grounds, I consider capitalism the most infamous, bloody and evil system that mankind has ever witnessed. <b>My</b> <b>language</b> is regarded as extravagant language, but the events of the past four years have proved my contention.|$|E

To make matters worse, Arabic, <b>my</b> native <b>language,</b> and English, <b>my</b> school <b>language,</b> were inextricably mixed: I have never known which was <b>my</b> first <b>language,</b> and have felt fully at home in neither, although I dream in both.

2500|$|Morath {{was briefly}} {{married to the}} British {{journalist}} Lionel Birch and relocated to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph {{during a visit to}} Venice. [...] "It was instantly clear to me that from now on I would be a photographer", she wrote. [...] "As I continued to photograph I became quite joyous. I knew that I could express the things I wanted to say by giving them form through my eyes." [...] Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that [...] "after the isolation of Nazism I felt I had found <b>my</b> <b>language</b> in photography." [...] After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman's secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. [...] She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym [...] "Egni Tharom", her name spelled backwards.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Terry (1817–1896) was a {{moderately}} successful {{actor in the}} mid-19th century. His father, also called Benjamin, an innkeper, married Catherine Crawford in 1838. The younger Benjamin's wife, Sarah, née Ballard (1819–1892), {{was the daughter of}} Peter Ballard, a builder and Master Sawyer who worked in Portsmouth. She had no theatrical connections before meeting Terry and marrying him without her parents' knowledge. She became an actress, adopting the stage name [...] "Miss Yerrett", but it was Terry who was the stronger theatrical influence on their children. He {{had been a member of}} William Charles Macready's company, and shared Macready's regard for good diction. His daughter Ellen recalled that he [...] "always corrected me if I pronounced any word in a slipshod fashion, and if I now speak <b>my</b> <b>language</b> well it is in no small degree due to my early training." [...] The couple had eleven children, two of whom died in infancy. (They had been christened Kate and Ellen after their paternal and maternal grandmothers; Benjamin and Sarah reused the names for their next two daughters.) Of the nine children who survived to adulthood only two, the eldest son, Benjamin, and the next to youngest, Tom, had no theatrical history. Benjamin (b. 1839) went into commerce and emigrated to Australia and then India, and Tom (b. 1860), a drifter, lived on the fringes of criminality and poverty, constantly helped by his parents and siblings.|$|E
