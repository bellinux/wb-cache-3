5|$|Before the 2014 season, the Phillies signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} the Phillies bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as the Phillies were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus <b>might</b> <b>prefer</b> to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that the}} Phillies used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{generally}} prefer larger shoals. This makes sense, as larger shoal usually {{provide better}} protection against predators. Indeed, {{the preference for}} larger shoals seems stronger when predators are nearby, or in species that rely more on shoaling than body armour against predation. Larger shoals may also find food faster, though that food {{would have to be}} shared amongst more individuals. Competition may mean that hungry individuals <b>might</b> <b>prefer</b> smaller shoals or exhibit a lesser preference for very large shoals, as shown in sticklebacks.|$|E
25|$|Mouthpiece {{selection}} {{is a highly}} personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist <b>might</b> <b>prefer</b> a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape {{in order to produce}} a rich symphonic tone quality, while a jazz trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims and cups allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpiece to their preference.|$|E
25|$|Fish tend {{to prefer}} shoals {{made up of}} {{individuals}} that match their own size. This makes sense as predators {{have an easier time}} catching individuals that stand out in a shoal. Some fish may even prefer shoals of another species if this means a better match in current body size. As for shoal size however, hunger can affect the preference for similarly-sized fish; large fish, for example, <b>might</b> <b>prefer</b> to associate with smaller ones because of the competitive advantage they will gain over these shoalmates. In golden shiner, large satiated fish prefer to associate with other large individuals, but hungry ones prefer smaller shoalmates.|$|E

500|$|Kenrick {{prefers the}} 1964 Lincoln Center cast {{recording}} {{to the earlier}} ones, especially approving of the performances of Risë Stevens as Anna and Patricia Neway as Lady Thiang. The inclusion on that recording, for the first time, of [...] "The Small House of Uncle Thomas", was notable because LP technology limited a single-disc album to about fifty minutes, and thus inclusion of the ballet required the exclusion {{of some of the}} other numbers. [...] Kenrick finds the recording of the 1977 Broadway revival cast to be [...] "asily the most satisfying King & I on CD". [...] He judges it to be Brynner's best performance, calling Towers [...] "great" [...] and Martin Vidnovic, June Angela {{and the rest of the}} supporting cast [...] "fabulous", though lamenting the omission of the ballet. [...] Hischak, in contrast, says that some <b>might</b> <b>prefer</b> Brynner in his earlier recordings, when he was [...] "more vibrant". Kenrick enjoys the 1992 Angel studio recording mostly for the Anna of Julie Andrews, who he says is [...] "pure magic" [...] in a role she never performed on stage. Kenrick praises the performance of both stars on the 1996 Broadway revival recording, calling Lou Diamond Phillips [...] "that rarity, a King who can stand free of Brynner's shadow". Hischak finds the soundtrack to the 1999 animated film with Christiane Noll as Anna and Martin Vidnovic as the King, as well as Barbra Streisand singing on one track, more enjoyable than the movie itself, but Kenrick writes that his sole use for that CD is as a coaster.|$|E

[...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet.

They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is hard not to be amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer".
