40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{emergence}} of systemic risk in a network model of interconnected bank balance sheets. The model incorporates multiple sources of systemic risk, including size of financial institutions, direct exposure from interbank lendings, and asset fire sales. We suggest a new <b>macroprudential</b> <b>risk</b> management approach building on a system wide value at risk (SVaR). Under the SVaR metric, the contribution of individual banks to systemic risk is well defined and can be approximated by a Shapley value-type measure. We show that, in a SVaR regime, a fair systemic risk charge which is proportional to a bank's individual contribution to systemic risk diverges from the optimal macroprudential capitalization of the banks from a planner's perspective. The results have implications {{for the design of}} macroprudential capital surcharges...|$|E

The resulting models would be able to tackle common challenges faced by chief risk officers and policymakers, such as deciding when and how much to cut individuals account credit lines, evaluating the credit score for current and prospective customers, and forecasting aggregate consumer credit defaults and delinquencies for the purpose of enterprise-wide and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>risk</b> management. by Danny Yuan.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of the {{introduction}} of new financial derivative products on exchange volatility, efficiency and liquidity. The derivatives under primary investigation are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Contracts for Difference (CFDs). These products offer a cheap, tax-efficient and speedy method for increasing or decreasing market exposure to price changes in the related primary asset. By facilitating faster and shorter-term trading, these products may increase market liquidity and/or increase market volatility for the related primary asset. The thesis builds a cross-country database of new-derivative-markets opening dates, and investigates the key features of prices and returns for related primary assets before and after the opening of these derivative markets. The database covers 16 countries in the CFD investigation, 21 commodity markets in the ETF investigation, and related data as available (daily closing prices, trading volumes, bid-ask quotes) in each of them. The key price and return features investigated include bid-ask spreads, trading volumes (both of derivatives and related primary assets), and daily return autocorrelation, variance, skewness and kurtosis. This thesis also considers a separate, but related, research problem. It extends and empirically applies a liquidity-indicator model for the Eurozone created by the Bank of England (BOE) and developed further by the European Central Bank (ECB) by including commodity liquidity, and uses this extended model to investigate shifting investor behaviour based on changing market dynamics. Similar to the investigation of the CDF and EFT markets, this investigation is concerned with market stability and liquidity in a changed environment (in this case, the key change is the introduction of the euro currency). Chapter one contains an introduction to the main hypotheses regarding {{the effects of}} the introduction of new derivatives on securities markets, and the empirical methods used to test these hypotheses. This chapter also describes the two investment products which are the main focus, CFDs and ETFs, and their particular potential impacts on market-specific characteristics such as volatility, efficiency and liquidity. Chapter two empirically investigates the impact of CFDs on market liquidity and volatility. CFDs have existed for less than twenty years and the CFD market grew rapidly prior to the recent international financial crisis. This chapter empirically examines the roles that CFDs have played, either as an accelerant for mispricing in international equity markets away from fundamental values, or as a source of increased market efficiency through the addition of new liquidity. This chapter uses GARCH and EGARCH models to test for the impact of CFDs on the return volatility and autocorrelation of the underlying security. In the case of Australia, the analysis is applied to individual securities. In the other 15 countries investigated in this chapter, the analysis is applied {{at the level of the}} market index. The chapter also investigates whether the stylised characteristics of CFDs are more or less pronounced in low liquidity exchanges. This chapter finds that CFDs appear to have influenced asset-specific variance and return autocorrelation. Some tentative explanations for these findings are offered. The presence of bid and ask-price ‘overhangs’ associated with CFD trading cannot be rejected and may be associated with observed volatility reductions in some jurisdictions. Following the analysis based on CFDs in chapter two, ETFs are the primary focus of chapter three. ETFs have existed since the late 1980 s, but were first traded on commodity markets in the early 2000 s. Their inception has been linked by some market analysts with the large growth in commodity market volatility seen in recent years. This chapter directly tests this link. The chapter also investigates whether the stylised characteristics of ETFs are more or less pronounced in larger commodity markets than in smaller markets. The results indicate that larger ETFs in terms of their assets under management at their dates of inception, are associated with higher volatility. Smaller commodity markets are found to have increased efficiency after the introduction of ETFs, indicating that there are some benefits from new ETF investment in markets below $ 4 to $ 5 billion in size, but the associated caveat is that of increased volatility, indicative of potential pitfalls in the ETF portfolio rebalancing process. It appears that ETFs have made commodity markets more efficient through a new influx of trading counterparties, but they appear to be associated with a cost. The need for regulation of investment size and market ownership limits therefore cannot be rejected. Chapters two and three look at two particular new instruments and their effects on liquidity and volatility. Another major innovation in market structure was the advent of the euro currency in January 1999. The power and presence of a financially-combined Europe attracted new international investment, therefore influencing liquidity. The combination of this influx of investors and new products (including CFDs and ETFs) can potentially have wide market impacts. Understanding the structural changes of liquidity in Europe in recent years is important for <b>macroprudential</b> <b>risk</b> assessment, as sudden changes in conditions may be indicative of current stress and a signal of future stress. Chapter four presents a Europeanspecific liquidity measure used by several central banks, and provides some new modifications to this measure. The measure is constructed by combining several facets of liquidity and depth measurement across several asset markets. It attempts to incorporate aspects such as market tightness, depth and resiliency. The flows and the direction of causality can also be inferred using vector autoregression, Granger causality techniques and impulse response functions. The measure uses a combination of liquidity determinants including the bid-ask spread, the return to volume ratio and numerous measures of liquidity premia. In the chapter, the modified liquidity measure is applied empirically to European-area data...|$|E

This paper develops an accounting-based measure of interest rate sensitivity.

Using microdata, I show that German life insurers have a significant exposure to interest rate risk. However, {{there is a wide}} dispersion across the sector. I find that insurers' size, growth and solvency are negatively correlated with interest rate risk. The heterogeneity suggests that insurers would behave differently during times of stress, which has important implications for understanding the <b>macroprudential</b> <b>risks</b> to which the sector is exposed...|$|R

We investigate a simple dynamical model for understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target and an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with clustered volatility.

A crude calibration of parameters to data puts the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price bubble, resembling a "Great Moderation", followed by a crash, with a period of approximately 10 - 15 years, which we dub the "Basel leverage cycle". We propose a criterion for rating macroprudential policies based {{on their ability to}} minimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family of leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of Basel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to countercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases. We find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average leverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the fundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal when the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the opposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy is closer to constant leverage. We also find that systemic risk can be dramatically decreased by lowering the leverage target adjustment speed of the banks. Comment: 41 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

This essay argues that in order to improve the safeguards against financial instability, it may be desirable to strengthen further the macroprudential orientation of current prudential frameworks, a process that is already under way. The essay defines, compares and contrasts the macro- and microprudential dimensions that inevitably coexist in financial regulatory and supervisory arrangements, examines the nature of financial instability against this background and draws conclusions about the broad outline of desirable policy efforts. systemic <b>risk,</b> <b>macroprudential,</b> microprudential, financial regulation, financial imbalances, financial stability...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition {{that prior to}} the global financial crisis financial regulation had lacked a macroprudential perspective. There has since been a strong effort {{to make a new}} macroprudential orientation operational, including through the establishment of new macroprudential authorities or ‘committees’ in a number of jurisdictions. These developments raise - and this paper explores - the following three questions. First, what distinguishes macroprudential policy from microprudential policy and what are its key tasks? Second, what powers should be given to macroprudential authorities and what should be their mandate? Third, how can governance arrangements ensure that macroprudential policies are pursued effectively? While arrangements for macroprudential policy will to some extent be country-specific, we identify three basic challenges in setting up an effective macroprudential policy framework and discuss options to address them. <b>Macroprudential</b> policy, systemic <b>risk,</b> governance...|$|R
40|$|A central {{proposition}} {{in research}} on the role that banks play in the transmission mechanism is that monetary policy imparts {{a direct impact on}} deposits and that deposits, insofar as they constitute the supply of loanable funds, act as the driving force of bank lending. This paper argues that the emphasis on policy-induced changes in deposits is misplaced. A reformulation of the bank lending channel is proposed that works primarily through the impact of monetary policy on banks' balance sheet strength and risk perception. Such a recasting implies, contrary to conventional wisdom, that greater reliance on market-based funding enhances the importance of the channel. The framework also shows how banks, depending on the strength of their balance sheets, could act either as absorbers or amplifiers of shocks originiating in the financial system. systemic <b>risk,</b> <b>Macroprudential</b> regulation, Portfolio distress loss, Credit default swap, Dynamic conditional correlation...|$|R
40|$|After {{the recent}} world {{financial}} crisis, macroprudential policy tools {{have started to}} play an important role in maintaining financial stability. In many countries, the tools have been extensively used only in recent years and their effectiveness is often difficult to assess. Using an index as a proxy for policy tools is one of ways to measure their impact. In this thesis, a new index capturing, in contrast with other studies, also an intensity factor, is constructed. Results are mostly in accordance with economic intuition and existing studies and suggest that indices constructed in an equivalent way can help to understand the impact of policies on changes in housing prices and credit volumes.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} and drawbacks of maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios as a macroprudential tool based on Hong Kong¡¦s experience and econometric analyses of panel data from 13 economies. The tool {{is found to}} be effective in reducing systemic risk stemming from the boom-and-bust cycle of property markets. Although the tool could impose higher liquidity constraints on homebuyers, empirical evidence shows that mortgage insurance programmes (MIPs) that protect lenders from credit losses on the portion of loans over maximum LTV thresholds can mitigate this drawback without undermining the effectiveness of the tool. This finding indicates the important role of MIPs in enhancing the net benefits of LTV policy. Our estimations also show that the dampening effect of LTV policy on household leverage is more apparent than its effect on property market activities, suggesting that the policy effect may mainly manifest in impacts on household sector leverage. systemic <b>risk,</b> <b>macroprudential</b> policy, loan-to-value ratio, Hong Kong...|$|R
40|$|The {{collection}} of comprehensive and reliable statistics on derivatives markets was advocated by central banks in October 1992, when the Governors {{of the central}} banks of the Group of Ten (G- 10) countries released the report entitled "Recent Developments in International Interbank Relations" (the Promisel Report). This {{was followed by a}} report on "Issues of Measurement Related to Market Size and <b>Macroprudential</b> <b>Risks</b> in Derivatives Markets" (the Brockmeijer Report), which was published in February 1995. The latter report identified central banks' information requirements with regard to derivatives markets and proposed two initiatives towards addressing them: a comprehensive survey of derivatives markets conducted relatively infrequently, and a system for collecting statistics more regularly from a small number of leading international dealers. The proposal in the Brockmeijer Report for a comprehensive survey culminated in the April 1995 Central Bank Survey Of Derivatives Market Activity. The survey was conducted by central banks and monetary authorities in 26 countries, in conjunction with the Bank for International Settlements and with the cooperation of the international financial community. The results of the survey, which are described in detail in "Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity" (BIS, May 1996), provided information on several important aspects of these markets which had previously been unavailable. Nevertheless, in view of the rapid development of global financial markets, it must be concluded that infrequent surveys are not sufficient to provide a timely picture of many aspects of derivatives activity. Against this background, the Euro-currency Standing Committee of the central banks of the G- 10 countries (ECSC) last year asked a Working Group to develop a proposal for the more regular {{collection of}} derivatives statistics. The Group, which was chaired by Shinichi Yoshikuni of the Bank of Japan, delivered its report to the G- 10 Governors in July 1996. The present report summarises the group's principal findings and recommendations. It is being released in order to finalise, with the input of market participants and supervisors, a framework for the regular collection of derivatives market data to be implemented at the end of 1997. It also recommends that central bank experts examine whether it is desirable to conduct another global survey of derivatives markets in conjunction with the next foreign exchange market survey, envisaged in 1998. In addition, the report provides an initial discussion of possible routes to monitoring price risks and exposures in international financial markets in a broader context than derivative alone. These systemic aspects of financial markets have long been a concern of central banks, but techniques for monitoring them have not been explored in detail either theoretically or quantitatively. After an introductory section, Part II of the report reviews the results of the April 1995 survey and assesses the implications of the survey results and participants' experiences for the regular reporting effort. Part III describes the Working Group's proposed reporting framework for derivatives activity and presents motivations for the specific components of the framework. Part IV attempts to address some of the broader issues relating to central bank monitoring of the financial system, and is intended to stimulate research and discussion on these topics in the financial community as well as in central bank and supervisory circles. Each of these sections is meant to serve as a self-contained unit. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{financial}} crisis 2007 - 2009 {{calls for a}} regulatory response. A crucial element of this task is the treatment of systemic risk. Basel III gains centre stage in this process. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to evaluate Basel III, examining its ability to reduce systemic risk. Design/methodology/approach – The paper highlights the importance of reducing systemic risk to achieve the goal of overall financial stability. By first focusing on the theoretical foundations of systemic risk, this paper explores and analyzes the crucial aspects of this almost impalpable risk type. It further investigates the current regulation of systemic risk, clearly showing Basel II's inability to reduce it. Then, it evaluates the Basel Committee's efforts to address these weaknesses through Basel III by investigating its incentives and its ability to reduce obvious drawbacks of Basel II as well as systemic risk factors. Findings – The findings show that there are still adjustments necessary. Although the development of Basel III is well advanced, providing some stabilizing incentives, there are still issues calling for closer consideration to counter all Basel II drawbacks and systemic risk factors adequately. These include: a risk-weighted leverage ratio; a more thorough treatment of procyclicality; adjustments for the NSFR (Net Stable Funding ratio); and most importantly, the mandatory issue to internalize negative externalities from financial institutions, that is, the call for pricing systemic risk. Originality/value – The paper not only examines the new Basel III framework, as a response to the Financial Crisis 2007 - 2009, but also draws attention to specific areas which the Basel Committee and regulators need to focus on more thoroughly.

40|$|The {{international}} financial system {{is undergoing a}} sustained process of structural change characterised by features such as {{the rapid growth of}} the hedge fund industry and credit risk transfer markets. In general, this development should generate positive effects for the efficiency of the financial markets. As the financial system is becoming more complex and less transparent, however, it is becoming a growing challenge for central banks to make an adequate assessment of the potential risks to financial stability. From a monetary policy perspective, hedge funds are likely to infl uence the transmission mechanism as well as the international linkages between interest rates and exchange rates. However, it has proved difficult up to now to track these effects empirically. The main concern with regard to financial stability is that failures of one or more larger hedge funds might jeopardise the stability of major complex financial institutions and/or create market liquidity crises. Probably the most important line of defence in containing potential risks to stability is adequate market discipline, which, in turn, requires hedge funds to be sufficiently transparent. There are doubts as to whether the purely market-driven process of recent years has produced sufficient progress in this respect. Therefore, given the key importance of market discipline exercised by the hedge funds’ prime brokers, the recommendations of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group II (Corrigan Group) should, as a matter of principle, be implemented in full. These recommendations contain proposals on hedge funds’ disclosure vis-à-vis counterparties. Especially prime brokers should aim at tailoring credit terms, especially collateral and margin requirements, to the transparency and the risk profi le of their respective hedge fund counterparties. The increasing investments of institutional investors such as pension funds, foundations, and insurance corporations are, on the whole, likely to help improve the quality of hedge funds’ risk management and disclosure. Nevertheless, there are evidently still considerable differences in disclosure practices and the current recommendations of the hedge fund industry associations fall somewhat short of earlier international recommendations. Against this backdrop, it would be desirable if the hedge fund industry were to define more demanding sound practices of disclosure to investors. It would also be useful if such best practices were to be incorporated into a voluntary code of conduct. Finally, it might be worthwhile examining whether the current indirect approach to monitoring regulated financial institutions’ substantial risk exposures to hedge funds should be further improved, for example, by strengthening the international cooperation among prudential authorities. Central banks are committed to not impeding an efficiency-enhancing process of structural transformation that can be observed within the financial system. At the same time, however, a suitable framework needs to be put in place so as to ensure adequate market discipline and the appropriate degree of transparency. This would constitute a key safeguard against significantly increased <b>macroprudential</b> stability <b>risks</b> in the wake of any market adjustments in the hedge fund industry in a less favourable economic setting. ...|$|R
