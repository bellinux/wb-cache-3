5000|$|Cancer is {{the leading}} cause of death for dogs in general, but Bernese Mountain Dogs have a much higher rate of fatal cancer than other breeds; in both U.S./Canada and UK surveys, nearly half of Bernese Mountain Dogs die of cancer,compared to about 27% of all dogs. [...] Bernese Mountain Dogs are killed by many types of cancer, {{including}} <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis,</b> mast cell tumor, lymphosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Inherited medical problems that a Bernese Mountain Dog may face include <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis,</b> hypomyelinogenesis, progressive retinal atrophy, and possibly cataracts and hypoadrenocorticism. The breed is also prone to histiocytic sarcoma, a cancer of the muscle tissue that is very aggressive, and hereditary eye diseases that are common among larger dogs.

50|$|Immunohistochemistry {{can be used}} to {{identify}} the presence of CD68, which is found in the cytoplasmic granules of a range of different blood cells and myocytes. It is particularly useful as a marker for the various cells of the macrophage lineage, including monocytes, histiocytes, giant cells, Kupffer cells, and osteoclasts. This allows it to be used to distinguish diseases of otherwise similar appearance, such as the monocyte/macrophage and lymphoid forms of leukaemia (the latter being CD68 negative). Its presence in macrophages also makes it useful in diagnosing conditions related to proliferation or abnormality of these cells, such as <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis,</b> histiocytic lymphoma, and Gaucher's disease.|$|E
50|$|The histiocytic sarcoma (HS) complex {{encompasses}} {{a number of}} distinctive clinical entities which will be described below. Some definitions are in order, and reflect the preferred nomenclature of the writing group of the Histiocyte Society. Histiocytic neoplasia which originates at a single site is called histiocytic sarcoma. This form of histiocytic sarcoma, which is often encountered on the extremities, has the best prognosis if treated early by surgical excision or by amputation of a limb. When spread to distant sites beyond the local lymph node occurs, the disease is then termed disseminated histiocytic sarcoma; this {{is more likely to}} occur unnoticed when primary lesions occur in cryptic sites (e.g. spleen, lung, and bone marrow). This latter form of HS is most like <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> (MH). MH is an aggressive, histiocytic neoplasm which arises in multiple sites simultaneously. Most lesions previously defined as MH are probably more correctly termed disseminated HS. The occurrence of true MH is difficult to establish because the lesions often occur in cryptic sites, and the existence of histiocytic neoplasia is only recognized after clinical signs have appeared and disease progression is advanced. HS and MH are capable of widespread metastasis, hence in time the 2 syndromes merge clinically and it is not always possible to differentiate true multicentric origin (MH) from widespread metastasis of disseminated HS. Also, it is never possible to know exactly how long the disease process has been operative. Hence, the perception is that both disseminated HS and MH follow a rapid clinical progression despite therapeutic intervention. This is certainly true once clinical signs are apparent, but the subclinical period is of unknown duration.|$|E

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2003. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 12 - 13). Tobey Jones, a 13 year-old male castrated Domestic Shorthair cat, {{presented to}} the Emergency Service at Cornell University Hospital for Animals for evaluation of dypsnea and acute onset, episodic open-mouth breathing. The cat's history included many months of inappetance, weight loss, and episodic, non-productive coughing. Physical examination revealed generalized poor body condition (body score: II/V), multiple skin nodules, and increased lung sounds. Cytology of multiple skin nodules and of pleural fluid showed a predominance of round cells with abundant cytoplasm. The morphologic of the round cells, combined {{with a history of}} pulmonary disease, lead to a cytologic diagnosis of <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> (MH). <b>Malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> (also termed disseminated histiocytic sarcoma) is a type of round cell tumor composed of antigen presenting cells of dendritic cell origin.

40|$|The authors {{determined}} the phenotypes of neoplastic cells in true histiocytic lymphoma and <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> {{by using a}} large panel of monoclonal antibodies and enzyme histochemistry procedures. Although the phenotypes overlapped slightly, the authors noted a distinct pattern in these tumors. The tumor cells of <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> generally expressed the monocyte markers CD 11 b, CD 11 c, CD 14, and CD 45, especially after induction with phorbol ester. In contrast, the tumor cells of true histiocytic lymphoma exhibited a marker expression {{very similar to that}} of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease. These cells expressed markers CD 30, 2 H 9, and 1 A 2, but rarely expressed CD 11 b, CD 11 c, CD 14, or CD 45. Regardless of their cytologic features, the tumor cells from both types of histiocytic lymphoma exhibited diffuse nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase activities, and they expressed histiocyte markers CD 15, CD 68, LN 5, 1 E 9, and M 387 to varying degrees. The tumor cells from both lymphomas did not exhibit T- or B-cell markers, T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, or gene translation products, even when they were induced with phorbol ester. The phenotypic expression in these two histiocytic malignancies suggests that they are derived from different types of histiocytes, or from histiocytes in different stages of maturation or differentiation, or from histiocytes that have distinct mechanisms of tumorigenic transformation. The expression of circulating monocyte markers in <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> suggests that this tumor originates in monocytes or free histiocytes, whereas the phenotype of true histiocytic lymphoma is compatible with an origin in fixed histiocytes, which generally are devoid of the monocyte markers CD 11 b and CD 14...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Malignant {{fibrous histiocytoma}} (MFH) and <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> (MH) are {{neoplasms}} with different histologic appearances and consequently a different putative cell of origin. Recently, the biopsy and necropsy {{services at the}} University of Pennsylvania have seen many canine soft tissue sarcomas that have the gross and histologic appearances of both MH and MFH within the same animal. A retrospective histologic evaluation of 263 cases diagnosed originally as either MH or MFH reclassified these neoplasms into 77 cases that were exclusively MH, 1 10 cases exclusively MFH, and 76 cases with features of both MH and MFH. Age, sex, breed predispositions, and distribution of lesions in organs were remarkably similar between the two categories.

40|$|Hodgkin's {{mononuclear}} cells, Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells, and U- 937 and SU-DHL- 1 histocytic {{cell lines}} were induced to differentiate by phorbol ester in cultures. The phenotypes of cells {{were determined by}} a panel of antibodies specific for monocytes, histiocytes, and interdigitating reticulum cells. Before induction, SU-DHL- 1 cells and H-RS cells expressed similar markers, such as HeFi- 1, 2 H 9, 1 A 2, and 1 E 9. In addition, SU-DHL- 1 cells were also stained by Tac and Leu M 5. Other monocyte markers, including OK M 1, Co Mo 2, BRL Mo 1, BRL Mo 2, and Leu M 3 were consistently negative in both types of cells. After induction, SU-DHL- 1 cells conserved the same phenotype, but H-RS cells became negative for HeFi- 1, 1 A 2, and 2 H 9. The U- 937 cells expressed Leu M 1 and Co Mo 2 and became positive for Leu M 5, OK M 1, Co Mo 2, BRL Mo 2, 2 H 9, and 1 E 9 after phorbol ester induction. The U- 937 cells did not express HeFi- 1 or 1 A 2. The marker expression of H-RS cells, SU-DHL- 1 cells, and U- 937 cells were compared with those of histiocytes or interdigitating reticulum cells in lymphoid tissues and with neoplastic cells in true histiocytic lymphoma and <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis.</b> It is concluded that SU-DHL- 1, U- 937, and H-RS cells are derived from or most closely related to fixed histiocytes, free histiocytes, and interdigitating reticulum cells, respectively. Our study further confirms the diagnosis of SU-DHL- 1 as true histiocytic lymphoma but reveals that U- 937 is a case of <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> rather than the previously diagnosed histiocytic lymphoma. The phenotypes and induction properties of SU-DHL- 1 cells are quite different from those of U- 937 cells, which suggests that true histiocytic lymphoma and <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> are two distinct disease entities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A second histiocytic proliferative disorder, which resembled <b>malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> of man, was {{identified}} in 13 Bernese mountain dogs. <b>Malignant</b> <b>histiocytosis</b> was clearly distinct from systemic histiocytosis, which was reported {{earlier in this}} breed. Eleven cases involved male dogs. Ten dogs occurred {{in the same family}} line as the dogs afflicted with systemic histiocytosis. Clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary involvement was present in nine dogs. Neurological disturbances were present in five dogs. Anemia was observed in five dogs and was associated with prominent erythrophagocytosis in two instances. The clinical course was rapidly progressive. Necropsy examinations revealed that infiltrates were especially frequent in the lungs and hilar lymph nodes. Other lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and central nervous system were also frequently involved. Evidence for primary pulmonary involvement was present in seven dogs. The original diagnosis in seven cases was large cell anaplastic carcinoma of the lung by light microscopy only. The infiltrates were composed of large, pleo-morphic, phagocytic mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells which also manifested marked cytological atypia and numerous, frequently bizarre, mitotic figures.
