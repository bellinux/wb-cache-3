40|$|Complex {{network theory}} aims to model and analyze complex systems that consist of {{multiple}} and interdependent components. Among all studies on complex networks, topological structure analysis {{is of the}} most fundamental importance, as it represents a natural route to understand the dynamics, as well as to synthesize or optimize the functions, of networks. A broad spectrum of network structural patterns have been respectively reported in the past decade, such as communities, multipartites, hubs, authorities, outliers, bow ties, and others. Here, we show that most individual real-world networks demonstrate <b>multiplex</b> <b>structures.</b> That is, a multitude of known or even unknown (hidden) patterns can simultaneously situate in the same network, and moreover they may be overlapped and nested with each other to collaboratively form a heterogeneous, nested or hierarchical organization, in which different connective phenomena can be observed at different granular levels. In addition, we show that the <b>multiplex</b> <b>structures</b> hidden in exploratory networks can be well defined as well as effectively recognized within an unified framework consisting of a set of proposed concepts, models, and algorithms. Our findings provide a strong evidence that most real-world complex systems are driven by a combination of heterogeneous mechanisms that may collaboratively shape their ubiquitous <b>multiplex</b> <b>structures</b> as we observe currently. This work also contributes a mathematical tool for analyzing different sources of networks from a new perspective of unveiling <b>multiplex</b> <b>structures,</b> which will be beneficial to multiple disciplines including sociology, economics and computer science.

40|$|Network {{models of}} {{language}} {{have provided a}} way of linking cognitive processes to language structure. However, current approaches focus only on one linguistic relationship at a time, missing the complex multi-relational nature of language. In this work, we overcome this limitation by modelling the mental lexicon of English-speaking toddlers as a multiplex lexical network, i. e. a multi-layered network where N[*]=[*] 529 words/nodes are connected according to four relationship: (i) free association, (ii) feature sharing, (iii) co-occurrence, and (iv) phonological similarity. We investigate the topology of the resulting multiplex and then proceed to evaluate single layers and the full <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> {{on their ability to}} predict empirically observed age of acquisition data of English speaking toddlers. We find that the multiplex topology is an important proxy of the cognitive processes of acquisition, capable of capturing emergent lexicon structure. In fact, we show that the <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> is fundamentally more powerful than individual layers in predicting the ordering with which words are acquired. Furthermore, multiplex analysis allows for a quantification of distinct phases of lexical acquisition in early learners: while initially all the multiplex layers contribute to word learning, after about month 23 free associations take the lead in driving word acquisition...|$|E
40|$|We propose here a {{multiplex}} network {{approach to}} investigate simultaneously {{different types of}} dependency in complex data sets. In particular, we consider multiplex networks made of four layers corresponding respectively to linear, non-linear, tail, and partial correlations among a set of financial time series. We construct the sparse graph on each layer using a standard network filtering procedure, and we then analyse the structural properties of the obtained multiplex networks. The study of the time evolution of the multiplex constructed from financial data uncovers important changes in intrinsically multiplex properties of the network, and such changes are associated with periods of financial stress. We observe that some features are unique to the <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> {{and would not be}} visible otherwise by the separate analysis of the single-layer networks corresponding to each dependency measure.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} approach for bond percolation on multiplex networks {{and use it}} to determine the expected size of the giant connected component and the value of the critical bond occupation probability in these networks. We advocate the relevance of these tools to the modeling of multilayer robustness and contribute to the debate on whether any benefit is to be yielded from studying a full <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> as opposed to its monoplex projection, especially in the seemingly irrelevant case of a bond occupation probability that does not depend on the layer. Although we find that in many cases the predictions of our theory for multiplex networks coincide with previously derived results for monoplex networks, we also uncover the remarkable result that for a certain class of multiplex networks, well described by our theory, new critical phenomena occur as multiple percolation phase transitions are present. We provide an instance of this phenomenon in a multipex network constructed from London rail and European air transportation datasets. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

This permits the encapsulated data {{to have its own}} frame rate and be able to [...] "float around" [...] relative to the SDH/SONET frame structure and rate. This interleaving permits a very low latency for the encapsulated data. Data passing through equipment can be delayed by at most 32 microseconds (µs), compared to a frame rate of 125 µs; many competing protocols buffer the data during such transits for at least one frame or packet before sending it on. Extra padding is allowed for the multiplexed data to move within the overall framing, as the data is clocked at a different rate than the frame rate. The protocol is made more complex by the decision to permit this padding at most levels of the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>structure,</b> but it improves all-around performance.|$|R

40|$|Multiplex {{networks}} are representations of multilayer interconnected complex networks where the nodes {{are the same}} at every layer. They {{turn out to be}} good abstractions of the intricate connectivity of multimodal transportation networks, among other types of complex systems. One of the most important critical phenomena arising in such networks is the emergence of congestion in transportation flows. Here we prove analytically that the structure of multiplex networks can induce congestion for flows that otherwise will be decongested if the individual layers were not interconnected. We provide explicit equations for the onset of congestion and approximations that allow to compute this onset from individual descriptors of the individual layers. The observed cooperative phenomenon reminds the Braess' paradox in which adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. Similarly, in the <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure,</b> the efficiency in transportation can unbalance the transportation loads resulting in unexpected congestion. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|A key {{question}} in neuroscience {{is to understand}} how a rich functional repertoire of brain activity arises within relatively static networks of structurally connected neural populations: elucidating the subtle interactions between evoked "functional connectivity" and the underlying "structural connectivity" {{has the potential to}} address this. These structural-functional networks (and neural networks more generally) are more naturally described using a multilayer or multiplex network approach, in favour of standard single-layer network analyses that are more typically applied to such systems. In this letter, we address such issues by exploring important structure-function relations in the Macaque cortical network by modelling it as a duplex network that comprises an anatomical layer, describing the known (macro-scale) network topology of the Macaque monkey, and a functional layer derived from simulated neural activity. We investigate and characterize correlations between structural and functional layers, as system parameters controlling simulated neural activity are varied, by employing recently described multiplex network measures. Moreover, we propose a novel measure of multiplex structure-function clustering which allows us to investigate the emergence of functional connections that are distinct from the underlying cortical structure, and to highlight the dependence of <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> on the neural dynamical regime...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges in network science is to quantify the information encoded in complex network structures. Disentangling randomness from organizational principles is even more demanding when networks have a multiplex nature. Multiplex networks are multilayer systems of $N$ nodes that can be linked in multiple interacting and co-evolving layers. In these networks, relevant information might not be captured if the single layers were analyzed separately. Here we demonstrate that such partial analysis of layers fails to capture significant correlations between weights and topology of complex multiplex networks. To this end, we study two weighted multiplex co-authorship and citation networks involving the authors included in the American Physical Society. We show that in these networks weights are strongly correlated with <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure,</b> and provide empirical evidence in favor of the advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as multistrength and the inverse multiparticipation ratio. Finally, we introduce a theoretical framework based on the entropy of multiplex ensembles to quantify the information stored in multiplex networks that would remain undetected if the single layers were analyzed in isolation.

This multiplex network presents positive correlated multiplexity and a high similarity between layers, stemming both from standard similarity analyses as well as a core-periphery analyses of the different layers. We propose measures of systemic importance that fit the case in which banks are connected through an arbitrary number of layers (be it by instrument, maturity or a combination of both). Such measures allow for a decomposition of the global systemic importance index for any bank into the contributions of each of the sub-networks, providing a useful tool for banking regulators and supervisors in identifying tailored policy instruments. We use the dataset of exposures between large European banks to illustrate that both the methodology and the specific level of network aggregation matter in the determination of interconnectedness and thus in the policy making process...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{focused on}} the orthographic network of the English language; however a similar {{analysis}} can be conducted for the orthographic forms of other languages {{in order to determine}} if the overall network structure {{is similar to that of}} the English language, and examine if the network structure of these words also influence visual word recognition. Another possible future direction is to apply more advanced techniques from network science to analyze the overall structure of language as a multiplex network, where different layers in the multiplex represent different types of relations between words (e.g., semantic or phonological relationships). Indeed, there has been recent work focusing on representing the semantic and phonological relationships between words as a <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> to explain language development and acquisition in children (Stella et al. 2017; Stella et al. 2018), and to account for language deficits in aphasic patients (Castro and Stella 2018). Incorporating orthographic information as another layer in the language multiplex could allow language scientists to better study the interrelationship between the orthography and phonology of words, especially in languages with a less transparent orthographic script (e.g., English and French; Katz and Frost 1992), and could have implications for understanding impaired reading processes in dyslexia or improve literacy training programs for children learning to read.|$|E

The community of Complexity Science and especially those researchers working on multiplex social systems are devoting increasing efforts to outline general laws, models, and theories, to the purpose of predicting emergent phenomena in SN's (e. g. success of a product). On the other side the semantic web community aims at engineering a new generation of advanced services tailored to specific people needs. This implies defining constructs, models and methods for handling the semantic layer of SNs. We combined models and techniques from both the former fields to provide a hybrid approach to understand a basic (yet complex) phenomenon: the propagation of individual interests along the social networks.

40|$|Multiplex {{networks}} {{consist of}} a fixed set of nodes connected by several sets of edges which are generated separately and correspond to different networks ("layers"). Here, a simple variant of the Ising model on multiplex networks with two layers is considered, with spins located in the nodes and edges corresponding to ferromagnetic interactions between them. Critical temperatures for the ferromagnetic transition are evaluated for the layers {{in the form of}} random Erdös-Rényi graphs or heterogeneous scale-free networks using the mean-field approximation and the replica method, from the replica symmetric solution. Both methods require the use of different "partial" magnetizations, associated with different layers of the multiplex network, and yield qualitatively similar results. If the layers are strongly heterogeneous the critical temperature differs noticeably from that for the Ising model on a network being a superposition of the two layers, evaluated in the mean-field approximation neglecting the effect of the underlying <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure</b> on the correlations between the degrees of nodes. The critical temperature evaluated from the replica symmetric solution depends sensitively on the correlations between the degrees of nodes in different layers and shows satisfactory quantitative agreement with that obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The critical behavior of the magnetization for the model with strongly heterogeneous layers can depend on the distributions of the degrees of nodes and is then determined by the properties of the most heterogeneous layer.

40|$|Elites are {{subgroups of}} {{individuals}} within {{a society that}} have the ability and means to influence, lead, govern, and shape societies. Members of elites are often well connected individuals, which enables them to impose their influence to many and to quickly gather, process, and spread information. Here we argue that elites are not only composed of highly connected individuals, but also of intermediaries connecting hubs to form a cohesive and structured elite-subgroup {{at the core of}} a social network. For this purpose we present a generalization of the $K$-core algorithm that allows to identify a social core that is composed of well-connected hubs together with their `connectors'. We show the validity of the idea in the framework of a virtual world defined by a massive multiplayer online game, on which we have complete information of various social networks. Exploiting this <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure,</b> we find that the hubs of the generalized $K$-core identify those individuals that are high social performers in terms of a series of indicators that are available in the game. In addition, using a combined strategy which involves the generalized $K$-core and the recently introduced $M$-core, the elites of the different 'nations' present in the game are perfectly identified as modules of the generalized $K$-core. Interesting sudden shifts in the composition of the elite cores are observed at deep levels. We show that elite detection with the traditional $K$-core is not possible in a reliable way. The proposed method might be useful in a series of more general applications, such as community detection. Comment: 13 figures, 3 tables, 19 pages. Accepted for publication in PLoS ON...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{multilayer}} networks {{is in its}} early stages, and its development provides vital methods for understanding complex systems. Multilayer networks, in their multiplex form, have been introduced within {{the last three years}} to analysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have modelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial institutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a non-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising the same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No mechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically evaluated, and no multichannel stabilisation strategies for pre-emptive contagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an interconnected <b>multiplex</b> <b>structure,</b> and a contagion mechanism among financial institutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity within different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial market. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and resilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion mechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost stabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their interconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion progressing through the overall structure. The stabilisation strategies subtly affect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural resilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each institution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate the new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential Regulatory Authority of the Bank of England. The capabilities of multichannel stabilisation are confirmed empirically. Comment: 35 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 35 equation...|$|E

40|$|Naval {{ships are}} some of the most complex systems ever engineered. The process by which they are {{designed}} is similarly complex. The complexity and disjointedness of this process leads to the creation of disparate and incomplete ship design information created by different systems of analysis, completed by different design groups, using different tools, at different levels of fidelity. Distributed system design decisions based off this disparate and incomplete information lead to unnecessary complexity when the design is transitioned from the early design stage to the detailed design stage. This dissertation presents novel network theory-based methods for better understanding and analyzing the implications of early stage distributed system design decisions. This new method introduces network theory concepts such as degree distribution, system interdependence, and community to the field of distributed systems design as metrics for determining system robustness, as well as develops new techniques for representing physical systems as networks. Additionally, a personnel movement modeling and analysis method, derived from the network concept of betweenness centrality, is developed. This dissertation documents the first use of multislice and <b>multiplex</b> <b>structures</b> in the analysis of physical systems. System design evolutions are analyzed using multislice network structures and the interactions between systems are investigated using <b>multiplex</b> network <b>structures.</b> These two structures are combined into a novel time-dependent <b>multiplex</b> network <b>structure</b> that is developed in this work.
