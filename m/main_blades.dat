40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation on the aerodynamic performance {{according to the}} application of splitter blades in an impeller of a centrifugal fan used for a refuse collection system. Numerical analysis of a centrifugal fan {{was carried out by}} solving three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model. A validation of numerical results was conducted by comparison with experimental data for the pressure and efficiency. From analyses of the internal flow field of the reference fan, the losses by the reverse-flows were observed in the region of the blade passage. In order to reduce these losses and enhance fan performance, two splitter blades were applied evenly between the <b>main</b> <b>blades,</b> and centrifugal impellers having the different numbers of the <b>main</b> <b>blades</b> were tested with their application. Throughout the numerical analyses of the centrifugal fan with splitter blades, {{it was found that the}} reverse-flow regions in the blade passage can be reduced by controlling the main blade numbers with splitter blades. The application of splitter blades in a centrifugal fan leads to significant improvement in the overall fan performance...|$|E

The equations are solved in steadily rotating reference frames and the centrifugal and the Coriolis force terms are included as source terms. The resulting computational procedure is validated for liquid rocket engine analysis and applied subsequently to analyze a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the instabilities inception in a transonic centrifugal com-pressor for different rotation speeds. The analysis was conducted from experimental results obtained with unsteady pressure sensors implanted in the inducer, vaneless diffuser and vaned diffuser. Beyond the stability limit the compressor enters into a deep surge without any precursor, whatever the speed. The surge process is initiated in the vaned diffuser by a massive boundary layer separation. For low speeds, together with the surge which remains triggered in the diffuser, aerodynamic instabilities are detected in the inducer. These instabilities can be understood as “tip clearance rotating disturbances” because they are generated at {{the leading edge of the}} impeller <b>main</b> <b>blades</b> and move along the tip clearance trajectory...|$|E

40|$|In turbochargers {{for diesel}} engines, a high {{pressure}} ratio {{and a wide}} operating range are required to achieve extremely low exhaust emissions. In the present study, the ring groove arrangement was adopted to enhance a operating flow range in a centrifugal compressor for automobile turbochargers. The upstream groove was located at the casing wall of the suction pipe and the downstream groove was located at the shroud casing wall near {{the leading edge of}} the splitter blades, where both grooves were connected by an annular bypass. According to the numerical results by using ANSYS-CFX, it becomes clear that the ring groove arrangement is effective for suppression of separation at the leading-edge of <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> even in small flow rates. The reverse flow zone on the shroud casing is sucked out from downstream groove and the flow incidence at the <b>main</b> <b>blade</b> leading edge is reduced successfully by about 5 degrees due to the increased incoming flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Centrifugal {{slurry pumps}} {{are a very}} unique {{turbomachine}} that {{must be able to}} handle the flow of high concentrations of solid particles which greatly accelerate wear. With Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), it is possible to accurately simulate the flow through such pumps to predict performance. A centrifugal slurry pump was simulated using water and results were validated with physical test results which also used water. Validation yielded good correlation where the most efficient flow rate was predicted correctly. With the confirmed CFD model, design changes were made to the pump to incorporate splitter blades which are shorter versions of the <b>main</b> <b>blades.</b> Optimization using the Adaptive Response Surface Method algorithm with an Intelligent Space Exploration Strategy was performed to find the optimum splitter configuration to minimize wear in the pump impeller. The optimum splitter configuration yielded an almost 19 % decrease in the wear with a slight increase in efficiency...|$|E
40|$|To {{support the}} design {{effort of the}} Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) Fuel Pump Stage, viscous flow {{calculations}} were performed in a centrifugal impeller with splitter blades. These calculations were carried out with a Navier-Stokes solver (MINT), which employs a linearized block-implicit Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) procedure to iteratively solve a finite difference form {{of the system of}} conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy in body-fitted coordinates. A computational grid was generated algebraically for the 'channel' between two <b>main</b> <b>blades</b> of the impeller and extended both upstream of the impeller inlet and downstream of the impeller exit so that the appropriate boundary conditions could be applied. The results of the calculations show that although the overall level of flow distortion near the impeller exit is not very large, there is a noticeable difference between the flow patterns in the two 'passages' (one passage between the pressure side of the splitter blade and the suction side of the next full blade) ...|$|E

40|$|Splitter vanes are additional, smaller {{airfoils}} {{that are}} placed circumferentially between the <b>main</b> <b>blades</b> of a compressor rotor. They {{have been used}} for decades in centrifugal rotors, and have been shown to improve overall performance in terms of pressure ratio and efficiency. Wennerstrom (circa 1974) was the first to use the splitter concept in an axial-flow rotor. His experiments indicated that in addition to the known benefits from centrifugal rotors, the splitters would also improve flow control in the axial flow when operating at off-design conditions. In spite of these potential benefits, there has been no known commercial application of the splittered axial rotor. The goal of this project is to determine if splitter vanes can be successfully utilized in a commercial gas turbine engine. If so, it would allow designers to use fewer stages in a compressor, thus reducing both manufacturing and operating costs of the engine. The first portion of the project will involve an extensive numerical study of various 2 -D geometries. Pertinent parameters include the shape and position of the splitter vane relative to the main rotor blades. 3 -D meshes will be used in the latter stages of the project...|$|E
