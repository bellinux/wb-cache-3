5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E
5|$|The Hamsa mendicants are {{constantly}} on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E

5|$|The Upanishad {{states that}} Kutichaka monks eat eight <b>mouthfuls</b> <b>of</b> food a day. Prominent ancient Rishis (sages) who {{illustrate}} the Kutichaka group are Gotama, Bharadwaja, Yajnavalkya, and Vasishta.|$|R
25|$|Blackeye gobies are diurnal, being {{primarily}} active during daytime. They feed {{almost exclusively}} on small crustaceans and mollusks. The most common prey include amphipods, copepods, isopods, decapods (particularly hermit crabs), snails, and clams. Other less important prey include annelids and other invertebrates. Parts of echinoderms (mostly sea urchins) and bryozoans are {{also found in the}} contents of the stomachs of blackeye gobies, though this is likely the result of incidental ingestion rather than true predation. The preferred prey can vary by season depending on their abundance. Blackeye gobies have also been observed feeding directly on chemosynthetic bacterial mats. It is of particular significance if substantiated, as {{it would be the first}} known instance of a fish deriving nutrition directly from chemosynthetic bacteria. Blackeye gobies feed mostly by simply picking off the prey directly from the substrate. Occasionally, they may feed by taking a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> substrate, spitting it out, then picking off edible prey as it drifts to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are sucked up {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{multiple}} angles and takes required for a single <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> food, Meyer offered a bounty of $20 per every shot of a character eating. For Shatner, the incentive was enough that he became the only cast member to consume purple-dyed squid. The shoot lasted several days because of what Plummer called the [...] "horror" [...] of filming the dinner.|$|E

500|$|Radalj was {{not happy}} with Rendall's leaving or Faulkner's greater {{influence}} and left the Gurus. He was replaced by ex-Fun Things guitarist Brad Shepherd, who had been Bramley's flatmate. Bramley and Shepherd had both been in The Hitmen and Super K. Faulkner wrote [...] "I Want You Back" [...] in response to Radalj's public dissatisfaction with the Gurus. Radalj went on to perform {{with a number of}} other acts, including The Johnnys, Love Rodeo, The Dubrovniks and Roddy Ray'Da & the Surfin' Caesars. As Roddy Ray'Da, he released Lost, Lonely and Vicious in 1990, Orgazmatazz a year later and <b>Mouthful</b> <b>of</b> Chicken in 1993.|$|E

500|$|Just as Cet is exulting in {{his victory}} over the full warrior {{contingent}} of Ulster present, the Ulster hero Conall Cernach enters the hostel, and leaps {{into the middle of}} the hall to roars of welcome from the Ulaid. Cet and Conall acknowledge each other in an exchange of archaic rhetorical verses, and Cet concedes that Conall is a better warrior than he. Cet adds that his brother Anlúan would best Conall in a contest: It is our misfortune that he is not in the house.' 'Oh but he is,' said Conall, and taking Anlúan's head from his wallet he threw it at Cet's breast so that a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> blood spattered over the lips." ...|$|E

So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> a cheesecake or something like that." [...] In the aftermath of the 60 Minutes broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in The Independent, [...] "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".|$|E
50|$|One final {{perception}} on {{the idea}} of unit came from linguist Eugene Nida. To him, translation units have a tendency to be small groups of language building up into sentences, thus forming what he called meaningful <b>mouthfuls</b> <b>of</b> language.|$|R

It was from this fight that he gained the nickname [...] "Tiger".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid to}} late 1990s, {{platinum}} replaced gold as {{the metal}} of choice in hip hop fashion.

Platinum fronts also became popular; Cash Money Records executive/rapper Brian [...] "Baby" [...] Williams has an entire <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> permanent platinum teeth.

As a result, she says countless adults and most children in the U.S. [...] "have never once had a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> genuinely wholesome food."

2500|$|Burgess's {{interest}} in language {{was reflected in}} the invented, Anglo-Russian teen slang of A Clockwork Orange (Nadsat), and in the movie Quest for Fire (1981), for which he invented a prehistoric language (Ulam) for the characters. His interest is reflected in his characters. In The Doctor is Sick, Dr Edwin Spindrift is a lecturer in linguistics who escapes from a hospital ward which is peopled, as the critic Saul Maloff put it in a review, with [...] "brain cases who happily exemplify varieties of English speech." [...] Burgess, who had lectured on phonetics at the University of Birmingham in the late 1940s, investigates the field of linguistics in Language Made Plain and A <b>Mouthful</b> <b>of</b> Air.|$|E
2500|$|He {{subsequently}} {{progressed to}} Formula Libre and bought himself {{a dark blue}} Lotus 24. With this car he won the Gold Flake Trophy at Leinster and a race at Phoenix Park, and encouraged by this success, decided to move up to Formula One. He drove to Sicily with one mechanic in a VW pickup, having entered the 1964 Mediterranean Grand Prix at the Autodromo di Pergusa. In practice, having posted the eighth fastest time and outqualifying his closest rival Peter Revson by a second, Gubby's Lotus suffered a wheel failure and he crashed heavily through chainlink fencing. [...] "Lotuses were always falling apart... I ended up upside down in the woods, cocooned in wire with a <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> leaves and grass," [...] he recalled. He was able to disconnect the battery to help prevent a fire, and some Italian mechanics {{arrived on the scene}} to cut him free, but he was unable {{to take part in the}} race. The wheel that failed was one that he had obtained from the BRP team after one of his own wheels had developed a crack.|$|E
