500|$|At {{one time}} the river's {{watershed}} was dominated by grassland mostly consisting of Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. Cottonwoods, quaking aspen, maple, and alder formed the riparian zone along the Potlatch River. In the foothills, a meadow steppe environment abounding with black hawthorn, snowberry and small conifers flourished, while {{along the banks of}} smaller tributaries, hawthorn and <b>mock</b> <b>orange</b> grew. Camas and forbs thrived in the thinly distributed seasonal wetlands along the river and its larger tributary creeks. The forests were mainly a mix of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine, interspersed with rare stands of grand fir, western redcedar, western white pine, and larch, and an understory of oceanspray, ninebark, serviceberry, wild rose and snowberry. Wildfires burned through the watershed from time to time, clearing the way for new growth. After human intervention, these vegetation communities continued to persist, but in lesser numbers, and the grasslands have mostly been wiped out by farming.

5000|$|In 1961 she {{reactivated}} {{the rose}} breeding program in Ottawa {{aimed to develop}} completely winter-hardy, recurrent-flowering varieties. [...] She also sought varieties resistant to black spot and mildew, and ones with good ornamental features of flower and shrub. The rose varieties available in Canada in 1961 could not survive without winter protection outside the warmer conditions of southern Ontario (Niagara Peninsula) and the coast of British Columbia. Armed with patience and determination, Dr. Svejda managed to succeed in developing a first variety with these characteristics after 8 years. In 1968 she launched the first national trial of ornamental shrubs in Canada whereby she sent her roses and other plants to locations across North America to test their survival rates in local climates. The Explorer rose series includes 25 different varieties released between 1968 and 1999; 13 developed during her career, the remainder developed by the program after her retirement. The Explorer Roses are winter hardy, recurrent-flowering, disease-resistant plants that have {{made their way into}} park gardens and backyards all over Canada. Some of the hardier cultivars are also grown in Finland, Russia, Iceland, Germany and her homeland of Austria, and have been adapted by others for harsh climates such as the Nevada desert.The Explorer Roses include: Alexander Mackenzie, Captain Samuel Holland, Champlain (a bush rose that flowers throughout the summer and fall), Charles Albanel, David Thompson, De Montarville, Frontenac, George Vancouver, Henry Hudson, Henry Kelsey, J.P.
