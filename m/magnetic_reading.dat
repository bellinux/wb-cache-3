40|$|International audienceThe {{magnetoresistance}} (MR) {{effect is}} widely used in technologies that pervade the world, from <b>magnetic</b> <b>reading</b> heads to sensors. Diverse contributions to MR, such as anisotropic, giant, tunnel, colossal, and spin-Hall, are revealed in materials depending on the specific system and measuring configuration. Half-metallic manganites hold promise for spintronic applications but the complexity of competing interactions has not permitted the understanding and control of their magnetotransport properties to enable the realization of their technological potential. This study reports {{on the ability to}} induce a dominant switchable magnetoresistance in La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 epitaxial films at room temperature (RT). By engineering an extrinsic magnetic anisotropy, a large enhancement of anisotropic magne-toresistance (AMR) is achieved which at RT leads to signal changes much larger than the other contributions such as the colossal magnetoresist-ance. The dominant extrinsic AMR exhibits large variation in the resistance in low field region, showing high sensitivity to applied low magnetic fields.

40|$|Low-field {{magnetoresistance}} is {{an effective}} and energy-saving way to use half-metallic materials in <b>magnetic</b> <b>reading</b> heads and magnetic random access memory. Common spin-polarized materials with low field magnetoresistance effect are perovskite-type manganese, cobalt, and molybdenum oxides. In this study, we report {{a new type of}} spinel cobaltite materials, self-assembled nanocrystalline NiCo 2 O 4, which shows large low field magnetoresistance as large as – 19. 1 % at 0. 5 T and – 50 % at 9 T (2 K). The large low field magnetoresistance is attributed to the fast magnetization rotation of the core nanocrystals. The surface spin-glass is responsible for the observed weak saturation of magnetoresistance under high fields. Our calculation demonstrates that the half-metallicity of NiCo 2 O 4 comes from the hopping eg electrons within the tetrahedral Co-atoms and the octahedral Ni-atoms. The discovery of large low-field magnetoresistance in simple spinel oxide NiCo 2 O 4, a non-perovskite oxide, leads to an extended family of low-field magnetoresistance materials.

40|$|With the advancements in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies, {{magnetic}} and inertial sensors {{are becoming}} more and more accurate, lightweight, smaller in size as well as low-cost, which in turn boosts their applications in human movement analysis. However, challenges still exist in the field of sensor orientation estimation, where magnetic disturbance represents one of the obstacles limiting their practical application. The objective of this paper is to systematically analyze exactly how magnetic disturbances affects the attitude and heading estimation for a magnetic and inertial sensor. First, we reviewed four major components dealing with magnetic disturbance, namely decoupling attitude estimation from <b>magnetic</b> <b>reading,</b> gyro bias estimation, adaptive strategies of compensating magnetic disturbance and sensor fusion algorithms. We review and analyze the features of existing methods of each component. Second, to understand each component in magnetic disturbance rejection, four representative sensor fusion methods were implemented, including gradient descent algorithms, improved explicit complementary filter, dual-linear Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter. Finally, a new standardized testing procedure has been developed to objectively assess the performance of each method against magnetic disturbance. Based upon the testing results, the strength and weakness of the existing sensor fusion methods were easily examined, and suggestions were presented for selecting a proper sensor fusion algorithm or developing new sensor fusion method...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} Turbo codes pushes the system {{performance}} {{close to the}} Shannon limit and the iterative decoding algorithm used in turbo-decoding attracts {{a lot of research}} interest in recent years. To reduce the decoding delay, several decoding algorithm based on different graphic models are proposed: a class of iterative decoding algorithm based on the Tanner graph or its extension; an iterative decoding algorithm as a belief propagation over the Bayesian network; sum product algorithm over factor graph. Very recently, Mow proposed a new graphic model, hypertrellis, which generalizes both the trellis and the factor graph. The hypertrellis can overcome the inefficiency of Tanner graph in representing non-binary codes. The connectivity of hypertrellis facilitates the visualization of the code structure at the codeword level, which is not available in factor graph. Furthermore, a fully parallel iterative decoding (FPID) algorithm based on hypertrellis can achieve a very high degree of parallelism to reduce the decoding delay. Channel decoders are traditionally implemented in digital VLSI to achieve sufficient numerical accuracy, as well as to make full use of powerful and mature design tools. Recent researchers have shown that analog VLSI implementation of decoders is an attractive approach for high speed applications, like <b>magnetic</b> <b>reading</b> and equalization. In addition, analog decoders could achieve better power and area efficiency than digital decoders could. In this thesis, we discussed the analog integrated circuit implementation of hypertrellis decoders with FPID and proposed a system structure with inherent 2 -stage pipeline to enhance speed as well as testability. A quaternary single check (5, 4) hypertrellis analog decoder is designed to demonstrate those proposed ideas. Computation is performed at 50 M symbol per second in cascode current mode signal processing efficient routing, accuracy and speed.

When operated at high source-drain bias, the magnetoresistance of our devices increases almost linearly with magnetic field, reaching nearly 10 000 % at 8 T, thus surpassing many known nonmagnetic materials that exhibit giant NLMR. The temperature dependence and mobility analysis indicate that the NLMR has a purely classical origin, driven by nanoscale inhomogeneities.

In shingled writing, we can designate either side of the written track as the remaining side due to the progressive scan. In this work, erase band width reduction was accomplished by optimization of the skew. A track pitch decrease of 7 % was measured due to skew angle control alone.

Unlikely taken branches are dynamically eliminated from the detector, decreasing its complexity by roughly 50 % with negligible penalty in signal to noise ratio. The resulting detector consists of four four-way, three threeway, three two-way ACS units and one adder that are dynamically assigned to 14 states of the detector. 1...|$|R
