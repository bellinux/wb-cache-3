50|$|Machine vises {{are mounted}} on drill presses, {{grinding}} machines and milling machines. Abrasive chop saws {{have a special}} type of <b>machine</b> <b>vise</b> built into the saw. Some hobbyists use a <b>machine</b> <b>vise</b> as a bench vise because of the low cost and small size.|$|E
50|$|In metalworking, a dead {{blow hammer}} {{can be used}} to {{properly}} seat the workpiece against parallels in a <b>machine</b> <b>vise.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{surface grinder}} is {{composed}} of an abrasive wheel, a workholding device known as a chuck, and a reciprocating or rotary table. The chuck holds the material in place while it is being worked on. It can do this one of two ways: ferromagnetic pieces are {{held in place by}} a magnetic chuck, while non-ferromagnetic and nonmetallic pieces are held in place by vacuum or mechanical means. A <b>machine</b> <b>vise</b> (made from ferromagnetic steel or cast iron) placed on the magnetic chuck can be used to hold non-ferromagnetic workpieces if only a magnetic chuck is available.|$|E

50|$|A {{leadscrew}} (or lead screw), {{also known}} as a power screw or translation screw, is a screw used as a linkage in a machine, to translate turning motion into linear motion. Because of the large area of sliding contact between their male and female members, screw threads have larger frictional energy losses compared to other linkages. They are not typically used to carry high power, but more for intermittent use in low power actuator and positioner mechanisms. Common applications are linear actuators, machine slides (such as in <b>machine</b> tools), <b>vises,</b> presses, and jacks.|$|R
50|$|Parallels {{are used}} in {{machining}} operations, be it milling, drilling, turning or sometimes grinding. The most common use is to support work when {{it is in a}} vise or clamped to the machine bed. If a workpiece is too small to be <b>machined</b> in a <b>vise</b> without it being in contact with all three faces of the vice - parallels can be used either side to give clearance from the vise, and to give support from underneath to eliminate the workpiece being pushed down by the force of the cutting tool.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{focus on}} the {{description}} of the device, that provides a work material clamped in the universal <b>machine</b> <b>vise</b> on machine tools with numerical control basing on three surfaces forming the coordinate angle. The use of device helps reduce the technological operation time by eliminating the need of resetting a machine for connecting a work material coordinate system to the machine coordinate system...|$|E
40|$|The subject "Mechanical {{engineering}} {{experiments and}} practice Ⅲ" was renamed from "Manufacturing practice Ⅲ" with {{modification of the}} contents in practice subject and it applied to the students who enter department of engineering in Apr. 2000 as a freshman. The aim of this modification is to introduce creative and experimental elements into practice subject. For this purpose, the new practice subject has one continuous operation which consisted of design, production and experiment. Here, I report the case study when small <b>machine</b> <b>vise</b> {{was used as a}} teaching material for 3 rd grade of the students...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{a change}} of an existing surface grinding technology for a more effective technology of face milling for the finishing operation of the jaw (for a hydraulic <b>machine</b> <b>vise)</b> in a tempered state with hardness of 53 + 4 HRC. The jaw is made of tool steel according to the Czech standard CSN 41 9312. Two new versions are proposed for the new technology. Progressive cutting materials are listed for milling. A suitable tool is selected. Total production costs and machine times for cutting conditions of the chosen tool are predicted. In the experimental part, the cutting conditions are verified in practice...|$|E
