5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the <b>millinery</b> business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. <b>Millinery</b> was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns are {{considered}} threatened or {{a species of}} concern in certain states. They are also among the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. The species reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the <b>millinery</b> trade. Exploitation continues today in western Greenland, where {{the population of the}} species has been reduced greatly since 1950.|$|E
5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and <b>millinery.</b> The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E
50|$|In Spring 2009, fashion {{retailer}} Intermix started carrying some of Yestadt <b>Millinery's</b> designs. Later {{that same}} year, a model wore a hat of Yestadt's at {{a photo shoot}} with Alister Mackie, then stylist for Marc by Marc Jacobs, and the design caught the stylist's eye. This resulted in a collaboration with Marc by Marc Jacobs that significantly raised Yestadt's profile.|$|R

5|$|Unknown biotoxins, pathogens, and the {{impairment}} of feather waterproofing {{can lead to}} hypothermia and avian cholera. Since this grebe usually winters on the coast, it is also vulnerable to oil pollution. Large-scaled deaths (such as 150,000 birds on the Salton Sea in 1992) from erysipelas, avian cholera and avian botulism have been recorded {{in the past and}} could threaten the species. These and other factors, such as human disturbance, including collisions with power transmission lines, contribute to declining populations in certain areas. This species used to be threatened in North America by the <b>millinery</b> industry, which helped facilitate the hunting of the birds, and egg collectors. Although this is true, this grebe is hunted in the Gilan Province in Iran, for both commercial and recreational purposes. However, there is no evidence suggesting that these threats could result in a significant risk for the overall population.|$|E

5000|$|In the beginning, the Head-of-the-Lake (Present day Hamilton) {{was covered}} in forest. In 1815 a {{chopping}} mill became the first industry in the area. Growth of the area was aided in 1827 by a channel cut to link Burlington Bay directly with Lake Ontario, thus improving its marine transportation. In 1833, George Hamilton's settlement was incorporated as a police village. On January 8, 1833 the Legislature passed a further act [...] "To define {{the limits of the}} Town of Hamilton, in the District of Gore, and to establish a Police and public market therein." [...] When the Town of Hamilton was incorporated in 1833, one of the first orders of business, after a closely fought election where 3 out of the 4 candidates had no opposition, was to find a suitable place for the town board to meet. For the first few years they made do with meeting in local taverns such as Thomas Wilson's Inn on the corner of John and Jackson Streets. Also in 1833 (February 16), The Garland, a local newspaper, published a synopsis, Hamilton contained [...] "about one hundred and twenty dwelling houses and upward of one thousand inhabitants" [...] and then went on to list 4 public buildings, 7 taverns, 16 stores, 2 watchmakers, 2 saddlers, 4 merchant tailors, 4 cabinet makers, 4 boot and shoe makers, 2 bakers, 4 newspapers, 1 druggist, 1 tin and sheet iron manufactory, 1 hatter and 3 <b>millineries.</b>|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} the retail trade of Besançon adapted to {{changing}} patterns of demand. In particular, it will focus on the development of the trade in luxury goods, <b>millineries</b> and second-hand objects. What were the products comprising the luxury and semi-luxury trade? What was the importance of the latter? What was the impact of Parisian fashions on the supply of Besançon tradesmen? What products were available second hand? What was the relative prevalence of old/used goods and new/novel goods on the Besançon market? These questions can be addressed via analysis of the post-mortem inventories of tradesmen dying during the first half of the nineteenth century, which contain detailed descriptions of their stock-in-trade. In spite of certain obvious gaps (they do not, for example, inform us about the date of acquisition of a product or its source), inventories provide a wealth of information on the goods stocked by retailers (including price, quantity, size, form, material, colour and quality) and, in some cases, even give the final use and destination of the object (linen to produce mattresses, sheets for trousers and so on). In addition, local and regional newspapers are replete with commercial advertisements and opinions: information on the arrival of new products in store, those objects which were ‘en vogue' or the latest technical innovations available. Such data provide a better understanding of the diversity of products in circulation, the passing and renewal of fashions, and the practices of tradesmen as well as – to a certain extent – those of consumers...|$|R
25|$|Coco Chanel thus {{could sell}} {{to them the}} hats she {{designed}} and made; she thus earned a living, independent of her financial sponsor, the socialite Balsan. In the course of those salons Coco Chanel befriended Arthur ‘Boy’ Capel, an English socialite and polo player friend of Étienne Balsan; per the upper class social custom, Chanel also became mistress to Boy Capel. Despite that social circumstance, Boy Capel perceived the businesswoman innate to Coco Chanel, and, in 1910, financed her first independent <b>millinery</b> shop, Chanel Modes, at 21 rue Cambon, Paris. Because that locale already housed a dress shop, the business-lease limited Chanel to selling only <b>millinery</b> products, not couture. Two years later, in 1913, the Deauville and Biarritz couture shops of Coco Chanel offered for sale prêt-à-porter sports clothes for women, the practical designs of which allowed the wearer to play sport.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Chanel {{launched}} the Chance perfume and Paraffection, a subsidiary company originally established in 1997 to support artisanal manufacturing, that gathered together Ateliers d’Art or workshops including Desrues for ornamentation and buttons, Lemarié for feathers, Lesage for embroidery, Massaro for shoemaking and Michel for <b>millinery.</b> A prêt-à-porter collection {{was designed by}} Karl Lagerfeld.|$|E
25|$|Also {{established}} in 1919 was the Negro Factories Corporation, with a capitalization of one million dollars. It generated income and provided around 700 jobs by its numerous enterprises: three grocery stores, two restaurants, a laundry, a tailor shop, a dressmaking shop, a <b>millinery</b> store, a printing company and doll factory. However, most {{went out of}} business by 1922.|$|E

25|$|After Cassatt's {{parents and}} sister Lydia joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, Degas, Cassatt, and Lydia were often {{to be seen}} at the Louvre {{studying}} art works together. Degas produced two prints, notable for their technical innovation, depicting Cassatt at the Louvre looking at art works while Lydia reads a guidebook. These were destined for a prints journal planned by Degas (together with Camille Pissarro and others), which never came to fruition. Cassatt frequently posed for Degas, notably for his <b>millinery</b> series trying on hats.|$|E
25|$|The House of Chanel (Chanel S.A.) {{originated}} in 1909, when Gabrielle Chanel opened a <b>millinery</b> shop at 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, {{the ground floor}} of the Parisian flat of the socialite and textile businessman Étienne Balsan, of whom she was mistress. Because the Balsan flat also was a salon for the French hunting and sporting élite, Chanel had opportunity to meet their demi-mondaine mistresses, who, as such, were women of fashion, upon whom the rich men displayed their wealth — as ornate clothes, jewelry, and hats.|$|E

25|$|Adding to the {{uncertainties}} for the CIO was {{its own internal}} disarray. When the CIO formally established itself as a rival to the AFL in 1938, renaming itself as the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the ILGWU and the <b>Millinery</b> Workers left the CIO {{to return to the}} AFL. Lewis feuded with Hillman and Philip Murray, his long-time assistant and head of the SWOC, over both the CIO's own activities and its relations with the FDR administration.

In 1912, the 14-year-old joined the Furriers Union of the United States and Canada, which changed its name a year later to the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada (IFWU).

25|$|The Joseph Joseph House is a stucco house {{located at}} 105 North Eighth Avenue. It {{was built in}} 1925 and first lived in by Joseph Joseph, an early Jewish settler.

25|$|The Maryland Legislature was {{controlled}} by farmers in rural counties who were short on labor and feared that education would draw blacks away from the farm. The school's 1911–1912 catalog {{emphasized the importance of}} teaching skills to black students–carpentry, painting, blacksmithing, plastering, papering, and shoemaking for the men, and domestic science, sewing and <b>millinery</b> work for the women. The school also aimed to prepare black teachers. The academic curriculum was equal to the ordinary high school course, with English, arithmetic, algebra, history, geography, music, government, physics, botany, and Latin or German. There were six teachers; Mrs. Goodloe taught music.|$|E
25|$|Historian Rita Heller, who {{conducted}} {{a survey of the}} students in 1982, found that while some of the respondents were ambivalent about the program's usefulness, most credited it with improving their self-image and social skills and believed the school had helped them advance in their careers. Many went on to take leadership positions in their communities, churches, and trade unions. Elizabeth Nord became chairman of the New England Silk and Rayon Workers Union; Carmen Lucia became vice president of the United Hatters, Cap and <b>Millinery</b> Workers International Union; and Rose Finkelstein Norwood led the Boston chapter of the Women's Trade Union League.|$|E
25|$|It {{first became}} {{popular in the}} mid 19th century and was named after the French empress Eugénie de Montijo, a fashion {{trendsetter}} whose taste was much admired and copied. In the early 1930s an adapted version worn by Greta Garbo in the film Romance inspired a wave of similar styles. By 1932, the feather-trimmed small hat had become ubiquitous and was widely criticised by the press – especially in the United States – with some commentators predicting its rapid demise. Despite the criticisms, its tilted shape and jaunty feather trim influenced <b>millinery</b> styles for the succeeding decade.|$|E
25|$|Among the <b>millinery</b> {{innovations}} Saint-Cyr {{is said to}} have devised, {{were the}} oblique hat – in which one side of the brim is angled, enabling decorative details to be placed on the crown. The oblique-brim hat has remained a favoured style for the Queen. She was also among the leading exponents of the 'cocktail hat' that came into vogue during the wartime years – this was typically a confection involving black silk and netting that could be worn with eveningwear. In the 1950s, she helped to revive the fashion for the draped turban producing a supple felt design in 1956 that covered the ears and rose to a peak {{at the back of the}} head.|$|E
