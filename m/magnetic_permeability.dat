25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability,</b> while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E

25|$|Para{{magnetism}} {{is a form}} of magnetism whereby certain {{materials are}} weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field, and form internal, induced magnetic fields {{in the direction of the}} applied magnetic field. In contrast with this behavior, diamagnetic materials are repelled by magnetic fields and form induced magnetic fields in the direction opposite to that of the applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include most chemical elements and some compounds; they have a relative <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability</b> slightly greater than 1 (i.e., a small positive magnetic susceptibility) and hence are attracted to magnetic fields. The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect and modern measurements on paramagnetic materials are often conducted with a SQUID magnetometer.|$|E

40|$|The {{engineering}} {{response of}} metamaterials has a dramatic {{impact on the}} physics, optics and engineering communities, because they offer electromagnetic properties that are difficult or impossible to achieve with conventional materials. In this paper, an asymptotic analysis of the electromagnetic fields at multi-material wedges composed of metamaterials is proposed. This is made possible by removing the assumption of positive electric permittivities and <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> an hypothesis which usually applies to conventional materials. Exploring {{the whole range of}} variability of these electromagnetic properties, it is shown that, in addition to the classical real eigenvalues 0 ⩽ λ < 1 leading to power-law singularities of the type O(rλ− 1) as r → 0, it is also possible to find imaginary eigenvalues leading to hypersingular solutions, as well as nonsingular configurations for a suitable choice of the negative electric permittivities and <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of the media. Moreover, to fully characterize the asymptotic fields, the analysis is not only restricted to the determination of the lowest real and complex eigenvalues, but is also extended to the evaluation of the higher-order nonsingular ones. The obtained analytical results collected in synthetic diagrams are expected to have impact on the design of micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems...|$|R

He then equated the ratio of the dielectric constant to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability</b> with a suitably adapted version of Weber and Kohlrausch's result of 1856, and he substituted this result into Newton's equation for the speed of sound.

2500|$|With antiferromagnets {{and certain}} types of {{insulating}} ferromagnets, effective negative <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability</b> is achievable when polariton resonance exists. To achieve a negative index of refraction, however, permittivity with negative values must occur within the same frequency range. The artificially fabricated split-ring resonator [...] is a design that accomplishes this, along {{with the promise of}} dampening high losses. With this first introduction of the metamaterial, it appears that the losses incurred were smaller than antiferromagnetic, or ferromagnetic materials.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, {{transmission}} is altered {{by adjusting the}} shape, size, and configurations of the unit cells. This results in control over material parameters known as [...] permittivity and <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability.</b> These two parameters (or quantities) determine the propagation of electromagnetic waves in matter. Therefore, controlling the values of permittivity and permeability means that the refractive index can be negative or zero as well as conventionally positive. It {{all depends on the}} intended application or desired result. So, optical properties can be expanded beyond the capabilities of lenses, mirrors, and other conventional materials. Additionally, one of the effects most studied is the negative index of refraction.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} linear phenomenological Maxwell's {{equations}} {{in the presence}} of a polarizable and magnetizable medium (magnetodielectric). For a dispersive, non-absorptive, medium with equal electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeabilities,</b> the latter can assume the value - 1 (+ 1 is their vacuum value) for a discrete set of frequencies, i. e., for these frequencies the medium behaves as a negative index material (NIM). We show that such systems have a well-defined time evolution. In particular the fields remain square integrable (and the electromagnetic energy finite) if this is the case at some initial time. Next we turn to the Green's function (a tensor), associated with the electric Helmholtz operator, for a set of parallel layers filled with a material. We express it in terms of the well-known scalar s and p ones. For a half space filled with the material and with a single dispersive Lorentz form for both electric and <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeabilities</b> we obtain an explicit form for the Green's function. We find the usual behavior for negative index materials, there is no refection outside the evanescent regime and the transmission (refraction) shows the usual NIM behavior. We find that the Green's function has poles, which lead to a modulation of the radiative decay probability of an excited atom. The formalism is free from ambiguities in the sign of the refractive index. Comment: 22 pages, accepted for publication in J. Math. Phys...|$|R

2500|$|In 1963 Robert Forward, a {{physicist}} and aerospace engineer at Hughes Research Laboratories, published a paper showing how {{within the framework}} of general relativity [...] "anti-gravitational" [...] effects might be achieved. Since all atoms have spin, gravitational permeability may be able to differ from material to material. A strong toroidal gravitational field that acts against the force of gravity could be generated by materials that have nonlinear properties that enhance time-varying gravitational fields. Such an effect would be analogous to the nonlinear electromagnetic permeability of iron making it an effective core (i.e. the doughnut of iron) in a transformer, whose properties are dependent on <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability.</b> In 1966 Dewitt was first to identify the significance of gravitational effects in superconductors.

2500|$|Just {{considering}} electromagnetic waves, we {{note that}} the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an anisotropic medium (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the electric displacement D and magnetic flux density B still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the electric susceptibility (or in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>permeability),</b> now given by a tensor, the direction of E (or H) may differ from that of D (or B). Even in isotropic media, so-called inhomogeneous waves can be launched into a medium whose refractive index has a significant imaginary part (or [...] "extinction coefficient") such as metals; these fields are also not strictly transverse. Surface waves or waves propagating in a waveguide (such as an optical fiber) are generally not transverse waves, but {{might be described as}} an electric or magnetic transverse mode, or a hybrid mode.|$|E
