50|$|AWS {{was formed}} in 1996 as a {{coalition}} of over 30 parties, uniting liberal, conservative and Christian democratic forces. <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> was its first chairman. In 1997 the coalition was joined by RS AWS, and by the Freedom Union. Jerzy Buzek of RS AWS became Prime Minister of Poland.|$|R
5|$|Next year, in February 1991, <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> {{was elected}} {{the leader of}} Solidarity. President Wałęsa's vision {{and that of the}} new Solidarity {{leadership}} were diverging. Far from supporting Wałęsa, Solidarity was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming 1991 parliamentary elections.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> ( [...] ; born 23 August 1950 in Kolbuszowa) is a Polish politician. A {{member of}} Solidarity since the 1980s, {{he was one}} of the most known and {{influential}} Polish politicians in the late 1990s, when he created the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS). The AWS coalition, especially when it joined forces with Freedom Union, was a major accomplishment in Polish politics, transforming the fragmented post-Solidarity camp into a powerful political force.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, he was {{selected}} chairman of Gdansk area's office. In 2002, he was elected {{as the chairman of}} Solidarity, replacing <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> who was criticized because of AWS' defeat in the 2001 parliamentary election. Janusz Śniadek was reelected in September 2006. He supported European Constitution while considering it lacking in references to Christianity. [...] In October 2010, Sniadek ran a third time for Chairman of Solidarity, but was beaten by Piotr Duda, who hails from Silesia.|$|R
5|$|However, controversies over {{domestic}} reforms, Poland's 1999 {{entry into}} NATO, and the accession process to the European Union, combined with AWS fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union—Unia Wolności) and infighting within AWS itself, {{as well as}} corruption, eventually resulted {{in the loss of}} much public support. AWS leader <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 {{parliamentary}} elections two parties with {{roots in the}} Solidarity movement - Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) and the Freedom Union (UW) - won 261 of the 460 seats in the Sejm and formed a coalition government. Jerzy Buzek of the AWS became Prime Minister. The AWS and the Democratic Left Allianc (SLD) held {{the majority of the}} seats in the Sejm. <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> was the leader of the AWS, and Leszek Miller led the SLD. In June 2000, UW withdrew from the governing collation, leaving AWS at the helm of a minority government.|$|R
50|$|President Kwaśniewski {{was seen}} as very likely to win {{re-election}} in the run up to the presidential election with polls showing that his popularity was high as 70% support. His main challenger {{was expected to be}} <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> from the Solidarity Electoral Action, which had formed the government since winning the last parliamentary elections in 1997. The other main candidate was a former Foreign Minister and more liberal conservative Andrzej Olechowski, who won support from voters who were discontented with both of the other main candidates and in particular younger voters, businessmen and intellectuals.|$|R

5000|$|During the 2000 presidential election, Olszewski stood {{again as}} a presidential candidate, but withdrew from the race shortly before the vote. The former premier later {{supported}} AWS candidate <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski.</b> Olszewski was reelected to the Sejm in 2001, with his party listed with the populist right-wing League of Polish Families. [...] However, Olszewski left the League shortly after his reelection over policy differences. Prior to Poland's admission into the EU in 2004, Olszewski expressed worry that Poland's EU accession would {{pave the way for}} Germans to make property claims regarding land seized during the population expulsions at the end of World War II. The former premier also expressed in 2005 his support for strong security and political relations with the United States within a transatlantic framework, though expressed reservations to stronger ties with Germany until property claims were dealt with.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} its {{four-year}} term, {{the ruling}} AWS government of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek faced bleak prospects for the September parliamentary election. In the previous presidential election in 2000, the SLD's Aleksander Kwaśniewski achieved a landslide reelection over AWS candidate <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski.</b> Economically, Polish consumer confidence dropped to its lowest since the mid-1990s, with unemployment rising above 16%. Politically, the Buzek government faced a series of crises undermining its credibility. In May 2000, the AWS' junior coalition partner, the Freedom Union, walked out of the government regarding the party's objections to the slow pace of reform, forcing Buzek to set up a relatively weak minority government in its place. Later in July 2001, Buzek's government was again hit by three further ministerial resignations over corruption charges, while the government's reform program for pensions and health care grounded to a halt in the Sejm.|$|R

50|$|In the {{parliamentary}} elections in 1997 {{one of the}} parties running for parliament was the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), a political party coalition gathered around Solidarność. It consisted of 20 small parties and 16 further groupings. AWS became by far the biggest party with almost 34 per cent of valid votes and gained 201 seats in the Sejm (out of 460), as well as 51 out of 100 seats in the Senate and thus had the absolute majority in the second chamber of the Polish parliament. Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek as well as most of the AWS ministers came from the trade union. The trade union’s chairman <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> (from February 1991 until September 2002) was simultaneously chairman of the AWS and its parliamentary grouping in the Sejm. His most important collaborators came from the trade union’s National Commission and took part in negotiations even when they were not members of parliament. Consequently, Krzaklewski - as chairman of the trade union, of the party and of {{the parliamentary}} grouping - {{and the members of the}} trade union’s National Commission became an extra-parliamentary centre of influence.|$|R

50|$|From 1979 to 1995 Kirkland was {{president}} of the American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). During his tenure, union membership in the United States declined precipitously. The unions suffered some of their most serious defeats, including the 1981 air traffic controllers's strike and the 1985 Hormel meat packers' strike. He also served on the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated (FPI) board from 1980-1988, representing Labor during FPI's growth years. On the international front, Kirkland's support of the Solidarity movement in Poland contributed to the decline of communism. According to Michael Szporer's Solidarity: The Great Workers Strike of 1980, American Unions under the leadership of Lane Kirkland contributed $150,000 shortly after the successful Solidarity Strike, as early as September 1980. At the time, the Carter administration, including its two prominent Polish Americans, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Ed Muskie advised against such aid fearing Soviet reaction. Kirkland boldly took the initiative persuading Zbigniew Brzezinski of the wisdom of supporting the Solidarity movement. In all US union support of Solidarity far exceeded its European counterparts. Solidarity aid was part of Lane Kirkland's internationalist vision for the labor movement and the building of the global consensus on human rights. After the changes in Eastern Europe, Kirkland became a mentor for many prominent labor leaders who saw him as a visionary and visited him in his office at the George Meany Center. He befriended Lech Walesa as well as <b>Marian</b> <b>Krzaklewski</b> who replaced Lech Walesa at the helm of Solidarity. Kirkland was awarded posthumously with the highest Polish award, the Order of the White Eagle.The Polish American Freedom Foundation has established a grant in Lane Kirkland's honor.|$|R
