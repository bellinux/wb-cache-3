5|$|Mass transit {{accounts}} for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 <b>million</b> <b>annually)</b> use intercity rail to travel, {{partly because of}} the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.|$|E
5|$|The Mayo Clinic {{noted that}} it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them to pay back taxes. In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury {{announced}} that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 <b>million</b> <b>annually,</b> or $3,100 a year for a resident earning $50,000 a year (and equivalent amount for the resident's employer).|$|E

5|$|To {{ameliorate}} {{the situation}} the old Republic maintained {{a policy of}} severe austerity during the century, especially economizing on its defense outlays (which in large part explains why its military and political role declined so much). Up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War this policy succeeded in bringing down the level of debt, but this war brought a large uptick in the public debt: between 1780 and 1794 the province of Holland alone issued 120 million guilders of new bonds. In 1795, its total debt stood at 455 million guilders. To this should be added the debts of the United East India Company and its sister, the WIC, and the five Dutch Admiralties {{for a total of}} about 150 million guilders. The other provinces owed 155 million guilders. The grand total in 1795, {{at the beginning of the}} Batavian Republic, came to 760 million guilders; this imposed a debt service of 25 million guilders annually. The indemnity of the Treaty of The Hague immediately added 100 million guilders to this total, and the maintenance of the French army of occupation added about 12 <b>million</b> <b>annually</b> (while the other funding requirements of the republic added another 20 <b>million</b> <b>annually).</b> In 1814 the public debt stood at 1.7 billion guilders.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the tenders were submitted, it turned out only NSB, DSB and Veolia had chosen bid. The tender was won by NSB Anbud on 30 May 2005, wanting NOK 70 <b>million</b> <b>annually</b> for the {{contract}}, ten million less than with the former agreement. After the contract was won, NSB Anbud announced the schedule for the Gjøvik Line. The number of train services would increase by 40%. Three stations serving the recreational area Nordmarka outside Oslo would be dropped—Elnes, Stryken and Bjørgeseter. Skogsholm tried to make an agreement with NSB to not abandon all the stations, but since this had not {{been part of the}} PSO tender, an agreement could not be made and the service was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Dung beetles (Scarabidae) {{have been}} {{successfully}} used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies, such as Musca vetustissima and Haematobia exigua which are serious pests of cattle in Australia. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe to reduce populations of Musca vetustissima, following successful trials of this technique in Hawaii. The American Institute of Biological Sciences reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 <b>million</b> <b>annually</b> through burying above-ground livestock feces.|$|E
5|$|Hodgsen sold to Carling O'Keefe in 1979, who {{had been}} {{minority}} owners since 1976. The brewing company's total investment in the team was $5.8 million. At {{the time it was}} rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 <b>million</b> <b>annually</b> by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E

Rodriguez did not participate in Clemson's practices prior to the Gator Bowl, and he did not coach during the game. Replacing Rodriguez as temporary offensive coordinator was Brad Scott. Joining him in the press box during the Gator Bowl was Mike O'Cain, who was hired as Clemson's new quarterbacks coach. In an effort to prevent further defections, Clemson awarded head coach Tommy Bowden a seven-year contract extension worth $1.1 <b>million</b> <b>annually</b> plus incentives.|$|E
