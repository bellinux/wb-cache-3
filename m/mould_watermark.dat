50|$|Another type of {{watermark}} {{is called}} the cylinder <b>mould</b> <b>watermark.</b> It is a shaded watermark first used in 1848 that incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image. Instead of using a wire covering for the dandy roll, the shaded watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll's own surface. Once dry, the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density. The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the Dandy Roll process, and as such Cylinder <b>Mould</b> <b>Watermark</b> Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes, passports, motor vehicle titles, and other documents where {{it is an important}} anti-counterfeiting measure.|$|E
50|$|Watermarks {{are created}} in the paper by special pieces of bent wire or bits, either {{attached}} to the mould or attached to the Dandy roll of machine-made paper. The watermark is inherently created differently by these two methods. In {{the case of the}} <b>mould,</b> the <b>watermark</b> is created by the settling of the fibers on the mould, thus creating the intentional thinning of the paper. In the case of the Dandy Roll, the watermark is pressed into the wet pulp. The papermaker closely adjusts the pressure the Dandy Roll exerts on the paper to ensure a proper impression of the watermark design into the paper. Too little pressure and the watermark may not be detectable.|$|R
