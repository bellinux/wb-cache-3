40|$|Not only in East Asia the {{political}} construction of “coherent regions ” is often {{closely linked to}} practices of financial regionalism. Starting from a non-idealistic understanding of community building, this paper compares three stages {{of the development of}} East Asian financial regionalism: Japan's proposal to establish an Asian Monetary Fund, the establishment of a network of currency swap agreements in 2000 (Chiang Mai Initiative) and the <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> this cooperative scheme in May 2010. It is demonstrated how the evolution of these cooperative arrangements has materialized an influential “East Asia”-Asianism essentially embedded in financial regionalism. Effectively negotiated internal discrimination, successful balancing of great powers as well as lender-borrower interests and the potential security function of the arrangement serve as the foundation of a nascent but fragile East Asian community.

40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{monetary}} transfers {{system that was}} created by the short-term inland bill of exchange markets. For decades this system was the most practical way of channeling the growing volume of transfers which were taking place {{as a consequence of the}} growth of the Spanish economy. This analysis argues that, between 1775 and 1885, the markets involved in this activity became progressively more efficient, due largely to the <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> the payment system. This situation lasted longer in Spain than in the rest of Europe since Spanish banking was, initially, slower to develop. Using univariate and multivariate GARCH models, it was possible to conclude that the inland bill of exchange markets constituted an essential monetary instrument, and one that faithfully reflects the integration of monetary markets in Spain.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the impacts of free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) in East Asia have assumed full utilization of preferences. The evidence suggests that this assumption is seriously in error, with the estimated uptake particularly low in East Asia. In this paper, we assume a more realistic utilization rate in estimating impacts. We find that actual utilization rates significantly diminish the benefits from preferential liberalization, but in a non-linear way. Reciprocity is an important motivation for pursuing FTAs over unilateral actions, although the Doha Round could deliver the same outcome if only it could be concluded. We isolate the impact of reciprocity, but find that the additional benefits also depend on utilization rates. Furthermore, the potential for trade deflection combined with possible retaliatory actions could negatively affect members and non-members. In the absence <b>of</b> Doha, the <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> preferences, even without reciprocity, is the practical route that {{is most likely to}} deliver the greatest benefits to members. Global liberalization, while difficult to attain, would maximize world welfare while posing no risk in its realization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the likely impact of European preferences, in particular of its Rules of Origin (RoO), on {{the prospects for}} integration of West Africa in world trade. We show that West African trade has not yet achieved the structural transformation of countries having successfully established themselves as manufacturing assembly platforms. EU RoO are complex, restrictive and discriminatory, hampering this integration of African producers in world trade. The paper explores the consequences of moving to a single product-specific RoO which would allow a maximum foreign content (MFC) to satisfy the substantial transformation criterion. We suggest that the developmental objective of the EPAs would be satisfied with a MFC of 90 %- 95 % for LDCs and a 60 %- 70 % for non-LDCs. Such a differentiated treatment should allow the small african companies in West Africa to enter into cross-border production chains. With such a move, the EU would also ?seize the agenda? in the much awaited move towards <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> preferential RoO. economic partnership agreement, trade preferences, rules of origin, European Union, West Africa...|$|R

Because big multilateral partnerships like the RBM are almost always guilty of the charges of non-transparency, non-responsiveness, and insensitivity to the local constituencies they serve, I use Richard Falk 2 ̆ 7 s twin concepts of 2 ̆ 2 globalism-from-above 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 globalism-from-below 2 ̆ 2 to explore the interaction between the RBM and traditional therapies in malaria-endemic societies. In search of a transparent cosmopolitan malaria regime, I propose a transnational dialogue between all the relevant actors and stakeholders: multilateral health institutions, pharmaceutical corporations, indigenous populations, traditional healers, and civil society. We need to synthesize the tension between the core (policies of multilateral institutions) and the peripheries (traditional therapies in malaria-endemic societies). This synthesis must proceed in a way that projects <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> malaria as a humane enterprise rather than a predator that erodes age-long therapies of rural populations in malaria-endemic societies of the global South...|$|R
40|$|Mega-regional trade {{agreements}} (MRTAs) {{have appeared in}} response to the prolonged stagnation of the multilateral trading system ruled by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Although this issue has stimulated research in international integration, the specifics of MRTAs have not yet been sufficiently investigated. This article therefore assesses the <b>multilateralization</b> potential <b>of</b> regional commitments using the example of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It includes commitments in market access liberalization made in regional {{trade agreements}} (RTAs) and in intraregional agricultural trade liberalization under the TPP. The central research problem is to identify the regional liberalization commitments that might be promoted {{to the level of the}} WTO. The authors use the methodology devised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for assessing the potential multilateralization. RTA and MRTA commitments are grouped in two policy areas: WTO-plus (going beyond the normal provisions of the WTO) and WTO-beyond (dealing with issues going beyond the WTO). The TTP is scrutinized in the context of intraregional agricultural trade liberalization. MRTAs can raise regional commitments to the global level because of their large membership, regulatory transparency and high levels <b>of</b> implementation. The <b>multilateralization</b> <b>of</b> regional agreements is expected in services and investments as well as in various aspects of technical regulation. The key features of implementing RTA’s WTO-plus and WTO-beyond commitments in intraregional agricultural trade are discussed. Most RTAs have liberalized tariffs beyond the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (WTO-plus), but only a few have strengthened disciplines in non-tariff barriers and implemented WTO-beyond commitments for export restrictions and export subsidies. The TPP parties are a diverse group in terms of involvement in global agricultural trade and applied tariffs on agriculture and food. The TPP provides the record in eliminating tariffs for agricultural products while keeping a number of exceptions for sensitive products and long implementation periods. Agricultural market liberalization under the TPP is achieved mostly through eliminating tariffs than by renewing non-tariff barriers. The TPP parties share the objective of implementing WTO commitments by supporting the global agricultural trade reform on export subsidies and export bans, and agree to incorporate WTO-plus and WTO-beyond obligations...|$|R
