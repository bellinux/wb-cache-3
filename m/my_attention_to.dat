He called <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> their show of pleasure or sense of danger, their perfect forms and splendid attire. He would speak of their departure and return with the seasons.|$|E
25|$|I {{lived through}} the whole of it, being of an age to {{comprehend}} events, and giving <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{them in order to}} know the exact truth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and being present with both parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly.|$|E
500|$|Morris's {{tenure as}} an {{instructor}} in Litchfield {{was cut short}} when, within months of arriving, he received an unsolicited ensign's commission in the Connecticut militia, which he accepted. [...] While {{in the service of}} the Connecticut militia Morris saw his first action, fighting battles in both Long Island and White Plains. In his memoirs, Morris wrote of this time, stating that [...] "The soldiers universally manifested a great respect for me, for my care of the sick and <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> their wants, and for my sympathies in their distresses." ...|$|E
60|$|I was irritated and disquieted. I {{had been}} very earnest in <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> Mother Anastasia. Perhaps this lady had seen me attempt to kiss her hand. I must set myself right.|$|R
6000|$|... "But do {{you know}} who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion? Do you know that I pay <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> her, and have for some time? Just be careful!" ...|$|R

500|$|Synge {{joined the}} Dublin Naturalists' Field Club {{and read the}} works of Charles Darwin. He wrote: [...] "When I was about {{fourteen}} I obtained a book of Darwin's.... My studies showed me the force of what I read, [...] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards I turned <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." [...] He then continued, [...] "Soon after I had relinquished the kingdom of God I began {{to take up a}} real interest in the kingdom of Ireland. My politics went round... to a temperate Nationalism." ...|$|E
500|$|Kateřina's health {{gradually}} worsened and in {{the spring}} of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died [...] "gently, without our knowing anything until the quiet drew <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> her." [...] After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, {{and fell in love with}} Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.|$|E
2500|$|Strabo is his {{own best}} expounder of his {{principles}} of composition:In short, this book of mine should be ... useful alike to the statesman and {{to the public at}} large – as was my work on History. ... And so, after I had written my Historical Sketches ... I determined to write the present treatise also; for this work is based on the same plan, and is addressed to the same class of readers, and particularly to men of exalted stations in life. ... in this work also I must leave untouched what is petty and inconspicuous, and devote <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what is noble and great, and to what contains the practically useful, or memorable, or entertaining. ... For it, too, is a colossal work, in that it deals with the facts about large things only, and wholes ....|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Anne,' cried John, {{with more}} gaiety than truthfulness, 'don't let {{yourself}} be troubled! What happens {{is for the}} best. Soldiers love here to-day and there to-morrow. Who knows that you won't hear of <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> some Spanish maid before a month is gone by? 'Tis the way of us, you know; a soldier's heart is not worth a week's purchase--ha, ha! Goodbye, good-bye!' ...|$|R
60|$|As {{they talked}} I gave <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> pretty {{exclusively}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle.|$|R

2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{strain of}} plaintive music, played on {{stringed}} instruments, and flutes, recalled <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the hidden shrine.|$|E
60|$|Explosives {{naturally}} drew <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> mines--tin-mines, coal-mines, {{and other}} commercial enterprises. They also suggested war and torpedoes.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{burst into}} a hearty laugh. [...] "They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure," [...] said he, [...] "but beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late {{acquaintance}} {{are going to be}} to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very happy," [...] returns the iron gentleman, [...] "to give <b>my</b> best <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{anything}} Lady Dedlock does me the honour to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am {{ashamed of}} you! Is this your {{gratitude}} for <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> you last spring? Is nothing due {{to me on}} that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have {{not been in the}} habit of brooking disappointment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Harold {{noticed it}} first," [...] she replied, [...] "and called <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it; and now I {{can see that}} you really have been failing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to be}} able to fight, Bertha, free of anxiety, and to be able <b>to</b> devote <b>my</b> whole <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the work. This I can't do if I {{know that}} you are exposed to bullets." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{grew more}} and more excited; she {{positively}} laid {{her hand on my}} arm in her eagerness <b>to</b> secure <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> all <b>to</b> herself. [...] "American girls or English?" [...] she resumed, her fat, firm fingers closing on me with a tremulous grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{would the}} variety of life be without them? It was for an {{adventure}} that I first began <b>to</b> pay <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> her. I've chased {{a good deal of}} game in my time, but there's no chase like that of a pretty woman. There was the piquant difficulty of it also, for, as she was the companion of Lady Emily Rood it was almost impossible to see her alone. On the top of all the other obstacles which attracted me, I learned from her own lips very early in the proceedings that she was engaged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “So there is,” {{the mate}} said, shading {{his eyes with}} his hand. “I see it plainly enough now that you call <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it.” ...|$|E
60|$|Now I turned <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the prisoners. To Tardos Mors I went first, asking {{where the}} keys might be which would {{unfasten}} their fetters.|$|E
60|$|It {{has always}} been a great comfort to me, too, that Irene herself {{was the first person to}} call <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Césarine Vivian's {{extraordinary}} beauty.|$|E

6000|$|... "This is {{a terrible}} business, sir!" [...] he said. [...] "His lordship has excused me from superintending {{the service of the}} dinner. Anything that I can do for you I am <b>to</b> give <b>my</b> whole <b>attention</b> <b>to.</b> These were <b>my</b> orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, bless my soul!" [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "I haven't {{any time to}} {{consider}} what has happened, I must give <b>my</b> whole <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what is happening or may happen. How are you? and {{how have you been}} during my absence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was so busy, I {{had no time}} to look at the papers. I suppose no {{one thought}} it his {{business}} to draw <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|As a {{practitioner}} I {{have given a}} great deal of <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Bright's disease. I have made some rules for treating it that may be valuable. Listen: ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Margaret, her sailor's eye on {{the falling}} {{barometer}} and on the [...] "making" [...] stuff adrift in the sky, who called <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> a coming blow.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell him so, Jekyl," [...] {{answered}} the Earl, [...] "and his proud Scotch stomach {{will be up}} in an instant, and he will pay you with a shot for your pains.--Why, he thinks himself cock of the walk, this strutting bantam, notwithstanding the lesson I gave him before--And what do you think?--He has the impudence <b>to</b> talk about <b>my</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> Lady Binks as inconsistent with the prosecution of my suit to his sister!
