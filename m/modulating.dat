40|$|Phase-control of a {{magnetron}} is studied via simulation using {{a combination}} of a continuous current source and a <b>modulated</b> current source. The addressable, <b>modulated</b> current source is turned ON and OFF at the magnetron operating frequency in order to control the electron injection and the spoke phase. Prior simulation work using a 2 D model of a Rising Sun magnetron showed that the use of 100 % <b>modulated</b> current controlled the magnetron phase and allowed for dynamic phase control. In this work, the minimum fraction of <b>modulated</b> current source needed to achieve a phase control is studied. The current fractions (<b>modulated</b> versus continuous) were varied from 10 % <b>modulated</b> current to 100 % <b>modulated</b> current to study the effects on phase control.

After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the intracellular space, be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} fundamental principles and applications of <b>modulated</b> induction thermal plasmas {{that have been developed}} by the author’s group. The <b>modulated</b> induction thermal plasma is established using a coil current that is <b>modulated</b> to the order of several hundreds of amperes at a millisecond time scale. Such a large current modulation enables the creation of a large disturbance in high-pressure and high-temperature plasmas. It also enables control of the temperature and radical density in thermal plasmas in a time domain. Examples are described for application of the <b>modulated</b> induction thermal plasma to surface modification. Thermally and chemically non-equilibrium effects are essential in temperature and radical density fields. The latest result is also presented for various applications of <b>modulated</b> induction thermal plasmas. Finally, dynamic behaviors of a recently developed arbitrary-waveform <b>modulated</b> induction thermal plasma are also introduced as a new type of <b>modulated</b> induction thermal plasma. 1...|$|R

The modulation frequency of the forcing is assumed to be close to the modulation frequency of the <b>modulated</b> wave solution, while the wave frequency of the forcing is supposed to be far from that of the <b>modulated</b> wave solution. We describe the domain in the three-dimensional control parameter space (of frequencies and amplitude of the forcing) where stable locking of the modulation frequencies of the forcing and the <b>modulated</b> wave solution occurs. Our system is a simplest case scenario for the behavior of self-pulsating lasers under the influence of external periodically <b>modulated</b> optical signals...|$|R

An electro-optical modulator <b>modulates</b> {{the frequency of the}} laser output signal to define a linear triangular waveform. An optical circulator passes the linear triangular waveform to a band-pass optical filter to filter out harmonic frequencies created in the waveform during modulation of the laser output signal, to define a pure filtered <b>modulated</b> waveform having a very narrow bandwidth.

In the B section, a sequence of hemiolas is interrupted by a dramatic interpolation in A-flat major, referencing the departure to this key in the opening of the Allegro with the added minor 6th. The second A section is a transformation of the first, interrupted every four bars by a silent bar, creating a mysterious atmosphere.

5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by <b>modulating</b> hepatic gene expression.|$|E

The present study was carried out to explore whether empathic racial bias for pain is <b>modulated</b> by minimal group. Chinese/Western faces with neutral {{expressions}} receiving painful (needle penetration) or non-painful (Q-tip touch) stimulation were presented. Participants {{were asked to rate}} the pain intensity felt by Chinese/Western models of ingroup/outgroup members. Their implicit racial bias were also measured. Two lines of evidence indicated that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was <b>modulated</b> by racial bias: (1) Chinese models elicited stronger activity than Western did in the ACC, and (2) activity in the ACC was <b>modulated</b> by implicit racial bias. Whereas the right anterior insula (rAI) were <b>modulated</b> by ingroup bias, in which ingroup member elicited stronger activity than outgroup member did. Furthermore, activity in the ACC was <b>modulated</b> by activity of rAI (i. e., ingroup bias) in the pain condition, while activity in the rAI was <b>modulated</b> by activity of ACC (i. e., racial bias) in the nopain condition. Our results provide evidence that there are different neural correlates for racial bias and ingroup bias, and neural racial bias for pain can be <b>modulated</b> by minimal group...|$|R
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of <b>modulating</b> immune {{function}} in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
5|$|Restrictive N-terminal truncation: The {{approximately}} 30 {{amino acids}} N-terminal extension of cTnI is an adult heart-specific structure. The N-terminal extension contains the PKA phosphorylation sites Ser23/Ser24 and {{plays a role}} in <b>modulating</b> the overall molecular conformation and function of cTnI. A restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI occurs at low levels in normal hearts of all vertebrate species examined including human and significantly increases in adaptation to hemodynamic stress and Gsα deficiency-caused failing mouse hearts. Distinct from the harmful C-terminal truncation, the restrictive N-terminal truncation of cTnI selectively removing the adult heart specific extension forms a regulatory mechanism in cardiac adaptation to physiological and pathological stress conditions.|$|E

This {{region is}} called the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region, and is {{composed}} of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as complement proteins. By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of opsonized particles (binding to FcγR), lysis of cells (binding to complement), and degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (binding to FcεR).|$|E

5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by <b>modulating</b> the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E

The soundtrack included tunes from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles composed by Tsukasa Masuko. While composing the music, Meguro attempted to express his feelings {{when he saw the}} world while remaining true to the styles established by the original Megami Tensei games. Taking inspiration from the game's dungeon-battle transitions, and the cut-scenes' combination of current graphics with classic use of subtitles for storytelling, Meguro created <b>modulating</b> tunes which included elements from 1980s music. Meguro also introduced orchestral elements which were absent from previous Megami Tensei scores, using it to emphasize the gameplay's constant shifts between movement and stillness. Meguro generally worked solo on the original version, but for the director's cut, he had help composing new tracks.|$|E
25|$|Many PLL {{frequency}} synthesizers {{can also}} generate frequency modulation (FM). The <b>modulating</b> signal {{is added to}} the output of the loop filter, directly varying the frequency of the VCO and the synthesizer output. The modulation will also appear at the phase comparator output, reduced in amplitude by any frequency division. Any spectral components in the <b>modulating</b> signal too low to be blocked by the loop filter end up back at the VCO input with opposite polarity to the <b>modulating</b> signal, thus canceling them out. (The loop effectively sees these components as VCO noise to be tracked out.) Modulation components above the loop filter cutoff frequency cannot return to the VCO input so they remain in the VCO output.|$|E
