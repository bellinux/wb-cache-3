50|$|Research on {{stress and}} drug-primed {{reinstatement}} {{has implications for}} treatment of addiction research in humans. Reinstatement studies on stress and drug primes provide evidence for their role in relapse behavior in humans. In addition to conditioned placed preference, animal testing using self-administration procedures have also been used to examine potential causes of relapse in humans. Stress and drug-primes have also shown to contribute to relapse behaviour in humans. With the knowledge that stress and drug primes contribute to relapse behavior, measures to avoid stressful situations can help addicts avoid returning to their addictive behaviors. Drug priming is thought to induce relapse in humans because of their effects on the reward circuits of the brain. Repeated drug exposure is thought to sensitize the rewarding effect of the drug and exposure to the drug after extinction can reintroduce this rewarding effect. These effects {{play a key role}} in the persistence of drug-seeking behaviors. Researchers use the reinstatement procedure to test the ability of certain drugs to inhibit these different types of reinstatement. One such drug that has been shown to have attenuating effects on reinstatement is <b>mecamylamine.</b> This is a selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist which, if administered after extinction trials, can block the reinstatement of the conditioned place preference for nicotine and opiates. Although direct causal linkages cannot be assumed between reinstatement in the conditioned place preference procedure and relapse in humans, it provides a solid first step in the process of creating drugs that may one day be used to treat relapse in humans.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the blocking action of <b>mecamylamine</b> on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was studied on rat isolated chromaffin cells recorded under whole-cell patch clamp. <b>Mecamylamine</b> strongly depressed (IC(50) = 0. 34 microM) inward currents elicited by short pulses of nicotine, an effect slowly reversible on wash. The <b>mecamylamine</b> block was voltage-dependent and promptly relieved by a protocol combining membrane depolarization with a nicotine pulse. Either depolarization or nicotine pulses were insufficient per se to elicit block relief. Block relief was transient; response depression returned in a use-dependent manner. Exposure to <b>mecamylamine</b> failed to block nAChRs {{if they were not}} activated by nicotine or if they were activated at positive membrane potentials. These data suggest that <b>mecamylamine</b> could not interact with receptors either at rest or at depolarized level. Other nicotinic antagonists like dihydro-beta-erythroidine or tubocurarine did not share this action of <b>mecamylamine</b> although proadifen partly mimicked it. <b>Mecamylamine</b> is suggested to penetrate and block open nAChRs that would subsequently close and trap this antagonist. Computer modeling indicated that the mechanism of <b>mecamylamine</b> blocking action could be described by assuming that 1) mecamylamine-blocked receptors possessed a much slower, voltage-dependent isomerization rate, 2) the rate constant for <b>mecamylamine</b> unbinding was large and poorly voltage dependent. Hence, channel reopening plus depolarization allowed <b>mecamylamine</b> escape and block relief. In the presence of <b>mecamylamine,</b> therefore, nAChRs acquire the new property of operating as coincidence detectors for concomitant changes in membrane potential and receptor occupancy...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) {{are involved in}} speed of information processing, and inspection time appears to be particularly sensitive to nicotinic manipulation. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought {{to examine the effects}} of the nAchR antagonist <b>mecamylamine</b> on inspection time. Furthermore, the extent to which the anticholinesterase donepezil would reverse the effects of <b>mecamylamine</b> on inspection time was also examined. METHODS: A double-blind, repeated measures design was employed. Subjects (n = 6) received placebo, <b>mecamylamine</b> (20 mg PO) or <b>mecamylamine</b> (20 mg PO) and donepezil (5 mg PO). Inspection time and physiological measures were then assessed. RESULTS: The <b>mecamylamine</b> condition and the <b>mecamylamine</b> and donepezil condition were associated with an increase in heart rate, when compared to the placebo condition. There was a significant slowing of inspection time in the <b>mecamylamine</b> condition; compared to placebo, which was partly reversed by donepezil. CONCLUSIONS: The slowing of inspection time following <b>mecamylamine</b> is consistent with the role of nAchRs in speed of information processing, and add to the evidence that IT may in part index nAchR system integrity...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the hypothesis that both nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors (nAChRs) and glutamate receptors (α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole propionate receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs)) are involved in fear conditioning, and may modulate similar processes. The effects of the nAChR antagonist <b>mecamylamine</b> administered alone, the AMPAR antagonist NBQX administered alone, and the NMDAR antagonist MK- 801 administered alone on cued fear conditioning, contextual fear conditioning, and latent inhibition of cued fear conditioning were examined. In addition, the effects of coadministration of either <b>mecamylamine</b> and NBQX or <b>mecamylamine</b> and MK- 801 on these behaviors were examined. Consistent with previous studies, neither <b>mecamylamine</b> nor NBQX administered alone disrupted any of the tasks. However, coadministration of <b>mecamylamine</b> and NBQX disrupted both contextual fear conditioning and latent inhibition of cued fear conditioning. In addition, coadministration of <b>mecamylamine</b> with a dose of MK- 801 subthreshold for disrupting either task disrupted both contextual fear conditioning and latent inhibition of cued fear conditioning. Coadministration of <b>mecamylamine</b> and NBQX, and coadministration of <b>mecamylamine</b> with a dose of MK- 801 subthreshold for disrupting fear conditioning {{had little effect on}} cued fear conditioning. These results suggest that nAChRs and glutamate receptors may support similar processes mediating acquisition of contextual fear conditioning and latent inhibition of fear conditioning...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mecamylamine</b> is a {{nicotine}} antagonist (that is it {{blocks the}} effect of nicotine). The rationale for its use in smoking cessation {{is that it may}} block the rewarding effect of nicotine and thus reduce the urge to smoke. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of <b>mecamylamine</b> in promoting smoking cessation, either alone or in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of <b>mecamylamine,</b> either alone or in combination with nicotine replacement therapy, which reported smoking cessation rates at least six months after intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and duration of the <b>mecamylamine</b> and nicotine treatments, side-effects of treatment, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was sustained abstinence from smoking (biochemically validated) after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. Smokers lost to follow-up were regarded as being continuing smokers. Because of the preliminary nature of available data, we did not perform meta-analysis but report the results narratively. MAIN RESULTS: We identified two studies, both from the same investigators. In a study of 48 volunteers, a combination of <b>mecamylamine</b> plus nicotine patch was more effective than nicotine patch alone (abstinence rate at one year 37. 5 % vs 4. 2 %). In a second study, 80 volunteers were treated for four weeks prior to cessation with one of four treatments: 1. Nicotine patch plus <b>mecamylamine</b> capsules 2. Nicotine alone 3. <b>Mecamylamine</b> alone 4. No active drug. All four groups received combination treatment with nicotine and <b>mecamylamine</b> after the scheduled quit date. The abstinence rates in these four groups were respectively 40 %, 20 %, 15 % and 15 %. The higher abstinence rate in the group treated with combination therapy was not statistically significant. The authors reported a statistically significant benefit of <b>mecamylamine</b> using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In the doses used, <b>mecamylamine</b> was well tolerated, although up to 40 % of subjects required reductions in dose, usually because of constipation. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Data from two small studies suggest that the combination of nicotine and <b>mecamylamine</b> may be superior to nicotine alone in promoting smoking cessation. However, these results require confirmation in larger studies before the treatment can be recommended clinically...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{a portion of the}} TM 2 domain regulates the {{sensitivity}} of beta subunit-containing rat neuronal nicotinic AChR to the ganglionic blocker <b>mecamylamine,</b> such that the substitution of 4 amino acids of the muscle beta subunit sequence into the neuronal beta 4 sequence decreases the potency of <b>mecamylamine</b> by a factor of 200 and eliminates any long-term effects of this drug on receptor function. The same exchange of sequence that decreases inhibition by <b>mecamylamine</b> produces a comparable potentiation of long-term inhibition by nicotine. Inhibition by <b>mecamylamine</b> is voltage-dependent, suggesting a direct interaction of <b>mecamylamine</b> with sequence elements within the membrane field. We have previously shown that sensitivity to TMP (tetramethylpiperidine) inhibitors is controlled by the same sequence elements that determine <b>mecamylamine</b> sensitivity. However, inhibition by bis-TMP compounds is independent of voltage. Our experiments did not show any influence of voltage on the inhibition of chimeric receptors by nicotine, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of nicotine are mediated by binding to a site outside the membrane's electric field. An analysis of point mutations indicates that the residues at the 6 ′ position within the beta subunit TM 2 domain may be important for determining the effects of both <b>mecamylamine</b> and nicotine in a reciprocal manner. Single mutations at the 10 ′ position are not sufficient to produce effects, but 6 ′ 10 ′ double mutants show more effect than do the 6 ′ single mutants...|$|E
40|$|Aims The muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor antagonist scopolamine {{is often used}} for proof-of-pharmacology studies with pro-cognitive compounds. From a pharmacological point of view, it would seem more rational to use a nicotinic rather than a muscarinic anticholinergic challenge to prove pharmacology of a nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} agonist. This study aims to characterize a nicotinic anticholinergic challenge model using <b>mecamylamine</b> and {{to compare it to}} the scopolamine model. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over trial, 12 healthy male subjects received oral <b>mecamylamine</b> 10 and 20 mg, intravenous scopolamine 0. 5 mg and placebo. Pharmacokinetics were analysed using non-compartmental analysis. Pharmacodynamic effects were measured with a multidimensional test battery that includes neurophysiological, subjective, (visuo) motor and cognitive measurements. Results All treatments were safe and well tolerated. <b>Mecamylamine</b> had a t(max) of 2. 5 h and a C-max of 64. 5 ngml(- 1) for the 20 mg dose. <b>Mecamylamine</b> had a dose-dependent effect decreasing the adaptive tracking performance and VAS alertness, and increasing the finger tapping and visual verbal learning task performance time and errors. Scopolamine significantly affected almost all pharmacodynamic tests. Conclusion This study demonstrated that <b>mecamylamine</b> causes nicotinic receptor specific temporary decline in cognitive functioning. Compared with the scopolamine model, pharmacodynamic effects were less pronounced at the dose levels tested; however, <b>mecamylamine</b> caused less sedation. The cognitive effects of scopolamine might at least partly be caused by sedation. Whether the <b>mecamylamine</b> model can be used for proof-of-pharmacology of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists remains to be established...|$|E

40|$|High {{doses of}} the nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (nAChR) antagonist <b>mecamylamine</b> can elicit somatic signs resembling those associated with nicotine withdrawal in nicotine-naïve adult rats. Understanding this phenomenon, and its possible modulation by acute nicotine and age, could inform the use of <b>mecamylamine</b> as both an experimental tool and potential pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence and other disorders. This study evaluated the ability of high-dose <b>mecamylamine</b> to elicit somatic signs in adolescent rats, {{and the potential for}} acute nicotine pretreatment to potentiate this effect as previously reported in adults. Single or repeated injections of <b>mecamylamine</b> (1. 5 or 3. 0 mg/kg, s. c.) elicited somatic signs in nicotine-naive adolescents, but this effect was not influenced by two hour pretreatment with acute nicotine (0. 5 mg/kg, s. c.). In an initial evaluation of the effects of age in this model, <b>mecamylamine</b> (2. 25 mg/kg, s. c.) elicited somatic signs in nicotine-naive adolescents and adults. This effect was modestly enhanced following acute nicotine injections in adults but not in adolescents, even when a higher nicotine dose (1. 0 rather than 0. 5 mg/kg, s. c.) was used in adolescents to account for age differences in nicotine pharmacokinetics. These studies are the first to show that <b>mecamylamine</b> elicits somatic signs in nicotine-naïve adolescent rats, an effect that should be considered when designing and interpreting studies examining effects of high doses of <b>mecamylamine</b> in adolescents. Our findings also provide preliminary evidence that these signs may be differentially modulated by acute nicotine pretreatment in adolescents versus adults...|$|E

40|$|Background: Nitric oxide and <b>mecamylamine</b> have an {{important}} role in anxiety-like behavior. Determining the site of action in the brain and interaction between these agents need to be investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible interaction between <b>mecamylamine</b> and nitric oxide in dorsal hippocampus using the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 180 male NMRI mice. Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and two cannuale were inserted stereotaxically into the CA 1 region of the dorsal hippocampus. All animals were allowed to recover for 1 week before the beginning of the behavioral testing. The elevated plus-maze was used to test the anxiety-like behavior. Results: Bilateral intra-dorsal hippocampal injections of <b>mecamylamine,</b> L-arginine or L-NAME induced the anxiogenic effects. Intra-dorsal hippocampal injection of ineffective dose of <b>mecamylamine</b> before different doses of L-arginine or L-NAME potentiated the anxiogenic effects of L-arginine or L-NAME.

40|$|<b>Mecamylamine</b> {{depressed}} the vasomotor centre {{independently of}} its ganglion-blocking action. The central action was elicited by {{small amounts of}} the drug when it was confined to {{the central nervous system}} of dogs and cats anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and of spinal cats. The spinal site of action was shown by the inhibition of vasomotor responses due to spinal compression in cats, when <b>mecamylamine</b> was introduced intrathecally in a dose too small to block autonomic ganglia. The supraspinal site of action was shown by intravertebral arterial injection of <b>mecamylamine</b> into cats, which caused hypotension and selectively blocked the electrically evoked pressor responses from the medulla without affecting the “nicotinic” ganglionic responses to acetylcholine. Injection of <b>mecamylamine</b> into the cerebral ventricles of dogs produced hypotension, and the reflex vasomotor responses to stimulation of afferent fibres in the vagus nerves and to occlusion of the common carotid arteries were inhibited without any change in the response of the nictitating membrane to preganglionic nervous stimulation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mecamylamine</b> {{differentially}} blocked fast nicotinic transmission in two functional subsets of sympathetic neurons within lumbar paravertebral ganglia of the bullfrog. EC s for {{inhibition of}} postsynaptic compound action potentials were 27. 3 " 2. 5 mM in the 50 secretomotor B system and 5. 7 " 0. 7 mM in the vasomotor C system. This 5. 2 : 1 selectivity is 2. 6 {{times greater than}} observed previously with D-tubocurarine, a nonselective blocker of nicotinic receptors, and it indicates that <b>mecamylamine</b> preferentially interacts with nicotinic receptors on sympathetic C neurons. We tested this by analyzing the effect of <b>mecamylamine</b> upon synaptic currents. In both cell types, the drug produced a qualitatively similar picture of open-channel blockade. It reduced EPSC amplitude, speeded EPSC decay, and became more effective with membrane hyperpolarization and repetitive activity. Despite these similarities, 8 mM <b>mecamylamine</b> reduced EPSC amplitude {{to a greater extent}} in C neurons, and the rate constant for drug binding to open channels was 4. 4 times greater in B cells, irrespective of membrane potential. This implies that the unblocking rate for <b>mecamylamine</b> is much slower in C cells than B cells, and it shows that the drug recognizes a structural difference between nicotinic receptors on these two populations of sympatheti...|$|E
