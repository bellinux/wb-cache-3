5|$|During the 1893 fleet maneuvers, Kaiser <b>Max</b> <b>was</b> mobilized {{to train}} {{alongside}} the ironclads , , Prinz Eugen, and , among other vessels. A new construction {{program in the}} late 1890s and early 1900s required the Austro-Hungarian Navy to discard old, obsolete vessels to reduce annual budgets.

She was converted into a barracks ship and in 1909, assigned to Cattaro Bay to serve the Arsenal Teodo, where she remained through World War I.

5|$|The ships had fairly uneventful careers, owing {{in part to}} the {{restricted}} naval budgets of the 1870s and 1880s, which precluded an active fleet policy. The three ships made one major overseas cruise to Spain in 1888 {{to take part in the}} Barcelona Universal Exposition. They were withdrawn from service in the early 1900s and converted for secondary roles; Kaiser Max and Don Juan d'Austria became barracks ships and Prinz Eugen became a repair ship and was renamed Vulkan. After World War I, Don Juan d'Austria sank under unclear circumstances while the other two ships were seized by Italy.

5|$|Upon being {{confronted by}} Scully, Sharon denies that Max brought a {{radioactive}} substance aboard the plane, but divulges {{that she is}} not actually Max's sister.

5|$|Erzherzog Ferdinand <b>Max</b> <b>was</b> {{laid down}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste on 6 May 1863. She was launched on 24 May 1865; the builders were forced to complete fitting-out work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. Erzherzog Ferdinand Maxs rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp, and {{they could not be}} delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed with old smooth-bore guns. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. With his flag aboard Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 26 June in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again could not bring the Italian fleet to battle.|$|E

She proved to be very wet forward owing to her open bow, and as a result, tended to handle poorly. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet.
