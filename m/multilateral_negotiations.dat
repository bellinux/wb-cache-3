25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|E

500|$|In the 14th century, {{many large}} scale brick {{building}} projects were undertaken during Casimir's reign, including {{the construction of}} Gothic churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents. [...] The most notable examples of architecture from the medieval period in Poland are the many churches representing the Polish Gothic style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are best revealed in the furnishings of churches and liturgical items. [...] Polish law was first codified in the Statutes of Casimir the Great (the Piotrków–Wiślica Statutes) from 1346–1362. [...] Accordingly, conflict resolution relied on legal proceedings domestically, while bilateral or <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiations</b> and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. By this time, the network of cathedral and parish schools had become well developed. In 1364, Casimir the Great established the University of Kraków, the second oldest university in Central Europe. While many still traveled to southern and western Europe for university studies, the Polish language, along with the predominant Latin, became increasingly more common in written documents. The Holy Cross Sermons (ca. early 14th century) constitute possibly the oldest extant Polish prose manuscript.|$|E
2500|$|Accordingly, the Simla Agreement was {{formulated}} {{and signed}} by the two countries, whereby the countries resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations and to maintain {{the sanctity of the}} Line of Control. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>negotiations</b> were not ruled out, but they were conditional upon both sides agreeing to them. To India, this meant an end to the UN or other <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiations.</b> However Pakistan reinterpreted the wording in the light of a reference to the [...] "UN charter" [...] in the agreement, and maintained that it could still approach the UN.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{automated}} multi-agent multi-issue negotiation solution {{to solve a}} resource allocation problem. We use a <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> model, by which three agents bid sequentially in consecutive rounds till some deadline. Two issues are bundled and negotiated concurrently, so win-win opportunities can be generated as trade-offs exist between issues. We develop negotiation strategies of the agents under an incomplete information setting. The strategies are composed of a Pareto-optimal-search method and concession strategies. An important technical contribution of this paper lies {{in the development of}} the Pareto-optimal-search method for three-agent <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation.</b> Moreover, we present the identification of agreements and Pareto-optimal outcomes achieved by our methods in mathematical proof.

40|$|The {{management}} of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> has frequently {{played a crucial}} role in developing global regimes but is often ignored in International Relations theory. The long-awaited UN climate summit in Copenhagen, for example, broke down in 2009 but negotiations reached agreement one year later in Cancún. This article argues that power and interests remained largely constant between Copenhagen and Cancún, and that the significantly altered negotiation management by the host government and the UN explains much of the difference. I develop an analytical framework to address whether and how the {{management of}} a <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> by the organizers increases or decreases the probability of agreement. The empirical focus lies on the Danish and Mexican Presidencies of climate negotiations with extensive evidence from participant observation and 55 interviews with senior negotiators, high-level UN officials, and lead organizers.

2500|$|Pacifism and revulsion {{with war}} were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems {{on the theme}} of the {{futility}} of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, Death of a Hero by Richard Aldington, Erich Remarque's translated All Quiet on the Western Front and Beverley Nichols's expose Cry Havoc. A debate at the University of Oxford in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. Dick Sheppard established the Peace Pledge Union in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiations.</b> Many members of the Peace Pledge Union later joined the Bruderhof during it's period of residence in the Cotswolds.|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{agents are}} {{software}} agents that are self-contained, {{capable of making}} independent decisions, and taking actions to satisfy internal goals based upon their perceived environment. Agent negotiation is a means for autonomous agents to communicate and compromise to reach mutually beneficial agreements. By considering the complexity of negotiation environments, agent negotiation can be classified into three levels, which are the Bilateral <b>Negotiation</b> Level, the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Negotiation</b> Level, and the Multiple Related Negotiation Level. In the Bilateral Negotiation Level, negotiations are performed between only two agents. The challenges on this level are how to predict an opponent 2 ̆ 7 s negotiation behavior, and how to reach the optimal negotiation outcome when the negotiation environment becomes open and dynamic. The contribution of this thesis on this level is (1) to propose a regression-based approach to learn, analyze and predict the opponent negotiation behaviors in open and dynamic environments based on the historical records of the current negotiation; and (2) to propose a multi-issue negotiation approach to estimate the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s negotiation preference, and {{to search for the}} bi-beneficial negotiation outcome when the opponent changes its negotiation strategies dynamically. In the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Negotiation</b> Level, negotiations are performed among more than two agents. Agents need more efficient negotiation protocols, strategies and approaches to handle outside options as well as competitions. Especially when negotiation environments become open and dynamic, future possible upcoming outside options still need to be considered. The challenge in this level is how to guide agents to efficiently and effectively reach agreements in highly open and dynamic negotiation environments, such as e-marketplaces. The contribution of this thesis on this level is (1) to propose a negotiation partner selection approach to filter out unexpected negotiation opponents before a <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> starts; (2) to extend a market-driven strategy for <b>multilateral</b> single issue <b>negotiation</b> in dynamic environments by considering upcoming changes of the environment; and (3) to propose a market-based strategy for <b>multilateral</b> multi-issue <b>negotiation</b> by considering both markets situations and agents specifications. In the Multiple Related Negotiation Level, several negotiations are processed together by agents in order to achieve a global goal. These negotiations are not absolutely independent, but some how related. In order to ensure the global goal can be efficiently achieved, factors such as the negotiation procedure, the success rate, and the expected utility for each of these related negotiations should be considered. The contribution of this thesis on this level is to introduce a Multi-Negotiation Network (MNN) and a Multi-Negotiation Inuence Diagram (MNID) to search for the optimal policy to concurrently conduct the multiple related negotiation by considering both the joint success rate and the joint utility...|$|R

40|$|Geneva trade diplomats are {{confounded by}} a serious dilemma: They {{do not know}} how to {{conclude}} the Doha Round of <b>multilateral</b> trade <b>negotiations</b> (MTNs), but they do not want to cancel them. As a consequence, the Doha Round seems likely to lapse into an indefinite period of hibernation— with little idea of when or how the talks could be awakened. If prolonged, hibernation would become the functional equivalent of termination—this is what has happened to the negotiation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. The Doha Round is not the first <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> to collapse under the weight of substantive disputes and tactical negotiating blunders, but it could well become the first <b>multilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> that could not be revived and brought to a successful conclusion. I fear that such a result could have serious deleterious effects on the World Trade Organization (WTO). This short paper examines the implications of the negotiating impasse in the Doha Round for the world trading system and for Korean trade policy. I start with an abbreviated look at where the WTO negotiations stand as the talks approach their tenth anniversary in late 2011 and summarize key reasons why the Doha Round has been unproductive to date. I then examine three major implications for Korean policy if the Doha negotiations collapse. The concluding section puts forward recommendations for unblocking the Doha Round and moving forward on an augmented negotiating agenda over the next 12 – 24 months. Current Status of the Doha Round Almost a decade ago, the 130 -odd members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) met in Doha, Qatar, and launched the ninth round of <b>multilateral</b> trade <b>negotiations</b> (MTNs) in the postwar era. The new talks were called the Doha Development Agenda; this awkward title seemed to suggest that the negotiation would be different from the previous Uruguay Round of MTNs and would focus on promoting economic development in poorer countries. But old habits are hard to break, particularly in conservative Geneva: The WTO talks have followed a familiar script and are generally called th...|$|R
