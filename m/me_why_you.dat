[...] Oliver St. John Gogarty, in his literary memoir As I Was Going Down Sackville Street, considers [...] the Pillar [...] "the grandest thing we have in Dublin", where [...] "the statue in whiter stone gazed forever south towards Trafalgar and the Nile". [...] That Pillar, says Gogarty, [...] "marks {{the end of a}} civilization, the culmination of the great [...] period of eighteenth century Dublin". [...] Yeats's 1927 poem [...] "The Three Monuments" [...] has Parnell, Nelson and O'Connell [...] on their respective monuments, mocking Ireland's post-independence leaders for their rigid morality and lack of courage, the obverse of the qualities of the [...] "three old rascals".A later writer, Brendan Behan, in his Confessions of an Irish Rebel (1965) wrote from a Fenian perspective that Ireland owed Nelson nothing and that Dublin's poor regarded the Pillar as [...] "a gibe at their own helplessness in their own country". In his poem [...] "Dublin" [...] (1939), written as the remaining vestiges of British overlordship were being removed from Ireland, Louis MacNeice envisages [...] "Nelson on his pillar/ Watching his world collapse".Austin Clarke's 1957 poem [...] "Nelson's Pillar, Dublin" [...] scorns the various schemes to remove the monument and concludes [...] "Let him watch the sky/ With those who rule. Stone eye/ And telescopes [...] can prove/ Our blessings are above".|$|E
