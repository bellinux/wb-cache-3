First, he applies the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics remain the same for any non-accelerating frame of reference (called an inertial reference frame), to the laws of electrodynamics and optics as well as mechanics. In the second postulate, Einstein proposes that the speed of light has the same value in all inertial frames of reference, independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.|$|E

The non-linear dynamics of the mechanical rotation motion is also revealed and described with an effective Duffing model.

2500|$|It's notable that Einstein's paper {{contains}} no direct references to other papers.

Regarding the Relativity Principle, the <b>moving</b> <b>magnet</b> and conductor problem (possibly after reading a book of August Föppl) and the various negative aether drift experiments were important for him to accept that principle— but he denied any significant influence of the most important experiment: the Michelson–Morley experiment. Other likely influences include Poincaré's Science and Hypothesis, where Poincaré presented the Principle of Relativity (which, as has been reported by Einstein's friend Maurice Solovine, was closely studied and discussed by Einstein and his friends {{over a period of years}} before the publication of Einstein's 1905 paper), and the writings of Max Abraham, from whom he borrowed the terms [...] "Maxwell-Hertz equations" [...] and [...] "longitudinal and transverse mass".|$|E
