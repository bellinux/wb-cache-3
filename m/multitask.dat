40|$|<b>Multitasking</b> using {{information}} systems (IS) comprised of hardware, software, and networks is growing such {{that there is}} a blurring between personal and work lives. Consequently, it is important to study the antecedents and effects of IS <b>multitasking</b> (Spink et al., 2008). There exists an overwhelming body of literature that points to overall negative effects of traditional <b>multitasking.</b> Surprisingly, research on IS <b>multitasking</b> is relatively scarce (Benbunan-Fich et al., 2009; Spink and Waller, 2008). To address this gap in research, we hypothesize and test a research model that identifies antecedents and outcomes of IS <b>multitasking.</b> Subjects were drawn from ‘millenials’ that have grown up using multiple IS devices and are ready to enter the workforce. Contrary to prior research, we find that IS <b>multitasking</b> leads to significant positive effects on ‘cognitive absorption’, ‘change in mental models’ (or learning), and ‘IS usage’. In turn, IS <b>multitasking</b> was significantly predicted by ‘personal innovativeness with technology’ and ‘computer polychronicity’ It is possible that <b>multitasking</b> in today’s world with information devices is a unique phenomenon that differs from traditional <b>multitasking.</b> Our study has implications for attitudes toward IS <b>multitasking</b> as well as designing training activities and <b>multitasking</b> systems...|$|R
25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit protected mode if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to <b>multitask</b> real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E

2500|$|One {{criticism}} of Strauss and Howe's theory, {{and the field}} of [...] "generational studies" [...] in general, is that conclusions are overly broad and {{do not reflect the}} reality of every person in each generation regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, or genetic information For example, Hoover cited the case of Millennials by writing that [...] "commentators have tended to slap the Millennial label on white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who <b>multitask</b> with ease as their helicopter parents hover reassuringly above them.

30|$|Research on the {{relationship}} of metacognition and the effects of <b>multitasking</b> on reading comprehension illustrate the intersection of self-regulation and working memory. Visual working memory theories examine the role of self-regulation in selecting and maintaining task-relevant visual targets. Thus, self-awareness is critical in mitigating the effects of media <b>multitasking.</b> Yet, students do not effectively self-regulate their media <b>multitasking</b> and are poor at recognizing and regulating inhibitors of performance. While students recognize that <b>multitasking</b> divides their attention, media <b>multitasking</b> reduces both accuracy and confidence in predicting impact on task performance. Self-regulation is an important skill in addressing <b>multitasking</b> and is an area of interest for future research, as students are not successful in managing their <b>multitasking</b> to avoid inhibiting performance or efficiency. Research on methods to foster student recognition of the deleterious effects of media <b>multitasking,</b> as well as development of self-regulation skills, can offer insight to classroom technology policy and instruction.|$|R

30|$|Individual {{differences}} in media <b>multitasking</b> have typically been estimated using the Media <b>Multitasking</b> Index (MMI) of Ophir et al. (2009) where participants’ self-reports {{on how much}} each form of media is used with each other media form allow a calculation of the frequency of media <b>multitasking</b> for that individual. MMI scores allow one to examine the cognitive and personality characteristics {{that are associated with}} media <b>multitasking</b> and identify those characteristics that can discriminate HMMs from light media multitaskers (LMMs). A profile is emerging that suggests that HMMs process information with less goal-relevant selectivity in both visual search (Cain & Mitroff, 2011; Lui & Wong, 2012) and working memory tasks (Ophir et al., 2009; Sanbonmatsu, Strayer, Medeiros-Ward, & Watson, 2013). This difficulty in ignoring irrelevant information has been interpreted as HMMs having reduced cognitive control abilities – a supposition supported by the finding that HMMs have reduced gray-matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex (Loh & Kanai, 2014), an area implicated in the coordinated control of goal-directed behavior (e.g., Bush, Luu, & Posner, 2000). Frequent media <b>multitasking</b> does not appear to lead to improved <b>multitasking</b> performance or the ability to accurately evaluate one’s own <b>multitasking</b> ability. Sanbonmatsu et al. (2013) found that media <b>multitasking</b> scores were negatively related to actual <b>multitasking</b> ability on an executive control working memory task even though media <b>multitasking</b> scores were positively related to self-perceived <b>multitasking</b> ability.|$|R

50|$|The {{human brain}} {{has only one}} {{spotlight}} meaning it can only focus on one thing, so multitasking is a myth. Brains {{are not meant to}} <b>multitask</b> with more than one activity that requires attention (natural reflexes such as breathing and pumping blood don’t count). Multitasking requires our brains to switch attention from one item to the next, taking time between each switch, often leaving the person to “lose track” of their work as a side effect of trying to <b>multitask.</b> Trying to <b>multitask</b> takes a person up to 50% longer to complete a single task and can make up to 50% more mistakes. Those who appear to be good at multitasking simply have good memory to restart the tasks where they left off previously.|$|E

Furthermore, students do not accurately predict its impact on task performance. A possible explanation is that <b>multitasking</b> while studying hinders the implementation of an appropriate learning strategy.

5000|$|A touchstone 2009 {{study by}} Stanford University used {{experiments}} to compare heavy media multitaskers to light media multitaskers {{in terms of}} their cognitive control and ability to process information. Findings from the experiment include: 1) When intentionally distracting elements were added to experiments, heavy media multitaskers were on average 77 milliseconds slower than their light media multitasker counterparts at identifying changes in patterns; 2) In a longer-term memory test that invited participants to recall specific elements from earlier experiments, the high media multitaskers more often falsely identified the elements that had been used most frequently as intentional distracters; 3) In the presence of distracting elements, high media multitaskers were 426 milliseconds slower than their counterparts to switch to new activities and 259 milliseconds slower to engage in a new section of the same activity. The researchers conclude that the experiments [...] "suggest that heavy media multitaskers are distracted by the multiple streams of media they are consuming, or, alternatively, that those who infrequently <b>multitask</b> are more effective at volitionally allocating their attention in the face of distractions". This slowing in performance that can be seen when people <b>multitask</b> is called interference in the cognitive bottleneck theory (CBT). According to this theory, people have only a limited amount of cognitive resources, which allows us to only focus and complete one task at a time. When people try to do several things at once, or <b>multitask,</b> their performance suffers because the completion of their tasks slowed down, due to a constraint called a cognitive bottleneck. A good metaphor to describe the cognitive bottleneck is that of a traffic jam. When an accident occurs on a highway, and several lanes of cars are forced to pass through a single lane, the traffic slows down. Over the decades of research, researchers tried to disprove this theory. Although scientists found a handful of activities that people can do at the same time without slowing, these activities are so simple and so far removed from what people normally do, they cannot be used as support for people's ability to <b>multitask.</b> In fact, a top team of researchers reviewed the extensive literature on multitasking and concluded that hundreds of studies show that slowing will happen when people try to <b>multitask,</b> and even many of the studies that were designed to show that people can <b>multitask</b> without interference still showed that they cannot <b>multitask.</b> Therefore, these researchers warn people that when they attempt to <b>multitask,</b> especially when doing complex and potentially dangerous tasks (such as driving and using their cell-phones to talk or text), they will always encounter the bottleneck which will cause their performance to suffer, either by being slower than usual or by making more mistakes.|$|E
