500|$|In the 1939–40 season, Ring {{played in}} all of Victoria's Sheffield Shield matches, and {{though he did not}} improve on either his best bowling or best batting figures, he took over as the side's {{principal}} spin bowler from Fleetwood-Smith, with 28 wickets in the six matches against the senior player's 17. At the end of the season, he was picked for [...] "The Rest" [...] team, composed of the best players from the other states, for the match against the Shield winners, New South Wales, though he was upstaged by the 48-year-old Clarrie Grimmett, who took 10 wickets to Ring's one in the match. Wisden noted in a brief report on the 1939–40 Sheffield Shield in its 1940 edition that Bill O'Reilly, Grimmett and Ring [...] "carried off chief bowling honours in the competition". Prior to the Second World War, the Australian captain Don Bradman said of Ring: [...] "If I were picking an Australian XI to go to England now, one of the first men on <b>my</b> <b>list</b> would be Doug Ring".|$|E
500|$|... "Sooner or Later" [...] was {{composed}} as a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass and horns. Rooksby described the track as [...] "conjuring {{the atmosphere of}} a smoky nightclub". Madonna sings in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. It opens with a [...] "lazy" [...] clarinet solo and portrays the singer {{as a kind of}} sexual magnate. [...] "I always get my man", she sings [...] "If you're on <b>my</b> <b>list</b> it's just a question of when". The song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 75 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna's voice spanning from F3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of B9–B6/F–B9–B6/F as its chord progression. In the film, [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] is the signature song of Breathless and was primarily performed during a montage just after Dick Tracy has placed a microphone in Alphonse [...] "Big Boy" [...] Caprice's boardroom and operator.|$|E

So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Madeon was associated with co-writing and co-producing three songs on Artpop, [...] "Venus", [...] "Mary Jane Holland" [...] and [...] "Gypsy". In August 2013, while being interviewed by French radio station, Fun Radio, Gaga confirmed that she had recorded [...] "Gypsy" [...] with Madeon and RedOne, as well as White Shadow. Having mutual respect for each others' work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. He reminds me of myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." [...] "Gypsy" [...] was described as Artpops most personal song, about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it.

500|$|On February 27, 2011, he and Anne Hathaway {{hosted the}} 83rd Academy Awards. The two were {{selected}} to help the awards show achieve its goal of attracting a younger audience. Franco had previously said that he accepted the job for the experience {{and because it was}} a once in a lifetime opportunity. Numerous media viewers criticized Franco for his discontent and lack of energy on stage and the show was widely panned, with some reviewers dubbing it the worst telecast in its history. The actor later spoke about his hosting in an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman. He explained that when accepting the job he never had high hopes, adding [...] "It was never on <b>my</b> <b>list</b> of things to do. It doesn't mean I didn't care and it doesn't mean I didn't try, right?” Regarding allegations that he was under the influence of marijuana while hosting, Franco commented [...] "I think the Tasmanian Devil would look stoned standing next to Anne Hathaway. She has a lot of energy!" [...] He concluded that he tried his best and could have had [...] "low energy" [...] during the telecast.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of the White House. About it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I have to confess that <b>my</b> <b>list</b> of reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is surely {{as simple as it}} seems: This is a recent hit song whose title is dominated by the words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it. Cyrus' video [...] is stocked with a great many of those things we like and do well: a drive-in theater, trucks and muscle cars, Daisy Dukes, giant flags. It is, just like bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} he only {{managed to}} play one match before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005, this time to League Two club Bristol Rovers, {{until the end of}} the season. He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2–1 victory away to Notts County. He stated his desire to stay at the club long-term in April 2005, saying [...] "I do need a change, just to get myself going again really because it has been disappointing not playing." [...] He made his first start for the club in a 4–0 away defeat against Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005. The loan expired in May 2005 after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club. Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two-year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him, saying [...] "He was high on <b>my</b> <b>list.</b> There are not many players who can play left-back, wing-back or as out-and-out wingers". However, after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football, he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005.|$|E

500|$|Peel was {{the first}} English bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Australia. At a time when {{international}} matches were relatively rare, his 20 Test matches were a considerable achievement, and it was unusual for a player to tour Australia {{as often as he}} did: he went there four times. His main rival as a spinner and for a place in the England team was Johnny Briggs; Peel bowled faster, which made him harder to hit. Archie MacLaren, who captained England from the late 1890s and was a team-mate and captain of Briggs, described Peel as [...] "the cleverest bowler of my time". MacLaren stated that Peel thoroughly understood tactics and could spot weaknesses in a batsman's technique. He concluded: [...] "I place Peel first on <b>my</b> <b>list</b> of great left-handed bowlers on account of his wonderful judgement, his diabolical cleverness and his great natural ability." [...] When Rhodes took over the role of left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, there was some debate over who out of Peate, Peel and Rhodes was the best left-arm spinner to play for Yorkshire. Historians regard Peel as part of a long-lasting chain of successful Yorkshire left-arm spinners, preceded by Peate and succeeded by Rhodes.|$|E
500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on <b>my</b> <b>list,</b> mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

[...] However, {{when asked whether}} he liked Spamalot during an interview with Dennis Daniel on 98.5 WBON-FM The Bone shortly after the musical's opening on Broadway, Jones said, [...] "Well, I thought it was terrific good fun.

They do them terribly well…I mean, they really are good…but I just quite don’t understand what that's about. [...] It isn’t really 'Python.' It is very much Eric." [...] Jones went on to say, [...] "...I think {{the best parts of}} the musical are the new things. For instance, when they do the Andrew Lloyd Webber take-off and this girl comes in and sings 'Whatever Happened to My Part' since she hasn’t appeared since the opening number and she's really furious!

[...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much to stand there singing this song that does my head in and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E

In November 2012, Marvel Comics teased the announcement of The Fearless Defenders by releasing an image of the word [...] "Fearless" [...] with the creative team of Bunn and artist Will Sliney. A week later, Marvel made the full announcement. Bunn said, [...] "The basic idea of the book is that Valkyrie is choosing a new team of Valkyrior, and she's been asked to choose all these women from the heroes of Midgard (Earth), instead of from Asgard". Bunn also said that Misty Knight co-stars in the series, [...] "They're our co-leads, {{and the rest of the}} team will build around them. I think it'll be interesting to see how the two of them see things differently. You've got Misty, who's a very street-level character. And you've got Valkyrie, who's a goddess". Dani Moonstar was revealed as the third member of team. Bunn said, [...] "She has such a connection to the Valkyrie.
