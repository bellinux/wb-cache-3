However, this communication represents the sorption at natural pH of dye solution and ambient temperature. Spent R. arrhizus biomass furnished <b>maximum</b> sorption <b>capacity</b> for dye metanil yellow (128.5  mg/g) and dye sunset yellow FCF (51.9  mg/g). Tamarind pod shells at pH 2 showed 65.04  mg/g <b>maximum</b> sorption <b>capacity</b> for dye amaranth, whereas spent biomass showed 47.0  mg/g at natural pH. In the case of dye acid red 88, 0.1  M HCl treated Azolla filiculoides biomass gave <b>maximum</b> sorption <b>capacity</b> (123.5  mg/g), while spent biomass showed 108.8  mg/g at natural pH and ambient temperature.

40|$|In {{the past}} maximum aerobic power tests {{have been the}} {{standard}} means for measuring the trained state. Recent literature, however, states {{that the ability to}} work aerobically at a high percentage of one's maximum aerobic power, referred to as <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity,</b> may be an equally effective means for indicating a person's state of training. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a simple technique to measure <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity</b> and relate this value to the person's state of training. Twenty trained and twenty untrained subjects ranging in age from 18 to 42 years participated in the study. Participants who accumulated in excess of an average of fifty Cooper points per week were considered as being trained, A re-test was administered to establish the reliability of using ventilation for measuring <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity.</b> The trained participants had a significantly greater mean level of <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity</b> than the untrained participants. Maximum aerobic power values correlated significantly with <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity</b> values, and <b>maximum</b> aerobic power and the participant's age had a significantly greater correlation than <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity</b> and the participant's age. There was no evidence that the <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity</b> test was any less efficient than the maximum aerobic power test for separating out levels of training, but the former was much easier to administer. Since <b>maximum</b> aerobic <b>capacity</b> was less related to age than maximum aerobic power it might be a better test for evaluating a person's state of training...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of bistatic multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems design for parameters estimation. <b>Maximum</b> channel <b>capacity</b> is used as criterion for the problem of optimal systems design under transmitted power constraint and channel constraint. We obtain that the system design based on <b>maximum</b> channel <b>capacity</b> can be expressed as a joint optimization problem. Given the number of transmit antenna, the number of receive antenna and signal-noise ratio (SNR), the <b>maximum</b> channel <b>capacity</b> can be determined. This <b>maximum</b> channel <b>capacity</b> {{can be obtained from}} a unique appropriate power allocation and antenna placement strategy, which is very important for system design. 1...|$|R

It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length.
