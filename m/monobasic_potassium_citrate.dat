40|$|Effect of potassium-magnesium citrate on urinary {{biochemistry}} and crystallization of stone-forming salts {{was compared}} with that of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> at same dose of potassium in five normal subjects and five patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. Compared to the placebo phase, urinary pH rose significantly from 6. 06 +/- 0. 27 to 6. 48 +/- 0. 36 (mean +/- SD, p less than 0. 0167) during treatment with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> (50 mEq/day for 7 days) and to 6. 68 +/- 0. 31 during therapy with potassium-magnesium citrate (containing 49 mEq K, 24. 5 mEq Mg, and 73. 5 mEq citrate per day). Urinary pH was significantly higher during potassium-magnesium <b>citrate</b> than during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy. Thus, the amount of undissociated uric acid declined from 118 +/- 61 mg/day during the placebo phase to 68 +/- 54 mg/day during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> treatment and, more prominently, to 41 +/- 46 mg/day during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy. Urinary magnesium rose significantly from 102 +/- 25 to 146 +/- 37 mg/day during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy but not during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy. Urinary citrate rose more prominently during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy (to 1027 +/- 478 mg/day from 638 +/- 252 mg/day) than during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> treatment (to 932 +/- 297 mg/day). Consequently, urinary saturation (activity product) of calcium oxalate declined significantly (from 1. 49 x 10 (- 8) to 1. 03 x 10 (- 8) M 2) during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy and marginally (to 1. 14 x 10 (- 8) M 2) during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy.

40|$|Citrate is an {{inhibitor}} of the crystallization of stone-forming calcium salts. Hypocitraturia, frequently {{encountered in}} patients with nephrolithiasis, is therefore an important risk factor for stone formation. <b>Potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> provides physiological and physicochemical correction and inhibits new stone formation, not only in hypocitraturic calcium nephrolithiasis but also in uric acid nephrolithiasis. Inhibition of stone recurrence has now been validated by a randomized trial. Ongoing research has disclosed additional causes of hypocitraturia (sodium excess, low intestinal alkali absorption, but not primary citrate malabsorption). Moreover, new insights on <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> action have been shown, notably that some of absorbed citrate escapes oxidation and contributes to the citraturic response, that ingestion with a meal does not sacrifice physiological or physicochemical action, that orange juice mimics but does not completely duplicate its actions, that <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> may have a beneficial bone-sparing effect, that it may reduce stone fragments following ESWL, and that danger of aluminum toxicity is not great in subjects with functioning kidneys.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the inhibition effects of the terpenoid of Plantago major on calcium oxalate crystals in vitro and to compare the effects of Plantago major with clinically used drugs like zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> for the treatment of urinary stone. Modified Schneider slide gel method was used for in vitro study and crystals formed were measured by Image Analyser System (Leica) after 24 h of treatment. The active compound in the methanol extract of Plantago major was isolated by bioassay - guided fractionation & isolation method. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control and zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> were used as positive controls. The results showed that crude methanol extract of Plantago major contained the active compound terpenoid. Terpenoid, zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> at concentrations in the range of (100 μg/ml - 250 μg/ml) significantly inhibited the area of crystal formation in comparison to the negative control after 24 h (p< 0. 001). The Zyloric and terpenoid of Plantago major in the concentrations of (100 μg/mL- 250 μg/mL) inhibited the sizes of crystals significantly (p< 0. 05). <b>Potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> was more effective, than terpenoid of Plantago major in inhibiting the size of crystals at two concentrations i. e 100 μg/mL and 150 μg/mL respectively (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} by {{a prospective}} randomized controlled study {{the efficacy of}} the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and dry extract of couch grass (Agropyrum repens) (CalcoMEV®) in renal stone treatment. Materials and Methods: 50 patients with nephrolithiasis associated with one or more active metabolic alterations that constitute an indication to the use of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> were randomly divided in two equal unblinded treatment groups. A group of patients was assigned to treatment with the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and couch grass (at the dose of 24 mEq of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and 100 mg of dry extract of Agropyrum repens bis in die) and the other group to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> (at a dose of 20 mEq ter in die). Each form of main treatment was associated, depending on the results of metabolic basal assessment, to allopurinol and/or an association of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide and/or pyridoxine. Patients of both groups were advised the same diet based on a reduced intake of sodium, foods rich in oxalate and protein of animal origin, a normalized intake of calcium and an increase in fluid intake (> 2 liters every day). Results: At the end of the 5 -month follow-up period, the group treated with the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and couch grass showed a significant reduction in the total number of stones (- 1. 0 ± 0. 2 vs 0. 0 ± 0. 2 stones) and in the larger diameter of the stones (- 3. 6 ± 0. 9 mm vs 0. 0 ± 0. 8 mm), as well as a statistically significant reduction of uric acid urinary excretion (- 164. 7 ± 45. 3 vs - 38 ± 42 mg/ 24 h). No significant differences in the two groups were observed with respect to urinary citrate, oxalate and calcium urinary excretions and urinary pH. Conclusions: This prospective randomized study demonstrates the superiority of the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and dry extract of couch grass, in combination with standard pharmacological and dietary treatment, in reducing the number and size of urinary stones with respect to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> in association with the same pharmacological and dietary regimen...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acidosis and {{transplantation}} {{are associated}} with increased risk of bone disturbances. This study aimed to assess bone morphology and metabolism in acidotic patients with a renal graft, and to ameliorate bone characteristics by restoration of acid/base homeostasis with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate.</b> METHODS: This was a 12 -month controlled, randomized, interventional trial that included 30 renal transplant patients with metabolic acidosis (S-[HCO(3) (-) ] 24 mmol/L, or potassium chloride (control group). Iliac crest bone biopsies and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Bone biopsies were analyzed by in vitro micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry, including tetracycline double labeling. Serum biomarkers of bone turnover were measured at baseline and study end. Twenty-three healthy participants with normal kidney function comprised the reference group. RESULTS: Administration of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> resulted in persisting normalization of S-[HCO(3) (-) ] versus potassium chloride. At 12 months, bone surface, connectivity density, cortical thickness, and cortical porosity were better preserved with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> than with <b>potassium</b> chloride, respectively. Serological biomarkers and bone tetracycline labeling indicate higher bone turnover with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> versus <b>potassium</b> chloride. In contrast, no relevant changes in bone mineral density were detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> in renal transplant patients is efficient and well tolerated for correction of metabolic acidosis and {{may be associated with}} improvement in bone quality.

The {{absorption of}} citrate was less efficient from a tablet preparation of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> than from a liquid preparation, probably due to a delayed release of citrate from wax matrix.
