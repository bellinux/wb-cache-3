Polyphenol oxidases are enzymes that cause enzymatic browning by conversion of natural phenolic compounds, such as monophenols to o-dihydroxyaryl compounds and subsequent oxidation to o-quinones [1]. These highly electrophilic species bind rapidly to nucleophilic sites on other compounds (e. g. phenols, amino-acids and proteins) and condense with phenols to form brown-, black- or red-colored polymers, associated with the undesired discoloration of fruit and vegetables. Recently, high levels of PPO activity {{have been reported in}} orchard grass [2]; however, to date, no endogenous substrates have been identified. In the present study, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of PPO substrates in this species. The free phenol fraction was extracted, separated by reverse-phase chromatography and six potential substrates, including two novel hydroxycinnamate esters (2 -O-caffeoylisocitric acid 6 -methyl ester and 2 -O-caffeoylthreonic acid), were identified by UV spectrometry, electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MSn) and 1 D and 2 D NMR analyses (1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, DEPT, COSY, HMQC and HMBC). Furthermore, three caffeoylquinic acids (3 -CQA, 4 -CQA and 5 -CQA) were identified by comparison of their spectral data (ESI-MS) with those of known compounds and literature data. Five of the isolated compounds (i. e. chlorogenic acid, 2 -O-caffeoylisocitric acid, 2 -O-caffeoylisocitric acid 6 -methyl ester, 2 -O-caffeoylthreonic acid and 2 -O-caffeoylhydroxycitric acid) were demonstrated to be substrates for orchard grass PPO.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} conventional and organic arable farming on soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil structure, aggregate stability and C and N mineralization, which are considered important factors in defining sustainable land management. Within one soil series, three different farming systems were selected, including a conventional and an organic arable system <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> without tillage. The old pasture represents optimal conditions in terms of soil structure and organic matter inputs and is characterized by high earthworm activity. More than 70 years of different management has caused significant differences in soil properties. SOM content, mineralization, earthworm activity and water-stable aggregation decreased {{as a result of}} tillage and arable cropping when compared with pasture, but were significantly greater under organic farming than under conventional farming. Total SOM contents between 0 and 20 cm depth amounted to 15, 24 and 46 g kg(- 1) for the conventional arable, organic arable <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> fields, respectively. Although less sensitive to slaking than the conventionally managed field, the soil under organic farming was susceptible to compaction when high pressures were exerted on the soil under wet conditions. The beneficial effects of organic farming are generally associated with soil biochemical properties, but soil physical aspects should also be considered.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project were to compare different cultivar types and methods {{to establish and maintain}} them in reseeded <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures</b> as a basis for efficient low cost sheep production. In Ireland only 3 % of pastures are reseeded annually <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures</b> rarely contain more than 5 % white clover. Improved clover content offers benefits of higher lamb growth rate and reduced fertiliser N use. Comparisons under cutting conditions provided no basis for replacement of Grasslands Huia by the new cultivar Aberherald. Grasslands Huia established successfully following direct reseeding and rotational grazing by sheep. It established more quickly than Kentish and gave higher yield only in the first year. A mixture of small and medium size white clovers should be sown for sheep grazing. Increasing seeding rate from 2 to 4 kg per ha increased pasture clover content only in the first year. Grasslands Huia persisted quite well for up to 5 years under rotational sheep grazing. It also survived under continuous grazing but leaf size was reduced. Rotational grazing management with sheep increased the clover content of <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> from under 2 % to 4 % over 2 years. Highest clover yields were achieved with rest intervals of 20 to 28 days. Simulated mixed sheep and cattle rotational grazing on <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> resulted in intermediate (10 to 12 %) clover dry matter contributions to total dry matter compared with cattle (15 to 18 %) and sheep (5 to 8 %).

Four different land use types were considered including arable land which is characterised with heavy cultural operations, ley <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> which have had intense cropping and livestock grazing and now left fallowa; also, moor-land having. mainly extensive grazing activities. Soil moisture was recorded on the field using theta probe and Soil samples were collected from all the different types of land use and were analysed in the laboratory for Soil organic matter content, soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat). Soil organic matter content (loss on ignition) were in the order arable (9. 4 %) < ley pasture (12. 6 %) < <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> (13. 5 %) and moor-land (25. 9 %); soil bulk density tended to be higher for <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> (1. 17 g 1 cm 3) followed by that of arable land (1. 16 g/cm 3) but the moor land had the least value for bulk density; Value for soil moisture indicated that the open moorland had the highest value of 55. 51 % while the arable land use recorded the least (39. 68 %), on the other hand, the saturated hydraulic conductivity indicated that arable land use showed the lowest value followed by ley pasture but moorland showed a relatively high value for saturated hydraulic conductivity.

Of the cereal fields sampled, those under organic management held the greatest AMF diversity, and in a glasshouse experiment this greater diversity was positively related to barley phosphorus uptake and grain biomass production. Our results demonstrate the impact of different agricultural practices on AMF communities.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Within organic systems, the successful management of nutrients at the field level is crucial for maximising production and minimising the environmental impacts. This requires that the farmer makes the best possible use of nutrients excreted by the grazing or housed livestock. In addition, the farmer must successfully manage the nutrients built-up in the ley phase of the crop rotation over the whole of the arable phase period. To analyse these complex flows, a nutrient budget model has been developed that describes the spatial and temporal flows within the organic farming system. The concept is analogous to treating nutrients as a currency where the flow of nutrients represents a cashflow. A spatial nutrient budget permits the analyses of the performance of the nutrient flows to be examined for the housing, manure, livestock, rotational land <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> to be analysed separately. This analysis will allow the farmer to better understand the weaknesses in the system, and hence take preventative measures...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{functions}} can {{be classified}} as supporting (nutrient cycling) and provisioning (crop production) ecosystem services (ES). These services consist of multiple and dynamic functions and are typically assessed using indicators, e. g. microbial biomass {{as an indicator of}} supporting services. Agricultural intensification negatively affects indicators of soil functions and is therefore considered to deplete soil ES. It has been suggested that incorporating leys into crop rotations can enhance soil ES. We examined this by comparing indicators of supporting soil services - organic carbon, nitrogen, water holding capacity and available phosphorous (carbon storage and nutrient retention); net nitrogen mineralisation rate and microbial biomass (nutrient cycling and retention) - in barley fields, leys <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures</b> along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (100, 500 and 1000 m radii). In addition, barley yields (provisioning service) were analysed against these indicators to identify trade-offs among soil services. Levels of most indicators did not differ between barley and ley fields and were consistently lower than in <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures.</b> Leys supported greater microbial biomass than barley fields. Landscape heterogeneity had no effect on the indicators or microbial community composition. However, landscape heterogeneity correlated negatively with yield and soil pH, suggesting that soils in heterogeneous landscapes are less fertile and therefore have lower yields. No trade-offs were found between increasing barley yield and the soil indicators. The results suggest that soil ES are determined at the field level, with little influence from the surrounding landscape, and that greater crop yields do not necessarily {{come at the expense of}} supporting soil services.

It focuses on evaluating changes in the use, management and conservation of land resources, which the panel believed are likely have effects orders of magnitude greater than any other positive impacts of CGIAR research. Given the shortage of reliable data, the method used was analysis of different scenarios, rather than economic models. The authors concluded that a very large amount of land, in excess of that available, would have been required to equal the increased production of seven mandate crops <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> attributed to CGIAR research. The study concluded by listing issues for further empirical assessment, questions on next steps, and recommendations on further activity. In view of the large costs involved, it suggested that the CGIAR provide guidance on the depth and breadth of {{evaluation of}} environmental impact it desired...|$|R
40|$|The habitat {{selection}} of the ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana has been examined on multiple spatial scales. Habitat variables of territories and random points were measured in the field on a 25 m radius and from GIS layers on scales of 25 m, 100 m, 500 m and 1, 000 m radius. Habitat variables were analysed by a generalized linear model. The ortolan bunting was found on a 25 m radius in areas with a few black pines, with low grass and open patches within the herbaceous layer. On a 100 m radius scale, the probability of occurrence was highest in areas with meadows with large trees, <b>permanent</b> <b>and</b> partly overgrown <b>meadows,</b> <b>and</b> small areas of forests. On a 500 m radius scale, the occurrence of the ortolan bunting was negatively affected by urban areas and their infrastructure and by forests, and positively by partly overgrown <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>meadows</b> with or without large trees. On a 1, 000 m radius, permanent meadows with or without large trees, {{and the absence of}} large urban areas and infrastructure positively affected the presence of the ortolan bunting. In conclusion, factors influencing habitat selection by the ortolan bunting differ according to spatial scale. On the territorial level, its presence was only influenced by cover of open <b>and</b> partly overgrown <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> by forest, while on larger scales it was also affected by the cover of urban areas. Factors influence habitat selection differently on different scales; a forest influences the probability of a territory positively on a small scale while negatively on larger scales. Factors influencing the habitat selection positively on a larger scale are becoming less common and therefore fewer suitable sites are available for the ortolan bunting in Kra...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Photovoltaic (solar) cells (Corkish, 2004) are {{semiconductor}} devices that directly create electric current and voltage {{from the collection}} of photons (quanta of light). They convert sunlight to electricity silently and without moving parts, require little maintenance, are reliable, being sold with warranties of up to twenty-five years, generate no greenhouse gases in operation and are modular, rapidly deployable and particularly suited to urban rooftops, façades and similar applications. Hence, they are easily located close to where electricity is consumed. Solar cells of 15 % efficiency covering an area equivalent to just 0. 25 % of the global area under crops <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> could meet all the world's primary energy requirements today (Archer and Hill, 2001), yet most or all of that area could be otherwise alienated land, such as on buildings, for example. "On any given day, the solar energy falling on a typical oilfield in the Middle East is far greater than the energy contained in the oil extracted from it. " (CarbonFree, 2006). However, solar cells remain an expensive option for most power generation requirements relative to fossil and nuclear sources, especially if the natural environment is attributed little or no value, and to some other sustainable options such as the enhancement energy efficiency, solar thermal (eg. solar water heating) or wind energy. Photovoltaics are synergistic with efficiency enhancement and solar thermal use and are usually more easily applied in urban situations than are wind turbines. Here, we aim to acquaint practising architects, builders and engineers with the fundamentals of solar photovoltaic energy production and devices and building-related applications (Green, 1995, Wenham et al., 2006, Prasad & Snow, 2005, Strong et al., 2005, Sick, 1996) ...|$|R
40|$|Description of the subject. This article {{deals with}} soil {{macrofauna}} {{as a key}} component of soil biological functioning. Objectives. This original study, performed in 2015, aimed to compare the effect of contrasted land uses and cultural practices on soil macrofauna in a crop-livestock area in the Madagascar Highlands. Five cropping systems were investigated: annual crops under tillage with low (LAMF) and high (LAEF) manure inputs, permanent tilled forage crops with high manure inputs (CFEF), crops under conservation agriculture without tillage or <b>permanent</b> mulch cover <b>and</b> with medium manure inputs (ACMF), <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures</b> without tillage <b>and</b> without manure (PP 0 F). Method. In each of these five cropping systems, soil macrofauna was sampled in 12 plots from experimental trials and smallholder farms {{at the end of the}} rainy season. In each plot, soil macrofauna was hand-sorted from five soil monoliths at a 0 - 30 cm depth. Results. Fifty-two species were identified and organized into 15 orders and six functional groups. In the annual cropping systems (ACMF), the absence of tillage and the presence of a permanent soil cover increased soil macrofauna diversity and density without reducing harmful white grubs (Scarabeoid beetle larvae), while earthworm density was reduced in comparison with the CFEF system. In conventional tillage cropping systems, manure input intensity (LAMF versus LAEF) had no specific effects on white grubs or earthworms. Conclusions. This study on soil macrofauna in the Highlands of Madagascar helped to establish which agricultural practices and farming systems are favourable to beneficial soil invertebrates such as earthworms, and unfavourable to harmful insects such as white grubs. This will help farmers to achieve a more sustainable crop management...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} United Kingdom's society's long-term intervention into the energy flows of domestic terrestrial ecosystems through the human appropriation of aboveground net primary production (aHANPP) covering the period 1800 - 2000. The depicted aHANPP trajectory and {{the historical development of}} its components are discussed in view of a continuously increasing population and the transition process from an agrarian to an industrial socioecological regime. During the 19 th century, aHANPP shows a steady decline from its level of 71 % in 1800. While even higher levels were reached during the mid 20 th century, the trend during the last forty years of the period under investigation again shows a reduction of aHANPP, which lies at 68 % in the year 2000. The high values of aHANPP in the United Kingdom are primarily attributable to the limited amount of forest in comparison to large agricultural areas. At the beginning of the studied period, the relative stabilisation or even decrease in aHANPP in comparison to population development was made possible through the area expansion of and productivity increases on cropland <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures.</b> Later this was made possible through the outsourcing of biomass harvest, by satisfying local nutritional demands by means of overseas imports, and as from the mid 20 th century through huge amounts of fossil fuel based inputs into agriculture (e. g. increased amounts of fertilizers and motorized traction) which allowed increases in biomass harvest to be decoupled from HANPP.

40|$|The use of {{annually}} sown pastures {{to provide}} winter forage {{is common in}} dairy farming in many regions of the world. Loss of organic matter and soil structural stability due to annual tillage under this management may be contributing to soil degradation. The comparative effects of annual ryegrass pastures (conventionally tilled and resown each year), <b>permanent</b> kikuyu <b>pastures</b> <b>and</b> undisturbed native vegetation on soil organic matter content, microbial size and activity, and aggregate stability were investigated on commercial dairy farms in the Tsitsikamma region of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. In comparison with soils under sparse, native grassy vegetation, those under both annual ryegrass <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> kikuyu <b>pasture</b> had higher soil organic matter content on the very sandy soils of {{the eastern end of}} the region. By contrast, in the higher rainfall, western side, where the native vegetation was coastal forest, there was a loss of organic matter under both types of pasture. Nonetheless, soil organic C, K 2 SO 4 -extractable C, microbial biomass C, basal respiration, arginine ammonification and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis rates and aggregate stability were less under annual than <b>permanent</b> <b>pastures</b> at all the sites. These results reflect the degrading effect of annual tillage on soil organic matter and the positive effect of grazed <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> on soil microbial activity and aggregation. Soil organic C, microbial biomass C, K 2 SO 4 -extractable C, basal respiration and aggregate stability were significantly correlated with each other. The metabolic quotient and percentage of organic C present as microbial biomass C were generally poorly correlated with other measured properties but negatively correlated with one another. It was concluded that annual pasture involving conventional tillage results in a substantial loss of soil organic matter, soil microbial activity and soil physical condition under dairy pastures and that a system that avoids tillage needs to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Questions: Which are {{the main}} {{vegetation}} types of lowland hay <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> pastures in Western and Central Europe? What {{are the main}} environmental gradients that drive patterns of species composition? Is it possible to classify these grasslands to phytosociological alliances that reflect management practices? Location: Western and Central Europe (excluding the Alps and Carpathians). Methods: A database of 21 400 vegetation plots of mesic grasslands across Western and Central Europe was compiled. After geographically stratified resampling, semi-supervised classification based on the K-means algorithm was applied to assign a subset of plots into 32 a priori association-level vegetation types and to search for new types within the subset of non-assigned plots. The vegetation plots assigned into the final vegetation types were submitted to another K-means classification to show the grouping into higher-level vegetation types. Results: A total of 36 associations were distinguished in the resampled subset of 8277 vegetation plots and were grouped into four large groups: (1) eutrophic and intensively managed hay <b>meadows</b> <b>and</b> <b>permanent</b> pastures; (2) nutrient-rich grasslands developed from recently abandoned fields or managed under irregular practices of mowing and manuring; (3) non-eutrophic lowland and submontane hay meadows; (4) extensively managed pastures and Atlantic grazed hay meadows. A PCoA of the associations of these four groups showed that extensively managed pastures were floristically more similar to non-eutrophic hay meadows than to <b>permanent</b> intensively managed <b>pastures,</b> which was more obvious in the Atlantic region than in Central Europe. Species composition of the lowland hay meadows was clearly differentiated according to biogeographic sectors. Other floristic differences were related to climate, altitude, soil base status and topography. Conclusions: This analysis challenges the traditional concept of mesic grassland alliances separating hay meadows from pastures. New classification should be based mainly on the differences in management intensity rather than in management practice. Consequently, nutrient-poor extensive pastures, which currently are not considered in the European Habitats Directive, should receive the same conservation attention as low-intensive hay meadows, because both types of vegetation can be equally species-rich and do not differ substantially in floristic composition from each other...|$|R

Effect on upland beef {{production}} of incorporating winter feeding of red clover or summer grazing of Molinia-dominated semi-natural pastures. Grass and Forage Science, 62 (3), 284 - 300 Sponsorship: UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department and the Meat and Livestock Commission. Management systems for finishing beef cattle, {{designed to meet}} environmental goals in the Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) of the UK, often rely on the integration of grazing of semi-natural <b>pastures</b> with sown <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture.</b> In this experiment, three management options were compared: (i) <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> for grazing <b>and</b> silage production (treatment PP), (ii) <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> for grazing <b>and</b> silage and grazing of Molinia-dominant semi-natural pasture in summer from June to August inclusively (treatment PP + SNP) <b>and</b> (iii) <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> for grazing <b>and</b> silage and red clover (RC) silage for 0 ? 25 of the silage requirement in winter (treatment PP + RC). The performance of spring-born Welsh Black steers was measured from turnout in spring 2002 until finishing in summer 2003. During summer 2002, the liveweight gain of steers grazing the semi-natural pasture was significantly {{lower than that of}} steers grazing the <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture.</b> There was a trend for the liveweight gains of the steers on the PP + SNP treatment to be higher from housing in autumn 2002, and live weights on all treatments were similar {{at the start of the}} red clover-feeding phase. Steers offered red clover silage had a significantly higher liveweight gains than those offered grass silage, but there was only a trend for a higher live weight at the end of the winter-feeding period. During summer 2003, liveweight gains were again higher on the <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture.</b> Finishing system significantly affected the fatty-acid profile of the meat produced, but there was no difference in the colour of meat in relation to shelf-life. Lipid oxidation was less for the meat from steers on the PP + SNP treatment than on the PP treatment, which, in turn, was less than for meat from the steers on the PP + RC treatment, and was in inverse proportion to the vitamin E concentration in the loin muscle. There were no significant differences in sensory panel scores for texture, juiciness or flavour of the meat. Peer reviewe...|$|R
