5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{allegations}} and court cases of police brutality, custodial death, human rights violations, fake encounter killing, extortion, filing fake cases to harass the general public, corruption {{filed against the}} Assam Police.Because of the corrupt politicians the police have always complained {{not being able to}} function properly.Different organizations and their open extortion are known to the public and the police also have been alleged to have a fair share on those.Another main acquisition of Assam police in the present is that they are the friends of thieves, kidnappers and murderers rather than the public and it is said that the police has a better share in those crime money.Corruption of the organization is at peak with people fearing to go to the police against a crime as they need to pay money to file an FIR or take actions.As a victim says,"I lost my bicycle as few days back and had reported the case in the station.They called <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had found it and asked 1000 rupees for the release.I took a new one in 1600". In fact it is said that the police waits for the crime to happen so that they can make a profit out of it.Therefore, citizens there take the law in their own hands.|$|E
25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

He informed Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow of the infractions and initially suggested sending all of the curfew violators back to Maryland by bus. Yow dissented, and they agreed to suspend the players {{for part of the}} game. Describing the incident, Friedgen said that [...] "Five percent of [...] guys thought they didn't need to listen to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could get bed checked and sneak out."

500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire {{to which they}} have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe".

Viewers are always telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> love it when Danielle and Ronnie have a scene together – I think they're {{on the edge of}} their seats, waiting to see when Danielle is finally going to admit the truth about her identity." [...] Danielle's death received a mixed reaction from viewers, with 90% of viewers polled by The Sun opining that killing Danielle off was a mistake. The decision was defended by Santer, who stated: [...] "We acknowledge that we didn't deliver the happy ending that many of the audience may have been hoping for, and that for some people this was upsetting. We hope viewers understand that our aim is to deliver the best drama. That doesn't always lead to a happy ending. EastEnders – like all good drama – contains a balance of storylines, both happy and sad. We’re proud of the episode, the storyline which built up to it and the way the audience have engaged with it." [...] Following Danielle's final episode, regulator Ofcom confirmed they had received a number of complaints from the public about the [...] "violent nature of the show and the horrific death at the end", and the fact it was broadcast before the 9p.m. watershed.|$|E
500|$|From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was {{increasingly}} occupied {{with the issue}} of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke. This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was [...] "talked out" [...] in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, {{in the course of a}} public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification. She wished good luck to those fighting for a [...] "same terms as men" [...] suffrage bill, but [...] "don't let them come and tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are working for my class". The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000. Her departure, she said, was [...] "alike a grief and a deliverance".|$|E
500|$|According to Nielsen SoundScan, Blackout sold 124,000 copies {{during its}} first day of {{availability}} in the United States. Jessica Letkemann of Billboard compared the sales favorably {{to those of the}} number-one album of the previous week, Carrie Underwood's Carnival Ride, which sold 49,000 copies. Letkemann also estimated that Blackout would possibly debut atop the Billboard 200. On November 6, 2007, Billboard announced that even though The Eagles's first-week sales of Long Road Out of Eden had handily surpassed Spears, they would not debut atop the chart because of rules forbidding albums exclusively sold at one retail outlet (Walmart in this case) from entering the Billboard 200. The magazine's senior analyst and director of charts Geoff Mayfield explained he was frustrated by the situation, saying: [...] "I can believe the Eagles sold more, but I'm not seeing anything that verifies for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that." [...] During the afternoon of the same day, Walmart issued a press release announcing that Long Road Out of Eden had sold 711,000 copies. At night, it was announced through an article on Billboard.biz that after an agreement with Nielsen SoundScan, Billboard would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on the charts, effective that same week. Hence Long Road Out of Eden would top the Billboard 200, while Blackout would debut at number two, with sales of 290,000 copies. It became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one. The album, however, set the record as the best-selling digital album debut by a female artist in a week at the time. Following the release of Circus in December 2008, Blackout re-entered the chart at number one-hundred-and-ninety-eight, with sales of 4,600 copies. As of March 2015, the album had sold one million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

500|$|The Moon Shaped Pool tour drew {{criticism}} for its {{inclusion of a}} date in Tel Aviv on 19 July, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. Radiohead were subject to protests at some concerts, where sections of the audience unfurled Palestinian flags. On 23 April, more than 50 prominent figures, including musician Roger Waters, whose 2017 album Is This the Life We Really Want? was produced by Godrich, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel the show. Yorke told Rolling Stone he found the criticism [...] "extremely upsetting ... choose to, rather than engage with us personally, throw shit at us in public. It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves. I thought it was patronising in the extreme." [...] He felt the criticisms created [...] "divisive energy" [...] rather than [...] "bring people together". Godrich added {{that he did not}} [...] "believe in cultural boycotts ... I don't think they're positive, ever ... The people you'd be denying [...] are the people who would agree with you and don't necessarily agree with their government." [...] Waters responded in a public statement saying he had written to Yorke months earlier, but that Yorke had replied angrily and not replied to further correspondence. On 11 July, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote in the Independent that [...] " [...] stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> only want to hear one side – the one that supports apartheid... Radiohead need to decide if they stand with the oppressed or with the oppressor." [...] Yorke responded in a statement: [...] "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression." [...] The show went ahead as planned, with Yorke telling the audience: [...] "A lot was said about this, but in the end we played some music." ...|$|E
