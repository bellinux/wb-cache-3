40|$|Abstract]: Estimating {{the drag}} force on a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> is {{important}} if the installed <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> area {{is large and}} wind speeds are moderate. Such a situation may arise if a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> is used to protect a property from ember attacks in a bushfire prone area. In this work, computational simulations are used to correlate the drag coefficient of a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> {{in terms of its}} porosity and the Reynolds number for 10 ≤ Re ≤ 1000. A benchmarking exercise suggests that the computational simulations may be in error by up to 13 % error for the level of discretization that could be achieved due to computer memory limitations. The drag coefficient correlation we have obtained has a maximum error of only 6. 5 % with respect to the results from the simulations...|$|R
40|$|Large {{deployable}} antennas with a mesh surface woven by fine metal wires are {{an important}} technology for communications satellites and space radio telescopes. However, {{it is difficult to}} make <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surfaces with sufficient radio-frequency (RF) performance for frequencies higher than millimeter waves. In this paper, we present the RF performance of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surfaces at 43 GHz. For this purpose, we developed an apparatus to measure the reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient, and radiative coefficient of the mesh surface. The reflection coefficient increases as a function of <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surface tension, whereas the radiative coefficient decreases. The anisotropic aspects of the reflection coefficient and the radiative coefficient are also clearly seen. They depend on the front and back sides of the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> surface and the rotation angle. The transmission coefficient was measured to be almost constant. The measured radiative coefficients and transmission coefficients would cause significant degradation of the system noise temperature. In addition, we carried out an astronomical observation of a well-known SiO maser source, R Cas, by using a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> mirror on the NRO 45 -m radio telescope Coude system. The <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> mirror considerably increases the system noise temperature and slightly decreases the peak antenna temperature. These results are consistent with laboratory measurements.

40|$|Abstract]: For {{building}} constructions in bushfire-prone areas, {{the relevant}} Australian Standard (AS 3959 - 1999) recommends that potential building openings be protected against flying debris and burning embers using a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> with an opening less than 1. 8 mm. Although the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> {{can reduce the}} radiant heat transfer, it can also create hot spots on the object {{it is intended to}} protect, particularly if the standoff distance between the mesh and the object is small. These hot spots may even have a higher temperature than the object temperature without <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> protection. In this paper, the performance of some commercial <b>metal</b> <b>meshes</b> is simulated and the minimum standoff distance needed to avoid hot spots {{on the surface of the}} object is determined. An approximate formula for the calculation of this minimum distance is proposed...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The topic of this thesis is <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> hybrid pocket damper seals (MHS). This seal design is a combination of the pocket damper seal and a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> element. The <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> element not only reduces the leakage but it also provides damping. Early in its development, the tested <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> hybrid pocket damper seal induced a gripping force on the shaft that increased with upstream pressure. The resulting friction torque was beyond acceptable limits. The target after that was to develop an experimentally verified design of a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> hybrid seal that has low leakage and positive damping, and to determine rotordynamic effects and leakage. The hybrid seal design was revised to eliminate the gripping effect. The inner diameter of the retaining ring was increased and holes were provided at the periphery of the ring. With this revised design, tests were carried out on the non-rotating rig. Results showed a considerable decrease in stiffness of the seal. This indicated that the stiffness of the seal is dependent on the press fit interference of the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> doughnut. Tests were carried out on the rotating rig using a grooved journal, which allowed a low press fit interference. <b>Metal</b> <b>mesh</b> was placed at the exit blade in these experiments. The results showed negative damping and positive stiffness. Results also showed appearance of instability at 58 Psig, which increased with increase of pressure. Next, the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> was moved to the inlet blade. This modification required design and fabrication of a complete new seal. The experiments were repeated on the rotating rig. This time positive damping and positive stiffness was achieved with no sign of instability. The pocket depth of the hybrid seal was decreased to achieve more damping as predicted by the pocket damper seal code. However experimental results did not show any improvement in damping from this modification. Finally, the Bode plots from rotating tests were curve fitted using XLTRC to obtain damping, stiffness and force coefficients...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Metal</b> <b>mesh</b> is a commercially available material used in many applications including seals, heat shields, filters, gaskets, aircraft engine mounts, and vibration absorbers. This material has been tested in the Turbomachinery Laboratory at Texas A&M University (TAMU) as a bearing damper in a rotordynamic test rig. The test facility was originally used to support the design of a turboprop engine at TAMU, developing squirrel cage bearing supports and squeeze film dampers for both the gas generator and power turbine rotors. To design the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> damper, static stiffness and dynamic rap test measurements were first made on <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> samples in a specially designed non-rotating test fixture. These property tests were performed on samples of various densities and press fits. One sample was also tested in an Instron machine as an ancillary and redundant way to determine the stiffness. Using the stiffness test results and equations derived by a previous investigator, a spreadsheet program was written and used to size <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> donuts that have the radial stiffness value required to replace the squirrel cage in the power turbine. The squirrel cage and squeeze-film bearing damper developed for the power turbine rotor was then replaced by a <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> donut sized by the computer code. Coast-down tests were conducted through the first critical speed of the power turbine. The results of the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> tests were compared with those obtained from previous testing with the squeeze film damper. The results show that the <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> damper has the same damping as the squeeze film at room temperature but does not lose its damping at elevated temperatures up to 210 F?. Experiments were run under several different conditions including balanced rotor hot oil soaked, unbalanced rotor hot oil soaked, balanced dry, and unbalanced dry. Over all, <b>metal</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers appear to be a viable and attractive substitute for squeeze film dampers in gas turbine engines. The advantages shown to date include less variation of damping with temperature, ability to handle large rotor unbalance, and the ability (if required) to operate effectively in an oil free environment...|$|R
