5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} Keynesian macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism {{is the idea that}} the supply of money matters for the <b>macroeconomy.</b> When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged those points.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the <b>macroeconomy.</b> The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign defaults, including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998–2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
500|$|Hayek {{created the}} Austrian {{business}} cycle theory, which synthesizes Menger's capital theory and Mises's {{theory of money}} and credit. The theory proposes a model of inter-temporal investment in which production plans precede the manufacture of the finished product. The producers revise production plans to adapt to changes in consumer preferences. Producers respond to [...] "derived demand," [...] which is estimated demand for the future, instead of current demand. If consumers reduce their spending, producers believe that consumers are saving for additional spending later, so that production remains constant. Combined with a market of loanable funds (which relates savings and investment through the interest rate), this theory of capital production leads to {{a model of the}} <b>macroeconomy</b> where markets reflect inter-temporal preferences. Hayek's model suggests that an economic bubble begins when cheap credit initiates a boom where resources are misallocated, so that early stages of production receive more resources than they should and overproduction begins; the later stages of capital are not funded for maintenance to prevent depreciation. Overproduction in the early stages cannot be processed by poorly maintained later stage capital. The boom becomes a bust when a lack of finished goods leads to [...] "forced saving" [...] since fewer finished goods can be produced for sale.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Optimum growth..." [...] {{paper was}} the {{culmination}} of a long line of research (beginning with Frank Ramsey's pioneering research in the 1920s) on modeling economic growth. [...] The literature found expression in the post-war period in the work of Robert Solow at MIT and Hirofumi Uzawa at Stanford, not only as a theory of growth, but also as a tool for understanding the <b>macroeconomy.</b> [...] Much of the development of the models in the literature was grounded in a set of post-war [...] "stylized facts" [...] that every economics Ph.D. student learns in their first year of graduate study. [...] One of the weak links in the development of these early models was their specification of saving behavior as being exogenous and given by the empirical regularity of the consumption-income relationship, and the various (partial equilibrium) theories of consumption spending designed to explain this regularity.|$|E
2500|$|Keynesian {{economic}} theory has {{played an important}} role in the economic philosophy of modern American liberals. Modern American liberals generally believe that national prosperity requires government management of the <b>macroeconomy,</b> in order to keep unemployment low, inflation in check, and growth high. They also value institutions that defend against economic inequality. In The Conscience of a Liberal Paul Krugman writes: [...] "I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That makes me a liberal, and I'm proud of it." [...] Liberals often point to the widespread prosperity enjoyed under a mixed economy in the years since World WarII. They believe liberty exists when access to necessities like health care and economic opportunity are available to all, and they champion the protection of the environment.|$|E

Our model provides a basis for understanding the various economic feedback chains contained in such models and their dynamic interaction. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{monetary}} and fiscal policy measures have aimed at mitigating {{the effects of}} the finan-cial market meltdown that started in the U. S. subprime sector in 2008 and has subsequently spread world wide as a great recession. Slowly some recovery appears to be on the horizon, yet it is worth-while exploring the fragility and potentially destabilizing feedbacks of advanced <b>macroeconomies</b> {{in the context of a}} framework that builds on the ideas of Keynes and Tobin. This framework stresses the fragilities and destabilizing feedback mechanisms that are potential features of all ma-jor markets—those for goods, labor, and financial assets. We use a Tobin macroeconomic portfolio approach and the interaction of heterogeneous agents on the financial market to characterize the potential for financial market instability. Though the study of the latter has been undertaken in many partial models, we focus here on the interconnectedness of all three markets. Furthermore, we study what potential labor market, fiscal and monetary policies can have in stabilizing unstable <b>macroeconomies.</b> In order to study this problem we introduce, besides money, long term bonds and equity into the asset market. We in particular propose a countercyclical monetary policy that sells assets in the boom and purchases them in recessions. Modern stability analysis is brought to bear to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of the suggested policies. The policies suggested here could help the Fed in its search for an appropriate exit strategy after its massive intervention in the financial market. ∗The authors acknowledge the comments and suggestions from the audience at the conference in honour of Professor Giancarlo Gandolfo.

We argue that the RA approach is simply not up to the task of enhancing our understanding of modern <b>macroeconomies</b> and that the standard cannot provide an adequate framework for understanding the economy even in more normal times. We advocate a bottom-up approach, where high-level (macroeconomic) systems may possess new and different properties than the low-level (microeconomic) systems on which they are based. The heterogeneous agent approach provides an alternative, one which has already proven its metal in helping us understand the interlinkages which helped give rise to the crisis. ...|$|R
