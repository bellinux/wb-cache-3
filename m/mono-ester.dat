40|$|Two major {{types of}} {{food-grade}} surfactants used to stabilize foams are proteins and {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) surfactants. Proteins lower the surface tension of interfaces and tend to unfold and stabilize the interface by {{the formation of a}} visco-elastic network, which leads to high surface moduli. In contrast, LMW surfactants lower the surface tension more than proteins, but do not form interfaces with a high modulus. Instead, they stabilize the interface through the Gibbs-Marangoni mechanism that relies on rapid diffusion of surfactants, when surface tension gradients develop as a result of deformations of the interface. A molecule than can lower the surface tension considerably, like a LMW surfactant, but also provide the interface with a high modulus, like a protein, would be an excellent foam stabilizer.

40|$|Oligofructose {{fatty acid}} esters are {{surfactants}} that considerably lower the surface tension of an air/water interface, provide the interface {{with a high}} dilatational modulus and {{lead to a high}} foam stability. In this study, we investigate the effect of the molecular structure of oligofructose fatty acid esters on their functional properties. We varied the length and degree of saturation of the fatty acid chain, and the number of fatty acids esterified to the oligofructose part. A tensiometer was used to establish CAC curves, light scattering to determine the size of micellar aggregates and an ellipsometer to determine the amount of material that adsorbed at the interface. Esters with a more hydrophobic character had a lower CAC and had a higher efficiency. Oligofructose mono- and di-esters with fatty acid chain lengths between C 8 and C 16 formed spherical micelles, while esters with a fatty acid chain length of C 18 formed larger aggregates. The effectiveness was similar for all esters. Using the Gibbs adsorption model, we did not find major differences in the area per molecule for the different esters. Ellipsometry experiments also did not indicate major differences in the area per molecule for the oligofructose <b>mono-esters.</b> The area per molecule of oligofructose esters was larger than that of sucrose esters and independent of the degree of saturation of the fatty acid chain.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chitin and cuticle {{coatings}} {{are important}} to the environmental and immune defense of honey bees and insect pollinators. Pesticides or environmental effects may target the biochemistry of insect chitin and cuticle coating. Denaturing of chitin involves a combination of deacetylation, intercalation, oxidation, Schweiger-peeling, and the formation of amine hydrochloride salt. The term "denatured chitin" calls attention to structural and property changes to the internal membranes and external carapace of organisms so that some properties affecting biological activities are diminished. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A case study was performed on honey bees using silver staining and microscopic computer-tomographic x-ray radiography (micro-CT). Silver nitrate formed counter-ion complexes with labile ammonium cations and reacted with amine hydrochloride. Silver was concentrated in the peritrophic membrane, on the abdomen, in the glossa, at intersegmental joints (tarsi), at wing attachments, and in tracheal air sacs. Imaged <b>mono-esters</b> and fatty acids from cuticle coating on external surfaces were apparently reduced by an alcohol pretreatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The technique provides 3 -dimensional and sectional images of individual honey bees consistent with the chemistries of silver reaction and complex formation with denatured chitin. Environmental exposures and influences such as gaseous nitric oxide intercalant, trace oxidants such as ozone gas, oligosachharide salt conversion, exposure to acid rain, and chemical or biochemical denaturing by pesticides may be studied using this technique. Peritrophic membranes, which protect against food abrasion, microorganisms, and permit efficient digestion, were imaged. Apparent surface damage to the corneal lenses of compound eyes by dilute acid exposure consistent with chitin amine hydrochloride formation was imaged.

40|$|A {{spectrum}} of reproductive system anomalies (cryptorchidism, hypospadias, dysgenesis of Wolffian duct-derived tissues and prostate, and reduced sperm production) in male rats exposed in utero to phthalate esters (PEs) {{are thought to}} be caused by PE inhibition of fetal testosterone production. Recently, dibutyl and dipentyl phthalate (DBuP, DPnP) were shown to disrupt the retinol signaling pathway (RSP) in mouse pluripotent P 19 embryonal carcinoma cells in vitro. The RSP regulates the synthesis and cellular levels of retinoic acid (RA), the active metabolite of retinol (vitamin A). In this new study, a total of 26 di- and <b>mono-esters</b> were screened to identify additional phthalate structures that disrupt the RSP and explore their mechanisms of action. The most potent PEs, those causing > 50 % inhibition, contained aryl and cycloalkane groups or C 4 -C 6 alkyl ester chains and were the same PEs reported to cause malformations in utero. They shared similar lipid solubility; logP values were between 4 and 6 and, except for PEs with butyl and phenyl groups, were stable for prolonged periods in culture. Mono- and cognate di-esters varied in ability to disrupt the RSP; e. g., DEHP was inactive but its monoester was active while DBuP was active yet its monoester was inactive. DBuP and dibenzyl phthalate both disrupted the synthesis of RA from retinol but not the ability of RA to activate gene transcription. Both PEs also disrupted the RSP in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. Based on this in vitro study showing that some PEs disrupt retinol signaling and previous in vivo studies that vitamin A/RA deficiency and PEs both cause strikingly similar anomalies in the male rat reproductive system, we propose that PE-mediated inhibition of testosterone and RA synthesis in utero are both causes of malformations in male rat offspring...|$|R

Additionally, a <b>mono-ester</b> containing a C 16 mono-unsaturated fatty acid chain and a C 12 di-ester were studied. Finally, to investigate {{the influence of the}} size of the hydrophilic group, commercially available sucrose esters were studied. The surface tension and surface rheological properties of air/water interfaces stabilized by the esters were determined, as well as the foaming properties of the esters, at a bulk concentration of 0. 2 % (w/v). OF mono-esters with intermediate fatty acid chain lengths (C 10 -C 16) were able to migrate quickly to the interface producing foams with small bubbles (0. 4 mm), a relatively narrow bubble size distribution, and a high stability. For oligofructose mono-esters containing fatty acids C 4 and C 8, the bulk concentration of 0. 2 % (w/v) was below the CMC, resulting in insufficient surface coverage, and low foamability and foam stability. The OF C 18 <b>mono-ester</b> and the OF C 12 di-ester were slow to migrate to the interface resulting in low foamability. Despite similar surface tension values, the foam half-life time of OFAE was higher than of the corresponding sucrose esters. OFAE gave higher surface dilatational moduli compared to sucrose esters. Based on the frequency dependence of the modulus and analysis of Lissajous plots, we propose that OFAE may be forming a soft glass at the interface...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the lipid soluble carotenoid astaxanthin (biosynthesised as a secondary metabolite by the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis) {{as a source of}} pigment to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the flesh of farmed salmonid species has been investigated, using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a model. Accretion of astaxanthin within rainbow trout epaxial white muscle was primarily shown to be dependent on dietary inclusion and the type of diet used as a pigment carrier. Different dietary inclusion rates demonstrated a dose response. Cold pressed low oil and commercially extruded high oil diets containing similar astaxanthin concentration were tested, fish receiving the latter obtained higher growth rates and retained higher concentrations of astaxanthin within their flesh as compared to those receiving the former. Assessment of intact encysted H. pluvialis cells and processed H. pluvialis cells which had been mechanically treated to ruptured their cell wall revealed that the astaxanthin retained within the cells is only bioavailable to rainbow trout when the cell wall has been breached. The carotenoid profile of H. pluvialis confirmed that its astaxanthin was in three forms, i. e. free (5. 9 %), mono-esterified (82. 3 %) and di-esterified (11. 8 %) to fatty acid moieties. Assessment of H. pluvialis purified mono and di-esterified astaxanthin extracts fed to rainbow trout demonstrated that astaxanthin <b>mono-esters</b> were more bioavailable than di-esters. Image analysis confirmed the major colour component of pigmented rainbow trout fillets is red and the distribution of astaxanthin within fillets varies greatly, with the head region having the lightest hue, which gradually increases towards the tail region. The addition of 2 -palmitoylaminoproprionic acid (Corbinol) as a feed additive to diets containing synthetic astaxanthin had no effect on increasing the deposition of astaxanthin in the epaxial white muscle. Nevertheless, none of the in vivo trials incorporating H. pluvialis cells or H. pluvialis derived astaxanthin extracts demonstrated any detrimental effects on rainbow trout, in terms of feed utilisation, growth performance or health. Also, the protection afforded to astaxanthin by ruptured H. pluvialis cysts was demonstrated (during in vitro experiments) to provide increased stability as compared to synthetic astaxanthin, with respect to diet storage, exposure to emulated sunlight and loss in a turbulent water column.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{essential}} element for life on our planet. It is central in numerous biochemical processes in terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems including food production; {{and it is the}} primary growth-limiting nutrient in some of the world’s biomes. The main source of P for use as agricultural fertilizer is mining of non-renewable mineral phosphate. In terrestrial ecosystems the main source is soil P, where the largest fraction is organic P, composed of many species with widely differing properties. This fraction controls the utilization of P by plants and microorganisms and influences ecosystem development and productivity. However, there is only scarce knowledge about the molecular composition of the organic P pool, about the processes controlling its bioavailability, and about its changes as soils develop. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop robust solution- and solid-state 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) methods to provide molecular information about speciation of the organic P pool, and to study its dynamics in boreal and tropical soils. By studying humus soils of a groundwater recharge/discharge productivity gradient in a Fennoscandian boreal forest by solution- and solid-state NMR, it was found that P speciation changed with productivity. In particular, the level of orthophosphate diesters decreased with increasing productivity while <b>mono-esters</b> such as inositol phosphates increased. Because the use of solution NMR on conventional NaOH/EDTA extracts of soils was limited due to severe line broadening caused by the presence of paramagnetic metal ions, a new extraction method was developed and validated. Based on the removal of these paramagnetic impurities by sulfide precipitation, a dramatic decrease in NMR linewidths was obtained, allowing {{for the first time to}} apply modern multi-dimensional solution NMR techniques to soil extracts. Identification of individual soil P-species, and tracking changes in the organic P pools during soil development provided information for connecting P-speciation to bioavailability and ecosystem properties. Using this NMR approach we studied the transformation of organic P in humus soils along a chronosequence (7800 years) in Northern Sweden. While total P varied little, the composition of the soil P pool changed particularly among young sites, where also the largest shift in the composition of the plant community and of soil microorganisms was observed. Very old soils, such as found Africa, are thought to strongly adsorb P, limiting plant productivity. I used NMR to study the effect of scattered agroforestry trees on P speciation in two semi-arid tropical woodlands with different soil mineralogy (Burkina Faso). While the total P concentration was low, under the tree canopies higher amounts of P and higher diversity of P-species were found, presumably reflecting higher microbial activity.

40|$|In chapter 1, we give an {{introduction}} to bifunctional monomers that {{play an important role}} in the chemical industry. Briefly, the conventional production processes of α,ω-dicarboxylic acids and α,ω-diols are discussed. Strategies for more sustainable alternatives for production of medium-chain bifunctional monomers are discussed. Monooxygenase-based processes seem promising, if the problem of poor diterminal oxidation capacities of monooxygenases is solved. Esterification could be a tool to solve this problem. In chapter 2 we have investigated the ω-oxidation activities of E. coli expressing AlkBGT or AlkBGTL, with various esters having an alkyl chain > 1. These strains were able to ω-oxidize ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of C 6 -C 10 fatty acids. Using esters with a longer alkyl chain enhanced ω-oxidation activities for C 6 and C 7 fatty acids. The major products were ω-hydroxy fatty acid esters, but over oxidation to the aldehyde and carboxylic acid also occurred. AlkL improved whole-cell ω-oxidation activities for substrates with a logPo/w above 4. Since the major products were ω-hydroxy fatty acid esters in chapter 2, we investigated further conversion of these compounds to mono-esterified dicarboxylic acids in chapter 3. Alcohol dehydrogenase AlkJ and aldehyde dehydrogenase AlkH were functionally expressed in E. coli. AlkJ is functional with 9 -hydroxy ethyl nonanoate as substrate, AlkH is functional with 9 -oxo methyl nonanoate. Expansion of the AlkBGTL system with AlkJ and AlkH yielded strain E. coli AlkBGTHJL. This strain accumulated mono-ethyl azelate exclusively from ethyl nonanoate. Adding the substrate dissolved in a carrier solvent increased final product titers. Subsequently, we investigated if in vivo esterification could enhance the ω-oxidation of AlkB in chapter 4. E. coli expressing AlkBGTHJL can ω-oxidize octanoate and nonanoate, but not efficiently. When acyl-CoA ligase AlkK and acyltransferase AtfA or Eeb 1 were also expressed, ω-oxidation was more efficient. Furthermore, complete oxidation to the carboxylic acid was much more efficient when also in vivo esterification was achieved. Also di-ethyl esters were produced, meaning that esterification occurred twice. Since ω-oxidation of fatty acids was improved with in vivo esterification in chapter 4, we were interested to investigate whether this system could also work with n-alkanes in chapter 5. <b>Mono-esters</b> of dicarboxylic acids were produced from n-alkanes by E. coli expressing AlkBGTHJKL and either AtfA or Eeb 1. Starting from n-alkanes would also allow production of alcohols if overoxidation could be prevented. Application of a different alcohol acyltransferase (Atf 1), limited the overoxidation by AlkB. ω-Oxidation of the formed ester resulted in the production of ω-alcohols, which were again esterified by Atf 1.

The point at which the system becomes a saturated salt solution in the diol systems is at 20 mol% ChCl, because at higher concentrations the conductivity decreases despite the increase in number of charge carrying species. The addition of ChCl to glycerol results in a decrease in the viscosity of the system by interrupting the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of the glycerol molecules, whereas the addition of ChCl to the diols results in an increase in viscosity. The mono-alcohol phenol has been shown to form a DES in a ratio of 4 : 1 phenol: ChCl. Stable DES’s have also been formed using sugars, D-(-) fructose, D-glucose, xylitol and meso-erythritol. Determination of solvent-solute interactions is key to the understanding of solvent properties in liquids therefore the Kamlet-Taft parameters α, β, π* and ET (30) parameter were determined {{for a series of}} alcohol based DES using three solvatochromic dyes, 4 -nitroaniline, N,N-dimethyl- 4 -nitroaniline and Reichardt’s dye ET (30). It is shown that they are similar to RNH 3 +X-, R 2 NH 2 +X- and imidazolium ionic liquids. The effect of ChCl on the Kamlet-Taft parameters is not uniform across the systems and is dependant upon the hydrogen bond donor. The solventless esterification of glycerol and lauric was carried out using ChCl with the intention of using its hydrogen bonding interaction with glycerol to behave a potential site inhibitor as to selectively form mono- or di-ester products. The work has shown that the addition of ChCl to the system, initially slows the rate of the <b>mono-ester</b> formation, but actually encourages the reaction to progress further towards the di-ester product, when compared to the pure glycerol system encouraging only <b>mono-ester</b> formation.

40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{covalent}} coupling method using electrochemical activation of hydroquinone <b>mono-ester</b> self-assembled monolayers. The reaction generates benzoquinone as a good leaving group, followed by nucleophilic acyl substitution with a primary amine to form an amide in high yield. The method allows the site-selective and the reaction-controlled positioning of biotin on the individually addressable microelectrode array and, subsequently, density-differentiated patterning of streptavidin on the biotin surfaces. Because the electrochemical coupling method provides a very rapid, mild, and quantitatively controllable reaction pathway for covalent bond formation on organic surfaces, {{it will be used}} as a versatile molecular anchoring tool in fields such as molecular electronics and biochip technology. Various methods to functionalize surfaces by anchoring molecules have been investigated intensively.

40|$|The fluorotelomer-based {{compounds}} {{are highly}} fluorinated organics that are uniquely both hydrophobic and oleophobic, thus widely utilized in industrial and consumer products to change surface properties (e. g., rendering textile fabrics stain-resistant). These products are suspected to contain or degrade into fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs) and subsequently into perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) including perfluorooctanoate, {{which has been}} globally detected in wildlife, humans and the environment. The high fluorination imparts unique physico-chemical properties that are not well-characterized, and subsequently, their behavior in the environment is not well understood. To shed light on potential sources of perfluorochemical contamination observed globally, this dissertation focused on evaluating the solubility, sorption and biotransformation of four dominant FTOH homologues (4 : 2 to 10 : 2 FTOH) and biotransformation of two FTOH-derived surfactants with <b>mono-ester</b> and tri-ester linkages. ^ The solubility and sorption of 4 : 2 and 6 : 2 FTOHs were measured adequately in aqueous systems, while the higher homologues required the validation and use of a log-linear cosolvency model. The aqueous solubility of FTOHs and the non-fluorine homologues (n-alkanols) followed a single log-linear correlation with modified McGowan molar volumes. However, 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOHs (solids at 25 °C) exhibited smaller entropy of melt values than expected for long chain molecules. Sorption increased with increasing soil organic carbon (OC) and perfluorocarbon chain length. The aerobic microbial degradation of 8 : 2 FTOH was assessed by monitoring metabolites over time using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and included assessing the effect of carrier solvents (ethanol, octanol and 1, 4 -dioxane). With octanol (the structural analogue of 8 : 2 FTOH), transformation was temporarily inhibited until depletion of octanol. Similar results were observed with soil bacteria enriched from soil using sole octanol carbon source. In all cases biodegradation pathways appeared the same. Cleavage of the fluorotelomer stearate <b>mono-ester</b> linkage with release of FTOHs occurred in soils with the subsequent generation of the fluorinated acids typical of 8 : 2 FTOH biotransformation, whereas the fluorotelomer citrate tri-esters appeared more stable. Novel solvent and soil-dependent abiotic hydrolysis was also observed. ^ This study has contributed to {{a deeper understanding of}} organo-fluorine chemistry and confirmed that estimations of global PFCA emissions should include breakdown of at least low molecular weight FTOH-derived compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|Aerated food {{products}} consist of air bubbles that {{are surrounded by}} a matrix that can be either liquid or solid. Due to {{the large number of}} air bubbles that are generally present in aerated products, these systems contain a large interfacial area. Therefore, the properties of the interfaces are considered to contribute significantly to the macroscopic properties of the system. The properties of these interfaces are largely determined by the type of surfactant that adsorbs. Two major types of surfactants that are used within the food industry are proteins and low molecular weight (LMW) surfactants. Proteins are macromolecules consisting of hydrophilic and hydrophobic patches that adsorb at the interface, where they lower the surface tension and can unfold to create a two-dimensional network that can provide a high modulus. In contrast, LMW surfactants are molecules with a well-defined hydrophilic and hydrophobic part. They can form more compact surface layers than proteins, leading to lower surface tensions. They generally do not provide the interface with a high modulus, instead they stabilize the interface through the Gibbs-Marangoni mechanism that relies on rapid diffusion of surfactants after deformations of the interface. A molecule that can lower the surface tension considerably, like a LMW surfactant, {{and at the same time}} provide a high modulus, like a protein, has the potential to be an excellent foam stabilizer. In this thesis we focus on a series of molecules that obey these criteria: oligofructose fatty acid esters. We address the influence of changes in chemical fine structure (fatty acid chain length and degree of saturation, degree of esterification and size of the hydrophilic group) on the functional properties. These esters are synthesized by esterification of fatty acids to oligofructose, which is a mixture of oligomers with different degrees of polymerization. As we show in chapter 2, reasonable yields are obtained when using lipase as the catalyst in a mixture of DMSO and Bu t OH. The conversion into mono-esters increased with increasing fatty acid chain length and is consistent with the preference of the enzyme for more hydrophobic substrates. The crude reaction product consisted of a mixture of unreacted oligofructose and fatty acids, the main reaction products mono-esters and small amounts of di-esters. The crude product was fractionated using RP-SPE. MALDI-TOF MS and (2 D) NMR were used to confirm the structure and purity of the esters; > 90 % for mono-esters and > 80 % for di-esters. Similar to typical LMW surfactants, the oligofructose esters formed spherical micelles in the bulk after a certain critical concentration. As we show in chapter 3, the CAC depended on the hydrophobicity of the molecules. The efficiency also increased with increasing hydrophobicity and the effectiveness was similar. The area occupied by a single molecule at the interface was determined by fitting the CAC curves with the Gibbs adsorption model and measured directly using ellipsometry. The area occupied at the interface was larger for oligofructose mono-esters compared to sucrose esters. Furthermore, oligofructose di-esters occupied slightly more area than sucrose esters. All esters occupied significantly more area than a single fatty acid chain. This shows that the oligofructose group dominates the area occupied at the interface. The rheological properties, as studied in chapter 4, were determined using a traditional approach, where the dependency of the surface dilatational modulus on surface pressure and frequency was determined, and using a novel approach, where we show how the surface dilatational modulus is dependent on deformation amplitude and temperature. Furthermore, we show how Lissajous plots of surface pressure versus deformation may be used to gain information about the correlation between surface rheological properties and interfacial microstructure. Sucrose esters behaved like typical LMW surfactants, with low surface dilatational moduli, scaling exponents in the frequency dependency close to 0. 5, and fairly viscous Lissajous plots without significant asymmetries. In contrast, oligofructose mono-esters formed interfaces with high surface dilatational moduli, low scaling exponents in the frequency dependency and asymmetric Lissajous plot with strain hardening during compression and strain softening during expansion. We conclude that the oligofructose mono-esters form a two-dimensional soft glass. The oligofructose di-esters behaved like typical LMW surfactants at high surface pressures, showing that the presence of the second fatty acid chain prevent the formation of the glass by the oligofructose part. In chapter 5 we focus on the difference in functionality between the crude reaction product, the individual components that are present in the crude product and mixes of these products. Unreacted fatty acids migrated to the interface only in very small amount, due to the low solubility in the bulk. The addition of mono-esters slightly improved the amount of fatty acid that could migrate to the interface. Oligofructose was not surface active and its addition to the <b>mono-ester</b> only diluted the <b>mono-ester</b> which did not lead to significant changes in functional properties because the concentration of <b>mono-ester</b> was still close to the CMC. When mono-esters and di-esters were mixed, the rheological results showed that the ratio between <b>mono-ester</b> and di-ester was very important for the rheological profile. In both cases the results suggest the presence of islands of glass phase formed by the mono-esters surrounded by a viscous phase formed by the di-esters. When the surface concentration of mono-esters was high, the glassy patches dominated the interface, leading to a high modulus, low frequency dependency and Lissajous plots with a high degree of asymmetry. When the surface concentration of mono-esters decreased, the lower connectivity between the glassy patches lead to a low modulus, intermediate frequency dependency, and Lissajous plots with moderate asymmetry. To study the potential of oligofructose esters as food grade surfactants it is important to consider that many {{food products}} contain ingredients with the potential to be surface active. Therefore, in chapter 6 we have studied the functional properties of an oligofructose <b>mono-ester</b> in the presence of whey protein isolate, a commonly used food protein. Except for at the highest protein concentration, the surface was dominated by the oligofructose ester. The stabilization mechanisms of oligofructose ester and WPI were mutually exclusive, leading to interfaces with a low surface dilatational modulus. Since the foaming properties were not negatively affected, we conclude that the Gibbs-Marangoni mechanism occurred. Only at the highest protein concentration, the surface concentration of WPI was sufficiently high to interfere with this mechanism, leading to a significant decrease in foam stability. Oligofructose esters were also able to displace a fully developed WPI network. In chapter 7 we discuss the foaming properties of the esters. We show that only esters of intermediate hydrophobicity are able to form foams with small bubbles and a uniform bubble size distribution that lead to high foam stability. The affinity of esters with shorter fatty acid chains, up to 8 carbon atoms, for the interface was quite low as a result of the relatively hydrophilic nature of the molecules. Therefore, they were not effective foam stabilizers. The most hydrophobic components (<b>mono-ester</b> with a chain length of 18 carbon atoms and di-ester with a chain length of 12 carbon atoms) were too slow to migrate to the interface. Therefore, also these components were poor foam stabilizers. We show that the surface tension at short time scales is the most accurate predictor of foam stability. However, despite similar initial surface tension values, oligofructose esters lead to higher foam stability. This could be attributed to the oligofructose part that forms a two-dimensional glass phase and provides mechanical stability to the foam films. In the general discussion that is presented in chapter 8 we integrate the results from the different chapters. One of the factors that is persistent throughout the different chapters is the rheological profile of the interfaces. We have shown that by using amplitude sweeps and Lissajous plots, a lot more information on the interfacial microstructure can be extracted from rheological data than by using more conventional methods. In the last part of the general discussion improvements to the synthesis are discussed, as the optimization of the synthesis was not considered in this thesis. Furthermore, improvements for the functional experiments and additional applications were identified.  ...|$|E
40|$|Viarovorax paradoxus T 4 strain was {{isolated}} from deep-ocean sediment and demonstrated {{to be able}} to degrade dimethyl isophthalate (DMI). When DMI was utilized as the sole source of carbon and energy, it was transformed by hydrolysis initially, forming monomethyl isophthalate (MMI) and isophthalate acid (IA) as degradation intermediates. DMI and MMI were completely transformed to MMI and IA in about 100 h, respectively. Degradation of IA was completed in about 55 h. Analysis of total organic carbon in the culture medium confirmed that more than 80 % of the substrate carbon was mineralized. Bacterial esterase induced by a range of substrates could be assessed using p-nitrophenyl acetate as the common substrate using crude enzyme preparation. The decreasing trend of Km values derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation was dimethyl phthalate (DMP) > monomethyl phthalate (MMP) > dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) > Liver esterase > DMI > MMI > monomethyl terephthalate (MMT), indicating that higher Km values were obtained by di-esters than <b>mono-ester</b> and the esters induced by terephthalate esters showed the highest activity. This investigation suggests that biochemical pathways for phthalate esters share many common characteristics and the esterases induced by different substrates are highly specific.
