5|$|Airship Industries {{managed a}} major {{marketing}} coup with {{the inclusion of}} their Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time Airship Industries were producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals.

5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} <b>most</b> <b>current</b> and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, <b>most</b> <b>current</b> supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>current</b> {{scholars}} {{consider the}} Codex Vaticanus {{to be one}} of the best Greek texts of the New Testament, with the Codex Sinaiticus as its only competitor. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex was unrivaled. It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of The New Testament in the Original Greek in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek New Testament are largely based on the text of the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. <b>Most</b> <b>current</b> calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|In <b>most</b> <b>current</b> cultures, it is {{more typical}} for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the <b>most</b> <b>current</b> one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E
