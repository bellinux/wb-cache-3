40|$|A novel {{structure}} of nonautonomous {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) retrotransposons called terminal repeat with GAG domain (TR-GAG) has been described in plants, both in monocotyledonous, dicotyledonous and basal angiosperm genomes. TR-GAGs are relatively short elements in length (< 4 kb) showing the typical features of LTR-retrotransposons. However, they carry only one open reading frame coding for the GAG precursor protein involved for instance in transposition, the assembly, and the packaging of the element into the virus-like particle. GAG precursors show similarities with both Copia and Gypsy GAG proteins, suggesting evolutionary relationships of TR-GAG elements with both families. Despite the lack of the enzymatic machinery required for their mobility, strong evidences suggest that TR-GAGs are still active.

40|$|Turkey is a {{secondary}} center of diversity for melon (Cucumis melo) and {{is home to}} a variety of regional morphotypes. This diversity is housed in a national germplasm repository with more than 500 accessions. Molecular genetic variability of 209 melon genotypes from 115 accessions of this collection was characterized using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Ten AFLP primer combinations yielded 279 reproducible fragments, which were used for dendrogram and principal coordinate analyses. These analyses showed two major clusters of Turkish melons: one group contained highly similar genotypes (maximum Dice dissimilarity coefficient of 0. 18), whereas the other group was genetically more diverse (maximum dissimilarity 0. 41). Although average dissimilarity was low (0. 13), a broad range of genetic diversity was observed in the collection. A marker allele richness strategy was used to select a core set of 20 genotypes representing the allelic diversity of the AFLP data. The core set had double the average diversity (0. 26) of the entire set and represented the major morphotypes present in the collection. <b>Molecular</b> genetic <b>diversity</b> of the core set was further validated using simple sequence repeat marker data (116 polymorphic fragments), which confirmed that the selected core set retained high levels of <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>diversity...</b>|$|R

The accessions were separated into 3 molecular genetic groups based on STRUCTURE analysis—group 1 from the classical Old World (Europe and west Asia–north Africa), group 2 from east Asia, and group 3 from east, central, south, and southeast Asia. Accessions classified as “wild ” (B. rapa var. sylvestris) were found only in group 1 and this group had the highest number and richness of private alleles. Each group included a diverse range of agricultural morphotypes (oilseed, root, or leafy vegetable types), flowering habit (winter, semi-winter, or spring type), self-compatibility or incompatibility, and seed color.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to combine species {{distribution}} modelling (SDM) {{with the results of}} a <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>diversity</b> study to make suggestions for sites on which to locate genetic reserves. This work was complemented by a <b>molecular</b> genetic <b>diversity</b> and a forest management policy study, to examine the potential for in situ conservation of the crop wild relative species, Prunus avium. In order to identify the species distribution, the most widely available occurrence data were in the form of historical records, gathered from online repositories and herbaria. A selection of environmental variables were incorporated with occurrence records in the SDM software, MaxEnt, to estimate the existing and possible future distribution of this species. Different sampling methods and combinations of accessions were used to evaluate model performance. This work was supplemented by the use of microsatellite marker analysis, to identify genetic distance among samples collected, covering the species‘ range. Clear separation was found between the individuals from the south-eastern edge of the range, and all other European samples. The effect of management practices on the persistence of wild cherry in managed forests and the impact of conservation policy was also considered, using case studies from the UK and Belgium, interviews and grey literature. Results showed that the difficulties of obtaining reliable, unbiased data can be overcome, as long as these factors are considered in conservation planning. Suggestions are made for several potential reserve sites across Europe, in a variety of forested environments, with differing management priorities. ...|$|R

In this study, we developed a pyrosequencing approach to extensively explore the diversity and dynamics of fungal and prokaryotic populations in CF lower airways. Methodology and Principal Findings Fungi and bacteria diversity in eight sputum samples collected from four adult CF patients was investigated using conventional microbiological culturing and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach targeting the ITS 2 locus and the 16 S rDNA gene. The unveiled microbial community structure was compared to the clinical profile of the CF patients. Pyrosequencing confirmed recently reported bacterial diversity and observed complex fungal communities, in which more than 60 % of the species or genera were not detected by cultures. Strikingly, the diversity and species richness of fungal and bacterial communities was significantly lower in patients with decreased lung function and poor clinical status. Values of Chao 1 richness estimator were statistically correlated with values of the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, body mass index, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p = 0. 046, 0. 047, 0. 004, and 0. 001, respectively for fungal Chao 1 indices, and p = 0. 010, 0. 047, 0. 002, and 0. 0003, respectively for bacterial Chao 1 values).
