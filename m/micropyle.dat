25|$|In {{addition}} to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an aril, a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle (funiculus), (as in yew and nutmeg) or an oily appendage, an elaiosome (as in Corydalis), or hairs (trichomes).

25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the <b>micropyle</b> and fertilise it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{flowering}} plants, the anthers of {{the flower}} produce microspores by meiosis. These undergo mitosis to form male gametophytes, each of which contains two haploid cells. Meanwhile, the ovules produce megaspores by meiosis, further division of these form the female gametophytes, which are very strongly reduced, each consisting only of a few cells, {{one of which is}} the egg. When a pollen grain adheres to the stigma of a carpel it germinates, developing a pollen tube that grows through the tissues of [...] the style, entering the ovule through the <b>micropyle.</b> When the tube reaches the egg sac, two sperm cells pass through it into the female gametophyte and fertilisation takes place.|$|E
2500|$|When {{placed on}} the stigma of a {{flowering}} plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a pollen tube, which grows down the tissue of the style to the ovary, and makes its way along the placenta, guided by projections or hairs, to the <b>micropyle</b> of an ovule. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in {{the tip of the}} pollen tube. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during pollen tube growth appear to be efficiently repaired in the generative cell that carries the male genomic information to be passed on to the next plant generation.

The elongate testicular region is closely attached to the GL. Among the ovulated eggs in the GL, those in the anterior part of the GL have <b>micropyles</b> but no perivitelline space (are not yet fertilized), whereas those in the posterior part of the GL are fertilized.

2500|$|The pollen grains are {{dispersed}} by {{the wind}} to the female, [...] ovulate cone that {{is made up of}} many overlapping scales (sporophylls, and thus megasporophylls), each protecting two ovules, each of which consists of a megasporangium [...] (the nucellus) wrapped in [...] two layers of tissue, the integument and the cupule, that were derived from highly modified branches of ancestral gymnosperms. [...] When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the <b>micropyle</b> ( [...] a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) [...] often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop. The pollen enters a [...] pollen chamber close to the nucellus, and there [...] it may wait for a year before it germinates and forms a pollen tube that grows through the wall of the megasporangium (=nucellus) where fertilisation takes place. During this time, the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to form four haploid cells, three of which degenerate. The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. [...] Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside. Fertilisation takes place when the nucleus of one of the sperm cells enters the egg cell in the megagametophyte’s archegonium.|$|E
60|$|Having now endeavoured to {{show that}} the several {{foregoing}} assumptions are to a certain extent supported by analogous facts, and having alluded {{to some of the most}} doubtful points, we will consider how far the hypothesis brings under a single point of view the various cases enumerated in the First Part. All the forms of reproduction graduate into one another and agree in their product; for it is impossible to distinguish between organisms produced from buds, from self-division, or from fertilised germs; such organisms are liable to variations of the same nature and to reversions of the same kind; and as, according to our hypothesis, all the forms of reproduction depend on the aggregation of gemmules derived from the whole body, we can understand this remarkable agreement. Parthenogenesis is no longer wonderful, and if we did not know that great good followed from the union of the sexual elements derived from two distinct individuals, the wonder would be that parthenogenesis did not occur much oftener than it does. On any ordinary theory of reproduction the formation of graft-hybrids, and the action of the male element on the tissues of the mother-plant, as well as on the future progeny of female animals, are great anomalies; but they are intelligible on our hypothesis. The reproductive organs do not actually create the sexual elements; they merely determine the aggregation and perhaps the multiplication of the gemmules in a special manner. These organs, however, together with their accessory parts, have high functions to perform. They adapt one or both elements for independent temporary existence, and for mutual union. The stigmatic secretion acts on the pollen of a plant of the same species in a wholly different manner to what it does on the pollen of one belonging to a distinct genus or family. The spermatophores of the Cephalopoda are wonderfully complex structures, which were formerly mistaken for parasitic worms; and the spermatozoa of some animals possess attributes which, if observed in an independent animal, would be put down to instinct guided by sense-organs,--as when the spermatozoa of an insect find their way into the minute <b>micropyle</b> of the egg.|$|E
50|$|The integuments do not enclose the {{nucellus}} completely but retain {{an opening}} at the apex {{referred to as the}} <b>micropyle.</b> The <b>micropyle</b> opening allows the pollen (a male gametophyte) to enter the ovule for fertilization.

Subsequently, the <b>micropyle</b> closes. In angiosperms, only a pollen tube enters the <b>micropyle.</b> During germination, the seedling's radicle emerges through the <b>micropyle.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{eggs are}} derived from {{materials}} ingested as a larva and in some species, from the spermatophores received from males during mating. An egg can only be 1/1000 {{the mass of the}} female, yet she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs. The egg is covered by a hard-ridged protective outer layer of shell, called the chorion. It is lined with a thin coating of wax, which prevents the egg from drying out. Each egg contains a number of <b>micropyles,</b> or tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, the purpose of which is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly and moth eggs vary greatly in size between species, but they are all either spherical or ovate.|$|R
40|$|Material of two clones of Pinus radiata (19 and 55), {{harvested}} from a seed orchard at Kaingaroa, at intervals of 1 - 4 weeks was studied. The same clones {{and some others}} were harvested less frequently from Whakarewarewa. Dissection and counts of terminal shoot components for each harvest confirmed that, as in other species of Pinus, female cones are initiated in summer. Cones emerge from their bud scales prior to pollen shed in early spring. Pollination drops are produced by different ovules throughout the cone's receptive period. One ovule can produce a drop {{on more than one}} occasion. In a simulated drop, pollen floats through the fluid with its wings upward. Pollen treated with chloroform does not float, but still reaches ovule <b>micropyles</b> when applied to bagged cones. An electron microscope study of receptive ovules showed that the most active cells were the nucellus cap cells, some of which develop vacuoles and collapse. Commencement of pollen shed varies with year. Duration at Whaka. (1972) was five weeks, but the timing of clonal receptivity varies. Receptive duration of cones varied from 3 to 13 days, depending on weather, and for bagged cones was shorter than for unbagged cones. Highly significant year to year differences in the amount of pollen trapped were shown. Counts showed a highly significant difference between clones in the amount of pollen in ovule <b>micropyles.</b> P. radiata ovules develop like other pinus ovules, but the duration of developmental phases is longer. A band of elongated thick-walled cells connecting the ovule and the scale vascular tissue differentiates by fertilization. Causes and frequency of ovule loss are described, along with other factors affecting seed production, (total scale number, potential seeds, fertilization failure and embryo breakdown). Clone 55 produces fewer seeds per cone than clone 19, but accommodates more archegonia and pollen. It has fewer unpollinated ovules, but more pollinated ovules abort. Year and site differences also affect seed yield per cone...|$|R

Molecular genetics, phytochemistry and host-parasite relationships have indicated a relationship between this woody, pantropical tribe of Flacourtiaceae and a small, trigeneric family of herbaceous, southern African endemics, the Achariaceae. In the present study, ovule and seed structure in Kiggelaria were investigated and compared with relevant data recently reported for Achariaceae.

In addition, eggshell morphology allows us to identify female imagoes at species level when they lack valid taxonomic features, since eggs are completely formed in mature female nymphs.

At present, this classification continues to be used as the basic reference in the morphological description of mayfly eggs, although it can only be done with SEM.
