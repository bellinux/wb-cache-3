5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%.
