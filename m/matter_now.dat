500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero <b>Matter</b> <b>now.</b> The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed {{instruments}} both acoustic and electric." [...] He praised several songs as being [...] "as powerful as anything the band has done." [...] Browne criticized the album's production, saying [...] "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." [...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't <b>matter</b> <b>now.</b> All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine." ...|$|E

To date, this matter has not been investigated or reviewed for possible violations of the Louisiana Criminal Code. Therefore, this <b>matter</b> <b>now</b> needs to be investigated for possible state criminal violations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Mitchell wisely {{shared the}} view of his predecessor, in that the church should seek a {{location}} not so hemmed in by ever-growing businesses that {{had taken over the}} area. The trustees felt likewise; but still, many members of the congregation did not agree. The dispute was taken to Presbytery; eventually the matter was taken to court, and soon news of the discernment broke out in the newspapers. The matter was finally resolved, in favor of removal to a new location. In 1887, Mrs. Truman G. Avery who lived at the site now occupied by Kleinhans Music Hall donated a parcel of land across the circle at the corner of Wadsworth and Pennsylvania Streets in memory of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Stephen G. Austin. [...] The <b>matter</b> <b>now</b> settled; the days of historic [...] "Old First" [...] were now numbered. [...] By April 1889 the congregation was ordered by the city to sell the property to Erie County Saving Bank and it was announced in July 1890 that the Old First Church would soon be demolished {{to make way for the}} Erie County Savings Bank's new office.|$|E

2500|$|Paragraph 19: The great mistake made {{in regard}} to the <b>matter</b> <b>now</b> under {{consideration}} is to take up with the notion that class is naturally hostile to class, and that the wealthy and the working men are intended by nature to live in mutual conflict. So irrational and so false is this view that the direct contrary is the truth. Just as the symmetry of the human frame {{is the result of the}} suitable arrangement of the different parts of the body, so in a State is it ordained by nature that these two classes should dwell in harmony and agreement, so as to maintain the balance of the body politic. Each needs the other: capital cannot do without labor, nor labor without capital. Mutual agreement results in the beauty of good order, while perpetual conflict necessarily produces confusion and savage barbarity. Now, in preventing such strife as this, and in uprooting it, the efficacy of Christian institutions is marvellous and manifold. First of all, there is no intermediary more powerful than religion (whereof the Church is the interpreter and guardian) in drawing the rich and the working class together, by reminding each of its duties to the other, and especially of the obligations of justice.|$|E
