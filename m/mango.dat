5|$|Napoleon {{had put a}} {{price on}} Federico Pistrucci's head, as he had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French {{advanced}} towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school.

There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. <b>Mango</b> told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe <b>Mango,</b> a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the ultrasonic wave characteristic at arumanis mangoesdamage caused by fruit fly.

The mean attenuation coefficient arumanis mangoeswhich damaged by fruit fly was 30. 67 Np/m, mean velocity of ultrasonic wave was 731. 72 m/s and Monumber was 6. 40.

50|$|Consider {{an example}} {{regarding}} reinstatement: say you learned {{an aversion to}} <b>mangos</b> because you got sick after eating one on a trip.

Reinstatement suggests that if you became sick again for some reason, the aversion to <b>mangos</b> would return even if your illness {{had nothing to do}} with eating <b>mangos.</b> In this example, after extinction, presentation of the US (the experience of being sick) brings about the conditioned behaviour to be aversive to <b>mangos.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{suitability}} of the humidity chambers known as Evaporative Cooling System (ECS) developed by Nigerian Stored Products Research Institute as storage structures for <b>mangoes</b> were compared for nine days between June-July 2012.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} use of ethy-gen II ® {{ripening}} concentrate (150 - 300 ppm of ethylene) {{as an alternative to}} the traditional method of off vine ripening would support ripening of locally cultivated <b>mangoes.</b> <b>Mangoes,</b> Keith variety, were treated with the ripening concentrate for 15 h in Graff ® standard reefer of 66. 5 m 3. Humidity was sustained by knapsack spraying of 20 litres of water inside the reefer. Fruits were stored for 6 days after treatment at ambient temperature 23 ± 2 o C, vented 30 min per day (1000 hGMT) in an air tight room to further ripe the <b>mangoes.</b> Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and sensory quality were studied at an interval of 2 days during the storage period. Sensory quality was assessed specifically on day 2 of storage. Results showed that ethy-gen II ® treated <b>mangoes</b> ripened uniformly and faster than untreated <b>mangoes</b> Treated <b>mangoes</b> had higher average TSS, attaining an average brix (14. 8 o) at day 2 of storage. The control had brix of 12. 18 o at the end of the storage period. Treated <b>mangoes</b> had the highest percentage (100 %) while the control had 34. 81 % at day 6 of storage. The fruity odour of the ripening concentrate had an impact on the taste of treated <b>mangoes,</b> however sensory evaluation revealed no significant difference (p < 0. 05) among treatments. Ethylene produced from ethy-gen II ® supports uniform ripening of locally cultivated <b>mangoes</b> and increased period of ventilation during storage helps to remove the fruity odour...|$|R
