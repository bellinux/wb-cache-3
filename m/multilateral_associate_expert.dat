40|$|Expert {{systems can}} be used to govern the {{intelligent}} control of vehicles, for example the Robotic Air Vehicle (RAV). Due {{to the nature of the}} RAV system the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system needs to perform in a demanding real-time environment. The use of a parallel processing capability to support the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system's computational requirement is critical in this application. Thus, algorithms for parallel real-time expert systems must be designed, analyzed, and synthesized. The design process incorporates a consideration of the rule-set/face-set size along with representation issues. These issues are looked at in reference to information movement and various inference mechanisms. Also examined is the process involved with transporting the RAV expert system functions from the TI Explorer, where they are implemented in the Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), to the iPSC Hypercube, where the system is synthesized using Concurrent Common LISP (CCLISP). The transformation process for the ART to CCLISP conversion is described. The performance characteristics of the parallel implementation of these expert systems on the iPSC Hypercube are compared to the TI Explorer implementation...|$|R

30|$|Like {{many other}} {{developing}} {{cities in the}} world, major cities in South Korea have experienced a massive expansion over the past decades. Many reasons can be accounted for this, but during the 1990 s {{it was obvious that}} the Korean government mainly focused its national strategy on economic growth [32, 36]. Since 1950 when the Korean War ended, it was undoubtedly clear that the socioeconomic status of South Korea was in its deepest downturn. As a response, government officials and <b>associated</b> <b>experts</b> dedicated themselves to improving economic status and concentrating on quantitative growth [37]. This type of approach works mainly for the major cities where the necessary socioeconomic infrastructure is maintained.

Consequently, in our evaluation we compare the different approaches, exploring a variety of associations along with other operational parameters (such as topicality). Using the TREC Enterprise corpora, we show that the second strategy consistently outperforms the first.

40|$|The Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) uses a large {{macroeconomic}} {{model to}} create forecasts of various important macroeconomic variables. The outcomes {{of this model}} are usually filtered by experts, {{and it is the}} expert forecasts that are made available to the general public. In this paper we re-create the model forecasts for the period 1997 - 2008 and compare the expert forecasts with the pure model forecasts. Our key findings from the first time that this unique database has been analyzed are that (i) experts adjust upwards more often; (ii) expert adjustments are not autocorrelated, but their sizes do depend on the value of the model forecast; (iii) the CPB model forecasts are biased for a range of variables, but (iv) at the same time, the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> forecasts are more often unbiased; and that (v) expert forecasts are far more accurate than the model forecasts, particularly when the forecast horizon is short. In summary, the final CPB forecasts de-bias the model forecasts and lead to higher accuracies than the initial model forecasts. Macroeconomic forecasting Expert adjustment Forecast accuracy...|$|R
