5|$|Swaminarayan {{was born}} Ghanshyam Pande in Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, India in 1781. In 1792, {{he began a}} seven-year pilgrimage across India {{at the age of}} 11 years, {{adopting}} the name Nilkanth Varni. During this journey, he did welfare activities and after 9 years and 11 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> journey, he settled in the state of Gujarat around 1799. In 1800, he was initiated into the Uddhav sampradaya by his guru, Swami Ramanand, and was given the name Sahajanand Swami. In 1802, his guru handed over the leadership of the Uddhav Sampraday to him before his death. Sahajanand Swami held a gathering and taught the Swaminarayan Mantra. From this point onwards, he was known as Swaminarayan. The Uddhav Sampraday became known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday.|$|E

However, perhaps due to the lukewarm-at-best critical and financial success which the band met, Page and Rodgers decided to disband The Firm within <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> album's release.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of Sections 5(2) and 37(1) of the 1920 act, Roman Catholics once again became {{eligible}} to occupy the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the British monarch's representative in Ireland. Within <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> legislation passing, Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent became in April 1921 the first Roman Catholic Lord Lieutenant of Ireland since the penal laws forbade such appointments in 1685. Because of {{the establishment of the}} Irish Free State in 1922 and the altered constitutional relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom, FitzAlan was also the last Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} has been cracking down on unregulated mining operations, which account for almost 80percent of the country's 16,000mines. The closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half {{the average number of}} miners killed, to about six a day, in the first six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year, the {{government has}} said. Major gas explosions in coal mines remain a problem, though the number of accidents and deaths have gradually declined year by year, the chief of the State Administration of Work Safety, Luo Lin, told a national conference in September.|$|E
25|$|The pace of killings slowed in 1942, as ghettoised Jewish slave {{workers were}} {{appropriated}} by the Wehrmacht. As Soviet troops advanced in 1943, the Nazi units {{tried to cover}} up the crime under the Aktion 1005 directive. Eighty inmates from the nearby Stutthof concentration camp were formed into Leichenkommando ("corpse units"). The workers were forced to dig up bodies, pile them on wood and burn them. The ashes were then ground up, mixed with sand and buried. After <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> gruesome work, the brigade managed to escape through a tunnel dug with spoons on 19 April 1944. Eleven of the 80 who escaped survived the war; their testimony contributed to revealing the massacre.|$|E

25|$|The Air Crew Europe Star {{was awarded}} for {{operational}} flying from {{bases in the}} United Kingdom over Europe from {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939 to 5 June 1944, the day before the D-Day Normandy Invasion, both dates inclusive. For air crew of the Air Forces, two months of operational flying was required in order to qualify for the award of the Air Crew Europe Star. Army personnel qualified for this star after they had served on air crew duties for four months, provided two <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> minimum four-month period had been operational flying over Europe with at least one operational sortie. The 1939-1945 Star must already have been earned before commencing qualifying service for the Air Crew Europe Star.|$|E
25|$|During that conflict, France {{had been}} pinned down in Europe {{fighting}} Continental powers while Britain defeated the French navy and won victories in India, the West Indies and North America. However, Britain's strategic {{position at the}} beginning of 1778 was far different from the one she enjoyed in 1756. Gone was the alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia: in 1778 Britain was diplomatically isolated and without European allies. In the first <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year, Britain attempted, without success, to find a Continental ally to engage the power of France. This failure produced the central strategic fact of the War of 1778: there would be no competing European campaigns to absorb France's strength. European isolation didn't matter in peacetime, but Britain was at serious disadvantage without European allies in war against France.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{needed to}} find a vehicle to {{continue}} to contain Saddam because the CIA said {{all we have to}} do is wait six months and Saddam is going to collapse on his own volition. That vehicle is sanctions. They needed a justification; the justification was disarmament. They drafted a Chapter 7 resolution of the United Nations Security Council calling for the disarmament of Iraq and saying in Paragraph 14 that if Iraq complies, sanctions will be lifted. Within <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> resolution being passed—and the United States drafted and voted in favor of this resolution—within months, the President, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his Secretary of State, James Baker, are saying publicly, not privately, publicly that even if Iraq complies with its obligation to disarm, economic sanctions will be maintained until which time Saddam Hussein is removed from power.|$|E

25|$|Field became First Sea Lord in July 1930. The {{greatest}} crisis {{faced by}} Field at the Admiralty was the pay crisis that soon followed. With the ongoing effects of worldwide depression and budget restrictions, a 25% pay cut was introduced across the fleet and one shilling per day {{was taken from}} every naval man. It were these proposed measures {{which led to the}} Invergordon Mutiny in September 1931 when the sailors of the Atlantic Fleet at Invergordon left their ships and refused duty. At King George V's insistence, Admiral Sir John Kelly, who was popular with the fleet, was brought out of retirement to take command of the Atlantic Fleet, and the cabinet, acting on Field's advice, hurriedly reconsidered its budget: the pay cuts were restricted to 10% rather than 25%. During the early <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> crisis, Field suffered a perforated ulcer.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 1717, the Spanish Crown granted Danío {{a second}} term as {{governor}} of Puerto Rico. This was a goal that he and Enríquez had originally planned {{since the end of}} his first administration. However, with time the privateer lost interest, feeling that it was no longer necessary to secure his goals. Danío did not took the office immediately since he was ordered to gather and equip a hundred soldiers that would accompany him. The enemies of Enríquez panicked, fearing that the privateer would possess the support of the governor, bishop and accountant. They soon launched an aggressive defamation campaign to revoke this appointment and seized as much control as they could before his arrival. However, their initiative failed. Enríquez and Danío had remained close following the first term, with one of his nephews receiving his education along Vicente. However, the irregularity in the fulfillment of their previous agreement took a toll. Knowing this, Enríquez quickly tried to once again earn his favor through letters, directly accusing his adversaries for the breach of their accord. Danío arrived to San Juan on April 6, 1720, and was immediately received by a belligerent Pozo, who told him that the privateers' enemies were now his own. During the first <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> term, the governor actually persecuted this group. Enríquez thrived, his fleet capturing four vessels, two from the Netherlands and one from Great Britain and France apiece.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the South Korean {{government}} announced that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] {{had brought in}} $13.4 million to the country's audio sector, and it subsequently launched a campaign to further expand the K-Pop music industry overseas. According to the Bank of Korea, the country's services account recorded a surplus of USD 2.3 billion {{in the first nine}} <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year, compared to a deficit of USD 4.5 billion last year. This was mainly due to the growing influence and popularity of K-pop songs such as [...] "Gangnam Style".

500|$|By {{examining}} leaked German documents, crashed Luftwaffe bombers, Enigma decryptions, {{and through}} German {{prisoner of war}} interrogations, Jones discovered that high-frequency radio signals were being transmitted across Britain from somewhere on the Continent, and he believed they came from a directional radar system. Within a few <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> discovery, Jones had identified several such radar systems, {{one of which was}} being used to detect British bombers; this was known as the [...] "Freya-Meldung-Freya" [...] array, named after the ancient Norse goddess. Jones was finally able to see concrete proof of the presence of the Freya system after being shown several mysterious objects visible in reconnaissance pictures taken by the RAF near Cap d'Antifer - two circular emplacements in each of which was a rotating [...] "mattress" [...] antenna approximately [...] wide. Having found proof of these Freya installations, Jones and the other scientists under his command could begin devising countermeasures against the system, and the RAF could begin to locate and destroy the installations themselves.|$|E
500|$|Webster's first {{application}} for parole in February 2004 was denied {{as he had}} not yet undertaken work release. After completing a few <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> program, Webster was released on parole on 10 June 2004 after serving 14½ years. The conditions of his parole specified that he would only be allowed to visit Newcastle or Stockton with permission from his probation and parole officer. Webster's parole was discussed in the Parliament of New South Wales, with Minister John Hatzistergos responding to queries and concluding that the option to supervise Webster's re-integration into society was better than the alternative of releasing him without supervision {{at the end of his}} sentence. Following his release, Leigh's family stated they harboured [...] "no ill thoughts" [...] towards Webster and wished him well in the [...] "re-establishment of his life". Webster's parole was revoked in November 2004 after he was arrested for assault; he pleaded not guilty, citing self-defence. He was released from prison in May 2005 after the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{government}} of the 5,000 and under the democracy that replaced it in 410 BC, Theramenes served as a general for several years, commanding fleets in the Aegean Sea and the Hellespont. Shortly after the rise of {{the government}} of the 5,000, Theramenes set sail to the Hellespont to join Thrasybulus and the generals elected by the army at Samos. After the Athenian victory at Abydos, he took thirty triremes to attack the rebels on Euboea, who were building a causeway to Boeotia to provide land access to their island. Unable to stop the construction, he plundered the territory of several rebellious cities, then travelled around the Aegean suppressing oligarchies and raising funds from various cities of the Athenian Empire. He then took his fleet to Macedon, where he assisted the Macedonian king Archelaus in his siege of Pydna, but, with that siege dragging on, he sailed on to join Thrasybulus in Thrace. The fleet soon moved on from there to challenge Mindarus' fleet, which had seized the city of Cyzicus. Theramenes commanded one wing of the Athenian fleet in the resulting Battle of Cyzicus, a decisive Athenian victory. In that battle, Alcibiades (who had been recalled from exile by the fleet at Samos shortly after the coup) led a decoy force that drew the Spartan fleet out into open water, while Thrasybulus and Theramenes, each commanding an independent squadron, cut off the Spartans' retreat. Mindarus was forced to flee to a nearby beach, and vicious fighting ensued on land as the Athenians attempted to drag off the Spartan ships. Thrasybulus and Alcibiades kept the Spartans occupied while Theramenes joined up with the nearby Athenian land forces and then hurried to the rescue; his arrival precipitated a total Athenian victory, in which all the Spartan ships were captured. In the wake of this victory, the Athenians captured Cyzicus and constructed a fort at Chrysopolis, from which they extracted a customs duty of one tenth on all ships passing through the Bosporus. Theramenes and another general remained at this fort with a garrison of thirty ships to oversee the collection of the duty. At Athens, meanwhile, {{the government of}} the 5,000 was replaced by a restored democracy within a few <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> battle; Donald Kagan has suggested that the absence of Theramenes, [...] "the best spokesman for the moderates", paved the way for this restoration.|$|E
2500|$|Law {{graduates}} {{wishing to}} work and be known as barristers must take the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC – previously Bar Vocational Course or BVC) {{at one of the}} institutions authorised by the Bar Council to offer the BPTC.

However, before they can practise independently they must first undertake 12 months of pupillage. The first six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period is spent shadowing more senior practitioners, after which pupil barristers may begin to undertake some court work of their own. Following successful completion of this stage, most barristers then join a set of Chambers, a group of counsel who share the costs of premises and support staff whilst remaining individually self-employed.|$|E
2500|$|Although RCA did not {{actively}} promote Rhymes & Reasons with a tour, Denver himself {{embarked on an}} impromptu supporting tour throughout the Midwest, stopping at towns and cities as the fashion took him, offering to play free concerts at local venues.

[...] With his foot in the door as author of [...] "Leaving on a Jet Plane", he was often successful in gaining some valuable promotional airtime, usually featuring one or two songs performed live. Some venues would let him play for the [...] "door"; others restricted him to selling copies of the album at intermission and after the show.
