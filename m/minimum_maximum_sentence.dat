50|$|Mandatory {{sentencing}} {{requires that}} offenders serve a predefined term for certain crimes, commonly serious and violent offenses. Judges {{are bound by}} law; these sentences are produced through the legislature, not the judicial system. They are instituted to expedite the sentencing process and limit the possibility of irregularity of outcomes due to judicial discretion. Mandatory sentences are typically given to people convicted of certain serious and/or violent crimes, and require a prison sentence. Mandatory sentencing laws vary across nations; they are more prevalent in common law jurisdictions because civil law jurisdictions usually prescribe <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>sentences</b> for every type of crime in explicit laws.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of a Parole Board contemplating whether to grant parole release to a {{prisoner}} who has finished serving their minimum sentence. The model implies a simple outcome test for racial prejudice robust to the inframarginality problem. Our test involves running simple regressions of whether a prisoner recidivates on the exposure time to the risk of recidivism and its square, using only the sample of prisoners who are granted parole release strictly between their <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>sentences</b> and separately by race. If the co-efficient estimates on the exposure time term differ by race, then there is evidence of racial prejudice against the racial group with the smaller coefficient estimate.

40|$|Although {{the public}} often has {{disagreements}} over which {{parts of the}} legal system should be reformed, most people probably do not understand the importance of sentencing in the judicial system. People may not realize there is a debate over different types of sentencing procedures; however, they could have an opinion on how judges should reach their decisions on sentencing. In some jurisdictions, laws have been passed to give judges a guideline to follow when sentencing convicted offenders. This may be set up as a range of length of prison terms or it may include a <b>minimum</b> or <b>maximum</b> <b>sentence.</b> However, in many jurisdictions, judges are given a considerable amount of discretion over their sentencing. Some legislatures have voted to enact determinate sentencing, so some states clearly believe sentencing limits are advantageous. However, not all jurisdictions have decided to use sentencing limits. This makes it clear that some people do not support limits on judicial discretion. How do we explain the variation in individual attitudes concerning the discretion given to judges in sentencing?

40|$|Much that we {{know about}} crime and {{criminal}} justice has come from comparisons between different countries and systems. Particularly fruitful have been comparisons between the world's two great legal families ⎯ the Anglo-American common law system and the continental civil law system. Over hundreds of years, comparisons between these two great systems have led to many major, and countless smaller, improvements in both systems and many countries. American criminal justice has benefitted immensely from this interchange. Penal codes, codes of criminal procedure, <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>sentences,</b> and organized police forces {{are just a few of}} the ideas that have come from the continent. Even the concept of a public prosecutor may be a product of this interchange. England had no public prosecutor in colonial times. It made its first small beginning in 1869 and did not fully adopt the idea until 1985. There have been public prosecutors in the United States, however, German and American Prosecutions 1 since early colonial days. While the evidence is far from conclusive, the first American public prosecutor was probably Dutch. Having long had a public prosecutor in their home country, it was natural that the Dutch should bring this institution with them to the New World. When New Amsterdam became New York in 1664, the Dutch system of prosecution seems to have been continued. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article is, in effect, {{the second}} half of the author 2 ̆ 7 s {{argument}} against the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment in Blakely v. Washington. The first half appeared in 2 ̆ 2 Train Wreck? Or Can the Federal Sentencing System Be Saved? A Plea for Rapid Reversal of Blakely v. Washington, 2 ̆ 2 41 American Criminal Law Review 217 (2004), and made a pragmatic, consequentialist argument against the Blakely result. This Article takes the next step of providing an alternative constitutional model of criminal sentencing to that offered by Justice Scalia in Blakely. The model emphasizes that a good constitutional model should pay particular attention to the functions and interaction of the major institutional actors in the process of defining and punishing crimes. In particular, it proposes that a crime for purposes of the Sixth Amendment jury trial right must be defined by a legislature and consist of the smallest bundle of facts that (a) within a family of offense types must be proven in order to expose a defendant to a particular <b>maximum</b> <b>sentence,</b> or (b) must be proven to require a defendant to suffer a mandatory minimum penalty designated by the legislature. If a legislature (or sentencing commission legislatively authorized to do so) attaches two sentences to a particular bundle of facts - a high statutory <b>maximum</b> <b>sentence</b> and a lower presumptive <b>maximum</b> <b>sentence</b> - the higher maximum is the statutory maximum whose triggering bundle of facts must be proven to a jury. Putting it another way, legislatures are permitted to to establish both <b>maximum</b> possible <b>sentences</b> and lower presumptive sentences as legal incidents of proof of the same bundle of facts. Facts in addition to those that define a crime which create presumptive <b>maximum</b> <b>sentences</b> lower than the statutory <b>maximum</b> or presumptive <b>minimum</b> <b>sentences</b> higher than the statutory minimum are sentencing factors that may be proven to a sentencing judge rather than a jury. The distinction between statutory <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>sentences</b> and constitutionally acceptable presumptive sentencing ranges within those statutory limits would be the existence of meaningful discretionary judicial authority to sentence outside the presumptive range based on the facts of the case or the circumstances of the defendant. The Article discusses the advantages of this model in comparison to the narrow formalism of Blakely. It emphasizes that such a model accords both legislatures and juries their proper and important place in defining and punishing crime, while according judicial sentencing discretion constitutional stature for the first time. The Article emphasizes that its approach to defining crime must be coupled with a re-examination of the due process rights accorded defendants at sentencing and, ideally, with a reinvigorated Eight Amendment review of the severity of non-capital punishments...|$|R
