25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, <b>measurement</b> <b>principles,</b> and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All kinds of different political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E

50|$|Benjamin Drake Wright (March 30, 1926 - October 25, 2015) was an American psychometrician. He {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for the widespread adoption of Georg Rasch's <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> and models. In the wake of what Rasch referred to as Wright's “almost unbelievable activity in this field” in the period from 1960 to 1972, Rasch's ideas entered the mainstream in high-stakes testing, professional certification and licensure examinations, and in research employing tests, and surveys and assessments across a range of fields. Wright's seminal contributions to measurement continued until 2001, and included articulation of philosophical principles, production of practical results and applications, software development, development of estimation methods and model fit statistics, vigorous support for students and colleagues, and the founding of professional societies and new publications.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA new {{low cost}} {{integration}} {{of force and}} moment measurements into a wheel bearing is proposed. Those data will enhance performances of existing driving assistance systems and enable emergence of new ones. The <b>measurement</b> <b>principle</b> stems from the dependancy between the contact forces transmitted by the balls and the force components to be measured. The deformations caused by the contact forces come from strain gauges installed on the outer ring of the bearing. We claim that the clear mechanical interpretation of the <b>measurement</b> <b>principle</b> makes it reliable and robust. Another aspect of the <b>measurement</b> <b>principle</b> stems from the periodicity of the deformations {{with respect to the}} angular positions of the balls; they can be represented as sums of harmonics. The study shows that the Fourier coefficients of gauge signals are functions of the force components to be measured. It is shown that the model obtained by keeping only a few harmonics is relevant to experimental data. Local inversibility of the system is discussed from sensibility and condition number considerations...|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of the modern optical mouse at Hewlett-Packard Co. {{was supported by a}} succession of related projects during the 1990s at HP Laboratories. In 1992 William Holland was awarded US Patent 5,089,712 and John Ertel, William Holland, Kent Vincent, Rueiming Jamp, and Richard Baldwin were awarded US Patent 5,149,980 for measuring linear paper advance in a printer by correlating images of paper fibers. Ross R. Allen, David Beard, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis were awarded US Patents 5,578,813 (1996) and 5,644,139 (1997) for 2-dimensional optical navigational (i.e., position <b>measurement)</b> <b>principles</b> based on detecting and correlating microscopic, inherent features of the surface over which the navigation sensor travelled, and using position measurements of each end of a linear (document) image sensor to reconstruct an image of the document. This is the freehand scanning concept used in the HP CapShare 920 handheld scanner. By describing an optical means that explicitly overcame the limitations of wheels, balls, and rollers used in contemporary computer mice, the optical mouse was anticipated. These patents formed the basis for US Patent 5,729,008 (1998) awarded to Travis N. Blalock, Richard A. Baumgartner, Thomas Hornak, Mark T. Smith, and Barclay J. Tullis, where surface feature image sensing, image processing, and image correlation was realized by an integrated circuit to produce a position measurement. Improved precision of 2D optical navigation, needed for application of optical navigation to precise 2D measurement of media (paper) advance in HP DesignJet large format printers, was further refined in US Patent 6,195,475 awarded in 2001 to Raymond G. Beausoleil, Jr., and Ross R. Allen.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} teacher use of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> and the factors influencing this use in the assessment of student achievement in the Riftvalley Province (Kenya). Given that most of the assessment in the classroom consists of instruments developed by teachers, a first step in exploring the utility of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> is to investigate the use of these principles in specific assessment areas. This could lead to the determination and the improvement of the fit between measurement training and teacher classroom assessment practices. The study was designed to provide information on teacher use of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> by considering whether teachers had received training in educational <b>measurement</b> <b>principles,</b> how important they perceived these principles to be, and how often they used the principles in the assessment of student achievement. The study was also designed to determine factors influencing the use of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> in schools. The results show that teachers have been trained in the principles of educational measurement. However, there is some indication that measurement training did not effectively address the assessment concerns of many classroom teachers. Teachers do not feel adequately prepared in test construction, marking, and the reporting of student assessment results. The results on the importance of <b>measurement</b> <b>principles</b> provide some clear indication that teachers attach much importance to the principles for test construction, test administration, marking, and the reporting of student assessment results. Teacher interviews revealed that teachers are overwhelmed by the demands associated with Kenya's 8 - 4 - 4 system of education. On the basis of the study findings, suggestions were made for improving teacher training in measurement and for further research. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of the undertaken investigation on industrial capacitance sensor interface for measuring small displacements, with focus on immunity to external interference, especially when using long cables. Several principles have been investigated and comparison has been made, followed by the proposed <b>measurement</b> <b>principle,</b> which can be implemented without electrical contact with the target. The range of measurement is up to 10 pF. Such sensor interface is designed to tolerate up to a 10 -meter cable, and more importantly, due to the special <b>measurement</b> <b>principle,</b> such system is designed to have an improved immunity to external interferences. There are several advantages of such a system, compared with existing capacitive sensor interfaces: (i) the special sensor configuration minimizes external interference (mostly electromagnetic interference); (ii) the <b>measurement</b> <b>principle</b> makes the front-end amplifier less sensitive to non-idealities like offset; (iii) a switch-capacitor type active shielding technique reduces the effect of cable capacitance. The results so far show that the dynamic range of such interface can reach more than 12 bits, with a measurement time less than 100 us.
