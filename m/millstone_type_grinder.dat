40|$|ABSTRACT In {{conventional}} recycling method, {{metal chips}} are cast after pressing and melting in electric arc furnace. Material loss occurs during the recycling from liquid metal {{due to the}} several reasons. Direct recycling method which produces the aluminium powder from aluminium chips using mechanical mill can be an alternative to conventional recycling method. Thus material and energy losses, and labour cost will be reduced by direct recycling method without melting. In this study, the particle morphology of powder direct recycled from AA 6013 aluminium alloy chips with cryogenic, disc and ball <b>type</b> <b>grinders</b> is investigated. Mechanical milling resulted flaky and irregular shaped AA 6013 particles. It was ascertained that the chips did not break sufficiently in despite of the long duration milling mechanisms by ball mill. Cryogenic mill provides the energy required for milling mechanisms to act. Disc mill has the highest impact energy was determined. Consequently, efficiency of ball mill {{is lower than the}} efficiency of cryogenic and disc type mills.

40|$|The Morgantina archaeological area, {{inhabited}} {{from the}} Early Bronze Age, had its widest expansion from the fifth {{to the first}} century BC. The volcanic millstones found at Morgantina fall into three different groups {{on the basis of}} the milling technique: (i) saddle querns (known from the Middle-Late Bronze Age and Iron Age); (ii) rectangular hopper-rubbers (Olynthian) millstones, the invention of which dates to the fifth century BC; and finally (iii) Morgantina-type rotary millstones (starting to be used from the fourth to the third century BC). In order to determine the provenance of the raw materials (lavas) used for all these <b>millstone</b> <b>types,</b> we collected 38 very small rock samples for thin-section modal mineralogy, petrography and major trace element composition. The results have contributed to classifying different lithotypes and distinguishing between provenance from Etna and the Hyblean Mountains, the two volcanic areas respectively north-east and south-east of Morgantina. Saddle querns are made of tholeiitic basaltic andesites from the Hyblean Mountains and transitional basalts, mugearites and hawaiites from Etna. The variety of sources of portable saddle querns, mostly used in households, indicate that there was no general preference for specific quarrying sites. By contrast, the rectangular hopper-rubber and the Morgantina-type millstones, which document the period of Morgantina’s greatest prosperity, are almost completely made of hawaiites from Etna. The use of a specific lithotype (i. e., Etna hawaiite) for the more efficient rectangular hopper-rubber and rotary millstones could be linked to the fact that these mills may have been operated in business establishments. It is worth noting that the Gornalunga river was, in antiquity, a waterway joining Morgantina to the final stretch of the Simeto river and then the Ionian coast. The best candidate areas for the millstone hawaiite quarrying sites from Etna are the far south-western sectors of the volcano, along the Simeto Valley (i. e., the ‘Piano Provenzana’ Formation) or the inner suburb of presentday Catania (i. e., the ‘Pietracannone’ Formation). The very efficient Morgantina-type rotary millstones spread during the reign of Hieron II of Syracuse (275 – 215 BC) in eastern Sicily and met the need for grinding large quantities of cereals during a relatively peaceful time and a period of agricultural development...|$|R

5000|$|A ball mill, a <b>type</b> of <b>grinder,</b> is a {{cylindrical}} device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic {{raw materials}} and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the {{material to be ground}} plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles and stainless steel balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed at one end and discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts (pulleys and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A rock tumbler functions on the same principle. Ball mills are also used in pyrotechnics and the manufacture of black powder, but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as flash powder because of their sensitivity to impact. High-quality ball mills are potentially expensive and can grind mixture particles to as small as 5 nm, enormously increasing surface area and reaction rates.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the prevalence of finger blanching among the workers in a shipyard of Korea using the dose-response relationship suggested by ISO 5349. The characteristics of vibration exposure produced by six <b>types</b> of <b>grinders</b> were investigated. Vibration measurement was made under the real work conditions. Exposure time was estimated by questionnaire and direct observation. In addition, cold provocation tests were performed, and the results from the tests were compared with the estimated prevalence. As a result, 4 hour-energyequivalent frequency-weighted accelerations of the finishing grinding (FG) and the prepainting grinding (PG) jobs were 6. 23 m/s 2 and 13. 39 m/s 2, respectively. The mean exposure time for holding the grinders was 4. 64 h per day. Using the ISO 5349 method, it was predicted that after exposure to vibration for 10. 79 yr, about a half of the FG workers could develop finger blanching. For the PG workers, the corresponding predicted latency was 5. 02 yr. A discrepancy was found between the results from the ISO relationship and those from the cold provocation tests.

Grains were incubated for 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h with inoculum varying in proportion of ruminal fluid and artificial saliva (l:l, 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4). In vitro rates of starch disappearance and coefficients of determination were similar for the 1 : 2, 1 : 3, and 1 : 4 inoculum dilutions and were higher (quadratic, P 3 ̆c 0. 01) than the 1 : 1 dilution. As the proportion of artificial saliva in the inoculum increased, in vitro pH increased (linear, P 3 ̆c 0. 01). In Experiment 2, six grain sorghum lines and a corn control were ground through a l-mm screen in a Udy (cyclone type) or Wiley mill. Starch disappearance for samples ground using a Udy mill were higher (P 0. 10) by grain type fed; however, absolute rates of digestion varied among inoculate sources.

40|$|Are {{anti-vibration}} gloves {{the solution to}} the problem of hand-arm vibration?Vibrations from hand-held machinery are a major problem in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. Research can validate the quality of labour protection gear available on the market and then make recommendations and suggestions for improvements. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how {{anti-vibration gloves}} (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. BackgroundToday, gloves labelled “anti-vibration” (AV) are advertised as “reducing vibration by 40 %”. To be marketed as “AVG”, a glove must be CE-certified and thereby comply with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 10819. The requirements apply only to the suppression of vibration in the palm of the hand, while in many work situations, vibration is transmitted to the fingers. However, in the ISO standard it is pointed out that AVGs provide inadequate damping of vibrations of low frequencies. Such vibrations are common in many hand-held tools and machines in industry and crafts, such as different <b>types</b> of <b>grinders.</b> Some regular protective gloves can even provide amplification of low frequencies but cannot be approved in accordance with this standard. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work to a greater or lesser degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. ImplementationNine subjects, whose work task was to deburr and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. All had extensive experience in this work. Usage times for the individual machines varied between ½ hour and 4 hours/day. The total usage times sometimes exceeded 4 hours/day. The most commonly used rotating machines rotate at high speeds, 100 000 revolutions per minute (rpm), but other machines with low speed, 500 rpm, were also used. Only one model of AVG was tested. The back of the glove was made of porous polyester and the palm of a denser, elastic synthetic material. Approximately 7 mm thick, foam-like materials were built into the palm, thumb and fingers grip side of the glove. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. Results and DiscussionThe comfort in terms of hand temperature was rated mediocre. Grip was rated good while finger sensitivity was rated low. At a so-called “pencil grip”, required for handling small machinery, the gloves were uncomfortable; however, they worked well with larger machines. The majority, eight of the nine individuals, responded that the glove offered good vibration damping. As the hand’s ability to perceive vibrations varies with the frequency of vibration the possibility to self-assess whether a glove is vibration-damping or not largely depends on how well the person can perceive the frequency of the machine in question. With a high-revving machine of, say, 50 000 rpm, the vibration tactility is fairly low, and so is therefore the ability to self-assess the glove’s damping properties. In addition, the vibratory sense in the hand does not reflect the hand-arm weighted vibration level which needs to be measured according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s regulations (AFS 2005 : 15). With regard to the vibrations, large differences between the various machines were measured; hand-arm weighted levels according to the regulations were between 0. 8 and 8. 3 m/s 2. High-revving, ≥ 55 000 rpm, machines gave the lowest weighted vibration levels. A machine’s rotation speed was found to cause the dominant vibration frequency; however, high frequencies from high-speed machines do not increase the hand-arm weighted exposure levels. ConclusionThe vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands. So-called “AVGs” generally give insufficient reduction in vibration exposure. This is demonstrated already by the standard for CE certification of AVGs. For a glove to protect against normal, low-frequency vibrations, it would have to be too heavy and thick to be practical. Despite the limitations of the protection that the CE-marked protective gloves offer against vibrations, we still recommend the use of gloves because: 1) High-frequency vibrations, which are presumed to be harmful, will be damped. 2) The gloves will ensure that vibrations will not be amplified. 3) Gloves keep the hands warm, which is believed to reduce vibration-related disorders...|$|R
