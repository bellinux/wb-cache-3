40|$|The main {{problems}} facing annuity providers relate to adverse selection and mortality risk, the {{risk associated with}} mortality improvements, and to interest rate, reinvestment and in¯ation risk. Annuity providers hedge these risks, wherever possible, by holding suitable <b>matching</b> <b>assets</b> against their annuity liabilities: for example, riskless (government) ®xedincome bonds are used to provide the payments on level annuities, and index-linked bonds are needed if index-linked annuities are to be serviced effectively. However, {{in the absence of}} suitable <b>matching</b> <b>assets,</b> providers are unable to hedge the risks associated with mortality effectively and compensate for this by imposing substantial cost loadings. They also face reinvestment risk if available assets are of insuf®cient duration. Annuitants face interest rate risk prior to purchase and, since most of them prefer the higher initial income from a level annuity compared with an indexed annuity, in¯ation risk after purchase. Some solutions to these problems are considered, including a planned programme of phased annuity purchases to hedge interest rate risk, limited price index bonds to partially hedge in¯ation risk, and survivor (or indexed life) bonds, with coupons declining in direct proportion to the realized mortality of a selected group of annuitants, to hedge mortality risk. Finally, we examine {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different institutional forms for the annuity market, ranging from monopoly provision through limited licensed provision to a fully competitive provision. 1...|$|E

The authors estimate how much durations shorten because of credit risk, basing their estimates on observable data and easily estimated bond pricing parameters.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} rationality of social action. The firm adopting the "red hat" strategy or individuals seeking partners with <b>matching</b> <b>assets</b> and qualifications {{can all be}} seen as agents who try to maximize their utilities by searching for what they regard as the most profitable action. The dissertation includes three distinct chapters. The first chapter reexamines the status exchange hypothesis (Davis 1941; Merton 1941), and specifically reanalyzes the data from Fu (2001) on recent marriages among whites, blacks, Mexicans, and Japanese (from the 1990 PUMS data), which claims to corroborate the status exchange hypothesis for intermarriage between whites and blacks {{as well as between}} whites and Mexican Americans. Using a simple quasisymmetry model, I show that the same-race and mixed-race marriage share a broadly similar pattern of educational homogamy, which is quasi-symmetric in character. Thus, I argue that this suggests little, if any, evidence for the status exchange hypothesis. Furthermore, the evidence strongly indicates that there is a remarkable consistency and symmetry in husband/wife educational attainment regardless of race (with the possible exception of white/white marriages); intermarried couples share a similar level of education, and educational homogamy dominates the educational marriages, no matter what their or their spouse's races are. The second chapter employs a game theory framework as well as case studies to examine the interactions between entrepreneurs and local governments under transitional institutions and examine how these actors play extensive games with perfect information. According to this game, the adoption of the "red hat" strategy is the rational results of the interaction between private firms and local governments. The third chapter employs multi-level logistic models to examine the ACS 2008 data and shows that the multilevel modeling helps to decompose the variance of intermarriage to individual level (preference) and context-level characteristics constraints in the analysis of interracial marriage. Metropolitan-level variables, which are typically ignored in previous research, provide additional understanding of the previous of Asian interracial and endogamous marriage in the United States. Studies of interracial marriage can no longer easily overlook the population geographic distribution and the nativity or generation structure of minority groups...|$|E

In the simulations, the fraction of households borrowing against future income at the time the first child arrives is 14 %.

50|$|In {{the less}} common {{unassigned}} case, the defendant or property/casualty insurer retains the periodic payment obligation and funds it by purchasing an annuity {{from a life}} insurance company, thereby offsetting its obligation with a <b>matching</b> <b>asset.</b> The payment stream purchased under the annuity matches exactly, in timing and amounts, the periodic payments agreed to in the settlement agreement. The defendant or property/casualty company owns the annuity and names the claimant as the payee under the annuity, thereby directing the annuity issuer to send payments directly to the claimant. One of the reasons an unassigned case is less popular is that the obligation is not truly off the books, and the defendant or casualty insurer retains a contingent liability.

40|$|Investment-based asset pricing (Cochrane (1991, 1996)) is {{a useful}} {{approach}} to understanding the cross-section of asset prices and returns. The first chapter incorporates its insights into mutual fund performance evaluation. Motivated by the investment model, I show that investment and profitability convey useful information about future fund returns. However, such information is not taken into account by the standard benchmarks that build exclusively on the size, value, and momentum effects. As a result, funds favoring low investment or high profitability stocks tend to outperform, while funds favoring high investment or low profitability stocks tend to underperform. Accounting for investment and profitability changes performance estimates significantly and helps explain the good performance of growth-oriented funds, high activeness funds, or small funds. I propose new performance benchmarks that incorporate investment and profitability. The results show that a new comprehensive benchmark accounts for the cross-section of stock returns better and tracks mutual fund returns much more closely. The second chapter shows that the investment model <b>matches</b> cross-sectional <b>asset</b> prices both in first differences and in levels. With ten book-to-market deciles as the testing portfolios, the investment model largely matches the Tobin's Q spread, while maintaining {{a good fit for}} the average return spread across the extreme deciles. The model's fit results from three aspects of our econometric strategy: (i) We test the model at the portfolio level to alleviate the impact of measurement errors; (ii) we match the first moment to mitigate the impact of temporal misalignment between asset prices and investment; and (iii) we allow for nonlinear marginal costs of investment. The model also does a good job in <b>matching</b> <b>asset</b> price levels within each industry, allowing technological heterogeneity across industries.

40|$|Abstract: The {{attempt to}} <b>match</b> <b>asset</b> price {{characteristics}} such as the risk-free interest rate, equity premium and the Sharpe ratio with data for models with instantaneous consumption decisions and time separable preferences has not been very successful. Many recent versions of asset pricing models have, in order to match those financial characteristics better with the data, employed habit formation where past consumption acts as a constraint on current consumption. In those models, surplus consumption, consumption over and above past consumption, improves welfare, yet habit formation gives rise to an additional state variable. By studying such a model we also allow for adjustment costs of investment. The asset price characteristics that one obtains from those models may depend on the solution techniques employed. In this paper a stochastic version of a dynamic programming method with adaptive grid scheme is applied to compute the above mentioned asset price characteristics where past consumption decisions are treated as an additional state variable. Since, as shown in Grüne and Semmler (2004), our method produces only negligible errors it is suitable {{to be used as}} solution technique for such models with more complicated decision structure. Using our solution methods shows that there are still remaining puzzles for the consumption based asset pricing model...|$|R
