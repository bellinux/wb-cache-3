Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The <b>man</b> <b>gets</b> up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E

500|$|The film premiered on May 20, in {{competition}} at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. At its first showing to the media, the film received abundant praise, and garnered [...] "some of the best responses of the festival," [...] but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it [...] "can't win, won't win" [...] Cannes's top prize. Brooks explained that [...] "t's too self-consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces {{as opposed to a}} rounded, textured drama," [...] but said that it was his [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said, [...] "Over the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social commentary; the birth of the cosmos {{and the end of the}} world. Turns out what we really wanted all along was a scene in which a <b>man</b> <b>gets</b> his head stomped in a lift. They welcome it in like a long-lost relation." [...] The film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence. Drive also received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd. The festival named Refn best director for Drive.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor {{packaging}} {{a loaf of bread}} for his uncle, the [...] "village wit", – who ironically nicknames him [...] "Beaut" [...] because of his off-putting appearance – in his mother Nance's Coal Creek bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father [...] "Cracked" [...] McGregor). [...] Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting bread on credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work and the young <b>man</b> <b>gets</b> a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a teetotaler up to that point) blind drunk with a [...] "horrible mess" [...] made just for that purpose. Having reached a breaking point, Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the 1893 World's Fair. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely milliner/shop owner, with whom he develops a platonic relationship.|$|E

[...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling."

2500|$|Arbuckle tried {{returning}} to filmmaking, but industry resistance to distributing his pictures continued to linger after his acquittal. He retreated into alcoholism. In {{the words of}} his first wife, [...] "Roscoe only seemed to find solace and comfort in a bottle". Buster Keaton attempted to help Arbuckle by giving him work on his films. Arbuckle wrote the story for a Keaton short called Daydreams (1922). Arbuckle allegedly co-directed scenes in Keaton's Sherlock, Jr. (1924), but {{it is unclear how}} much of this footage remained in the film's final cut. In 1925, Carter Dehaven made the short Character Studies. Arbuckle appeared alongside Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, and Jackie Coogan. The same year, in Photoplays August issue, James R. Quirk wrote [...] "I would like to see Roscoe Arbuckle make a comeback to the screen." [...] He also said [...] "The American nation prides itself upon its spirit of fair play. We like the whole world to look upon America as the place where every <b>man</b> <b>gets</b> a square deal.

2500|$|The film {{begins with}} [...] "1 Nature" [...] at the Nyon {{cultural}} center. A young couple, Marie and her boyfriend, {{are setting up}} a used bookstand. Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears {{that he is a}} professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a <b>man</b> <b>gets</b> out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically drag her away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been watching all along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, [...] "I am at your service." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1894, Morse {{was moved}} to quarterback to replace King. [...] Newspaper {{accounts}} indicate that Morse's move to the quarterback position was less than successful. [...] One paper noted pointed to the quarterback position as Princeton's downfall and noted, [...] "Morse, who by the way is a splendid half, was anything but a success in the position." [...] Morse was sidelined due to illness {{in the middle of}} the season with what was described as [...] "a threatened attack of pneumonia." [...] Morse returned to the lineup for the Penn game and put on a display that drew praise for his [...] "pluck" [...] but also dismay at the physical beating he took. [...] The New York World reported as follows:"Morse and Ward were both cripples. [...] I don't believe in talking about the roughness of the game. [...] Any man who goes into it must expect anything and take it, but Morse was tackled altogether beyond the pale of pardon, more than once. [...] When a <b>man</b> <b>gets</b> as far gone as he was and nothing but his indomitable pluck allowed him to stand, somebody should have had the power and the will to force him to leave the game. [...] But he died fighting ..."Despite the beating, Morse was Princeton's leading rusher in the 1894 Penn game, and his 25-yard run was the longest of the game. [...] However, the beating took a permanent toll on Morse. [...] After the game, The New York Times reported on Morse's retirement from football:"Franklin B. Morse, '95, Princeton's greatest half back, has gone out of training and quit the game. [...] This move was not taken by Morse until it was forced upon him. [...] He has been ill for some time and was really unable to go in the game with Pennsylvania, although he played in that game as long as he could stand on his feet. [...] Since then he has been on the field only a few times, and had to leave the game each time. [...] The whole student body deeply regrets Morse's inability to continue playing." ...|$|E
