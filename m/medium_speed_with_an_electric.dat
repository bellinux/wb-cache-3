50|$|Banana Boats: The {{players were}} divided by sex {{and told to}} climb onto banana boats that were to be towed behind a powerboat. The {{challenge}} was for the men {{to move to the}} womens boat and the women to the mens without anyone falling in the water. There were three rounds, one at a very slow speed, worth $1,000 if successful, one at <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter rope, worth $3,000 if successful, and one at <b>a</b> very fast <b>speed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shorter rope still, worth $6,000 if successful. Each round lasted ten minutes. The players easily won the first round, but ran out of time in the second, after the mens boat tipped over multiple times. The players won the last round with 2 seconds to spare, totaling $7,000 for this assignment.|$|R

The Discovery Cruises web site listed her gross tonnage as 20,186, top speed as 18 kn and passenger capacity as 698. Propulsion was by four Fiat <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> diesel engines <b>with</b> <b>a</b> combined power output of 18,000 shaft horsepower. The engines were individually clutched and geared in pairs to each of the two shafts which drive controllable pitch propellers. This arrangement enabled one or more engines to be shut down and declutched as required. Last registry was under the Saint Kitts and Nevis flag.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} design of an ultra-light-weight power and torque dense motor to enhance the {{performance}} of a light-weight electric racing vehicle. Such a racing vehicle is to compete in formula student racing events. The state-of-the-art powertrain in these vehicles are axial-field machines or <b>medium</b> <b>speed</b> radial-field machines <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gear. This paper concerns a high speed traction machine radial-field design that closely considers the endurance duty-cycle and/or driving cycle of a race car and provides fast acceleration. The proposed electrical machine is designed to be ultra-light-weight. Therefore, an 18, 000 rpm (single gear), 24 slot, 4 pole and 33 Nm brushless highly saturated permanent magnet machine is designed, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> active mass of around 3. 0 kg (~ 10 kW/kg and 10 Nm/kg). To account for the various race events, the velocity of the racing tracks is to be closely matched with the machine output characteristics. Within this paper, the design and no-load results will be presented. In the near future (Q 2 of 2015), following extended tests, this machine (integrated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> specifically designed single-stage gear) will be used to drive the vehicle using torque vectoring on all four-wheels. We expect that this will result in a significant performance gain in acceleration, endurance and handling characteristics of the 2015 University Racing Eindhoven race vehicle...|$|R
