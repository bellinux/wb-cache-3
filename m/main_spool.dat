5000|$|Since 2001, most {{work has}} focused on simpler methods of {{construction}} requiring much smaller space infrastructures. They conceive the launch of a long cable on a large spool, followed by deployment of it in space. [...] The spool would be initially parked in a geostationary orbit above the planned anchor point. A long cable would be dropped [...] "downward" [...] (toward Earth) and would be balanced by a mass being dropped [...] "upward" [...] (away from Earth) for the whole system {{to remain on the}} geosynchronous orbit. Earlier designs imagined the balancing mass to be another cable (with counterweight) extending upward, with the <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> remaining at the original geosynchronous orbit level. Most current designs elevate the spool itself as the main cable is paid out, a simpler process. When {{the lower end of the}} cable is long enough to reach the surface of the Earth (at the equator), it would be anchored. Once anchored, the center of mass would be elevated more (by adding mass at the upper end or by paying out more cable). This would add more tension to the whole cable, which could then be used as an elevator cable.|$|E

In the present paper, we consider the effect of fluid viscosity on steady flow forces for both positive and negative damping lengths. Using fundamental momentum and CFD analysis, it is shown that viscosity affects significantly the steady flow forces.

The main focus {{of this study is}} on revealing the dynamic properties of the priority control system for a developed high-speed on–off digital valve. In this article, a detailed introduction to the high-speed on–off digital valve and its priority control system is performed first, which includes the system function, structural composition, and operation principle. Thereafter, a simulation model of the priority control system is established using the AMESim software and the dynamic characteristics are simulated. Simulation results including the variations in the pulse-width modulation signal, coil current, and the <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> displacement of the directional valve are presented and discussed. They indicate that the opening time of the <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> increases with the duty ratio of the voltage signal. Moreover, the <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> displacement is basically equal in one single pulse-width modulation signal cycle, and thus, it is proportional to the cycle number of the pulse-width modulation signal.

40|$|Many control schemes, simple or sophisticated, utilize high {{performance}} electro-hydraulic components as an interface to mechanical hardware. Failure of an electro-hydraulic component in these applications may impact safety, maintenance schedules and/or {{productivity of the}} overall operation. A condition monitoring scheme that would measure the performance or health of critical electro-hydraulic components would be desirable in addressing the above mentioned concerns. A neural network approach in estimating on-line proportional solenoid valve parameters {{is the focus of}} this study. A neural network algorithm is well suited for this type of parameter estimation in that it is capable of learning and best fitting a solution to given data. It is also capable of handling inherent noise in sensor data and is simple enough to allow for non-complex processing. Some of the parameters that affect the performance of the main stage valve spool which may be used in a condition monitoring scheme include orifice area gradient, spring rates, spring pre-compressions and spool friction. This thesis considers the use of individual neuron structures to estimate each valve parameter. Each neuron trains to a specific valve parameter with its output being the estimated parameter's <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> force contribution. The individual neurons act and train independently; however, their outputs are integrated to compute the <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> differential pressure. This differential pressure calculation is compared to the measured value and the difference is used to train each neural structure.

40|$|A knuckle boom crane is {{characterized}} by being a versatile machine that during operation experiences large load variations caused by the changes in position and payload. Common uses are as a mobile loader crane mounted on trucks and in offshore applications. Since their introduction the use of counterbalance valves (CBV) have been the de facto standard on load-carrying hydraulically actuated applications like the knuckle boom crane. It offers a simple and practical solution {{to one of the}} issues of mobile cranes: Controlling the load safely when lowering. By law (e. g. European Standard) the hydraulic circuit of load-carrying applications is required to contain a load holding protection device. The classical way of actuating such a crane is to use a circuit containing a pressure compensator valve and a directional control valve (DCV) in series with a CBV. This circuit {{is referred to as the}} base circuit. It is well known that this combination of valve components tends to introduce instability in the base circuit. This is mainly a problem when the controlled actuator is subjected to a negative load, because this will require the CBV to throttle the return ﬂow. The instability presents itself as pressure oscillations in the hydraulic circuit which cause the mechanical structure to oscillate. The consequence of the oscillations is a decreased accuracy of the boom motion which create a safety risk, reduces productivity and introduces an undesirable extra fatigue load. The objective of this project was to investigate the oscillations created in the hydraulic circuit of knuckle boom cranes and reduce their severity. The effort has mainly been split in two: First, was looked into existing solutions with the focus on the ones not requiring control systems to function. This was done with reliability and robustness in mind. The investigation identiﬁed the pressure control valve (PCV) as the best commercially available solution. The use of a PCV to control the inlet ﬂow in crane applications was rather uncharted territory. The valve, a DCV with a pressure control spool manufactured by Danfoss, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A linear stability analysis has been performed with the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. This analysis of the valve used together with a hydraulically actuated experimental setup indicates that the combination is stable in all situations. The use of the pressure control spool in the DCV is a simple and robust solution to the stability problem of the base circuit. Not related to the PCV’s ability to reduce the oscillations the use of it in knuckle boom cranes, however, comes with certain drawbacks. The drawbacks include a load dependent dead band and a load dependent inlet ﬂow. In order to achieve similar behavior as the normal pressure compensated DCV a closed loop control system is required. These issues are addressed in this project, where control schemes are proposed to handle them. In the second part the perspective of the search was broadened to include solutions using control systems. This has lead to the development of a novel, patent pending, concept that signiﬁcantly reduces the oscillations of the base circuit. It introduces a secondary circuit where a low-pass ﬁltered value of the load pressure is generated and fed back to the compensator of the ﬂow supply valve. The work has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement of stability obtained for a system with the novel concept implemented both theoretically and experimentally. The stability has been investigated both using a linear and a nonlinear model of a hydraulically actuated experimental setup. The presented novel concept circuit has the same steady state characteristics as the base circuit but without the corresponding oscillatory nature. Because the <b>main</b> <b>spool</b> of the DCV is not used for stabilising the system, the novel concept can be combined with any feedback control strategy. In this project, the novel concept is presented with linear actuators only. However,its use covers circuits with rotational actuators and CBV’s as well. The base circuit is used as a reference for comparison. Therefore, the stability of the base circuit is also investigated with a linear model...|$|E
40|$|Servo valves {{are used}} in a broad variety of flow {{modulation}} applications. In the field of aerospace, servo valves {{are used in}} aero engines to meter fuel flow. The existing valves are labour intensive to manufacture and highly optimised such that to achieve improvements in performance requires a novel design. This research investigates smart material actuators and valve concepts. Specifically, a prototype pilot stage nozzle flapper valve is developed {{for the purpose of}} actuating a <b>main</b> stage <b>spool.</b> The typical nozzle flapper type servo valve uses a torque motor to actuate the flapper. In this research project, the torque motor has been substituted for two piezoelectric ring bender actuators. A novel mounting mechanism has been developed to secure the ring benders within the valve. Analytical and finite element models have been made to understand the displacement mechanism of a ring bender and the effects of the mount on the displacement and force from a ring bender, and the results were compared with experiment. The mounting stiffness at the inner and outer edges was found to decrease the displacement of the ring bender and {{it was found that the}} stiffness of the mount at the outer edge has a greater negative effect on displacement than the stiffness of the mount at the inner edge. The displacement of a ring bender was tested across the operational temperature range of an aero engine. It was found that the displacement of the ring bender is reduced at low temperatures and increases at high temperature. The variation of stiffness of the elastomeric mount was also tested with temperature and it was found that the displacement of a ring bender is significantly reduced when the mounting elastomer approaches its glass transition temperature. A prototype valve was built to test the pressures and flows that could be achieved at two control ports by using a ring bender as actuator. A single ring bender and two ring benders, mounted in tandem to provide redundancy, have been tested. An analytical model was developed and the predictions are compared with experimental results for pressures and flow. The full stroke of the valve was 300 m when mounted and reduced to 150 m when mounted in tandem with an inactive ring bender. The hysteresis of the valve is +/- 10 %. The pressures and flow at and between the control ports of the valve are consistent with the predictions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an Experimental/Analytical approach to modeling and calibrating shaking tables for structural dynamic applications. This approach was successfully {{applied to the}} shaking table recently built in the structural laboratory of the Civil Engineering Department at Rice University. This shaking table is capable of reproducing model earthquake ground motions with a peak acceleration of 6 g's, a peak velocity of 40 inches per second, and a peak displacement of 3 inches, for a maximum payload of 1500 pounds. It has a frequency bandwidth of approximately 70 Hz and is designed to test structural specimens up to 1 / 5 scale. The rail/table system is mounted on a reaction mass of about 70, 000 pounds consisting of three 12 ft x 12 ft x 1 ft reinforced concrete slabs, post-tensioned together and connected to the strong laboratory floor. The slip table is driven by a hydraulic actuator governed by a 407 MTS controller which employs a proportional-integral-derivative-feedforward-differential pressure algorithm to control the actuator displacement. Feedback signals are provided by two LVDT's (monitoring the slip table relative displacement and the servovalve <b>main</b> stage <b>spool</b> position) and by one differential pressure transducer (monitoring the actuator force). The dynamic actuator-foundation-specimen system is modeled and analyzed by combining linear control theory and linear structural dynamics. The analytical model developed accounts {{for the effects of}} actuator oil compressibility, oil leakage in the actuator, time delay in the response of the servovalve spool to a given electrical signal, foundation flexibility, and dynamic characteristics of multi-degree-of-freedom specimens. In order to study the actual dynamic behavior of the shaking table, the transfer function between target and actual table accelerations were identified using experimental results and spectral estimation techniques. The power spectral density of the system input and the cross power spectral density of the table input and output were estimated using the Bartlett's spectral estimation method. The experimentally-estimated table acceleration transfer functions obtained for different working conditions are correlated with their analytical counterparts. As a result of this comprehensive correlation study, a thorough understanding of the shaking table dynamics and its sensitivities to control and payload parameters is obtained. Moreover, the correlation study leads to a calibrated analytical model of the shaking table of high predictive ability. It is concluded that, in its present conditions, the Rice shaking table is able to reproduce, {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, model earthquake accelerations time histories in the frequency bandwidth from 0 to 75 Hz. Furthermore, the exhaustive analysis performed indicates that the table transfer function is not significantly affected by the presence of a large (in terms of weight) payload with a fundamental frequency up to 20 Hz. Payloads having a higher fundamental frequency do affect significantly the shaking table performance and require a modification of the table control gain setting that can be easily obtained using the predictive analytical model of the shaking table. The complete description of a structural dynamic experiment performed using the Rice shaking table facility is also reported herein. The object of this experimentation was twofold: (1) to verify the testing capability of the shaking table and, (2) to experimentally validate a simplified theory developed by the author, which predicts the maximum rotational response developed by seismic isolated building structures characterized by non-coincident centers of mass and rigidity, when subjected to strong earthquake ground motions...|$|R
