25|$|A {{common type}} of axial-leaded {{resistor}} today is the <b>metal-film</b> <b>resistor.</b> Metal Electrode Leadless Face (MELF) resistors often use the same technology, and are also cylindrically shaped but are designed for surface mounting. Note that other types of resistors (e.g., carbon composition) are also available in MELF packages.|$|E
40|$|Experimentally {{obtained}} {{and analyzed}} fine structure of statistical distributions for two physically independent processes: alpha-decay rate fluctuations of Pu- 239 sample in Pushchino (Moscow region, Russia) and equilibrium voltage fluctuations (Johnson noise) from <b>metal-film</b> <b>resistor</b> in Tbilisi (Georgia). Special investigation of histograms shape similarity in these processes demonstrated majority of previously studied effects, called - macroscopic fluctuations. Offered qualitative {{model of the}} observed effects. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
