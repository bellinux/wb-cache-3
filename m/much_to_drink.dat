25|$|Martha taunts George aggressively, and he retaliates {{with his}} usual passive aggression. Martha tells an {{embarrassing}} story about how she humiliated him with a sucker-punch {{in front of her}} father. During the telling, George appears with a gun and fires at Martha, but an umbrella pops out. After this scare, Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled and, {{at the end of the}} act, Honey runs to the bathroom to vomit, because she had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the inn, Pippin has too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> {{and begins}} to tell stories about Bilbo. Afraid that he will reveal too much, Frodo climbs on a table {{and begins to}} sing and dance to {{distract}} the crowd. However, he slips, and the Ring lands on his finger, turning him invisible. An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they are drawing {{too much attention to}} themselves. He introduces himself as Strider (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that Strider is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E
25|$|Watson {{then spent}} {{a very brief}} period selling sewing {{machines}} for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad {{more than a year}} to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E

5000|$|Compared to dehydration, {{hyponatremia}} is {{a relatively}} recently recognized danger, and there are different opinions about how <b>much</b> water <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> at each water stop. Some texts say that thirst is not a reliable indicator of the need in water, while other say that obligatory drinking at every opportunity without real need increases the danger of hyponatremia.

25|$|Completed in 1875, Old Main, a two-towered brick {{building}} {{designed in the}} Second Empire style, was the primary instructional and administrative building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its design {{was based on the}} plans for the main academic building at the University of Illinois, which has since been demolished. However, the clock and bell towers were switched at Arkansas. The northern taller tower is the bell tower, and the southern shorter tower is the clock tower. One legend for the tower switch is that the taller tower was put to the north as a reminder of the Union victory during the Civil War. A second legend is that the contractor accidentally swapped the tower drawings after having had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> Although the southern tower was designed with clock faces, it never held a working clock until October 2005. The bell tower has always had some type of chime, initially a bell that was rung on the hour by student volunteers. Electronic chimes were installed in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Monica Charles Brooks-Dent (played by Keesha Sharp) is William's wife. All {{four of the}} girlfriends (especially Lynn and Toni) {{hated her}} (Joan comes to see her {{vulnerable}} side and becomes her friend, and Toni moves to New York {{at the end of}} the sixth season). In the seventh season, they slowly and later fully accept Monica as their friend as Monica does the same. Although engaged to William, the two date twice before; they meet at a bar the first time. Since the last time William proposes to her in Monaco, he has occasionally had doubts about ever doing so. Eventually he marries her, but on their wedding day he has too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> and confesses that he has had and still has doubts about marrying her. Monica leaves William in Season 7 but returns shortly after the girlfriends go to Chicago to persuade her to get back together with William. On their visit, they discover that Monica, due to her father's dementia and her mother's power of attorney, has been cut off from her family fortune, so Joan offers Monica a job at the J-Spot. William is thrilled about Monica's return until she demands half of what he earned while they were married. They manage to slowly rebuild their relationship but constantly clash at the J-Spot. In the Season 7 finale, they get back together. By Season 8, Monica was pregnant and is seen spending more time with the other three girlfriends, particularly Joan.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink,</b> vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

60|$|In unison {{with this}} pursuit, a chaste {{simplicity}} obtains {{in the domestic}} habits of Arcadia. Its few scattered people dine early, live moderately, sup socially, and sleep soundly. It is rumoured that the Beadles of the Arcade, from being the mortal enemies of boys, have signed with tears an address to Lord Shaftesbury, and subscribed to a ragged school. No wonder! For, they might turn their heavy maces into crooks and tend sheep in the Arcade, to the purling of the water-carts as they give the thirsty streets <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> than they can carry.|$|R

500|$|Casting of {{the show}} {{included}} {{using some of the}} actors who had already appeared in the movie, including Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, a character similar to the one he had played in the movie, and Connie Britton as Tami Taylor, wife of coach Eric Taylor. Britton had felt that the female story lines were underplayed in the movie, but was promised by Berg that these topics would be given more attention in the television series. Kyle Chandler, playing the role of head coach Eric Taylor, said he had played some high school football, [...] "but I was no good". He recalled showing up to an early meeting with Berg after a friend's party where he [...] "had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink,</b> smoked too many cigarettes" [...] and was generally quite tired. Berg liked that look, since he wanted the coach to appear old and weary. [...] "You need to drink a lot of scotch and smoke a lot of cigarettes," [...] he advised.|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> and made a very bad decision. [...] If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My {{heart goes out to}} him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jean Rochette's lawyer implicitly {{accepted}} {{that his client}} was a murderer, pleading that Rochette was {{not responsible for the}} murders because he had been unable to break free of the influence of his masters. This plea contributed to the fate of the accused. Some historians think that the culpability of the Martins in the [...] "assassination" [...] of Enjolras is far from being proven, arguing that the latter simply {{died of a heart attack}} after having too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink,</b> and that this would explain why Marie Martin tried to make him drink herbal tea. The summing-up of the president of the court was effectively a second closing speech for the prosecution; the argument of the defence, that Chaze was a drunken down-and-out whose testimony was implausible, was ignored.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose that in {{a sample}} of 100 men, 90 drank wine in the {{previous}} week, while {{in a sample of}} 100 women only 20 drank wine in the same period. The odds of a man drinking wine are 90 to 10, or 9:1, while the odds of a woman drinking wine are only 20 to 80, or 1:4 = 0.25:1. The odds ratio is thus 9/0.25, or 36, showing that men are <b>much</b> more likely <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> wine than women. The detailed calculation is: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} Inkspot strolled about the wharves of Valparaiso, in {{company with the}} two sailors, who never lost sight of him, and he had rather a {{pleasant}} time, for they gave him as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> eat and <b>drink</b> as was good for him, and made him understand {{as well as they}} could {{that it would not be}} long before they would help him to return to the brig Miranda commanded by Captain Horn.|$|R

I will force you neither to eat nor <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> more than it pleases you, and you shall give me as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> eat and <b>drink</b> as it pleases me, then we shall be both well satisfied.

2500|$|May later blamed {{her actions}} on fatigue and insisted she hadn't had too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> [...] "I didn't {{have a lot}} of wine," [...] May said, [...] "but it may have hit me harder than I thought it would". When {{questioned}} if she should resign, May responded that [...] "a lot of people have given bad press gallery speeches and have gone on to be Prime Minister or gone on to lead other aspects of their lives, time will tell." [...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy. However, she said they shouldn't detract from her political track record. [...] President of the Treasury Board Tony Clement and NDP House Leader Peter Julian said Monday afternoon that May's apology was sufficient. [...] "Look, she's apologized which was appropriate and I'm going to leave the matter at that," [...] Clement told reporters. Laura Peck, senior partner at TransformLeaders.ca, said, [...] "She has apologized. She's done the right thing, she's apologized," [...] Peck said. [...] "One mistake is forgivable, two is a pattern." [...] It's more of an [...] "inside Ottawa beltway" [...] thing anyway, Peck added.|$|E

50|$|On 8 October, the {{municipal}} council was {{complaining about the}} policeman. He was apparently <b>much</b> given <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> and had already been negligent in doing his duty for years. Also, some nighttime disturbances of the peace were not coming to his attention as he did his nightly rounds. Furthermore {{he had failed to}} appoint other citizens each evening in addition to the serving security watches for the nighttime criminality that was getting out of hand. The policeman was to be dismissed, the more so as he had thrown his sabre and duty book into the mayor’s livingroom. Five persons sought the fired policeman’s job. The wages amounted to 40 guilders. The policeman also had to act as a court official and a field marksman for the nearby surrounding area. The municipality had to borrow capital amounting to 1,500 guilders to be able to indemnify those from Schornsheim who had gone to war in France.|$|R
50|$|Author John Dykstra, {{who writes}} under the pen name of Rick Hardin, has had too <b>much</b> beer <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> at his mystery writer's group meeting and desperately {{needs to find}} a rest stop on his return from Jacksonville to Sarasota. There is only one other car at the rest stop and he hears its {{occupants}} in the ladies' bathroom. It is a woman's and a man's voice he hears coming from the bathroom and clearly the sounds of domestic abuse. John Dykstra is too timid and frightened to act, yet he assumes the mentality of his alter-ego, Hardin, and attacks the man with a tire iron. Calling the police and ordering the woman to leave {{the scene in the}} car, <b>much</b> <b>to</b> her protest, Hardin smashes the man's glasses to ensure he doesn't follow him on the road in retaliation. After some time, Hardin mentally reverts to Dykstra, who begins to vomit out the side of his vehicle when the adrenaline rush of the incident wears off. He stops at a gas station and thoroughly searches to make sure the man has not followed him. Upon returning home, Dykstra locks his doors and activates his burglar alarm system.|$|R

6000|$|It {{have come}} to the {{knowledge}} of the Prophet that his [...] "Notes" [...] are not quite so much read as they once was, partly owing, no doubt, to the book being not so much an [...] "edition de looks" [...] as rather a low- lived lot, to a casual eye, at fourpence; the picture outside representing Nicholas rather as having had too <b>much</b> for <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> than as a prominent member of the Blue Ribbon Society, which it did not exist in his period, nor would it have enjoyed, to any considerable extent, my personal or pecuniary support, he having something else to do with his money. (Printer, please put in a full stop somewhere here, Nicholas being a little out of the habit of writing for the periodical press.) He have also heard that it is proposed in literary circles to start a [...] "Nicholas Society" [...] for the purpose of printing a limited edition of my works including my lost treatise of Knur and Spell, on Japanese paper, illustrated with photo-gravelures; they having come in since the Prophet's period, though perhaps a little gay.|$|R
500|$|Another {{traditional}} assumption, {{based on}} {{the language of the}} inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a buffet beside it. The buffet of the period was more like a modern Welsh dresser or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use. [...] Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> from on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day, while Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is <b>much</b> too heavy <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> from conveniently. [...] However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start. It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the Saint Chapelle at his capital of Bourges, intended to rival the king's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and his brother's foundation at Champmol in Dijon.|$|R
6000|$|Never, {{in all my}} folly and excesses, did I {{give myself}} so <b>much</b> up <b>to</b> <b>drink,</b> as when I reached Philadelphia this time.

We turned out, accordingly, to the number if a hundred, or more, in blue jackets and white trowsers, and marched up to the hospital in a body. I was one of the leaders in this arrangement, and felt much interest in it, as Jack had been my messmate; but, the instant I saw his coffin, a fit of the [...] "horrors" [...] came over me, and I actually left the place, running down street towards the river, as if pursued by devils. Luckily, I stopped to rest on the stoop of a druggist. The worthy man took me in, gave me some soda water, and some good advice. When a little strengthened, I made my way home, but gave up at the door. Then followed a severe indisposition, which kept me in bed for a fortnight, during which I suffered the torments of the damned.|$|R
