25|$|Opposing {{the tidal}} {{deceleration}} of Earth is a mechanism {{that is in}} fact accelerating the rotation. Earth is not a sphere, but rather an ellipsoid that is flattened at the poles. SLR has shown that this flattening is decreasing. The explanation is that during the ice age large masses of ice collected at the poles, and depressed the underlying rocks. The ice mass started disappearing over 10000 years ago, but Earth's crust is still not in hydrostatic equilibrium and is still rebounding (the relaxation time {{is estimated to be}} about 4000 years). As a consequence, the polar diameter of Earth increases, and the equatorial diameter decreases (Earth's volume must remain the same). This means that mass <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the rotation axis of Earth, and that Earth's moment of inertia decreases. This process alone leads to an increase of the rotation rate (phenomenon of a spinning figure skater who spins ever faster as they retract their arms). From the observed change in the moment of inertia the acceleration of rotation can be computed: the average value over the historical period must have been about −0.6 ms/century. This largely explains the historical observations.|$|E

During the Derelict investigation, he <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> an egg to get {{a better}} look; a facehugger attaches to him and, unbeknownst to him and the crew, impregnates him with an Alien embryo. Kane remains unconscious until the facehugger dies and falls off. At dinner afterwards, Kane goes into convulsions; an infant Alien bursts through his chest, killing him. His body was later jettisoned into space as a funeral by the crew.|$|E

500|$|Kurosawa's {{style is}} marked by a number of devices and {{techniques}} which Kurosawa introduced in his films over the decades. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the [...] "axial cut", in which the camera <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to,</b> or further away from, the subject, not through the use of tracking shots or dissolves, but through a series of matched jump cuts. Another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is Kurosawa's tendency to [...] "cut on motion": that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot.|$|E
500|$|During {{the verses}} the band {{maintains}} the same chord progression as the chorus. Cobain plays a two-note guitar line over Novoselic's root-note eighth note bassline, which outlines the chord progression. As the song <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the choruses, Cobain begins {{to play the}} same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the word [...] "Hello". Following {{the first and second}} choruses, Cobain simultaneously sings the word [...] "Yay" [...] and performs a unison bend on his guitar. After the second chorus, Cobain plays a 16-bar guitar solo that almost completely restates his vocal melody from the verse and pre-chorus. During the closing refrain, Cobain sings [...] "A denial" [...] repeatedly; his voice becomes strained and is almost shot from the force of yelling.|$|E

NY31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of Verona. Northeast of Oneida, NY31 intersects NY46 adjacent to the path of the old routing of the Erie Canal. Farther east, NY31 intersects NY365 just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The Turning Stone Resort & Casino, located [...] south of the intersection, is accessible via NY365.|$|E

2500|$|An off-center {{stamping}} {{will apply}} a slow 0.56Hz modulation to the playback, affecting pitch {{due to the}} modulating speed that the groove runs under the stylus. The effect becomes gradually more acute during playback as the stylus <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> {{the center of the}} record. It also affects tonality because the stylus is pressed alternately against one groove wall and then the other, making the frequency response change in each channel. This problem is often called [...] "wow", though turntable and motor problems can also cause pitch-only [...] "wow".|$|E

2500|$|NY89, meanwhile, {{continues}} northward into Romulus, {{where it}} gradually <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the western lake shore as it descends {{back into the}} lake valley. It reaches the shoreline near the hamlet of Elm Beach, from where the route continues along Cayuga Lake for [...] into the town of Varick. Along the way, NY89 serves dozens of lakeside homes and several small communities, including East Varick. The 7-mile stretch ends at the Fayette town line, where the route leaves the lake to take a slightly more inland routing through the town. As a result, the lakeside homes give way to farmland once again, and the rolling terrain follows NY89 northward into the town of Seneca Falls.|$|E
2500|$|... "Country of Cherry Blossoms" [...] is a {{story in}} two parts. Part one is set in 1987 in Tokyo. At the start of fifth grade, Nanami Ishikawa, the {{daughter}} of Minami's brother Asahi (and thus second-generation atomic bomb victim), is a tomboy nicknamed [...] "Goemon" [...] by her classmates, to her disgust. At baseball practice, she gets a bloody nose after {{being hit by a}} ball, after which she skips practice to visit her brother Nagio in the hospital, where he is being treated for asthma. On the way, she meets her best friend and next-door neighbor, a feminine girl named Toko Tone, who loans her subway fare and accompanies her. In Nagio's hospital room, they toss cherry blossom petals that Nanami collected into the air, to give him the experience of spring that he's missing. Nanami is scolded by her grandmother for visiting Nagio when she's not supposed to. That summer, her grandmother, Asahi's mother, Fujimi, dies, and that fall Nanami loses touch with Toko after her family <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Nagio's hospital.|$|E
2500|$|E. J. Lowe, of Durham University, {{denies that}} holding to {{indirect}} realism (in {{which we have}} access only to sensory features internal to the brain) necessarily implies a Cartesian dualism. He agrees with Bertrand Russell that our [...] "retinal images"—that is, the distributions across our retinas—are connected to [...] "patterns of neural activity in the cortex" [...] (Lowe 1986). He defends {{a version of the}} Causal Theory of Perception in which a causal path can be traced between the external object and the perception of it. He is careful to deny that we do any inferring from the sensory field, a view which he believes allows us to found an access to knowledge on that causal connection. In a later work he <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the non-epistemic theory in that he postulates [...] "a wholly non-conceptual component of perceptual experience", but he refrains from analyzing the relation between the perceptual and the [...] "non-conceptual". Most recently he has drawn attention to the problems that hallucination raises for the direct realist and to their disinclination to enter the discussion on the topic.|$|E

2500|$|For flow in a pipe of {{diameter}} , experimental observations {{show that}} for [...] "fully developed" [...] flow, laminar flow occurs when [...] < 2300 and turbulent flow occurs when [...] > 2600. At {{the lower end}} of this range, a continuous turbulent-flow will form, but only at a very long distance from the inlet of the pipe. The flow in between will begin to transition from laminar to turbulent and then back to laminar at irregular intervals, called intermittent flow. This is due to the different speeds and conditions of the fluid in different areas of the pipe's cross-section, depending on other factors such as pipe roughness and flow uniformity. Laminar flow tends to dominate in the fast-moving center of the pipe while slower-moving turbulent flow dominates near the wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the continuous turbulent-flow <b>moves</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the inlet and the intermittency in between increases, until the flow becomes fully turbulent at [...] > 2600. This result is generalized to non-circular channels using the hydraulic diameter, allowing a transition Reynolds number to be calculated for other shapes of channel.|$|E
