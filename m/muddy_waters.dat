5|$|Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became {{childhood}} {{friends and}} classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent, before the Jagger {{family moved to}} Wilmington, five miles (8.05km) away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters,</b> Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again in 1960 on Dartford railway station, and the Chuck Berry and <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> records that Jagger was carrying revealed a common interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.|$|E

5|$|Folk Singer is {{the fourth}} studio album by <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters,</b> {{released}} in April 1964 by Chess Records. The album features Waters on acoustic guitar, backed by Willie Dixon on string bass, Clifton James on drums, and Buddy Guy on acoustic guitar. It is Waters's only all-acoustic album. Numerous reissues of Folk Singer include bonus tracks from two subsequent sessions, in April 1964 and October 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} depicts <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> at the Newport Jazz Festival holding a semi-acoustic guitar. When the photographer, Burt Goldblatt, {{asked him to}} pose for the cover, Waters left his Fender Telecaster (which he played during the concert) {{on the stage and}} instead held the semi-acoustic guitar, {{belonging}} to his friend John Lee Hooker.|$|E
5|$|At Newport 1960 is a live album by <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> {{performed}} at Newport Jazz Festival in Newport, Rhode Island, with his backing band, consisting of Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Pat Hare (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and Francis Clay (drums), on July 3. Waters's performances across Europe in the 1950s and at Newport helped popularize blues {{to a broader}} audience, especially to whites. The album {{is said to be}} one of the first live blues albums.|$|E

5|$|Paul Vaughn Butterfield (December 17, 1942May 4, 1987) was an American blues {{harmonica}} {{player and}} singer. After early {{training as a}} classical flautist, he developed an interest in blues harmonica. He explored the blues scene in his native Chicago, where he met <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> and other blues greats, who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions. He soon began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts Nick Gravenites and Elvin Bishop.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} {{his debut}} album The Best of <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> (1958), a greatest hits collection, and Sings Big Bill Broonzy (1960), {{a collection of}} covers of songs by the blues musician Big Bill Broonzy, Waters performed at the Newport Jazz Festival. Waters had already been a well-known blues musician across Europe and the United States in the '50s. His successful performances with his electric blues band, consisting of his half-brother Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Pat Hare (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and Francis Clay (drums), increasingly popularized the blues in mainstream music in the United States and Europe, especially among white audiences.|$|E
5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes, attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers, such as <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> and Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.|$|E

5|$|Led Zeppelin's {{music was}} rooted in the blues. The {{influence}} of American blues artists such as <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin' Wolf. Tracks were structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by {{the music of the}} British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew {{on a wide variety of}} genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on Houses of the Holy and the albums that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{movement}} were in the British jazz, skiffle and folk movements of the 1950s. The 1958 visit of <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> influenced key figures Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner to turn to electric blues and form the band Blues Incorporated, which became something of a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians. A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included the Rolling Stones, Manfred Mann, The Animals, The Yardbirds, Them, and the Spencer Davis Group, who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, {{in the wake of}} the Merseybeat craze, becoming central to the mod subculture in the UK and a second wave of British Invasion acts in the US.|$|E
5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation of rhythm and blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm and blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E

5|$|From 1962 {{demand for}} blues {{recordings}} in Britain and Europe led to new outlets for American recordings, Chicago recordings that were now available included Vee Jay Records through EMI's Stateside label and Chess Records through Pye International's R series. These records were enthusiastically sought and collected {{by a new}} generation of enthusiasts. The increasing appetite for rhythm and blues was reflected in the growing numbers of Afro-American artists visiting the country. From 1962 the American Folk Blues Festival, organised by German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau, brought American blues stars including Waters, Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, and John Lee Hooker to the country. In 1964 the American Folk Blues and Gospel Caravan arrived in the UK for an 11-date tour, including in its line-up Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Blind Gary Davis, Sonny Terry, <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> and Otis Spann. The original dates sold out rapidly and six more had to be added. Later that year, the first of what was to become the annual National Jazz and Blues Festival was held at Reading in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Blues harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse {{public house}} in London’s Soho, {{which served as}} {{a focal point for}} British skiffle acts. Like guitarist Alexis Korner, he had worked for Chris Barber, playing in the R segment Barber {{introduced}} to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists. They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was blues, they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances. The visit of <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R in general. Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified electric blues, but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews. Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chicago {{experienced}} {{two major}} race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and angst, more riots followed {{in subsequent years}} and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued and reflect on ideas of the black experience in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes and personalities, each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 × 14 foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters,</b> Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour {{towards the end of}} the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Blues {{became a}} part of American popular music in the 1920s, when classic female blues singers like Bessie Smith grew popular. At the same time, record {{companies}} launched the field of race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences. The most famous of these acts went on to inspire much of the later popular development of the blues and blues-derived genres, including the legendary delta blues musician Robert Johnson and Piedmont blues musician Blind Willie McTell. By the end of the 1940s, however, pure blues was only a minor part of popular music, having been subsumed by offshoots like rhythm & blues and the nascent rock and roll style. Some styles of electric, piano-driven blues, like boogie-woogie, retained a large audience. A bluesy style of gospel also became popular in mainstream America in the 1950s, led by singer Mahalia Jackson. The blues genre experienced major revivals in the 1950s with Chicago blues musicians such as <b>Muddy</b> <b>Waters</b> and Little Walter, {{as well as in the}} 1960s in the British Invasion and American folk music revival when country blues musicians like Mississippi John Hurt and Reverend Gary Davis were rediscovered. The seminal blues musicians of these periods had tremendous influence on rock musicians such as Chuck Berry in the 1950s, as well as on the British blues and blues rock scenes of the 1960s and 1970s, including Eric Clapton in Britain and Johnny Winter in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{including}} {{trees are}} important in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may {{be more or less}} magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the <b>muddy</b> <b>waters</b> of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E
