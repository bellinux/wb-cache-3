25|$|During {{erythrocyte}} invasion, merozoites release <b>merozoite</b> cap protein-1 (MCP1), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), erythrocyte-binding antigens (EBA), myosin A {{tail domain}} interacting protein (MTIP), and <b>merozoite</b> surface proteins (MSPs). Of these MSPs, MSP1 and MSP2 are {{primarily responsible for}} avoiding immune cells. The virulence of P. falciparum is mediated by erythrocyte membrane proteins, which are produced by the schizonts and trophozoites inside the erythrocytes and are displayed on the erythrocyte membrane. PfEMP1 is the most important, capable of acting as both an antigen and an adhesion molecule.|$|E
25|$|At the schizont stage, the {{parasite}} replicates its DNA multiple times and multiple mitotic divisions occur asynchronously. Each schizont forms 16-18 merozoites. The {{red blood cells}} are ruptured by the merozoites. The liberated merozoites invade fresh erythrocytes. A free <b>merozoite</b> is in the bloodstream for roughly 60 seconds before it enters another erythrocyte.|$|E
25|$|Prime-boost {{strategies}} {{have been successful}} in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone. This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus. An effective prime-boost strategy for the simian malarial model P. knowlesi has also been demonstrated. Rhesus monkeys were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical <b>merozoite</b> surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and <b>merozoite</b> surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to P. falciparum in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.|$|E

25|$|This {{concept was}} applied in topical {{administration}} of pDNA encoding IL-10. Plasmid encoding B7-1 (a ligand on APCs) successfully enhanced the immune response in tumour models. Mixing plasmids encoding GM-CSF and the circumsporozoite protein of P. yoelii (PyCSP) enhanced protection against subsequent challenge (whereas plasmid-encoded PyCSP alone did not). It was proposed that GM-CSF caused dendritic cells to present antigen more efficiently and enhance IL-2 production and TH cell activation, thus driving the increased immune response. This {{can be further}} enhanced by first priming with a pPyCSP and pGM-CSF mixture, followed by boosting with a recombinant poxvirus expressing PyCSP. However, co-injection of plasmids encoding GM-CSF (or IFN-γ, or IL-2) and a fusion protein of P. chabaudi <b>merozoite</b> surface protein 1 (C-terminus)-hepatitis B virus surface protein (PcMSP1-HBs) abolished protection against challenge, compared to protection acquired by delivery of pPcMSP1-HBs alone.|$|E
25|$|P. falciparum {{does not}} have a fixed {{structure}} but undergoes continuous change during the course of its life cycle. A sporozoite is spindle-shaped and 10-15 μm long. In the liver it grows into an ovoid schizont of 30-70 μm in diameter. Each schizont produces merozoites, each of which is roughly 1.5 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. In the erythrocyte the <b>merozoite</b> form a ring-like structure, becoming a trophozoite. A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called haemozoin. Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8-12 μm long and 3-6 μm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18-24 μm. An oocyst is rounded and can grow up to 80 μm in diameter. Microscopic examination of a blood film reveals only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes that are in the peripheral blood. Mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears, as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. On occasion, faint, comma-shaped, red dots are seen on the erythrocyte surface. These dots are Maurer's cleft and are secretory organelles that produce proteins and enzymes essential for nutrient uptake and immune evasion processes.|$|E

50|$|Blocking {{antibodies}} have {{a variety}} of functions on the <b>merozoite</b> form of parasitic malaria. While in the <b>merozoite</b> form, malaria parasites invade erythrocytes and reproduce in them. Some blocking antibodies may inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes, while other blocking antibodies prevent the binding of inhibitory antibodies, allowing <b>merozoite</b> invasion of erythrocytes despite the presence of inhibitory antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies that prevent the invasion of merozoites bind to the parasitic antigen MSP-1 (<b>merozoite</b> surface protein 1). The binding of blocking antibodies to MSP-1 is shown to result in the inhibition of secondary processing, resulting in the inability for merozoites to invade host erythrocytes. Secondary processing involves a single proteolytic cleavage on the <b>merozoite</b> surface of the carboxy-terminal component of MSP-1. The blocking of MSP-1 has been proposed to be a method of creating a vaccine against malaria by preventing its invasion and multiplication.|$|E

The taxonomic position of this unusual coccidian stage is discussed. KEY WORDS: Coccidia. meront. giant meront (figs. 1 - 5) containing thousands of <b>merozoites</b> {{has been found in}} the intestinal epithelium of one out of nine white breams (Blicca bjoerkna) from Černovický brook in Soběslav, South Bohemia. The tissue samples of the fish caught in March and April 1989 and 1990, respectively, were processed for histological and electron microscopical examination as described elsewhere (Lukeš, 1992). The meront was located between the epithelial cells close to the lamina propria and contained mature <b>merozoites</b> (fig. 1). There was no cyst wall around the parasite and also no reaction of the host tissue has been observed in semithin sect ions. The dimensions of the meront were about 50 x 55 x 40 µm. Considering that about 200 <b>merozoites</b> were present in the cross sections, the total number in this meront can be estimated to be more than 2500 <b>merozoites.</b> The transmission electron microscopical examination revealed <b>merozoites</b> in the same phase of development (fig. 5). The ectomerogonial origin of <b>merozoites</b> could have been traced in regions where remnants of the residual cytoplasm were preserved (fig. 4). <b>Merozoites</b> were enclosed by a single unit membrane and any additional enclosing membranes or septae were not observed. In fixed material dimensions of the <b>merozoites</b> were 8. 2 - 9. 0 µm x 1. 8 - 2. 5 µm. The cross section of the <b>merozoites</b> revealed the presence of 22 subpellicular microtubules (fig. 2).

Sera from five Gambian adults who were highly immune to P. falciparum were used as a reagent to study the cross-reactivity between P. falciparum schizonts and surface proteins on P. knowlesi <b>merozoites.</b> Although the sera bound to the surface of viable, intact P. knowlesi <b>merozoites,</b> the sera did not block invasion of rhesus erythrocytes. 125 I-lactoperoxidase-labeled surface proteins on <b>merozoites</b> formed complexes with the antibody.

Because Gambians have never been exposed to P. knowlesi malaria, the antibodies that reacted with P. knowlesi <b>merozoites</b> must be directed against antigens of another parasite such as P. falciparum.
