5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E

'In {{many cases}} I have {{deliberately}} employed alliteration, {{believing that the}} music of a line is intensified thereby,' says <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> {{in the preface to}} his poems, and there is certainly no reason why <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> should not employ this 'artful aid.' Alliteration {{is one of the many}} secrets of English poetry, and as long as it is kept a secret it is admirable. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly,</b> it must be admitted, uses it with becoming modesty and reserve and never suffers it to trammel the white feet of his bright and buoyant muse. His volume is, in many ways, extremely interesting. Most minor poets are at their best in sonnets, but with him it is not so. His sonnets are too narrative, too diffuse, and too lyrical. They lack concentration, and concentration is the very essence of a sonnet. His longer poems, on the other hand, have many good qualities. We do not care for Psychossolles, which is elaborately commonplace, but The Flight of Calliope has many charming passages. It is a pity that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> has included the poems written before the age of nineteen. Youth is rarely original.|$|E

6000|$|The {{complex of}} coincidences, however, {{could not be}} {{attributed}} to chance selection out of the whole possible field of conjecture. We must remember, too, that a series of such hits increases, at an enormous rate, the odds against accidental conjecture. Of such mere luck I may give an example. I was writing a story of which the hero was George Kelly, one of the 'Seven Men of Moidart.' A year after composing my tale, I found the Government description of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> (1736). It exactly tallied with my purely fanciful sketch, down to eyes, and teeth, and face, except that I made my hero 'about six feet,' whereas the Government gave him five feet ten. But I knew beforehand that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> was a clergyman; his curious career proved {{him to be a}} person of great activity and geniality--and he was of Irish birth. Even a dozen such guesses, equally correct, could not suggest any powers of 'vision,' when so much was known beforehand about the person guessed at. I now give cases in the experience of Miss Angus, as one may call the crystal-gazer. The first occurred the day after she got the glass ball for the first time. She writes: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Henderson has {{recorded}} that, about Leeds, the flight {{is supposed to}} be that of 'the souls of unbaptized children doomed to flit restlessly above their parents' abode.' In Germany, certainly the Wild Hunt or Furious Host is accompanied by unbaptized children, and it has been recorded that a woman, about the year 1800, died of grief upon learning that the Furious Host had passed over the village where her still-born child had died just before. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> (Indo-European Tradition) very ably and poetically resolves all the various superstitions of this Wild Hunt into figurative descriptions of natural phenomena, but Mr. Yarrell, the distinguished naturalist, reduces the cries of the Gabriel Hounds into the whistling of the Bean Goose, Anser Segetum, as the flocks are flying southward in the night, migrating from Scandinavia.|$|E
60|$|Witchen or quicken, old English {{names of}} the rowan or {{mountain}} ash. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly</b> (Indo-European Tradition and Folklore) accounts for {{the reputation of the}} 'wiggin' by connecting it with the Indian Palasa, the tree that, according to the Vedas, sprang from the feather which, together with a claw, fell from the falcon bringing the heavenly soma to earth. The same writer also compares it with the Mimosa, and quotes a singular passage from Bishop Heber, to the effect that the natives of Upper India are in the habit of wearing sprigs of it in their turbans, and of suspending pieces of it over their beds, as security against wizards, spells, the Evil Eye, etc. Naturally enough the Bishop expresses his surprise at finding the superstitions, which in England and Scotland attach to the rowan, applied in India to a tree of similar form, and he asks, 'From what common centre are these common notions derived?' The Mimosa is popularly supposed to have sprung from the claw alluded to above.|$|E

60|$|Yesterday {{morning we}} set out from Glenluce, going some {{distance}} round to see some rivers: they were scarcely worth the while. We went on to Stranraer, in a burning sun, and had gone about six miles when the Mail overtook us: we got up, were at Port Patrick in a jiffey, and I am writing now in little Ireland. The dialects on the neighbouring shores of Scotland and Ireland are much the same, yet I can perceive a great difference in the nations, from the chamber-maid at this nate toone kept by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kelly.</b> She is fair, kind, and ready to laugh, because she {{is out of the}} horrible dominion of the Scotch Kirk. A Scotch girl stands in terrible awe of the Elders--poor little Susannahs, they will scarcely laugh, and their Kirk is greatly to be damned. These Kirk-men have done Scotland good (Query?). They have made men, women; old men, young men; old women, young women; boys, girls; and all infants careful--so that they are formed into regular Phalanges of savers and gainers. Such a thrifty army cannot fail to enrich their Country, and give it a greater appearance of Comfort, than that of their poor rash neighbourhood--these Kirk-men have done Scotland harm; they have banished puns, and laughing, and kissing, etc. (except in cases where the very danger and crime must make it very gustful). I shall make a full stop at kissing, for after {{that there should be a}} better parenthesis, and go on to remind you of the fate of Burns--poor unfortunate fellow, his disposition was Southern--how sad it is when a luxurious imagination is obliged, in self-defence, to deaden its delicacy in vulgarity, and rot[72] in things attainable, that it may not have leisure to go mad after things which are not. No man, in such matters, will be content with the experience of others--It is true that out of suffering there is no dignity, no greatness, that in the most abstracted pleasure there is no lasting happiness--Yet who would not like to discover over again that Cleopatra was a Gipsy, Helen a rogue, and Ruth a deep one? I have not sufficient reasoning faculty to settle the doctrine of thrift, as it is consistent with the dignity of human Society--with the happiness of Cottagers. All I can do is by plump contrasts; were the fingers made to squeeze a guinea or a white hand?--were the lips made to hold a pen or a kiss? and yet in Cities man is shut out from his fellows if he is poor--the cottager must be very dirty, and very wretched, if she be not thrifty--the present state of society demands this, and this convinces me that the world is very young, and in a very ignorant state--We live in a barbarous age--I would sooner be a wild deer, than a girl under the dominion of the Kirk; and I would sooner be a wild hog, than be the occasion of a poor Creature's penance before those execrable elders.|$|E
