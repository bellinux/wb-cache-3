50|$|A topos {{as defined}} above can be {{understood}} as a Cartesian closed category for which the notion of subobject of an object has an elementary or first-order definition. This notion, as a natural categorical abstraction of the notions of subset of a set, subgroup of a group, and more generally subalgebra of any algebraic structure, predates the notion of topos. It is definable in any category, not just topoi, in second-order language, i.e. in terms of classes of morphisms instead of individual morphisms, as follows. Given two <b>monics</b> m, n from respectively Y and Z to X, we say that m ≤ n when there exists a morphism p: Y → Z for which np = m, inducing a preorder on <b>monics</b> to X. When m ≤ n and n ≤ m we say that m and n are equivalent. The subobjects of X are the resulting equivalence classes of the <b>monics</b> to it.|$|R
50|$|All {{this applies}} to any topos, {{whether or not}} {{concrete}}. In the concrete case, namely C(1,-) faithful, for example the category of sets, the situation reduces to the familiar behavior of functions. Here the <b>monics</b> m: X′ &rarr; X are exactly the injections (one-one functions) from X′ to X, and those with a given image { mx | x ∈ X′ } constitute the subobject of X corresponding to the morphism f: X → Ω for which f&minus;1(t) is that image. The <b>monics</b> of a subobject will in general have many domains, all of which however will be in bijection with each other.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies colimits of {{sequences}} of finite Chu spaces and their ramifications. Besides generic Chu spaces, we consider extensional and biextensional variants. In the corresponding categories we first characterize the <b>monics</b> {{and then the}} existence (or the lack thereof) of the desired colimits. In each case, we provide a characterization of the finite objects in terms of monomorphisms/injections. Bifinite Chu spaces are then expressed {{with respect to the}} <b>monics</b> of generic Chu spaces, and universal, homogeneous Chu spaces are shown to exist in this category. Unanticipated results driving this development include the fact that while for generic Chu spaces <b>monics</b> consist of an injective first and a surjective second component, in the extensional and biextensional cases the surjectivity requirement can be dropped. Furthermore, the desired colimits are only guaranteed to exist in the extensional case. Finally, not all finite Chu spaces (considered set-theoretically) are finite objects in their categories. This study opens up opportunities for further investigations into recursively defined Chu spaces, as well as constructive models of linear logic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGiven a {{category}} with a stable system of <b>monics,</b> one can form the corresponding category of partial maps. To each map {{in this category}} there is, on {{the domain of the}} map, an associated idempotent, which measures the degree of partiality. This structure is captured abstractly by the notion of a restriction category, in which every arrow is required to have such an associated idempotent. Categories with a stable system of <b>monics,</b> functors preserving this structure, and natural transformations which are cartesian with respect to the chosen <b>monics,</b> form a 2 -category which we call MCat. The construction of categories of partial maps provides a 2 -functor Par:MCat→Cat. We show that Par can be made into an equivalence of 2 -categories between MCat and a 2 -category of restriction categories. The underlying ordinary functor Par 0 :MCat 0 →Cat 0 of the above 2 -functor Par turns out to be monadic, and, from this, we deduce the completeness and cocompleteness of the 2 -categories of M-categories and of restriction categories. We also consider {{the problem of how to}} turn a formal system of subobjects into an actual system of subobjects. A formal system of subobjects is given by a functor into the category sLat of semilattices. This structure gives rise to a restriction category which, via the above equivalence of 2 -categories, gives an M-category. This M-category contains the universal realization of the given formal subobjects as actual subobjects...|$|R

25|$|Symmetric polynomials arise {{naturally}} {{in the study}} of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a <b>monic</b> polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.|$|E

The notion of equivalence relation on a class of morphisms is itself intrinsically second-order, which the definition of topos neatly sidesteps by explicitly defining only the notion of subobject classifier Ω, leaving the notion of subobject of X as an implicit consequence characterized (and hence namable) by its associated morphism f: X &rarr; Ω.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the proper definition of embeddings in purely category-theoretical terms. It {{is argued that}} plain category theory cannot capture what, in the general case, constitutes an embedding of one structure in another. We discuss three available solutions to this problem: variants of <b>monics,</b> concrete categories, and allegories. The first and last of these {{are found to be}} unable to solve the problem, and the second to be philosophically unsatisfactory. Instead, we introduce a theory of forms and relators, which, like allegory theory, attempts to abstract from relation algebras in the way that categories abstract from monoids, but which does not have the shortcomings we have identified in allegories. We show that the theory in question does indeed solve the problem of defining embeddings...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{harmonic generation}} by atoms exposed to an intense laser pulse {{of a few}} femtoseconds. Our results, obtained by solving numerically the corresponding 3 -dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation, demonstrate that the harmonic spectra are extremely sensitive to the phase of the laser field. Depend- ing on this phase, the harmonics in the cutoff are resolved or not resolved. The position of the cutoff itself varies with the phase and the so-called “plateau” region exhibits two well-distinct parts: a series of well-defined har- <b>monics</b> followed in the high-frequency region {{by a series of}} broad peaks which are not separated any more by twice the laser field frequency. These results are explained in terms of both quantum and classical dynamics. We also show that this phase sensitivity may be exploited in order to probe the phase of the electric field of an ultrashort laser pulse in a single shot experiment. Our discussion about this new method of diagnosis takes into account propagation effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the behaviour {{of the terminal}} sequence of an accessible endofunctor T on a locally presentable category K. The preservation of <b>monics</b> by T is sufficient to imply convergence, necessarily to a terminal coalgebra. We can say much more if K is Set, and κ is ω. In that case {{it is well known}} that we do not necessarily get convergence at ω, however we show that to ensure convergence we don't need to go to a higher cardinal, just to the next limit ordinal, ω + ω. For an ω-accessible endofunctor T on Set the construction of the terminal coalgebra can thus be seen as a two stage construction, with each stage being finitary. The first stage obtains the Cauchy completion of the initial T-algebra as the ω-th object in the terminal sequence Aω. In the second stage this object is pruned to get the final coalgebra Aω+ω. We give an example where Aω is the solution of the corresponding domain equation in the category of complete ultra-metric spaces...|$|R
40|$|We use a {{one-dimensional}} morphodynamic {{model to}} analyze the long-term evolution of the lower reaches of the Fly River, Papua New Guinea, from the Everill Junction to the delta mouth. The model shows how the break in the exponential trend of river width triggers deposition, thus producing a tidal region characterized by a higher bed elevation {{with respect to the}} river-dominated one. Numerical simulations indicate that the river attains a dynamic equilibrium configuration in which the amount of sediment entering upstream is flushed seaward. A sensitivity analysis is performed, in which the effect of varying solid discharge, tidal har- <b>monics,</b> and initial conditions is discussed. The model shows that an equilibrium configuration results from a delicate balance between the aggrading effect associated with channel divergence (acting mainly during neap tide and at slack water) and the opposite effect of tidal flushing driven by residual water discharge. A physically meaningful morphodynamic equilibrium occurs only for a small range of values of sediment dis- charge prescribed at the upstream boundary. In particular, an increase in sediment discharge leads to aggra- dation, while a decrease triggers extensive scour and a deepening of the estuary...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} regular {{category}} [1] has several 2 -dimensional analogues depending upon which special arrows are chosen to mimic <b>monics.</b> Here, {{the choice of}} the conservative arrows, leads to our notion of faithfully conservative bicategory K in which two-sided discrete fibrations become the arrows of a bicategory F = DFib(K). While the homcategories F(B,A) have finite limits, {{it is important to have}} conditions under which these finite “local” limits are preserved by composition (on either side) with arrows of F. In other words, when are all fibrations in F flat? Novel axioms on F are provided for this, and we call a bicategory F modulated when Fop is such a F. Thus, we have constructed a proarrow equipment () ∗: → M (in the sense of [28]) with M = Fcoop. Moreover, M is locally finitely cocomplete and certain collages exist [23]. In the converse direction, if M is any locally countably cocomplete bicategory which admits finite collages [23], then the bicategory M∗ of maps in M is modulated. (Recall from [26, p 266], that a 1 -cell in a bicategory is called a map when it has a right adjoint. ...|$|R
50|$|One {{might then}} think {{to define a}} subobject of X as an {{equivalence}} class of <b>monics</b> m: X′ → X having the same image or range { mx | x ∈ X′ }. The catch is that two or more morphisms may correspond to the same function, that is, we cannot assume that C is concrete {{in the sense that}} the functor C(1,-): C → Set is faithful. For example the category Grph of graphs and their associated homomorphisms is a topos whose final object 1 is the graph with one vertex and one edge (a self-loop), but is not concrete because the elements 1 &rarr; G of a graph G correspond only to the self-loops and not the other edges, nor the vertices without self-loops. Whereas the second-order definition makes G and the subgraph of all self-loops of G (with their vertices) distinct subobjects of G (unless every edge is, and every vertex has, a self-loop), this image-based one does not. This can be addressed for the graph example and related examples via the Yoneda Lemma as described in the Further examples section below, but this then ceases to be first-order. Topoi provide a more abstract, general, and first-order solution.|$|R

This implies that there are p- 1 pd∑_k|d, p∤ kμ_M(k) p^d k such `regular' m (μ_M the Möbius function). Motivated by killing this zero'th cohomology, we study the directed system of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras A_d=F_p[x]/(g_d) as well as their inherited bicovariant differential calculi Ω(A_d;m). We show that A_d=C_d⊗_χ A_ 1 a cocycle extension where C_d=A_d^ψ is the subalgebra of elements fixed under ψ(x) =x+ 1. We also have a Frobenius-fixed subalgebra B_d of dimension 1 /d∑_k | dϕ(k) p^d/k (ϕ the Euler totient function), generalising Boolean algebras when p= 2. We note that A_ 1 F_p(Z/pZ) the algebra of functions on the finite group Z/pZ and we describe its differential calculus and Fourier theory. We show dually that F_p Z/p Z F_p[L]/(L^p) for a `lie algebra' generator L with e^L group-like, using a truncated exponential. We show that A_ 2 over F_ 2 is a 1 -dimensional extension of the Boolean algebra on 3 elements and we study its noncommutative differentials, metrics and Levi-Civita connections within bimodule noncommutative geometry.
