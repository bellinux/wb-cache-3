40|$|Drawing, as a {{discipline}} within in the Visual Arts domain of knowledge {{is the focus of}} this dissertation. Herein I pose the question: What happens between my mind, body (hand), and the drawing (as product) that appears on paper while I draw? Drawing as experience is primary to my practice and to my understanding of the varying processes that drawing encompasses. I relate and investigate these processes to understand my art making as a means of research. In the dissertation I reflect on my own drawing and on the work of the American artist Richard Serra, in particular his installation entitled Black is the drawing (1977). In <b>my</b> <b>discussions</b> of both <b>my</b> own and Serraʼs work I focus on the core devices that orchestrate the materiality of drawing, namely ʻblanknessʼ, automatic flow and the coming together of intention, gesture and act. The theoretical framework in which I investigate these core devices is mainly provided by the Chilean biologist, philosopher, and neuroscientist Francisco Varela and his notions of human perception, productive action, and creativity or invention. These theories of Varela I employ to frame and develop discussion in the dissertation. Further concepts that come to the fore in <b>my</b> <b>discussions</b> of drawing as experience, as derived from Varela and the French philosopher Jacques Derridaʼs writings, include signature, individuation, or characteristic mark making. Individuation of the mark in relation to self-reflexive methodology in art making as research practice is primary to the development of <b>my</b> <b>discussions.</b> Additional concepts that are key to the dissertation and that flow from self-reflexivity, are self-discovery and self-generating productivity and the notion of self-as-being that the drawing process can bring about and affirm.

60|$|My dear Lord,--I am {{not sure}} that the best way of {{discussing}} any subject, except those that concern the abstracted sciences, is not somewhat in the way of dialogue. To this mode, however, there are two objections: the first, that it happens, as in the puppet-show, one man speaks for all the personages. An unnatural uniformity of tone is in a manner unavoidable. The other and more serious objection is, that, as the author (if not an absolute skeptic) must have some opinion of his own to enforce, he will be continually tempted to enervate the arguments he puts into the mouth of his adversary, or to place them in a point of view most commodious for their refutation. There is, however, a sort of dialogue not quite so liable to these objections, because it approaches more nearly to truth and Nature: it is called CONTROVERSY. Here the parties speak for themselves. If the writer who attacks another's notions does not deal fairly with his adversary, the diligent reader has it always in his power, by resorting to the work examined, to do justice to the original author and to himself. For this reason you will not blame me, if, in <b>my</b> <b>discussion</b> of the merits of a Regicide Peace, I do not choose to trust to my own statements, but to bring forward along with them the arguments of the advocates for that measure. If I choose puny adversaries, writers of no estimation or authority, then you will justly blame me. I might as well bring in at once a fictitious speaker, and thus fall into all the inconveniences of an imaginary dialogue. This I shall avoid; and I shall take no notice of any author who my friends in town do not tell me is in estimation with those whose opinions he supports.|$|E

[...] Instead, he offers, [...] "we must, therefore, cultivate within ourselves an ironic understanding of our own countercultural inheritance while simultaneously developing a nonironic commitment to learning how to build enduring institutions that have the capacity not only to rouse spirits but also to dismantle the power of those whose strength partly depends on our cynicism" ...|$|R

This is something that has puzzled people always. I think I've figured out what it is.Expansion and development are two different things. Development is differentiation of what already existed. Practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing, from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes. Expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity. That is a different thing.I've gone at it two different ways. Way back when I wrote The Economy of Cities, I wrote about import replacing and how that expands, not just the economy of the place where it occurs, but economic life altogether. As a city replaces imports, it shifts its imports. It doesn't import less. And yet it has everything it had before.Reason: It's not a zero-sum game. It's a bigger, growing pie.Jacobs: That's the actual mechanism of it. The theory of it is what I explain in The Nature of Economies. I equate it to what happens with biomass, the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area. The energy, the material that's involved in this, doesn't just escape the community as an export.

5000|$|C. Scott Littleton has {{suggested}} that ranking by patrilineal ultimogeniture could have prevailed in Proto-Indo-European society. He wrote the following in [...] "The New Comparative Mythology: An Anthropological Assessment of the Theories of George Dumezil":"Gerschel published, in 1956, a most interesting, albeit exploratory, paper. Entitled [...] "Sur un schème trifonctionnel dans une famille de légendes germaniques", the paper {{is concerned with the}} possible existence of a tripartite scheme in a series of German and Swiss legends wherein {{a man or a woman}} performs some service for the [...] "little people" [...] (fairies, elves, etc.) and, in return, receives three gifts (e.g., a ring, a sword, and a loaf of bread) which are to be passed on to the three sons. So long as these three items are preserved, the three branches of the family will prosper. These gifts, of course, are seen by Gerschel as symbolic of the three functions, and the prosperity of the three sons so endowed varies accordingly: the eldest son receives a gift symbolizing the third function (e.g., a loaf of bread; cf. the third function identification of Lipoxaïs, eldest son of the Scythian Targitaos) and becomes a successful farmer and the father of many children; the second son receives a gift symbolic of the second function (e.g., a sword) and becomes a successful warrior; the youngest son receives a gift symbolic of the first function (e.g., a ring or a cup) and becomes a priest, an abbot, or the governor of a province. Should these objects be lost or destroyed, then the three branches of the family will cease to prosper in their respective ways. Often the first and second sons lose their talismans, while the youngest, who holds the gift symbolizing sovereignty, is able to preserve his by sequestering it in an abbey and thus continues to prosper. Gerschel concludes that these modern (fifteenth-to eighteenth century) South German and Swiss legends, many of which are tied to existing families in the area and are used to explain the differing fortunes of various branches thereof, [...] "sont susceptibles de récéler une matière d' origine indo-européenne: la légende est ici héritière du mythe" [...] (1956, p. 92). This interpretation, if correct, is, in my opinion, of the highest significance; it implies that the tripartite ideology has persisted far beyond the phase in which epics were composed, that it trascended the era of classical historical interpretation, and that, despite well over a thousand years of Christianity, it still forms a part of the European world view (at least in Bavaria and some Swiss cantons). As I see it, even if these legends are but isolated examples, Gerschel's work, coupled with that of Dumézil, opens up some most interesting avenues of research, ones that have perhaps some important theoretical implications as far as the relationships among language, society, and ideology are concerned. Another matter that this article brings into focus is the extent to which Proto I-E society was characterized by ultimogeniture. I have alluded above to Lipoxaïs, who, as the eldest son, received the lowest rank; conversely, his youngest brother Kolaxaïs became sovereign. In these German and Swiss legends, the same thing happens. Elsewhere the evidence is not clear-cut, but hints of ultimogeniture can be found throughout ancient I-E literature. One such example can be seen in the kinship in heaven theme mentioned previously in <b>my</b> <b>discussion</b> of Wikander's work; here again, the youngest son inherits the sovereign position (cf. the positions of Zeus, Feridun, Tesub, etc., relative to their respective siblings). That this was indeed the Proto I-E pattern is still an open question, but I feel that a good case for it can be made on the basis of the evidence presented above".|$|E
