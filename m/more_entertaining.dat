5|$|As {{the first}} shooter {{game in the}} Final Fantasy series, the game's staff had various {{problems}} during development, although producer Yoshinori Kitase found the experience challenging, and added role-playing elements {{in order to make}} the game <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> for traditional fans of the main series. When Dirge of Cerberus was released outside Japan, several aspects of the gameplay were modified in order to make it more appealing. A mobile phone tie-in was also released in 2006, while in 2008, Square republished the game in Japan with the updates made for the Western versions. Although the game has sold 1.5 million copies worldwide as of 2011, it has received a mixed critical reaction.|$|E

Geisel was asked to write a <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.|$|E

The first leg at Alavés' home ground the Estadio Mendizorroza finished 0–0. However, the second leg was <b>more</b> <b>entertaining.</b> The match contained seven goals, Alavés won the match 4–3 to progress to the second round. Alavés' opposition {{in the second round}} were Lillestrøm of Norway. The first leg was at Lillestrøm's home ground the Åråsen Stadion.

5|$|Once {{rebuilding}} began, {{the poor}} rebuilt their basic {{housing in the}} same primitive fashion as before. By contrast, the wealthiest residents, both secular and spiritual, became caught in an almost manic orgy of building. Most members of the nobility had several homes in Sicily. For one thing, the Spanish viceroy spent {{six months of the}} year in Palermo and six in Catania, holding court in each city, and hence members of the aristocracy needed a town palazzo in each city. Once the palazzi in devastated Catania were rebuilt in the new fashion, the palazzi in Palermo seemed antiquated by comparison, so they too were eventually rebuilt. Following this, from the middle of the 18th century, villas to retire to in the autumn, essentially status symbols, were built at the fashionable enclave at Bagheria. This pattern was repeated, on a smaller scale, throughout the lesser cities of Sicily, each city providing a <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> social life and a magnetic draw for the provincial aristocrat than their country estate. The country estate also did not escape the building mania. Often Baroque wings or new façades were added to ancient castles, or country villas were completely rebuilt. Thus the frenzy of building gained momentum until the increasingly fantastical Baroque architecture demanded by these hedonistic patrons reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{held out}} of {{training}} camp before the 1990 season, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks dragged into September with neither side budging, and as the season approached Taylor received fines {{at the rate of}} $2,500 dollars a day. He signed a three-year $5 million contract (making him the highest paid defensive player in the league) just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out training camp and the preseason, Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble against the Eagles. He finished with 10.5 sacks and earned his 10th Pro Bowl in as many years, although the season marked the first time in Taylor's career that he was not selected to the All-Pro team. The Giants started out 10 – 0 and finished with a 13–3 record. In the playoffs, the Giants defeated the Bears 31–3, and faced the rival 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. They won 15–13, after Taylor recovered a key fumble late in the game to set up Matt Bahr's game-winning field goal. In Super Bowl XXV, they played the Buffalo Bills and won one of the <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> Super Bowls in history, 20-19, after Buffalo's Scott Norwood missed a potential game-winning field goal as time expired.|$|E

Sangakkara, impressed by his teammate set him as opener for the Kings XI Punjab. He scored a few <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> knocks in vain including 44 against the Rajasthan Royals and 93* against the Deccan Chargers. He ended the tournament with a batting average of 43.90.

25|$|As Tsubasa is {{connected}} with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar. Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style {{which leads to the}} characters have longer limbs. Another similarity between both the series is the use of one-eyed characters or people who lost their sight, which is meant to express the feelings from them. The characters of Fai D. Flowright and Kurogane were created in order to have adult characters who would side with Syaoran, who was much younger and was still in development during the series' start. As a result of the manga being aimed at young male demographic, characters are designed to appeal of them such as Syaoran who appears as an action hero. In order to make fights <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> Clamp decided to include yells of fighting techniques {{for the first time in}} a manga of them. Although Kurogane was the only character who did this at first, the authors also planned to make Syaoran do this.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This article {{describes}} {{a pilot study}} in which children with autism alternated between playing a co-operative, dyadic video game with an adult human and playing the same game with an autonomous humanoid robot. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether the children, all of whom had difficulties communicating and engaging in social play with others, would display more collaborative behaviours when playing with an adult after playing and interacting with the humanoid robot. Based on our analysis of the children’s behaviours while playing the cooperative game, our findings suggest that the children were <b>more</b> <b>entertained,</b> seemed <b>more</b> invested in the game, and collaborated better with their partners during their second sessions of playing with human adults than during their first. One possible explanation for this result is that the children’s intermediary play session with the humanoid robot had an impact on their subsequent play session with the adult. Additionally, while the autistic children saw the robotic partner as being <b>more</b> interesting and <b>entertaining,</b> they played <b>more</b> collaboratively and cooperated better with the human adult.

500|$|At {{the time}} Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage {{performances}} were {{heavily influenced by}} orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it [...] "better to say things as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps <b>more</b> <b>entertaining</b> and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth".
