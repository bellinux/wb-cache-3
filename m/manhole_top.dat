40|$|This {{paper has}} looked into how climate change {{will affect the}} {{drainage}} system in Veumdalen, Fredrikstad municipality. Veumdalen has been looked at as a whole, {{as well as a}} deeper analysis of different subfields with buildings. A comparison with previous research has also been done {{towards the end of the}} paper. Different 10 -, 20 - and 50 -year rains have been constructed, in addition to a percentage climate change which also has been added. When it comes to the number of manholes with critical level (water level above 75 cm top pipe), a 10 year rainfall will lead to 12 cases of this. By adding 10 % to the rainfall intensity, the percentage rise in number of manholes with critical level will be 17 %. In other words; the increase is greater than the increase in rainfall intensity. The worst case happens when 50 % is added to the rainfall intensity. This leads to an increase of 417 % in number of manholes above critical level. These analyses have also been made for 20 - and 50 -year rains with similar conclusions. For pipe lines with a pressure height above critical level (75 cm above the top of the pipe), a similar analysis has been done. The total length of all the pipes which has reached the critical level has been added together, to look at how the piping system holds up to an increase in rainfall intensity. The tendencies are the same as for the manholes, were a percentage increase in rainfall intensity leads to an even greater percentage increase in total length of pipes above critical level. In this case the percentage increase is largest for a 10 -year rainfall, with a whopping 367 % increase in pipe length for 50 % added rainfall intensity. It has also been done simulations that show the pipe networks performance in relation to “Norsk Vann” recommended design requirements. Based on the results, 1. 1 % of the pipelines do not meet the requirement of maximum filling degree of 100 % once every ten years. Moreover, it also sets the requirement of reaching the critical level only once per twenty years. 2. 3 % of the distribution system fails to meet these requirements. When it comes to the amount of overflow a 10 year rainfall will increase the total amount from 1590 m 3 to 2755 m 3, when 50 % rainfall intensity is added. Again, the increase in percentage is greater than the percentage increase in intensity. For a 50 -year rainfall the total amount is 2409 m 3 and 3949 m 3 respectively, in other words an increase of approximately 64 %. Furthermore, the thesis dealt with different subfields, and looked at the number of buildings that in some way could be connected to pipelines above critical level. The results from these areas are summed together and presented in a separate chapter regarding the total number of affected buildings. Here the results show that an increase of 50 % in rainfall intensity will cause an percentage increase of affected buildings in the range of 133 - 226 %, depending on which return period is used. This paper also contains results regarding subfields with a separate storm water pipe line. In these areas we have looked at storm water which rises to the ground level, and start causing trouble for the drainage around the houses and so forth. In the subfield named Myratoppen, five manholes will have storm water which reaches the ground level. The height above the <b>manhole</b> <b>top</b> lies in the range of 18 - 51 cm. In another subfield, namely “Veumdalen north-west, Ambjørnrød”, two manholes have the same problem. These manholes flood 20 and 31 cm respectively above the top of the manhole. Finally, the thesis has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the parameters “percentage contributing dense area” and “runoff time”. Looking at an area which previously has been strongly affected by basement flooding, the sensitivity was measured in relation to the change in maximum flow. The results show that the model has greater sensitivity to the parameter “percentage contributing dense area” than “runoff time”...|$|E

50|$|At 9 ft {{above rail}} level, the Class 16E boiler {{centre-line}} was the highest-pitched on the SAR at the time. Because {{of this and}} {{the limitations of the}} loading gauge, the boiler was domeless with an inspection <b>manhole</b> on <b>top</b> of the boiler barrel where the dome would have been. Steam was collected through numerous small feeder pipes fixed into two collector pipes which were arranged as high as possible above the water surface. The collector pipes then joined together to form a main steam pipe, 7 in in diameter, which led to the superheater header and multiple valve regulator located in the smokebox. The steam pipes from the header to each cylinder were 6 in in diameter. The boiler was fitted with two large Pop safety valves mounted ahead of the firebox, one {{on either side of the}} boiler and angled about 80 degrees apart.|$|R
25|$|Lodner D. Phillips {{designed}} the first wholly enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a barrel-shaped upper torso with domed ends and included {{ball and socket}} joints in the articulated arms and legs. The arms had joints at shoulder and elbow, and the legs at knee and hip. The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing port, entrance through a <b>manhole</b> cover on <b>top,</b> a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators {{at the ends of}} the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, Phillips' suit was ever constructed.|$|R

This connection is made by a flange to the top of the tanker.A cone can be equipped with a vapour hose to prevent the vapors from being released to the atmosphere.Numerous accessories are available to make a loading arm more ergonomic and more effective: press down system, pneumatic up/down system, top level control, safety break valve, purge, drain…etc.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ancient and}} solid gravity dam {{structure}}, a pre-Islamic structure that fords a local nala (stream) is 7 m in height and [...] in length {{between the two}} banks. It has been built with quartzite stones (locally available), duly chiselled and dressed, as a regular dam section with downstream base width increasing in steps with depth up to the foundation. It has entry <b>manholes</b> from the <b>top</b> of the dam, which lead {{into the body of}} the dam for inspection and control of flow through sluices for downstream uses. The intake entry into the sluice is on the upstream side. The downstream outlet end leads to the flat terrain below the dam at the ground level. The reservoir created by the dam is mostly silted over the centuries, but it is said to be in use.|$|R
50|$|When {{firing a}} torpedo, the two flaps forming {{the lower part}} of the bow would be opened, the sluice raised, and the tube {{projected}} by means of the chain leading from the inner end to the hauling-out drum. The torpedo would then be thrust from the case at the end of the tube by means of the tubular rod to which the holding fingers are fixed, and, the torpedo being detached, the main tube would be withdrawn by means of the hauling-in chain. In order to place another torpedo in the case at the end of the tube the sluice has to be closed, and the tank having been emptied of water by the centrifugal pump already mentioned, the <b>manhole</b> at the <b>top</b> of the tank can be opened and access thus obtained to the torpedo holder. The emptying of the tank can be effected by the centrifugal pump in about four seconds, and the whole of the operations which we have described can be performed at such a rate that a torpedo can be discharged every three minutes if required.|$|R
5000|$|The M-970 Semi-Trailer Refueler is a 5,000 gal fuel {{dispensing}} tanker {{designed for}} under/overwing refueling of aircraft. It {{is equipped with}} a filter/separator, recirculation system and two refueling systems, one for underwing and one for overwing servicing. The tanker is designed to be towed by a 5-ton, 6x6 truck tractor or similar vehicle equipped with a fifth wheel. The M-970 can be loaded through the bottom or through the top fill openings. A ladder is provided {{at the front of the}} semitrailer for access to the <b>top</b> <b>manhole,</b> and a 4-cylinder diesel engine and pump assembly provides self load/unload capability. The body of the refueler is a 5,000-U.S.-gallon, single compartment, stainless steel tank. The chassis is of welded steel construction and is equipped with full floating tandem axles and a manually operated landing gear. There has been talk of retiring the M-970, but a suitable off-road replacement has not been found. The Marine Corps also uses R-9 and R-10 tankers, but they are not capable of off road use. The M-970 is a part of the [...] "United States Marine Corps Maintenance Center - Albany, Georgia, USA - An Integrated Enterprise Scheduling Case Study" [...] which is working to upgrade the Semitrailer for future use.|$|R
5000|$|The reactor {{was placed}} {{to allow for}} access from above for refueling. The 74-MW reactor is a tall, narrow cylinder, housed in a {{cylindrical}} containment vessel with rounded ends and a 14 ft diameter vertical cylindrical projection housing the control rods and refueling equipment. The 50 ft long containment vessel houses the pressurized-water reactor, the primary coolant loop and the steam generator. The steel vessel has a wall thickness varying from 2.5 in to 4 in, designed to accommodate the [...] (gauge) pressure generated by a ruptured primary coolant pipe. There are two 42 in diameter <b>manholes</b> in the <b>top</b> of the containment vessel. Two 24 in by 18 in manholes {{in the bottom of}} the containment vessel are designed to admit water to the containment vessel if the ship sinks in more than 100 ft of water to prevent the pressure vessel's collapse. The containment vessel was not occupied under operational conditions, but could be accessed within 30 minutes of reactor shut-down. The lower half of the containment vessel is shielded by a 4 ft concrete barrier. The upper half is shielded by 6 in of lead and 6 in of polyethylene. A collision mat shields the sides of the vessel with alternating layers of 1 in steel and 3 in of redwood in a 24 in assembly.|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 2007 and 2008 to evaluate heat treatment for disinfestations of empty concrete elevator silos. A Mobile Heat Treatment Unit was used to introduce heat into silos to attain target conditions of 50 °C for at least 6 h. Ventilated plastic containers with a capacity of 100 g of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., held Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Polyvinyl chloride containers with a capacity of 300 g of wheat held adults of Liposcelis corrodens (Heymons) (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae) and Liposcelis decolor (Pearman), which were contained in 35 -mm Petri dishes within the grain. Containers were fastened to a rope suspended {{from the top of}} the silo at depths of 0 m (just under the <b>top</b> <b>manhole),</b> 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m (silo floor). When the highest temperature achieved was ≍ 50 °C for 6 h, parental mortality of R. dominica and T. castaneum, and both psocid species was 98 - 100 %. Progeny production of R. dominica occurred when there was parental survival, but in general R. dominica seemed less impacted by the heat treatment than T. castaneum. There was 100 % mortality of L. corrodens at all depths in the heat treatments but only 92. 5 % mortality for L. decolor, with most survivors located in the bioassay containers at the top of the silo. Results show wheat kernels may have an insulating effect and heat treatment might be more effective when used in conjunction with sanitation and cleaning procedures...|$|R
