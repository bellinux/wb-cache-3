The <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> length passed anneal furnace can reach {{thousands}} of meters. <b>Strip</b> <b>steel</b> is easy off tracking. So, <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> deviation correction sensor must be set in anneal furnace. <b>Strip</b> <b>steel</b> deviation correction check control system must be set on <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> production line. Electromagnetic inductance <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> deviation correction sensor was designed independently by electromagnetic induction principle in this paper to work in anneal furnace. Its structure form is centring check form. The technique quotas of this sensor are same as similar product of Germany EMG Company. SolidWorks software was adopted to construct the right half part model of sensor metal frame. Transient state heat analysis and heat structure coupling analysis were made on relative model by ANSYS software. The influence rules of temperature field and gravity field on sense structure deformation were found. <b>Strip</b> <b>steel</b> deviation correction check control system was designed. Prepositive amplification rectification circuit was designed. Second order infinite gain multiple circuit feedback lowpass smoothing circuit was designed.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{determine}} the effective cooling parameters for the run-out table (ROT) of <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> in a hot rolling process. Two-dimensional transient heat conduction is developed, including the external force convection and heat source due to translational motion. The strip velocity, cooling water temperature and external fluid velocity are chosen to study the influent parameters during the cooling process. To determine 2 -dimensional transient heat conduction in the cooling process of <b>strip</b> <b>steel,</b> numerical methods are applied to solve for {{the temperature of the}} <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> with appropriate boundary conditions. The backward difference formula (BDF) applies to the discretization of a partial differentiation equation (PDE). The parallel sparse direct linear solver (PARDISO) is applied to the computation {{in the form of a}} linear algebraic equation built with the Comsol multiphysics software for the heat transfer module. The simulation studies are divided into 12 case studies with three variations subjected to cooling conditions at the ROT.

40|$|Abstract: An {{automatic}} control method to prevent thin <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> from breaking in cold rolling {{is presented in}} this paper. The strip width detector is equipped at the entry and exit sections of the cold rolling mill respectively, thus the width reduction of the <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> {{before and after the}} mill can be real-time detected. The signal of the width reduction rate exceeding a certain value means that the strip edge is too tight. Then, via the strip shape adjusting mechanism, the edge of the <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> becomes loose and the strip breakage can be avoided. By applying this method, the incidence of strip breakage can be reduced and the productivity capacity can be increased, and more, the width control accuracy of the rolled <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> can be improved. The validity of the proposed method is verified by the example simulation...|$|R
40|$|Two novel Ultra Low Carbon steels were investigated, {{one based}} on {{combined}} vanadium and titanium additions and the second based on titanium only additions. Grain size and mechanical property measurements have been performed on continuous annealed samples previously subjected to 80 % cold rolling reduction on both <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> grades. The recrystallisation and grain coarsening characteristics of annealed ULC strips have been studied. The amount of precipitated species, under equilibrium conditions, at various annealing temperatures has also been calculated using MT-DATA thermodynamic modelling software.

5000|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>Steel</b> or {{cold rolled}} <b>strip</b> is a <b>steel</b> {{product that is}} {{produced}} from a hot rolled strip that has been pickled. The coil is then reduced by a single stand cold roll steel mill straight away or reversing mill or in a tandem mill consisting of several single stands in a series. The strip is reduced to approximately final thickness by cold-rolling directly, or with the inclusion of an annealing operation at some intermediate thickness to facilitate further cold reduction or to obtain mechanical properties desired in the finished product. High carbon <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> requires additional annealing and cold reduction operations. The coil is then slit to the desired width {{through the process of}} roll slitting.|$|R

40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making <b>steel</b> {{strapping}} and <b>strip</b> from rod stock produced from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of mini-mills is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing steel strapping and cold-rolled <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, steel strapping and cold-rolled <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} strapping or strip, which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces steel strapping and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> from the rod and strip stock made from scrap steel in mini-mills. The new process creates <b>steel</b> strapping and <b>strip</b> with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any steel strapping used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce cold-rolled <b>strip</b> <b>steel,</b> a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} <b>strip</b> <b>steels</b> with a {{yield strength}} of 700 MPa {{are used in}} the yellow goods industry, with recent trends requiring thicker strips with an improved toughness. <b>Strip</b> <b>steel</b> was produced to thicknesses of 10 – 17 mm, with thinner strips showing improved Charpy impact toughness compared to the thicker strip. It was found that all samples (different thicknesses and test orientations) showed splits on the fracture surfaces in the upper transition region. The hot rolled <b>strip</b> <b>steels</b> showed a predominantly fine-grained (4 µm ECD) ferrite microstructure, with some coarse grain patches (grains ≥ 5 µm grouped together). No significant differences were noted for the grain size, yield stress, tensile strength, hardness and texture for the different compositions. Splits were characterised and produced successfully by low blow Charpy testing with acoustic emission (AE) sensors indicating the presence of splits which occurred in the upper transition region predominantly without main crack propagation. Analysis by x-ray tomography and sectioning was carried out showing splits propagate by transgranular cleavage, preferentially following coarse-grained regions, with the 10 mm strip producing deeper splits which was related to elongated grains (high aspect ratio). Therefore the presence of deep splits improved toughness through a reduction of the impact transition temperature, which was achieved by ensuring the presence of a bimodal grain structure, containing coarse elongated grain patches...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the impact}} fatigue characteristics of valve leaves that are prevalently used in hermetic reciprocating compressors especially for the household type refrigerators. A unique automated impact fatigue test system has been designed and produced, which enables to carry out impact fatigue tests of the compressor valve leaves under the desired impact velocities. The test system serves investigations on the impact fatigue characteristics with the ability of crack detection and as the subsequent step of automatically terminating the test. The crack detection technique incorporates a non-contact actuation, a data acquisition system and a microphone. The investigation relates the impact fatigue lifetime of the valve leaves with the impact velocity, asymmetrical impact, operation temperature, material type (carbon <b>strip</b> <b>steel,</b> stainless <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> and new stainless <b>strip</b> <b>steel</b> grade) and tumbling operation duration. Microscopic and metallographic observations were performed on the specimens. It was observed that the crack initiated {{at the edge of}} the valve leaves on the contact surface of valve leaf and vale plate and a particle is torn away from the edge before propagation. As the crack propagates, branching along the crack path is caused by the geometrical shape and stress waves on the valve leaves. The investigation and introduced test system guide the design optimization of valve leaves in terms of compressor performance due to energy consumption and lifetime of the valve leaf...|$|R
