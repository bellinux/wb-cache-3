Globular carbon and composite flakes are poorly crystalline microporous carbon. Homogeneous flakes decompose in the electron beam and are probably composed of heavy volatile hydrocarbons. Graphite is confined to samples from retrograde shear zones and often occurs with globular carbon.

Also reported are ages from a middle amphibolite-facies <b>metasediment</b> from the Soldiers Cap Group approximately 90 km north of Cannington. The predominantly metasedimentary host rocks of the Cannington deposit were eroded from a terrane containing latest Archaean to earliest Palaeoproterozoic (ca 2600 - 2300 Ma) and Palaeoproterozoic (ca 1750 - 1700 Ma) zircon. The ca 1750 - 1700 Ma group of zircons are consistent with sedimentary provenance from rocks of Cover Sequence 2 age that are now exposed {{to the north and}} west of the Cannington deposit. The metasedimentary samples also include a group of zircon grains at ca 1675 Ma, which we interpret as the maximum depositional age of the sedimentary protolith. This is comparable to the maximum depositional age of the <b>metasediment</b> from the Maronan area (ca 1665 Ma) and to previously published data from the Soldiers Cap Group. Metamorphic zircon rims and new zircon grains grew at 1600 - 1580 Ma during upper amphibolite-facies metamorphism in metasedimentary and mafic magmatic rocks. Zircon inheritance patterns suggest that sheet-like pegmatitic intrusions were most likely derived from partial melting of the surrounding metasediments during this period of metamorphism. Some zircon grains from the amphibolite have a morphology consistent with partially recrystallised igneous grains and have apparent ages close to the metamorphic age, although {{it is not clear whether}} these represent metamorphic resetting or crystallisation of the magmatic protolith.

Garnetite layers, which reach a tnickness up to 15 m, invariably separate melasediment and gabbroic silIs. Garnets of these layers are almandine-rich pyralspites. The main variation of the garnet composition which occur trough tne sections is a grossular concentration increase and a decrease of the pyrope-almandine component, away from the metasediments. Garnets are LREE depleted and in general have flat or slightly increasing MREE-HREE patterns. The most striking feature of the REE profiles is the negative Eu anomaly, which decreases away from the <b>metasediment</b> contact.

40|$|New and {{published}} major and trace element abundances of elastic <b>metasediments</b> (mainly garnet-biotite-plagioclase schists) from the similar to 3. 8 Ga Isua Greenstone Belt (IGB), southern West Greenland, {{are used in}} an attempt to identify the compositional characteristics of the protoliths of these sediments. Compositionally, the <b>metasediments</b> are heterogeneous with enrichment of LREE (La/Sm-chord = 1. 1 - 3. 9) and variable enrichment and depletion of HREE (Gd/Yb-chord = 0. 8 - 4. 3). Chondrite-normalized Eu is also variable, spanning a range from relative Eu depletion to enrichment (Eu/Eu* = 0. 6 - 1. 3). A series of geochemical and geological criteria provides conclusive evidence for a sedimentary origin, in disagreement with some previous studies that questioned the presence of genuine elastic <b>metasediments.</b> In particular, trace element systematics of IGB <b>metasediments</b> show strong resemblance to other well-documented Archaean clastic sediments, and are consistent with a provenance consisting of ultramafic, malic and felsic igneous rocks. Two schists, identified as metasomatized mafic igneous rocks from petrographic and field evidence, show distinct compositional differences to the <b>metasediments.</b> Major element systematics document incipient-to-moderate source weathering in the majority of <b>metasediments,</b> while signs of secondary K-addition are rare. Detailed inspection of Eu/Eu*, Fe 2 O 3 and CIW (chemical index of weathering) relationships reveals that elevated iron contents (when compared to averages for continental crust) and strong relative enrichment in Eu may be due to precipitation of marine Fe-oxyhydroxides during deposition or diagenesis on the seafloor. Some of the IGB <b>metasediments</b> have yielded anomalous Nd- 142 and W- 182 isotopic compositions that were respectively interpreted in terms of early mantle differentiation processes and the presence of a meteorite component. Alternatively, W and possibly Nd isotopes could have been affected by thermal neutron capture on the Hadean surface. The latter process was tested in this study by analysis of Sm isotope compositions, which serve as an effective monitor for neutron capture effects. As no anomalous variation from terrestrial values was detected, we infer that isotope systematics (including W- 182 and Nd- 142) of IGB <b>metasediments</b> were not affected by neutron capture, but reflect decay of radioactive parent isotopes.

40|$|Major {{and trace}} {{elements}} of metasediments of the granulite facies Narryer and the amphibolite facies Jack Hills metasediments {{have been used}} to devise plots which enable the original sedimentary components of these rocks to be unravelled, despite their metamorphic state. These plots overcome the predominant effect of quartz which ranges up to 100 % and can be used to study other <b>metasediment</b> suites. Six components controlled the composition of the clastic metasediments (1) kaolinite, (2) illite-muscovite, (3) chlorite–montmorillonite, (4) dolomite, (5) quartz, (6) resistant heavy minerals such as rutile, zircon, chromite and monazite. Identifying the first four of these components enables the trace element composition associated with the components to be estimated. Feldspar was largely destroyed by chemical weathering but there is a suggestion that traces of it formed a minor seventh component in the Narryer rocks. There was little or no mixing of the original kaolinite-bearing and illite–muscovite-bearing samples, indicating two distinct sources, although both sets of samples contain > 4 Ga zircons, suggesting a third zircon source. The old zircons may have been derived from re-worked sediment or <b>metasediment</b> as they occur in the matrix and in the quartzite clasts of conglomerates. Using Bhatia's criteria, a passive margin is the likely site of deposition.

40|$|Metasedimentary rocks {{represent}} a substantial {{component of the}} Bergen Arcs System and they are mostly confined to the Minor and Major Bergen Arcs. The arcs represents imbricate structures composed of island arc lithologies, prism sediments and gneissic continental substrate thrust, one upon another during the Caledonian Orogeny. In the westernmost Austevoll, surrounded by the massive Sunnhordland Batholith, islands consisting of metasediments occurs. Due to their location, their tectonic position is somewhat enigmatic {{with respect to the}} nearby nappes and they have only been vaguely correlated with the metasediments of the Major Bergen Arc. In order to gain insight in the metamorphic evolution and the tectonic position of the <b>metasediment</b> in Austevoll, a petrological study on garnet-bearing mica-schists from the island of Møkster has been carried out, complemented by thermodynamic modelling in order to constrain the pressure and temperature conditions at which the prograde assemblage of the rock formed. The same methods have been utilized on garnet-bearing micaschists collected from the Samnanger Complex of the Major Bergen Arc to compare them. The petrological study suggests that the metasediments all share common textures with respect to prograde metamorphism. The metasediments from Møkster experienced the highest metamorphic grade resulting in a mineral assemblage, containing staurolite, while the metasediments from the Samnanger Complex only contain garnet-bearing assemblages at the metamorphic peak. The PT conditions for the prograde assemblages could be constrained via thermodynamic modelling to 605 - 635 C and 7. 5 - 8. 2 kbar for the <b>metasediment</b> from Møkster, and to 480 - 565 C and 4. 7 - 6. 6 kbar for the <b>metasediment</b> from the Samnanger Complex. Corresponding depths were calculated to 30 - 31 km and 24 - 25 km, respectively. By calculating a geothermal gradient based on the above estimations, a common geotherm of 20 - 24 C/km was found for the metasediments which is considered a «normal» geothermal gradient, associated with burrial of sediment along an active margin. From their similar textures and metamorphism along a common thermal gradient it is inferred that the metasediments on Møkster and in the Samnanger Complex may {{have been part of the}} same tectonic unit during prograde metamorphism. Thus, the tectonic position of the metasediments on Møkster may have been similar to that of the metasediments of the Samnanger Complex in the Major Bergen Arc...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMultiple {{pieces of}} {{geologic}} evidence suggest that interfaces between contrasted lithologies exert a strong {{control on the}} fate of volatiles in subduction zones. Here we present results from a contact between serpentinites and sediments, located in Corsica and metamorphosed in the blueschist facies during the alpine orogeny. It was shown previously that carbonates in the sediments have been reduced to graphitic carbonaceous material within a 5 - 10 -cm-thick reaction zone at the contact with serpentinites. In an effort to investigate the mechanisms governing this unusual process, bulk rock geochemical analyses incorporating a statistical analysis of compositional data are presented. Observations show that the fate of C was decoupled from that of other elements such as O, H, and large-ion lithophile elements [...] e. g. K, Sr, Ba [...] .,As [...] that were extensively leached from the reaction zone. Notably, Na is strongly enriched in the reaction zone and structurally linked to pectolite. Reducing conditions, manifested by the depletion of O in the reaction zone compared to the bulk <b>metasediment,</b> were likely maintained by the presence of Fe(II) in the serpentinite. Moreover, thermodynamic calculations show that the low solubility of carbon in COH fluids at high-pressure and low-temperature conditions was the main driver for graphite precipitation synchronously with carbonate destabilization. This may have been kinetically favored by the presence of already existing graphitized carbonaceous material and phengite in the <b>metasediment.</b> Limited lateral flow might have contributed as well to the geochemical and petrological patterns observed in these rocks...|$|E

40|$|Garnetite (garnet > 60 %) is a {{prominent}} rock type in Val Fiorina (northern Ivrea Zone), where it occurs as layers up to 10 m thick between granulite-facies metapelites and mafic-ultramafic lithologies. The contacts are sharp between garnetite and metapelite and gradational towards the mafic-ultramafic rocks. Biotite occurs together with garnet in streaky garnetite domains, while both hornblende and clinopyroxene increase in garnetite towards the mafic-ultramafic layers. The grossular content of garnet increases from the <b>metasediment</b> contact towards the mafic rocks, while almandine decreases, bulk-rock Y/Sc and Zr/Ti {{as well as}} initial Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 decreases and K/Rb increases. Garnets have a negative Eu anomaly, but Eu/Eu* increases smoothly in the garnets with increasing distance from the <b>metasediment</b> contact. Two hypotheses are discussed for garnetite petrogenesis: 1) metasomatism taking place by interstitial melt retention in amphibolites and metapelites undergoing synchronous anatexis; 2) reaction between metapelite-derived anatectic melt and phases segregated from a basaltic sill during intrusion which induced partial melting of the country rocks. An objection to hypothesis 1 is the improbability of interstitial melts being retained until completion of the metasomatism. The second hypothesis may explain the observed composition and structures and has been proposed for other Ivrea Zone sectors such as Val Sesia. However, this process only produced extensive garnetites in Val Fiorina. The special conditions required in this case are tentatively ascribed to the flow characteristics and/or to differences in the anatectic component determined by a more fertile metapelite source in Val Fiorina with respect to Val Sesia. Both processes led to geological scenarios consistent with events affecting the Ivrea Zone...|$|E
