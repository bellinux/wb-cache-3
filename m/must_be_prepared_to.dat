5|$|The American Chess Congress' final {{proposal}} {{was that the}} winner of a tournament {{to be held in}} New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> charge down the ball {{once it has}} been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E
25|$|In {{professional}} ice hockey, the back-up goaltender fills {{an important}} team role. Although the back-up will spend most games {{sitting on the}} bench, the back-up <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> play every game. A back-up may be forced into duty at any time to relieve the starting goaltender {{in the event of}} an injury or poor game performance. The back-up will also be called upon to start some games to give the starter the opportunity to rest from game-play during the season.|$|E
25|$|After the {{breakdown}} of his first attempt to negotiate a title match against Lasker (1911), Capablanca drafted rules {{for the conduct of}} future challenges, which were agreed by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> defend his title once a year; the match should be won by whichever player first won six or eight games (the champion had the right to choose); and the stake should be at least £1,000 (worth about £347,000 or $700,000 in 2006 terms).|$|E

50|$|We {{must have}} humility when {{approaching}} Scripture. Even {{some of the}} Church's greatest and most philosophically sophisticated saints stated that some passages were difficult for them.

25|$|The {{point of}} {{exception}} handling routines {{is to ensure}} that the code can handle error conditions. In order to establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and mutation testing (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write exception handling routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s).|$|E
25|$|Abrahams {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} that the only solution was to end the status of resident native, leaving him free to quit the estate or to stay there on terms satisfactory both to himself and the landlord, substituting contractual for statutory rights. The 1948 Land Planning Committee of senior civil servants did not wholly agree with Abraham’s recommendations, holding the view that 'African and European enterprise in Nyasaland are complementary and inter-dependent; neither can progress without the goodwill of the other; both <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> co-operate for their mutual benefit and progress'. Under this two-fold policy land could still, under certain conditions, be alienated to non-Africans.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the Bible says. He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise us {{when we consider the}} general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take to do with the knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{exception}} of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but <b>must</b> <b>be</b> visibly <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do so.

25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E
25|$|The 1839 Treaty of London {{recognised}} Belgium as {{an independent}} and neutral state. Until 1911, Belgian strategic analysis anticipated that if war came, the Germans would attack France across the Franco-German border and trap the French armies against the Belgian frontier, as they had done in 1870. British and French guarantees of Belgian independence were made before 1914 but the possibility of landings in Antwerp was floated by the British military attaché in 1906 and 1911, which led the Belgians {{to suspect that the}} British had come to see Belgian neutrality as a matter of British diplomatic and military advantage, rather than as an end in itself. The Agadir Crisis (1911) left the Belgian government in little doubt as to the risk of a European war and an invasion of Belgium by Germany. In September 1911, a government meeting concluded that Belgium <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> resist a German invasion, to avoid accusations of collusion by the British and French governments. Britain, France and the Netherlands were also to continue to be treated as potential enemies. In 1913 and 1914, the Germans made inquires to the Belgian military attaché in Berlin, about the passage of German military forces through Belgium. If invaded, Belgium would need foreign help but would not treat foreign powers as allies or form objectives beyond the maintenance of Belgian independence. Neutrality forced the Belgian government into a strategy of military independence, based on a rearmament programme begun in 1909, which was expected to be complete in 1926. The Belgian plan was to have three army corps, to reduce the numerical advantage of the German armies over the French, intended to deter a German invasion.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} 23 September that Graves and Clinton learned that the French fleet in the Chesapeake {{numbered}} 36 ships.

[...] After effecting repairs in New York, Admiral Graves sailed from New York on 19 October with 25 ships {{of the line and}} transports carrying 7,000 troops to relieve Cornwallis. It was two days after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. General Washington acknowledged to de Grasse the importance of his role in the victory: [...] "You will have observed that, whatever efforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest." [...] The eventual surrender of Cornwallis led to peace two years later and British recognition of the independent United States of America.|$|E

500|$|A 2011 {{article in}} New York Magazine {{described}} {{the company as}} the [...] "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" [...] because of its unwavering commitment to [...] "total honesty and accountability" [...] and minute detail in its corporate culture.

All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary.

He says that any employee can respectfully say anything to anyone in the firm, but they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> be challenged in return. The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.|$|E
500|$|The Frenchman took {{a sabbatical}} in 1992 after {{being fired from}} Ferrari for {{publicly}} criticizing {{the car and the}} team, while the Brazilian struggled as McLaren was no longer competitive with Williams.

Senna had wanted to join Williams too, as they were the most competitive, but Prost had a clause in his contract forbidding the Brazilian as a teammate. An infuriated Senna called the Frenchman a [...] "coward" [...] during a press conference at Estoril, and decried his unwillingness to compete for the Drivers' Championship on equal sporting terms: I think if Prost wants to be called the sole champion, three-times world champion, come back in a sportive way, maybe win another championship, he should be sportive.

500|$|Wales {{conducted}} {{their first}} overseas tour in 1964, playing several games and one Test in South Africa. They lost the Test against South Africa in Durban 24–3, their biggest defeat in 40 years. At the WRU {{annual general meeting}} that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that [...] "it was evident {{from the experience of}} the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales... Players <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football". This started the coaching revolution. The WRU Coaching Committee – set up in the late 1950s – was given the task of improving the quality of coaching and, in January 1967, Ray Williams was appointed Coaching Organiser. The first national coach, David Nash, was appointed in 1967 to coach Wales for the season, but resigned when the WRU refused to allow him to accompany Wales on their 1968 tour of Argentina. Eventually, the WRU reversed their decision, appointing Clive Rowlands to tour as coach. Of the six matches, Wales won three, drew two and lost one.|$|E
