40|$|The rose aphid, <b>Macrosiphum</b> <b>rosae,</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests on roses in the world and it causes economic damage. In this study, biology, seasonal population dynamics, and status of natural enemies of the rose aphid were studied. Seasonal population dynamics was studied by randomly sampling 10 shoots every week in two locations of Isfahan, Iran. Rose aphid with a high population density, both in spring (April and May) and in autumn (November), was observed on roses. The results showed that the rose aphid overwinters as parthenogenetic females and nymphs. This aphid migrates to a secondary host, Dipsacus fullonum (Dipsacaceae), in summer due to poor food quality of rose plants. Since sexual form and egg of the rose aphid were not observed in Isfahan, it is probably anholocyclic species with host alternation in this area. Natural enemies of the rose aphid include four species of Coccinellidae, three species of Syrphidae, two species of Chamaemyiidae, one species of Chrysopidae, a few species of Anthocoridae and Miridae, and one species of Cantharidae. One species of ectoparasite mite of Erythraeidae was also collected. In addition, four species of parasitoid wasps, Braconidae, were collected...|$|E

The overall developmental period of C. septempunctata was found significantly longer on L. erysimi and shorter on M. rosae. The grubs, however, required significantly longer developmental period on H. coriandri and shorter on M. rosae. Nonetheless, the adult longevity was higher on L. erysimi and shorter on M. rosae. Between the sexes, the female required longer period for its development than male {{with respect to}} all aphid species. With regard to predation, the grubs consumed maximum H. coriandri, whereas, adult preferred L. erysimi. The last larval stage (grub 4), irrespective of aphid species, devoured more aphids than the other grub stages. The predation by female of all aphid species was more as compared to male.

40|$|Discrete {{steps in}} the process of host {{selection}} of Aphidius rosae Haliday (Hym., Braconidae Aphidiinae), a parasitoid of the rose aphid <b>Macrosiphum</b> <b>rosae</b> (L.) (Hem., Aphididae), were studied to assess its specificity in the Australian environment. In a wind tunnel females were strongly attracted only to roses when given a choice between uninfested shoots of hybrid Rosa sp., var. Tea-hybrid and various other plants. The parasitoids were not able to distinguish between infested and uninfested roses when the shoots were 30 cm apart, but they preferred to land on infested plants when shoots were placed only 5 cm apart. These results suggest that aphid-related volatiles involved in host location are detectable by the wasp only over a short distance. Experienced and inexperienced parasitoids were presented with a range of aphid species in choice and no-choice tests. Only the host M. rosae and to a much lesser extent the non-host Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) were attacked. No larvae of A. rosae were found in M. euphorbiae that were stung when these were dissected. To assess host specificity we argue that more attention should be paid towards the entire host selection process from location of host habitats to location of hosts, host acceptance and host suitability.

40|$|Rose {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} ornamental shrubs of the world because of its durability, long period of flowering, different cultivars and its beauty. The rose aphid, <b>Macrosiphum</b> <b>rosae</b> is the most important pest of the rose which causes significant economic damage annually. In order to compare four rose cultivars including Black Magic, Caramba, Noa and Good Life, and a wild rose, Nastaran, infested with rose aphid, a split-plot in time experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design layout with three replications, in Isfahan (Iran) from February 2004 to March 2005. The infestation levels of roses with the rose aphid and its seasonal fluctuations were determined by weekly sampling. Analysis of data showed that there are significant differences (P&lt; 0. 01) between cultivars. Noa (with pink flowers) has the highest infestation of rose aphid (with average 23. 12   ± 0. 036 aphids) and Caramba (with yellow flowers) has the lowest infestation (with average 6. 46   ± 0. 036 aphids).

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{certain aspects of}} the biology and ecology of the predatory {{lacewing}} Dichochrysa prasina Burmeister (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) such as the effects of various prey species, temperature, relative humidity regimes and prey density on development and reproduction, were studied under laboratory conditions. The experiments were carried out at the Laboratory of Applied Zoology and Parasitology of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, during 2003 - 2007. The effects of different prey species on preimaginal development and survival, as well as on adult longevity and fecundity of the predatory lacewing Dichochrysa prasina Burmeister were studied under laboratory conditions. The prey species tested were the aphids Aphis fabae Scopoli, Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe, Aphis pomi De Geer, Hyalopterous pruni Geoffroy, <b>Macrosiphum</b> <b>rosae</b> (L.) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer), the “two spotted spider mite” Tetranychus urticae Koch, the “moth” Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) and the “beetles” Tribolium confusum Duval and Tenebrio molitor (L.). Eggs of E. kuehniella and nymphs of M. persicae were the most favorable among the tested prey, resulting in high survival and short developmental time of preimaginal stages as well as in increased adult longevity and fecundity of D. prasina. Larvae of T. molitor were less favorable, resulting in a decrease in adult longevity and fecundity of D. prasina. Among the other prey studied, nymphs of A. fabae, A. pomi, H. pruni and M. rosae, nymphs and adults of T. urticae, and larvae of T. confusum were the least favorable for development, whereas nymphs of A. nerii did not allow the completion of larval development of D. prasina. These results could be useful for mass-rearing D. prasina and for understanding its population dynamics in the field in relation to the availability of certain prey species. Immature development and adult longevity and reproduction of D. prasina were investigated at six constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 33 °C) and a photoperiod of 16 : 8 (L:D) under laboratory conditions. Irradiated frozen eggs of the flour moth E. kuehniella were used as food throughout immature development of the lacewing larvae, whereas the adults fed on a liquid volumetric mixture of water, yeast hydrolysate, sugar and honey. The higher temperature tested of 33 °C was fatal and no individuals reached maturity at this temperature regime. At the rest temperatures tested, the duration of immature developmental time (from egg to adult) ranged from approximately 99 or 92 days for females and males respectively at 15 °C to 25 days at 30 °C for both sexes. The percentage of adult emergence ranged between 36 and 84 % within the temperature range from 15 to 30 °C. Both adult longevity and fecundity were significantly affected by the rearing temperature and the estimation of life table parameters revealed that the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) reached its maximum value at 27 °C. The importance of these results in the establishment of a small or large scale mass production system of D. prasina is further discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{effects of}} the {{inherent}} transmissibility of the virus and of the inherent transmitting ability of aphids on the transmission of bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) were studied along with four virus-vector relationships of BYMV and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulz.). In addition, investigations were made on the transmission of clover yellow mosaic virus (CYMV) by aphids and {{on the effects of}} temperature on the susceptibility of Lincoln pea to inoculation with bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) by M. persicae. All eight aphid species included in these tests transmitted BYMV. The aphids ranked in the order of descending efficiency of BYMV transmission as follows: Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thos.), Benton Co. (Oregon) clone of Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Myzus persicae (Sulz.), Aphis fabae Scop., Columbia Co. (Washington) clone of A. pisum, <b>Macrosiphum</b> <b>rosae</b> (L.), Therioaphis riehmi (Borner), Brachycaudus helichrysi (Kltb.) and Cavariella aegophodii (Scop.). Efficiency of transmission varied from 62 percent to 7 percent. B. helichrysi, C. aegopodii and T. riehmi have not previously been reported to transmit BYMV. Collections of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), from Oregon and Washington included biotypes differing in BYMV transmission, fecundity, body size and host preference. No differences were found among M. persicae clones. BYMV isolates differed in symptom expression and in the ease with which they were transmitted by aphids. Aphid transmissibility of BYMV was lost or greatly reduced following a single mechanical transfer. The vector-Iess isolate multiplied to the virtual exclusion of the aphid transmissible isolate when broad bean plants were inoculated simultaneously with both these isolates. Different areas of broad bean leaves were not equal as sources of BYMV for M. persicae. More aphids transmitted the virus from the interveinal chlorotic area than from the green areas along the veins. Post-inoculation temperature for 48 - 56 hours had a considerable influence on Lincoln pea susceptibility to BYMV infection by M. persicae inoculation. More plants were infected at 27 and 30 °C than at 15, 18 or 24 °C. Post-inoculation temperature treatment for 24 hours or less did not have any appreciable effect. Pre-inoculation temperature for 47 - 55 hours also considerably influenced plant susceptibility to BYMV infection by aphid inoculation. Twice as many plants were infected at 15 °C as at 30 °C. The effects of pre- and post-inoculation temperatures were not additive. The number of plants infected depended entirely on post-inoculation temperature. Artificial termination of acquisition probes did not have any appreciable effect on BYMV transmission by M. persicae. No significant differences in virus transmission were found for aphids with acquisition probes in the 11 - to 45 -second, range. Virus transmission increased with {{an increase in the number}} of test probes. Loss of BYMV by feeding M. persicae could be expressed exponentially. Half-Iife of the retention of virus by feeding aphids was about three minutes. Clover yellow mosaic virus could be easily confused with BYMV on the basis of symptom expression in Dwarf Horticultural and Bountiful cultivars of the bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., Pisum sativum L. cv. Lincoln, Vicia faba L. (secondary symptoms, especially on new sprouts), and in Chenopodium amaranticolor Coste and Reyn. (primary reaction).
