40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that single-beam hydrographic systems can underestimate bottom depth in the presence of dense submersed aquatic vegetation. It was hypothesized that multibeam systems may likewise underestimate depth under similar conditions. We test this hypothesis using multibeam data collected from a Maine coastal harbor that is heavily colonized with tall, dense eelgrass (Zostera marina). The multibeam data was collected from an intensive (400 % coverage) survey in which final gridded depth data was picked based on several depth picking operators, including minimum, mean, and maximum depth within each grid cell. Data for depth comparison and vegetation characterization was collected using a specialized single-beam system able to detect the bottom under vegetation and capable of characterizing seagrass canopy geometry. Comparison of data sets shows that the minimum and average depth picking operators underestimate depth for all levels of seagrass density, but that the <b>maximum</b> <b>operator</b> is unaffected by all but the densest levels of seagrass. Differencing depth data layers generated by the minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>operators</b> produces a data layer which is highly correlated with seagrass height and density, suggesting that this technique may be used to map seagrass...|$|R

It certainly is better than rigid automation where tasks are taken over while the operator is taken out of the loop to supervise the process. Ideally, automation can be switched on or off (or increased and decreased) dynamically {{on the basis of the}} <b>operator’s</b> <b>demand.</b> A way to assess <b>operator’s</b> <b>demand</b> is to measure physiological parameters and to infer operator status. If general patterns that reflect different levels of emotional state, vigilance, or workload can be detected, automation can be adapted on the basis of that. Cardiovascular indices seem promising for this use. The work environment of the ambulance dispatcher has been simulated and experiments have been performed to evaluate feasibility of using the cardiovascular measures for adaptive automation. Results show that adaptation on the basis of one physiological parameter only, a blood pressure rise of 10 mmHg, is unlikely to be successful.
