40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} novel method designed to detect rotor position by decoding received information in two different techniques for switched reluctance motor at standstill and also low speeds. These decoding techniques are namely, digital pulse width modulation (DPWM) decoder and digital pulse position modulation (DPPM) decoder. This method begins by connecting a small capacitor in series with each <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding.</b> The supply voltage {{in conjunction with the}} drive transistor produces a short pulse for each phase capacitor. Since the phase inductance varies with the rotor position, the rise time of the voltage produced on each capacitor changes as well. Next, the capacitor voltages are compared with some pre-set voltage values and the rotor position is detected at standstill mode. The number of pre-set voltage values varies for each technique. It then continues to sense the rotor position while the motor is running by applying the same procedure, but only to the un-energized phases windings. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the method...|$|E
40|$|A {{multilevel}} inverter topology for a four-pole induction-motor {{drive is}} presented in this paper, which is constructed using the induction-motor stator winding arrangement. A single dc source with a less magnitude when compared with conventional five-level inverter topologies is used in this topology. Therefore, power balancing issues (which are major challenges in conventional multilevel inverters) are minimized. As this configuration uses a single dc source, it provides a path for zero-sequence currents because of the zero-sequence voltages present in the output, which will flow through the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> and power electronic switches. To minimize these zero-sequence currents, sine-triangle pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) is used, which will shift the lower order harmonics near to switching frequency in the linear modulation region. However, {{in the case of}} overmodulation, harmonic voltages will be introduced close to the fundamental frequency. In this regard, a modified SPWM technique is proposed in this paper to operate the drive in the overmodulation region up to the modulation index of 2 /surd{ 3 }. The proposed quad two-level inverter topology is experimentally verified with a laboratory prototype on a four-pole 5 -hp induction motor. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed topology in the complete linear modulation region and the overmodulation region...|$|E
40|$|Multilevel {{inverters}} {{are gaining}} more attention in ac drive application {{due to their}} many attractive features. In the case of conventional neutral-point-clamped (NPC) or flying capacitor multilevel inverter configurations, active switches are connected in series to produce multilevel output voltage waveform. Therefore, if any one switch fails, the entire configuration has to be shut down; this will reduce {{the reliability of the}} system. A dual three-level inverter configuration for induction motor drive is proposed in this paper to improve reliability of the system. This topology is developed by feeding four-pole induction motor stator winding with four conventional two-level inverter modules. A level-shifted carrier-based third harmonic injection pulsewidth-modulation technique is used to produce the gating signals for the proposed configuration. By providing proper phase shift between carrier waves, multilevel voltage waveform is produced across the total <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding,</b> and first center band harmonics are also canceled. Thereby, the torque ripple will be considerably reduced compared with conventional NPC five-level inverter-driven induction motor drive. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is used to estimate the torque ripple when induction motor is supplied by the proposed configuration and conventional five-level NPC inverter configuration to show the effectiveness of the proposed converter. The proposed configuration is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and experimentally verified using a laboratory prototype with a 5 -hp four-pole induction motor drive...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to obtain the rotor {{position}} of switched reluctance motors by means of voltage measurements.

This paper discusses {{the influence of the}} magnetic inductive coupling between motor phases on the observed damped voltage resonance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a five-level {{inverter}} topology is presented for a four pole induction motor drive {{with a single}} DC source. In any ac motor, the winding coils which are 3600 (electrical) apart will have identical voltage profiles. A conventional four pole induction machine consists of two such Identical Voltage Profile Winding Coils (IVPWCs) which are connected in series (or parallel). In the proposed method the series (or parallel) connected IVPWCs are disconnected into two parts. Each IVPWC is fed by a two two-level inverters from both the sides thereby four two-level inverters are used to generate the five-level voltage across the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding.</b> All these four two-level inverters {{are connected to the}} same DC source with a magnitude v/dc (where Vdc is the dc bus voltage required for conventional five-level NPC inverter).

Using the advantage of both IVPWCs of the induction motor stator winding and UPSC PWM the harmonics can be shifted to higher order which is close to four times compared to the harmonics with general SPWM. This circuit configuration does not require any major design modifications of the induction motor except the disconnection between the IVPWCs.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of an on-line technique for detecting and locating partial discharges in the stator winding of a high voltage electrical machine. This technique forms part of an on-line health monitoring strategy for the insulation of high voltage machines. Existing diagnostic techniques and partial discharge measurement systems are reviewed. The requirement for an on-line partial discharge location technique is discussed. An experimental investigation was carried out into the propagation characteristics of partial discharge pulses within a model stator winding. This allowed identification of the main propagation characteristics which were used {{as the basis for the}} development of a partial discharge location technique. In the development of a location technique, a means of on-line detection of discharge signals at the motor terminals is required. A study was therefore made on the use of the Rogowski coil for the non-invasive measurement of partial discharges. A partial discharge location system was developed based on the correlation of partial discharge pulses detected at the two ends of a <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding.</b> The performance of the location system was investigated by injecting artificially generated discharge pulses into the model stator winding.

40|$|Multilevel {{voltage source}} {{inverters}} have been receiving {{more and more}} attention from the industry and academia as a choice for high voltage and high power applications. The high voltage multilevel inverters can be constructed with existing low voltage semiconductor switches, which already have a mature technology for handling low voltages, thus improving {{the reliability of the}} overall inverter system. These multilevel inverters generate the output voltage in the form of multi-stepped waveform with smaller amplitude. This will result in less dv/dt at the motor inputs and electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by switching is considerably less. Because of the multi-stepped waveform, the instantaneous error in the output voltage will be always less compared to the conventional two-level inverter output voltage. It will reduce the unwanted harmonic content in the output voltage, which will enable to switch the inverter at lower frequencies. Many interesting multi level inverter topologies are proposed by various research groups across the world from industry and academic institutions. But apart from the conventional 3 -level NPC and H-bridge topology, others are not yet highly preferred for general high power drives applications. In this respect, two different five-level inverter topologies and one three-level inverter topology for high power induction motor drive applications are proposed in this work. Existing knowledge from published literature shows that, the three-level voltage space vector diagram can be generated for an open-end winding induction motor by feeding the motor phase windings with two two-level inverters from both sides. In such a configuration, each inverter is capable of assuming 8 switching states independent of the other. Therefore a total of 64 switching combinations are possible, whereas the conventional NPC inverter have 27 possible switching combinations. The main drawback for this configuration is that, it requires a harmonic filter or isolated voltage source to suppress the common mode currents through the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding.</b> In general, the harmonic filters are not desirable because, it is expensive and bulky in nature. Some topologies have been presented, in the past, to suppress the common mode voltage on the motor phase windings when the both inverters are fed with a single voltage source. But these schemes under utilize the dc-link voltage or use the extra power circuit. The scheme presented in chapter- 3 eliminates the requirement of harmonic filter or isolated voltage source to block the common mode current in the motor phase windings. Both the two-level inverters, in this scheme, are fed with the same voltage source with a magnitude of Vdc/ 2 where Vdc is the voltage magnitude requires for the NPC three-level inverter. In this scheme, the identical voltage profile winding coils (pole pair winding coils), in the four pole induction motor, are disconnected electrically and reconnected in two star groups. The isolated neutrals, provided by the two star groups, will not allow the triplen currents to flow in the motor phase windings. To apply identical fundamental voltage on disconnected pole pair winding, decoupled space vector PWM is used. This PWM technique eliminates the first center band harmonics thereby it will allow the inverters to operate at lower switching frequency. This scheme doesn’t require any additional power circuit to block the triplen currents and also it will not underutilize the dc-bus voltage. A five-level inverter topology for four pole induction motor is presented in chapter- 3. In this topology, the disconnected pole pair winding coils are effectively utilized to generate a five-level voltage space vector diagram for a four pole induction motor. The disconnected pole pair winding coils are fed from both sides with conventional two-level inverters. Thereby the problems like capacitor voltage balancing issues are completely eliminated. Three isolated voltage sources, with a voltage magnitude of Vdc/ 4, are used to block the triplen current in the motor phase windings. This scheme is also capable of generating 61 space vector locations similar to conventional NPC five-level inverter. However, this scheme has 1000 switching combinations to realize 61 space vector locations whereas the NPC five-level inverter has 125 switching combinations. In case of any switch failure, using the switching state redundancy, the proposed topology can be operated as a three-level inverter in lower modulation index. But this topology requires six additional bi-directional switches with a maximum voltage blocking capacity of Vdc/ 8. However, it doesn’t require any complicated control algorithm to generate the gating pulses for bidirectional switches. The above presented two schemes don’t require any special design modification for the induction machine. Although the schemes are presented for four pole induction motor, this technique can be easily extend to the induction motor with more than four poles and thereby the number of voltage levels on the phase winding can be further increased. An alternate five-level inverter topology for an open-end winding induction motor is presented in chapter- 4. This topology doesn’t require to disconnect the pole pair winding coils like in the previous propositions. The open-end winding induction motor is fed from one end with a two-level inverter in series with a capacitor fed H-bridge cell, while the other end is connected to a conventional two-level inverter to get a five voltage levels on the motor phase windings. This scheme is also capable of generating a voltage space vector diagram identical to that of a conventional five-level inverter. A total of 2744 switching combinations are possible to generate the 61 space vector locations. With such huge number switching state redundancies, it is possible to balance the H-bridge capacitor voltage for full modulation range. In addition to that, the proposed topology eliminates eighteen clamping diode having different voltage ratings compared to the NPC inverter. The proposed topology can be operated as a three-level inverter for full modulation range, in case of any switch failure in the capacitor fed H-bridge cell. All the proposed topologies are experimentally verified on a 5 h. p. four pole induction motor using V/f control. The PWM signals for the inverters are generated using the TMS 320 F 2812 and GAL 22 V 10 B/SPARTAN XC 3 S 200 FPGA platforms. Though the proposed inverter topologies are suggested for high-voltage and high-power industrial IM drive applications, due to laboratory constraints the experimental results are taken on the 5 h. p prototypes. But all the proposed schemes are general in nature and can be easily implemented for high-voltage high-power drive applications with appropriate device ratings...|$|E

In {{this thesis}} work, the {{electronic control system}} design and design method of a refrigerator that is supplied from PV panel have been studied. The designed system includes PV panel, accumulator and a compressor with a high efficiency BLDC (brushless DC) motor. For the system, motor has an input power of 100 W and the controlled speed range is 2200 – 3600 min- 1. Open-circuit voltage range for the PV panel is 15 – 50 V and design is suitable for both 12 V and 24 V accumulators. For such an application, {{it is necessary to}} use PV panel at the voltage and current that gives maximum power. Using MPPT algorithms, energy supplied from PV panel is transferred to the accumulator with maximum energy efficiency. Having high efficiency and being suitable for using in variable speed applications, BLDC motor was preferred at this study. A compressor {{is a part of the}} cooling system (compressor, evaporator, condenser etc.) and it is driven with the BLDC motor. This cooling system ensures the inside temperature of the refrigerator cabin as low as desired. A boost DC/DC converter that is supplied from the accumulator is used for adjusting the DC bus voltage at the input of 3 -phase motor inverter. The speed of the BLDC motor is controlled by adjusting the DC bus voltage. On the other hand, three phase motor inverter is used for energizing the motor phases at the right instances according to the rotor position information coming from sensorless position detection circuit. As a result, BLDC motor is controlled with six-step trapezoidal control method. Below are the criteria for the MPPT charger circuit design: • Flexibility in using(being compatible with various kind of accumulators and PV panels), • Successful MPPT operation during the whole day and all climate conditions, • Low electromagnetic radiation and low electrical noise, • Cost-effectiveness (single switch topologies were considered) Input impedance of buck-boost type DC/DC converters can be adjusted in range [0,&# 8734;) in continuous conduction mode. Consequently, regardless of the ratio between input voltage and output voltage of the converter, a successful MPPT operation can be done and converter can run the PV panel from open-circuit point to short-circuit point. Therefore, buck-boost type DC/DC converter topologies were considered for MPPT charger circuit. Classical buck-boost converter and Zeta converter has a controlled switch at the input side. Thus these converters have high input current ripple, harmonic and differential mode electromagnetic noise. On the other hand, &# 262;uk and SEPIC topologies are better in harmonic and noise performance because of the input inductor. In battery supplied systems, peak value of the battery charge current is crucial because high ripple current affects battery life and parasitic losses. Because of the output inductor, ripple of the battery charging current for &# 262;uk converter is low, whereas SEPIC converter has a discontinuous and high ripple output current because of the diode at the output. As a result, &# 262;uk converter is the best alternative among other single switch topologies for MPPT charger circuit. With the &# 262;uk MPPT charger an efficiency of 92, 04 % has been obtained. MPPT algorithms are used for obtaining maximum power from the panel that is available. At this thesis work, open circuit voltage method, perturb&observe method and incremental conductance method have been studied. There are various other MPPT algorithms in the literature. Open circuit (OC) voltage method adjusts panel voltage to a k multiple of open circuit voltage. But this method is satisfactory only certain conditions because maximum power point voltage depends on irradiance and ambient temperature. On the other hand, OC voltage method is a useful method to approach maximum power point rapidly after power-on. Perturb and observe (PO) algorithm is the method that the PV panel voltage or current is increased and decreased, the PV power is calculated at each time and the direction of change is reversed when the PV power decreases. As a result, PO algorithm is an algorithm of trial and error that the PV power works and oscillates around maximum power point. According to the incremental conductance algorithm maximum power point for the PV panel is located when the instantaneous conductance is equal to the negative value of incremental conductance. When instantaneous conductance is greater than negative of the incremental conductance, this means operating point is at the left of the MPPT point. Then, algorithm will decrease PV voltage. When instantaneous conductance is smaller than negative of the incremental conductance, this means operating point is at the right of the MPPT point. Then, algorithm will increase PV voltage. Incremental conductance algorithm is successful in rapidly varying irradiance conditions. However, it is not immune to noise, then noise reduction will be important in the implementation of this algorithm. At this thesis work, two implementations of MPPT algorithms have been done and MPPT efficiencies have been measured. MPPT efficiency is the ratio of generated PV output power to available PV power under test irradiance and temperature conditions. During MPPT tests, Chroma 62150 H 400 S DC power supply, which has solar panel simulation property, has been used. A model of Kyocera KC 85 T PV panel has been done and two parallel KC 85 T panel model has been used in MPPT efficiency tests. At the first implementation, OC method is used after first power-on and approach to maximum power point rapidly. Then, PO algorithm starts to work and find the MPPT point. At this first hybrid MPPT method an MPPT efficiency of 99 % has been obtained under constant 600 W/m 2 irradiance. At the second MPPT test, from 600 W/m 2 to 300 W/m 2 and from 300 W/m 2 to 600 W/m 2 a rapidly varying irradiance at each 5 second has been implemented. At this test, an MPPT efficiency of 96, 2 % has been obtained. At the second implementation, OC method is used after first power-on and approach to maximum power point rapidly. Then, IC algorithm starts to work and find the MPPT point. At this hybrid MPPT method an MPPT efficiency of 98, 5 % has been obtained under constant 600 W/m 2 irradiance. At the second MPPT test, from 600 W/m 2 to 300 W/m 2 and from 300 W/m 2 to 600 W/m 2 a rapidly varying irradiance at each 5 sec has been implemented. At this test, an MPPT efficiency of 96. 6 % has been obtained. A boost DC/DC converter is used for boosting 12 / 24 V accumulator voltage to 35 - 50 V. Peak current mode control has been used for the control of boost converter. An efficiency of 91. 41 % has been obtained for this boost converter with 100 W maximum output power. BLDC motors have generally three phase winding in the stator and they have permanent magnet in the rotor. Back-EMF voltages induced in phase windings are trapezoidal for BLDC motors. Brushed DC motors need frequent maintenance due to the arcs caused by brush-commutator structure and mechanical frictions. On the other hand, for BLDC motors commutation action is done electronically instead of mechanical brush-commutator action. Thus, BLDC motors do not require maintenance and do not have risk of arcs. Moreover, compressor contains oil for the protection of mechanical parts of the compressor; arcs that result from mechanical friction of brushes can ignite or cause fire. Therefore, BLDC motor was preferred for this thesis work. When two of the three phases of BLDC motors are energized consecutively, this motor model does not have a difference with simple brushed DC motor. To obtain maximum torque from BLDC motor and to drive efficiently each phase should be energized at the 120 electrical degrees part where the EMF is maximum. In a BLDC inverter there are six semiconductor switches that enable electronic commutation. In six step trapezoidal drive method there are six combinations for two of three <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>winding</b> energizing. At every 60 degrees two of three phases are energized and there will be a sequence of energizing according to the rotor position. If this action is done in the right sequence, motor runs at desired speed and torque. Speed control of the motor is done via adjusting the input DC bus voltage of the three phase inverter with a boost DC/DC converter, thus there is no need to a high frequency PWM operation in motor inverter. As a result, at the motor inverter, switching frequency of semiconductor switches is equal to the motor electrical commutation frequency. Therefore, switching losses of motor inverter transistors and parallel diode reverse recovery losses are very low. There is a relationship between motor EMF voltage and rotor’s mechanical position. Rotor position information is critical for six step trapezoidal drive. Thus, there are sensored and sensorless position detection methods for BLDC motors. There are various position detection sensors such as Hall effect sensors, optical sensors etc. that generate three sensor signals at the same phase and frequency of back EMF voltage. According to information coming from these sensors, motor inverter switches energize the motor windings. In sensorless position detection methods, by sensing the back EMF voltage on motor terminals, it is possible to detect rotor position without sensors. Generally, there are two kinds of sensorless position detection methods. At the first method, zero crossing points of the back EMF voltages are detected and delayed digitally. As the commutation point has a phase difference of 30 degrees with respect to zero crossing point, commutation signals can be determined with digital delay. At the second type of sensorless methods, phase voltages are filtered first and delayed after filtering. Delaying and/or filtering is done in such a manner that the result exactly gives the commutation point when they are compared to each other or compared with the neutral point. The sensorless position detection method used in this thesis work is belonging to the second group. In this method, delay time is adjusted according to the rotating speed and motor phase voltages are compared to each other. As a result, method gives three position signals that have the same electrical frequency with the back EMF voltage. Square wave position detection signals have a phase difference of 120 degrees to each other and they have 180 degrees on time. Magnitude of back EMF voltage has a linear relationship with the motor speed. Thus, at low speeds motor back EMF voltages are small and not enough to give correct commutation instant. Sensorless motor control methods are not able to detect motor position at low speeds. Then, sensorless position detection algorithms work as follows: firstly, rotor is aligned to a known position. Secondly, during free run interval, motor phases are energized according to six step trapezoidal drive for predetermined time intervals in an open loop manner. After this open loop interval, closed loop sensorless position detection algorithm starts to work and all commutation is done according to the position signals coming from sensorless position detection circuit. As a result, BLDC motor control has three steps: align, free run, closed loop operation. With the stated sensorless position detection and motor control method, motor speed control and drive has been done and motor speed has been regulated to desired reference between 2200 - 3600 min- 1 speed interval.

40|$|In this paper, a {{harmonic}} elimination and suppression {{scheme for}} a dual-inverter-fed open-end winding induction motor drive is presented. Two isolated dc-link sources with voltage ratio of approximately 1 : 0. 366 {{are required for}} the present drive. These two isolated dc links feeding two inverters to drive the open-end winding induction motor eliminate the triplen harmonic currents from the <b>motor</b> <b>phase.</b> The pulsewidth-modulation scheme proposed enables the cancellation of all the 5 th- and 7 th-order (6 _n ± 1, where n = 1, 3, 5, 7 etc.) harmonic voltages and suppresses the 11 th- and 13 th-order harmonic voltage amplitudes in the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> voltage, in all modulation ranges. The next higher order harmonics present in the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> voltages are 23 rd, 25 th, 35 th, 37 th etc. (6 _n ± 1, n = 4, 6, etc.). By using triangular carrier wave and proper modulating waves for each inverter, the open–end winding induction motor can be operated in the entire modulation range, eliminating all the 6 _n ± 1 harmonics (n = 1, 3, 5, 7 etc.) coupled with 11 th and 13 th harmonic suppression.

The scheme measures the stator current phasor deviation direction to determine the back emf vector position during inverter zero vector switching states. This measurcment of rotor flux position is done indirectly by computing the motor back emf position which is orthogonal to the rotor flux position. The space vector P W M voltage output in <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> generates a curent ripple pattern, which depends upon the ripple voltage and equivalent stator leakage inductance. For high speed operation when the time duration for the zero vector switching states are small an indirect method for flux position estimation is proposed, where the effect of active voltage vectors on the stator ripple current is eliminated by creating a virtual short circuit at the motor terminals. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{optimized}} five-level inverter topology is proposed for a four pole induction motor drive. This topology has developed {{by using the}} advantage of two identical voltage profile <b>winding</b> coils per <b>phase</b> in a four pole induction motor. The identical voltage profile winding coils are disconnected and {{each part of the}} winding is fed with two two-level inverters from both sides. Thereby four two-level inverters are used to generate five voltage levels on induction <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> windings. All two-level inverters are fed with single DC link with the magnitude V dc over 4 (where V dc is the dc-bus voltage required for a conventional NPC five-level inverter). Because of the common DC link for all the two-level inverters, common mode currents will find a path through the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> windings {{due to the lack of}} isolated neutral. To minimize the common mode currents a Sine-Triangle Pulse Width Modulation is used in the proposed topology. Thereby the first dominant harmonics and triplen harmonics shifted near to the switching frequency, which will have a less impact on the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> currents. Since the dominant harmonics are less in the proposed topology, it gives almost sinusoidal output voltage which will improve the efficiency of the drive system. The proposed topology does not require any major design modifications of induction motor. The proposed topology is simulated in MATLAB (Simulink) with (5 HP) four pole induction motor with sine triangle PW...|$|R
