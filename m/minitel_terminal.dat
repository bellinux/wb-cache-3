50|$|Many other {{standards}} were also introduced for special purposes, commonly using a high-speed channel for receiving, and a lower-speed channel for sending. One typical example {{was used in}} the French Minitel system, in which the user's terminals spent the majority of their time receiving information. The modem in the <b>Minitel</b> <b>terminal</b> thus operated at 1,200 bit/s for reception, and 75 bit/s for sending commands back to the servers.|$|E

25|$|After a test {{period with}} 2500 users {{starting}} in 1994, online banking services were launched in 1998, using <b>Minitel</b> <b>terminals</b> that were distributed freely {{to the population}} by the government.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{track of}} an eGovernment measure in France was the {{nationwide}} release in 1984 of <b>Minitel</b> <b>terminals</b> through which citizens and companies could access several public services and information remotely.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the demise of}} the British system, the French equivalent of Prestel, Teletel/Minitel, received substantial public backing when millions of <b>Minitel</b> <b>terminals</b> were handed out free to telephone subscribers (causing Alcatel huge financial problems). As a consequence the Teletel network became very popular in France, and remained well used, with access later also possible over the Internet. After a short postponement, Minitel closed finally on 30 June 2012.|$|R

50|$|In some European countries, and {{especially}} in France, Minitel data transmitting services were popular before the Internet. Minitel had many consumer-level communication services, including chatting, email, railway and broadcast timetables and travel and hotel booking. <b>Minitel</b> used little <b>terminals</b> rented from telephone companies or computers with modems that accept Minitel transmission protocol speed. Amiga Minitel communication programs were written in France, Germany and Italy (Amiga Videotel).|$|R
5000|$|Ireland: Minitel was {{introduced}} to Ireland by Eircom (then called Telecom Éireann) in 1988. The system {{was based on the}} French model and Irish services were even accessible from France via the code [...] "36 19 Irlande". A number of major Irish businesses came together to offer a range of online services, including directory information, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, airline reservations, news, weather and information services. The system was also the first platform in Ireland to offer users access to e-mail outside of a corporate setting. Despite being cutting edge for its time, the system failed to capture a large market and was ultimately withdrawn due to lack of commercial interest. The rise of the internet and other global online services in the early to mid-1990s played {{a major factor in the}} death of Irish <b>Minitel.</b> <b>Minitel</b> Ireland's <b>terminals</b> were technically identical to their French counterparts, except that they had a Qwerty keyboard and an RJ-11 telephone jack which is the standard telephone connector in Ireland.

40|$|A {{sentinel}} {{health information}} system using telematics {{and a network}} of general practitioners {{was set up in}} Aquitaine in south western France in 1986. Among the health problems under surveillance was acute diarrhoea. Data for each patient who fulfilled the usual case definition for acute diarrhoea were reported by general practitioners using home <b>terminals</b> (<b>Minitels)</b> connected to a central computer by telephone. Over one year 2234 cases of diarrhoea were reported, the incidence varying from 0. 8 to 1. 5 cases per doctor per week. Seasonal variations in incidence were observed, with peaks in the winter and in the summer. Only 379 (17 %) episodes of diarrhoea were classified as severe, and these patients consulted their general practitioners earlier than patients whose diarrhoea was less severe. Foreign travel was rarely found in the patients' histories, but clusters of cases were found in communities (4. 6 %) and in families (22. 3 %). The advantages of this system were easy reporting and immediate feedback, but it was difficult to extrapolate the data, and the system was inadequate for intervening in outbreaks of diarrhoeal disease. Our knowledge of diarrhoeal diseases in south west France improved...|$|R
