40|$|Late Cretaceous–Paleocene {{evolution}} of the east Gondwana <b>margin</b> <b>Plate</b> reconstructions in a mantle reference frame show that from 140 to 105 Ma Gondwana moved eastward toward the Pacifi c Plate. This convergence was largely accommodated by the subduction of the Pacifi c Plate under Gondwana. Between 120 to 105 Ma, the deep continental crust of the east Gondwana cordillera was largely melted as indicated by a dominantly felsic volcanic province which extends from eastern Australia and Lord Howe Rise, to Marie Byrd Land. From 105 to 95 Ma, Gondwana remained stationary; subsequently, Australia started moving away from Antarctica in a northwesterly direction, resulting in an oblique opening of the early southeast Indian Ocean. This path suggests that, at around 100 Ma, the basal traction that produced and sustained the east Gondwana cordillera decreased signifi cantl...|$|E

The Faroes frontier area {{is in part}} covered by basalts and is a high-risk area with poorly known plays and sedimentary basins. It is therefore essential to obtain {{as much information as}} possible on the evolution of sedimentary basins on the rifted volcanic margins closest to the Faroese Islands <b>margin.</b> <b>Plate</b> reconstructions of the North Atlantic region indicate the former close proximity of East Greenland to the Faroe Islands region (Fig. 1), and the Kangerlussuaq Basin thus constitutes the most important field analogue with respect to stratigraphy, major unconformities and basin evolution.

40|$|Antarctic/Scotia plate {{convergence}} off southernmost Chile The {{southern tip}} of South America off Chile has suffered a long phase of ocean-continent convergence which has shaped the continental margin through different phases of accretion and tectonic erosion. The present accretionary wedge is a dis-continuous geological record of plate convergence and records {{only part of the}} accretionary processes resumed after Chile ridge consumption (14 Ma). The structural style of the subduction complex, such as rates of sediment accretion and tecto-nic erosion, structural vergence, width of the accretionary wedge, taper angle and deformation in the forearc basin, varies along the margin. Large taper values are related to narrow wedges and seaward vergent structures. Low tapers occur where deformation at the toe of the accretionary complex is spread over wide areas and is related both to landward and seaward vergent thrust faults. Seismic data interpretation contributes to define more accurately frontal wedge morphology and geometry of subduction and suggests that different modes of accretion together with tectonic erosion may be active concur-rently along the trench at different locations. In areas of subduction driven accretionary processes the majority of trench sediments are involved in accretionary processes and sediments are uplifted and piled up in the form of imbricate thrust sheets. In areas where the wedge is non-accretionary the continental margin shows steeper continental slopes associated with narrow accretionary wedges, more intense sediment disruption and very shallow décollement levels. Variation in structural style and in the geometry of the forearc region setting off Southernmost Chile, has been interpreted as related to the existence of different structural domains: the nature of their boundaries is still unclear mainly for the lack of high reso-lution bathymetric data. They have been tentatively related to tectonic lineaments belonging to the Magellan Fault system and/or to the character and morphology of the converging plates (lateral heterogeneities, sea-mounts and fracture zones), which produce a segmentation of the <b>margin.</b> <b>Plate</b> tectonics.

This is due to the fact that most papers focused on the so called lower <b>plate</b> <b>margins,</b> while the upper <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> remained less well understood, mainly due to the lack of public accessible drill hole data. The aim of this paper is to provide a first order description of the global architecture and stratigraphic evolution of an upper <b>plate,</b> magma-poor rifted <b>margin.</b> In order to provide such a template, we focused on 2 seismic sections, the ION- 1000 line (East Indian margin), and the SCREECH 2 line (Newfoundland margin) and describe key, km-scale outcrops from the fossil European margin exposed in the Western/Central Alps, all of which document classical upper <b>plate</b> <b>margins.</b> Based on these data we show that upper <b>plate</b> magma-poor rifted <b>margins</b> can be characterized by a staircase type architecture with terraces (T 1, T 2, T 3) and ramps (R 1, R 2) that result as a consequence of an evolution through a coupling, exhumation and breakup stage.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Mid-ocean ridges are a {{fundamental}} but insufficiently understood {{component of the}} global plate tectonic system. Mid-ocean ridges control {{the landscape of the}} Earth's ocean basins through seafloor spreading and influence the evolution of overriding <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> during midocean ridge subduction. The majority of new crust created at the surface of the Earth is formed at mid-ocean ridges and the accretion process strongly influences the morphology of the seafloor, which interacts with ocean currents and mixing to influence ocean circulation and regional and global climate. Seafloor spreading rates are well known to influence oceanic basement topography. However, I show that parameters such as mantle conditions and spreading obliquity also play significant roles in modulating seafloor topography. I find that high mantle temperatures are associated with smooth oceanic basement, while cold and/or depleted mantle is associated with rough basement topography. In addition spreading obliquities greater than > 45 ° lead to extreme seafloor roughness. These results provide a predictive framework for reconstructing the seafloor of ancient oceans, {{a fundamental}} input required for modelling ocean-mixing in palaeoclimate studies. The importance of being able to accurately predict the morphology of vanished ocean floor is demonstrated by a regional analysis of the Adare Trough, which shows through an analysis of seismic stratigraphy how a relatively rough bathymetric feature can strongly influence the flow of ocean bottom currents. As well as seafloor, mid-ocean ridges influence the composition and morphology of overriding <b>plate</b> <b>margins</b> as they are consumed by subduction, with implications for landscape and natural resources development. Mid-ocean ridge subduction also effects the morphology and composition of the overriding <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> by influencing the tectonic regime experienced by the overriding <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> and impacting on the volume, composition and timing of arc-volcanism. Investigation of the Wharton Ridge slab window that formed beneath Sundaland between 70 Ma and 43 Ma reveals that although the relative motion of an overriding <b>plate</b> <b>margin</b> is the dominant force effecting tectonic regime on the overriding <b>plate</b> <b>margin,</b> this can be overridden by extension caused by the underlying slab window. Mid-ocean ridge subduction can also affect the balance of global plate motions. A longstanding controversy in global tectonics concerns the ultimate driving forces that cause periodic plate reorganisations. I find strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that the plates themselves drive instabilities in the plate-mantle system rather than major mantle overturns being the driving mechanism. I find that rapid sub-parallel subduction of the Izanagi mid-ocean ridge and subsequent catastrophic slab break o_ likely precipitated a global plate reorganisation event that formed the Emperor-Hawaii bend, and the change in relative plate motion between Australia and Antarctica at approximately 50 M...|$|R
