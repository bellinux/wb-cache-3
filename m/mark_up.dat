40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> tend to be pro {{cyclical}} in manufacturing and counter cyclical in market services. However, at the sectoral level value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> may be misinterpreted if intermediate input variations are ignored. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} the manufacturing sectors, although less so in that of market services. In fact, this is the main explanation for the (pro cyclical) behaviour of relative services manufacturing <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> which, in turn, play an important role in their relative price dynamics of these sectors. In addition, fluctuations in demand also play a role. In the case of services, <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend negatively on current output and positively on future output; hence in periods when demand is recovering (declining) <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> widen (narrow). By contrast, in the manufacturing sectors <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend positively on the current output gap and negatively on future expected demand, i. e. when demand is recovering (declining) current <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> fall (rise). sectoral mark-ups, gross output, aggregation, intermediate inputs...|$|R

5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix.

Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would <b>mark</b> <b>up</b> the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E

25|$|A {{ballpoint pen}} is a writing {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to <b>mark</b> <b>up</b> his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the role of imperfect competition to explain the relative price of non-traded to traded goods within the Balassa-Samuelson framework. Under imperfect competition in the two sectors, relative prices depend on both productivity and mark-ups. We test this implication using a panel of sectors for the seven major OECD countries. The empirical evidence suggests that rela-tive price movements are well explained by relative productivity and variations in <b>mark</b> <b>ups.</b> Unlike the original Balassa-Samuelson model, aggregate demand could affect the real exchange rate by changing the <b>mark</b> <b>ups.</b> Empirical results show that aggregate demand fluctuations lead to changes on the <b>mark</b> <b>ups...</b>|$|R
