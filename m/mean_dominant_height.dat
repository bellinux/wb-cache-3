El monitoreo del crecimiento en la etapa juvenil inició a año y medio de edad con el establecimiento de 31 parcelas circulares de 300 m², bajo el criterio de muestreo estratificado por calidad de sitio. Los datos recabados durante cuatro años, se utilizaron para el cálculo de IS con las ecuaciones de Schumacher, Korf y Richard-Chapman. Las regresiones arrojaron estadígrafos de R² Schumacher (67, 2446 %), Korf (67, 5393 %) y Richard-Chapman (67, 4306 %), la comparación para muestras pareadas indicó no {{diferencia significativa}} entre los dos últimos modelos. Los resultados para edad de referencia (12 años) en la familia de curvas IS promedio indican con Korf un límite {{superior}} 22, 62 m. e inferior 12, 57 m., Schumacher 19, 94 m y 11, 80 m. y Richard-Chapman 22, 28 m y 13, 25 m. La comparación de los rangos IS Korf con los hallados por (Torres, Delvalle y Restrepo, 2011) región Caribe Colombia, IS superior 24, 7 metros e inferior 9, 8 m., ubica los valores estimados al interior de estos niveles.

Abstract: Under the concept “sustainable management in forest plantations” previous sowing a teak Tectona grandis plantation on an agro-forest {{field in the}} north part of The Urabá Chocoano, Caribbean coast in Colombia South America, qualification of site was done by indirect method (topography, edaphology and climate) identifying it suitable to use. Monitoring young stage growth started {{one and a half}} year after sowing by establishing 31 round sample plots of 300 m 2 under quality of site stratification criterion. Gathered data during four years were used to calculate the S. I. with the Schumacher and Korf equations. The return showed R² of 67. 2446 % for Schumacher, 67. 5393 % for Korf and (67, 4306 %) for Richard y Chapman, the paired sample comparison was not significantly different. The resulting S. I. curves at a base age of twelve years old indicated with Korf a <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> of 22. 62 m on the best sites, and 12. 57 m on the worst sites, Schumacher a <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> of 19, 94 m on the best sites, and 11. 80 m on the worst sites and Richard y Shapman a <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> of 22. 28 m on the best sites, and 13, 25 m on the worst sites. Comparison of Korf’s S. I. ranges with those reported by Torres, Del valle and Restrepo in 2011 in the Caribbean region of Colombia (S.

40|$|A set {{of growth}} and yield models for intensively managed Pinus radiata D.

Stand-level increment models have been derived for <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height,</b> basal area, mortality, and volume. A combined parameter prediction and recovery method was used to forecast the parameters of the Weibull distribution which was used as a model of the diameter distribution. A model for the simulation of thinning has also been constructed. Where possible the models have been cast as generalised linear models and a quasi-likelihood approach was adopted in the modelling of the random com-ponent of each model, resulting in an iteratively reweighted least squares procedure for the estimation of model parameters. A Poisson-like variance function was used to model the error variance of forecasts of stand variables-mean dominant height, basal area, and volume.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether edaphic and/or topographic variables may be used as predictors of site productivity in Stone pine stands in Calabria (southern Italy). To accomplish this goal, a linear discriminant rule was developed using data from 16 pure Stone pine stands, grouped into three different classes based on the <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> annual growth. The discriminant rule was based on three linear models (one for each class) that jointly predicts site class for a given stand. To test the accuracy of the proposed method, cross-validation was carried out by developing 16 alternative discriminant rules (excluding the analyzed data). Predictors tested were edaphic (texture, pH, organic matter) and topographic (altitude and slope) variables. The model obtained allow to discriminate poorest sites accurately (100 % of sites were correctly re-classified using the discriminant functions obtained). In more productive areas, sites were correctly re-classified in the 33. 33 % of cases, while in intermediate sites the correct classification was equal to 50 %. Our discriminant rule classifies correctly the poorest stands, suggesting that site index in plain site soils strongly depends on clay percentage. Overall, the edaphic model obtained classifies plots into the correct site index class 61. 11 % of cases, which is considered an acceptable value for these kinds of studies.

40|$|Abstract—This study applies an {{approach}} based on stochastic geometry for retrieval of forest characteristics from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in two situations: 1) without ground-measured training data and 2) with training data. The applied model treats the ALS echo heights as {{an outcome of}} a random process, express-ing the observed heights of canopy envelope {{as a function of}} stand density, the parameters of the tree height distribution, and the shape of the individual tree crown. The model was applied to a eucalyptus plantation dataset with known spacing, where the main interest was to estimate the plot-specific tree height distribution. Estimation without training data resulted in RMSEs of 2. 9 and 0. 9 m for <b>mean</b> and <b>dominant</b> <b>heights,</b> respectively. Estimation using training data resulted in RMSE’s of 1. 4 and 0. 8 m, respec-tively. In both cases, the estimates of <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> were more accurate than with the reference method, but the estimates of mean height were less accurate (area-based approach; RMSEs 1. 1 and 0. 9 m, respectively).

Quantifying this mitigating effect requires accurate mapping of forest stands and estimation of their dendrometric characteristics. However, steep terrain {{and lack of}} accessibility hamper field surveys. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technique whose potential for the retrieval of forest parameters has been widely investigated {{in the past ten}} years. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the potential of ALS for estimating stand parameters required as input data for rockfall simulation models or more generally for quantifying the rockfall protection function of forests. ALS data was acquired over an 8. 6 km 2 area including coppice stands and deciduous stands on poor quality sites. Multiple regression models were established between laser-derived metrics and forest variables from 31 field plots. The coefficients of determination for stem density, <b>mean</b> diameter, <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and basal area ranged from 0. 43 to 0. 80.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the occurrence of density-dependent height relationships in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) populations. After assessing and ruling out the presence of consequential spatial correlation effects, the analysis consisted of analyzing the relationship between <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and initial planting density within 28 Nelder plots located in the central portion of the Canadian Boreal Forest Region. Employing remeasurement data obtained at periodic intervals (16, 20 and 40 – 41 years post-establishment) across a stand density gradient ranging from a minimum of 1425 stems/ha to a maximum of 28, 621 stems/ha, graphical and simple linear regression analyses were used to quantify the stand height–density relationship by species, plot and measurement year. The results indicated the presence of density-dependent effects on height development for both species: 65 % of the 83 jack pine relationships and 89 % of the 27 black spruce relationships had significant (p ≤ 0. 05) and negative slope values. In regards to jack pine for which the data permitted, the occurrence and magnitude of the observed height repression effect increased over time. The asymptotic height repression effect for jack pine was 24 % greater than that for black spruce. The results are discussed within the context of the applicability of the density-independent height growth assumption and potential implications for site quality estimation and thinning response modeling...|$|E

Significant differences between sites and between taxa in survival, growth, stem form and attack by stem-boring insect larvae were demonstrated. AU taxa grew best on the Convery site that had the highest mean annual rainfall, 1400 mm, on a Red Ferrosol soil derived from volcanic parent material; E. dunnii and E. pilularis grew to a <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> of 17 m in 6 y, E. cloeziana to 15 m, C. citriodora subsp. variegata and E. saligna to 14 m. Fewer than 2 % of trees of all taxa at this site were attacked by insects. The other two sites had Brown Dermosol soils and were drier, the Muller site receiving 1200 mm y - 1 and the Ironbolt site 1100 mm y- 1. Height and diameter growth of all taxa was slower at these sites, with E. pilularis and E. cloeziana showing the greatest reduction in growth while E. grandis x E. camaldulensis showed the least reduction. Overall survival at age 6 y was acceptable at all three sites, being highest at Convery site (86 %) followed by Müller (77 %) and Ironbolt (74 %). While C. citriodora subsp. variegata and E. cloeziana had minimal damage at Mueller and Ironbolt, the other taxa had from 9 % to 100 % of stems affected by borers, with E. grandis, the E. saligna clone and E. urophylla x E. grandis proving particularly susceptible on these sites...|$|E
40|$|Summary We {{studied the}} growth and water balance of young {{plantations}} of Pinus radiata D. Don and Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden. irrigated with effluent for 3 years in a climate of high net evaporation. The plantations were irrigated weekly with secondary-treated municipal effluent at the esti-mated water-use rate, or at nominally twice or half this rate. Control plots were irrigated with bore water at their estimated water-use rate. Both species grew rapidly when irrigated with either efflu-ent or bore water. The eucalypts irrigated with effluent at the estimated water-use rate closed canopy in 24 months, and at 34 months, <b>mean</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> was 12. 1 m, stand basal area was 12. 2 m 2 ha- 1, volume was 51. 2 m 3 ha- 1, LAI was 5. 7, and foliage mass was 6. 5 Mg ha- 1. The pines in the corresponding effluent treatment had not closed canopy by 34 months. At this time, mean height was 5. 0 m, stand basal area was 9. 6 m 2 ha- 1, volume was 29. 7 m 3 ha- 1, LAI was 3. 5, and foliage mass was 7. 3 Mg ha- 1. Water use by eucalypts was consistently higher than by pines, commensurate with their more rapid early growth, but {{the difference was not}} in proportion to the differ-ence in leaf area. In the third year (when the eucalypts had a closed canopy), the eucalypts used 22 % more water than the pines, but the annual mean LAI of the eucalypts was three times greater than that of the pines. The results suggest that (1) plantation water use by the two species on the same site will be similar for the same stage of canopy development, (2) eucalypts are not inherently more profligate consumers of water than pines when soil water is not limiting, and (3) stomatal control limits growth and water use of E. grandis in arid environments...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} two-stage {{procedure for}} determination of stand parameters of entire forest stands {{by means of}} field plots and airborne laser scanner data has been developed and tested. In the first stage, geo-referenced field sample plots {{are related to the}} corresponding laser data, and relationships (regressions) between field data and various canopy height and canopy density metrics that can be derived from laser data are estimated. In the second stage, the entire forest area in question is divided into a regular grid with cell size equal {{to the size of the}} field sample plots. Stand parameters of each grid cell are predicted by means of the estimated regression models and the laser data that correspond to each cell. Stand parameters of entire stands are finally computed from the individual cell predictions. The procedure has been tested in a forest area of 1000 ha. 173 systematically distributed sample plots in very young (h < 10 m) to mature forest were used to regress <b>dominant</b> <b>height,</b> <b>mean</b> height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume against the laser data. The derived models were used to predict corresponding parameters in 73 subjectively selected test stands. Verification of stand estimates revealed a negligible bias for most parameters. The precision was promising: the RMSEs of the predictions were 0. 61 – 1. 17 m, 0. 57 – 1. 33 m, 1. 32 – 1. 61 cm, 128 – 400 ha – 1 (16. 9 – 22. 2 %), 2. 33 – 2. 54 m 2 ha – 1 (8. 6 – 11. 7 %) and 18. 3 – 31. 9 m 3 ha – 1 (11. 4 – 14. 2 %) for <b>mean</b> <b>height,</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>height,</b> <b>mean</b> diameter, stem number per hectare, basal area, and volume, respectively (Næsset 2002, Næsset & Bjerknes 2001).

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{detailed}} and timely forest inventory information available for Canada's large, remote northern boreal forests. The Canadian National Forest Inventory program has derived a limited set of attributes from a Landsat-based land cover product representing circa year 2000 conditions. Of the required inventory attributes, forest vertical structure (e. g., tree height) is critical for terrestrial biomass and carbon modeling and to date, is unavailable for these remote areas. In this study, we develop a large-area, fine-scale (25 m) mapping solution to estimate tree <b>height</b> (<b>mean,</b> <b>dominant,</b> and Lorey's <b>height)</b> across Canada's northern forests by integrating lidar data (representing 0. 27 % of the study area), and Landsat imagery (representing 100 % of the study area), using a geometric-optical modeling technique. First, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to extract image endmembers and generate fraction images. Second, lidar data were used to calibrate the inverted geometric-optical model by adjusting the model's three key fractional inputs: sunlit crown, sunlit background, and shade fraction, based upon the SMA derived images. The heterogeneity of the study area, spanning 2. 16 million ha, made it challenging to directly and accurately decompose mixed Landsat image pixels into the canopy and background fractions used for the Liâ??Strahler geometric-optical model inversion. As a result we developed a novel method to use the lidar plot data to facilitate the calculation of these fractions in an accurate and automated manner. The average estimation errors for <b>mean,</b> <b>dominant,</b> and Lorey's <b>height</b> were 4. 9 m, 4. 1 m, and 4. 7 m, respectively {{when compared to the}} lidar data, with the best result achieved using <b>dominant</b> tree <b>height,</b> where the average error was 3. 5 m for over 80 % of the forested area.

Our {{aim is to}} study the biomass production potentialities of traditional coppice, for various species, sites and managements. This contribution deals with Black Locust (Robinia pseudacacio L.) in the « Val-de-Loire » region. This species, widely introduced in the region, is interesting in coppice management, because of its nitrogen-fixing and rootsuckering ability. Our measures concern the evolution of standing woody mass during the classical coppice-cycle (25 years), without separating living and dead parts of trees. The studied coppice stands are 1 to 25 years old, and have been cut a variable unknown number of times. They have grown on alluvial sandy soils, under oceanic climate. 31 circular sample plots lrom 100 to 400 m 2 have been surveyed in pure coppice. In each plot, girth at breast-height of every shoot, and dominant height of the plot have been measured. In young stands, height of small shoots - smaller than 1. 30 m - has also been measured. From a sample of 217 shoots of various ages, mass prediction equations were built. Two equations were applied on the different inventories :(formule voir document ci-joint) (b : total woody mass : c : girth at breast height; HD : dominant height of the stand), for shoots higher than 1. 30 m, and : (formule voir document ci-joint) (h : height of the shoot) for shoots smaller than 1. 30 m.

The used model form guarantees that the simulated height development of individual trees is logically related to the <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> development of the stand.|$|R

For the analysis of environmental factors influence on the <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> growth pattern the covariance analysis was used. The covariance analysis indicated that the soil was the environmental factor responsible for the variation in the growth pattern in <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and that the variations in this pattern, occurred among clones and within the clone.

40|$|Key message Diachronic photogrammetric canopy height {{models can}} be used to {{quantify}} at a fine scale changes in <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and wood volume following storms. The regular renewal of aerial surveys makes this approach appealing for monitoring forest changes. -Context The increasing availability of aerial photographs and the development of dense matching algorithms open up new possibilities to assess the effects of storm events on forest canopies. -Aims The objective of this research is to assess the potential of diachronic canopy height models derived from photogrammetric point clouds (PCHM) to quantify changes in <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and wood volume of a broadleaved forest following a major storm. -Methods PCHMs derived from aerial photographs acquired before and after a storm event were calibrated using 25 field plots to estimate <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and volume using various modeling approaches. The calibrated models were combined with a reference damage maps to estimate both the withinstand damage variability, and the amount of volume impacted. -Results <b>Dominant</b> <b>height</b> was predicted with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4 %, and volume with RMSEs ranging from 24 to 32 % according to the type of model. The volume impacted by storm was in the range of 42 – 76 %. Overall, the maps of <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> changes provided more details about within-stand damage variability than conventional photointerpretation do. -Conclusion The study suggests a promising potential for exploiting PCHM in pursuit of a rapid localization and quantification of wind-throw damages, given an adapted sampling design to calibrate models.

40|$|Abstract Data from a {{fertilizer}} response {{study in}} loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations at different {{sites in the}} southeastern United States were used to develop response models for <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and basal area following midrotation nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization. Nonlinear regression models developed from the data predict total cumulative response {{as a function of}} the interaction of N and P application rates, drainage class of the site, stand conditions when fertilized, and time since fertilization. Stand variables that were found to be significant predictors of response included site index, age, basal area, number of surviving trees, and <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> at fertilization. <b>Dominant</b> <b>height</b> response was significantly greater on poorly drained sites than on other sites. Basal area response to P was significantly less on poorly drained sites and significantly greater on well drained sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigated}} the behavior of climatic variables inserted as inclination modifi ers of the Chapman-Richards model for estimating <b>dominant</b> <b>height.</b> Thus, 1507 data pairs from a Continuous Forestry Inventory of clonal eucalyptus stands were used. The stands {{are located in the}} States of Espírito Santo and southern Bahia. The climatic variables were inserted in the <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> model because the model is a key variable in the whole prognosis system. The models were adjusted using 1360 data pairs, where the rest of the data was reserved for model validation. The climatic variables were selected by using the Backward model construction method. The climatic variables indicated by the Backward method and inserted in the model were: mean monthly precipitation and solar radiation. The inclusion of climatic variables in the model resulted in a precision gain of 19. 8 % for <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> projection values when compared with the conventional model. The advantage of the method used in this study is the actualization of inventory data contemplating climatic history and productivity estimates in areas without prior plantation...|$|R
40|$|Chilimo {{forest is}} one of the few {{remnants}} of dry afro-montane mixed uneven aged natural forest located in Central Highlands of Ethiopia. Also it has been during the last century one of the most exploited and disturbed forest in the country. Stand density management diagram (SDMD) is a stand-level model that graphically illustrates the relationships between wood yield, density and mortality throughout all stages of stand development. SDMD is a useful tool for designing, displaying and evaluating alternative density management regimes for both even-aged and uneven-aged forest stands. However, information in this regard and other silvicultural management operations are lacking for most Ethiopian forests in general and Chilimo dry afro-montane forest in particular. The purpose of the study is to develop a SDMD model for the existing mixed natural forest using appropriate species proportion for Juniperus procera and Podocarpus falcatus. Two linear equations were simultaneously fitted to relate quadratic mean diameter with stand density and <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and relate it to total stand volume with quadratic mean diameter, stand density and <b>dominant</b> <b>height.</b> Moreover, <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> and quadratic <b>mean</b> diameter were found to be the best endogenous variables for SDMD for Chilimo forest. The relationship between stand density, <b>dominant</b> <b>height,</b> quadratic <b>mean</b> diameter and stand volume are represented in the SDMD graph. Formulating SDMD using species proportion is better than treating each species independently. This SDMD is the first diagram model developed for mixed-forest in Africa and it canbe servingfor sustainable management of Chilimo dry afro-montane forest in particular and other dry afro-montane forests in general.

40|$|Aiming at {{describing}} {{and modeling}} the morphometric {{relationships among the}} crown diameter, the crown percentage, {{the length of the}} crown exposed to light and the <b>height</b> of the <b>dominant</b> trees in stand of Pinus taeda L., one hundred and eighty seven sample units were studied considering the type proposed by Prodan, modified for twelve trees, distributed on good and bad stands. In each sample unit, two dominant trees were identified and the dimensions of the diameter at breast height, the total height, the crown lengths and the length of crown exposed to light and the crown diameter under eight rays were measured. Results allowed concluding that the crown diameter and the length of the crown exposed to light grow with the increase of the <b>dominant</b> <b>height,</b> and the two relationships can be described with good statistical precision by a curvilinear mathematical model.

40|$|Abstract. The Stand Density Control Diagram (SDCD) is {{an average}} stand-level model which is {{primarily}} used to derive density control schedules by management objective. One of its applications is to evaluate stand growth parameters {{at any time}} of stand development. The main objective of the present investigation is to examine a model of SDCD estimated for Austrian black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) plantations in Bulgaria with a representative validation data set and to illustrate its application for estimation of density, mean breast height diameter and stand stock. Equivalent mean diameter curves proved to be very good predictors for all studied growth parameters, having smaller relative errors than the Equivalent height curves. A result of practical importance is the insignificant difference between the direct (experimental <b>dominant</b> <b>height)</b> and the indirect (predicted <b>dominant</b> <b>height)</b> way of parameter estimation. Among all six examined ways of determination of the stand stock the Equivalent mean diameter curves based on the experimental values of basal area and <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> showed best performance. The proposed model of SDCD avoids some disadvantages of the existing growth and yield models and supplies a reliable method for estimation of the stand growth parameters...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous stand-level {{growth and}} yield models for Pinus sylvestris in {{north-east}} Spain were developed based on 21 {{permanent sample plots}} established in 1964 by the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agrarias (INIA). The plots ranged in site index from 13 to 26 m (<b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> at 100 years), and were measured an average of 5 times. The estimation data consisted of 79 growth periods of stands {{ranging in age from}} 36 to 132 years. Non-linear three-stage least squares method was used to simultaneously fit prediction and projection equations for stand basal area, volume and stand density. An existing model for <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> growth fitted with the same estimation data was used to project <b>dominant</b> <b>height.</b> The models were evaluated both quantita-tively and qualitatively. Correlation among error components of the prediction equations for basal area and vol-ume as well as the projection equations for number of trees per hectare and volume were strong and significant. The mean biases for basal area, volume and number of trees per hectare predictions were positive. The presented system of models can serve for forest-level management planning as a simple yield prediction system that re-quires only stand level input data...|$|R

Eighteen sites containing areas of both pasture and regenerating forest aged 6 - 79 years were selected from areas of steep, colluvial-covered slopes prone to shallow landslipping.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is presented {{for growth and}} yield of Cupressus lusitanica, Pinus radiata and Pinus patula growing in the highlands of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Malawi, based on permanent sample plot data. Stand <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> is predicted by a log/reciprocal function of age and site Index. Initial diameter distributions are predicted by spacing at a <b>dominant</b> <b>height</b> of 7 metres and generated by a Weibull function. The diameter distribution of stems is simulated by a vector of 10 cumulative percentiles which are incremented over each growth period by a function based on relative basal area, <b>dominant</b> <b>height,</b> and tree dominance. Relative basal area is {{defined in terms of}} maximum basal area, which. itself is modelled by a Chapman-Richards function in terms of <b>dominant</b> <b>height.</b> Dominance is defined as the ratio of tree diameter to stand dominant diameter. Thinnings are simulated by a novel and efficient algorithm that takes some trees from all size classes but is biassed to the smaller stems, although the degree of bias varies with thinning intensity. Tree volumes are determined by a new tree taper function using a quadratic/cosine model of relative height and relative sectional area. An algorithm is presented based on the taper function for subdividing stand volume into classes determined by log diameter and length. Validation of the model showed that diameter increment and height prediction, as well as the thinning routine were very accurate over a wide range of stand conditions; but the taper function was biassed towards underestimation of larger sizes and required re-fitting by a suitable method of weighting, whilst the initial distribution estimation required an additional variable to account for some of the variation occurring in practice. Two computer programs and a subroutine library are presented in the Appendix. VYTL- 2 is a program to produce variable yield tables; whilst PYMOD is a forecasting program for multicompartment forests. </p...|$|R
