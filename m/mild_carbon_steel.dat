50|$|Oxygen is used {{in small}} amounts as an {{addition}} to other gases; typically as 2-5% addition to argon. It enhances arc stability and reduces the surface tension of the molten metal, increasing wetting of the solid metal. It is used for spray transfer welding of <b>mild</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> low alloy and stainless steels. Its presence increases the amount of slag. Argon-oxygen (Ar-O2) blends are often being replaced with argon-carbon dioxide ones. Argon-carbon dioxide-oxygen blends are also used. Oxygen causes oxidation of the weld, {{so it is not}} suitable for welding aluminium, magnesium, copper, and some exotic metals. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-oxygen blends with 1-2% oxygen are used for austenitic stainless steel where argon-CO2 can not be used due to required low content of carbon in the weld; the weld has a tough oxide coating and may require cleaning.|$|R

The current design curves cannot cover the high-strength steel columns due to that the available curves were based on research of <b>mild</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> To study the overall buckling behavior of high-strength steel columns, an experimental investigation on the ultimate bearing capacity of weld box and H columns with a nominal yield stress of 690 MPa subjected to axial compression was carried out.

The specimens were tensile and fatigue tested pre and post exposure to brine. SEM and EDS analysis were carried out to examine the surface morphology and microstructure of the coatings. The specimens that were subjected to a corrosion environment {{for an extended period of}} three weeks failed at a lower tensile load than those that were not exposed to corrosive environment. Shear deformation of the adjacent zones at the coating-substrate interface resulted in the total failure of the coating. However, in some cases, the coating was almost free from voids or pores and was impervious to electrolytic or any other contaminants. This result was observed from tests performed on different sets of specimens to identify brine exposure effects on coating adherence to the substrate. Foreign materials were observed beneath the coating due to improper surface preparation during the specimen preparation prior to coating. From tensile tests results it was observed that the bond strength of the coating reduced due to corrosion effect which caused degradation of the coating adhesion to the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s surface.
