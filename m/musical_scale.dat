5|$|The Han applied {{mathematics}} to various diverse disciplines. In musical tuning, Jing Fang (78–37 BC) realized that 53 perfect fifths was approximate to 31 octaves while creating a <b>musical</b> <b>scale</b> of 60 tones, calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776 (the same value of 53 equal temperament {{discovered by the}} German mathematician Nicholas Mercator , i.e. 353/284).|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a <b>musical</b> <b>scale,</b> {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a leper.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a <b>musical</b> <b>scale.</b> Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

25|$|A pentatonic {{scale is}} a <b>musical</b> <b>scale</b> or mode with five notes per octave in {{contrast}} to a heptatonic (seven-note) scale such as the major scale and minor scale.

25|$|The {{system of}} contractions in English Braille {{begins with a}} set of 23 words which are {{contracted}} to single characters. Thus the word but is contracted to the single letter b, can to c, do to d, and so on.

50|$|Many other <b>musical</b> traditions use <b>scales</b> {{that include}} other intervals. These scales {{originate}} within the derivation of the harmonic series.

25|$|Popular Hawaiian {{music with}} English verse (hapa haole) can be {{described}} in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A <b>musical</b> <b>scale</b> that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.|$|E

25|$|The 1950s saw the {{emergence}} of free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or <b>musical</b> <b>scale,</b> {{as the basis of}} musical structure and improvisation. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.|$|E

500|$|A {{key feature}} of the song is Beck's {{innovative}} guitar playing. Shadwick comments it [...] "suited Beck's taste for shaping and sculpting guitar sounds through the control and manipulation of sustain and, on occasion, feedback". Beck recalled he began incorporating feedback into his guitar solos after he realised that he could control it, adding [...] "I started finding the resonant points on the neck where it came in best. [...] I loved {{it because it was}} a most peculiar sound that contrasted wildly with a plucked string, this round trombone-like noise coming from nowhere. [...] In addition to feedback, Beck's uses a <b>musical</b> <b>scale</b> and bent notes variously described as Eastern, Indian, or raga sounding. [...] Critics and biographers have called the solo [...] "monumental fuzz-drenched", [...] "explosively warped", and [...] "climaxed with a solitary, gigantic burst of feedback".
