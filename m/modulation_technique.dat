500|$|The SSEM's 32-bit {{word length}} was {{increased}} to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit words– known as pages– backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store. The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write head. Each track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2×32×40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase <b>modulation</b> <b>technique</b> still known today as Manchester coding.|$|E
2500|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} (AM) is a <b>modulation</b> <b>technique</b> used {{in electronic}} communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave.

[...] That waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a loudspeaker, or the light intensity of television pixels. [...] This technique contrasts with frequency modulation, in which the frequency of the carrier signal is varied, and phase modulation, in which its phase is varied.|$|E
