Misspecifications of the model might lead to biases in the estimates of preferences, that may influence the simulation results obtained from the model. In this paper we study to what extent predicted distributions of lifetime consumption are robust with respect to the specification of preferences. The simulation results show that simulated distributions of lifetime consumption strongly depend on the estimate of the intertemporal substitution rate {{as well as on the}} estimate of the time preference rate relative to the <b>marginal</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> net of taxes.

We study in particular how banks use different pieces of private and public information to screen firms and overcome informational asymmetries in the credit market.

The cost of credit is measured using overdrafts, the most expensive line of credit, at the bank that charges the highest rate for overdrafts. We find that the cost of credit is smaller for a firm with a close relationship to the marginal bank. Firms with large assets, a high sales/assets ratio, and a low debt/assets ratio pay a lower interest rate at the margin.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between stock market performance and economic growth in Nigeria. It utilized the bounds testing co-integration procedure also known as autoregressive distributed lag estimation procedure. The empirical model combined key stock market indicators and some traditional macroeconomic variables to estimate the hypothesized relationship in the study. It found that in the long-run, overall output in the Nigerian economy is less sensitive to changes in stock market capitalization as well as the average dividend yield thereby casting doubt on the ability of the Nigerian stock market in its present level of development to serve as a barometer for measuring or predicting the overall health of the Nigerian economy as well as its direction over the long-run horizon. The other major finding in the study is that the long-run growth of the Nigerian economy is highly sensitive to <b>marginal</b> variations in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> which is suggestive that macroeconomic variables in the country are at present more useful in shaping the long-run direction of the Nigerian economy...|$|R
