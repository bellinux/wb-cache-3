25|$|In late June 1941 Owen was {{discharged}} from the AIF and began work at Lysaght who manufactured his gun. In September 1941 his gun was ready for testing against similar weapons; the American Thompson Machine Gun, the Sten and the German Bergmann. The Owen proved superior to the other weapons and having been variously immersed in water, <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> it also proved itself almost impossible to jam while the other weapons faltered and eventually became unworkable. As {{a result of the}} success of the trials, the initial order of 100 firearms was increased to 2,000. After further difficulties, the Owen gun entered mass production in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The bedrock at McConnells Mill State Park {{was formed}} over 300,000,000 {{years ago as}} layers of peat, <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> were compressed. This part of Pennsylvania was a coastal area at the time. The layers of bedrock were built into {{mountains}} as the continental plates shifted. The layers of bedrock had different strengths. Some of the layers eroded quickly and others eroded at a much slower pace. The various erosion rates account for the variety of geologic features at McConnells Mill State Park. The geology of the park was also heavily influenced by the glacial effects of the ice age: a large glacial lake (water that was {{held in place by}} a glacier), broke about 140,000 years ago. This break in the glacial dam caused a dramatic change in the flow of the water. The lake that had previously drained in a northward direction was now draining to the south. The drastic change in direction and very high volume of water flow created Slippery Rock Creek Gorge.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of Law Number 16/2012 allowed Pindad {{to create the}} Komodo to their advantage, in which the law stipulates Indonesia to have local content used in the manufacturing of its defense products with international cooperation. The Komodo was designed in Pindad's Bandung, West Java manufacturing facility with a price tag of about USD$300,000. According to Pindad, the Komodo's monocoque armored body is bulletproof and it can withstand 7.62mm or lower caliber rifle and handgun bullets. The Komodo's glass is also made bulletproof. The Komodo's turbo intercooler diesel engine has a total horsepower of 215 PS at 2500 rpm, allowing the vehicle to achieve the weight ratio of around 30hp/ton. The Komodo can carry up to 200liters of diesel fuel. The vehicle only has a manual transmission system, which consists of 6 forward and 1 reverse gear, allowing the Komodo to have off-road capabilities. President Avianto said that the normal cruising range of the Komodo is at 450kilometers, with an average speed of 70km/h. The Komodo's off-road capabilities have been tested in various conditions ranging from mountainous terrain to <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{rocks of}} the area are mostly mudstone, {{deposited}} in a deep ocean basin some 450 million years ago. Very few fossils {{are found in the}} rocks because the sediments were deposited in such deep water. Associated locally with the mudstone are beds of hard sandstone (turbidites); at Poppit Sands these beds are up to a metre or two thick. Deposited as <b>muds</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> on the ocean floor, they were subsequently squeezed and folded by major earth movements, which changed the mudstones into slates. [...] Excellent examples of these folded rocks can be seen at the western end of Poppit Sands.|$|R
50|$|There are broadly four feeding styles {{employed}} by the sandpipers, although many species are flexible and may use more than one style. The first is pecking with occasional probing, usually done by species in drier habitats {{that do not have}} soft soils or <b>mud.</b> The second, <b>and</b> most frequent, method employed is probing soft soils, <b>muds</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> for prey. The third, used by Tringa shanks, involves running in shallow water with the bill under the water chasing fish, a method that uses sight as well as tactile senses. The final method, {{employed by}} the phalaropes and some Calidris sandpipers, involves pecking at the water for small prey.|$|R
500|$|A {{flood plain}} crossed by {{rivers and lakes}} {{developed}} in the area. <b>Mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand</b> accumulated in this setting to become the gray sandstones and mudstones of the Kaiparowits Formation.

Ashclough, a 50 800 mÂ² site which comprises the steep banks of the river between Prestolee and Little Lever, has been designated an SSSI because of its geological interest, primarily because it is the best site in the area displaying the Ashclough marine band and its associated strata.

2500|$|The Hayward {{fault is}} {{considered}} to be particularly dangerous due to the poor soil conditions in the alluvial plain that drops from the East Bay Hills to the eastern shoreline of San Francisco Bay. At the lower elevations near the bay the soil is mostly water saturated <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> <b>sand,</b> placed in the early 20th century as fill in marsh areas. This soil tends to [...] amplify the effects of an earthquake and so producing significantly greater ground motion. Additionally, the soil itself can fail, turning into a liquid mud from the agitation, a mud unable to support buildings erected upon once-firm soil. This region is also covered with dense low-rise urban development, most of which was built soon after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and long before even moderately earthquake resistant construction practices had been developed in the late 1920s.|$|E

50|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{start when}} something, for example an earthquake (or just the inherent instability of newly deposited sediments), triggers sediments {{to be pushed}} {{over the edge of}} the continental shelf and down the continental slope, creating a submarine landslide. A dense slurry of <b>muds</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> accelerates towards the foot of the slope until the gradient levels off and the turbidity current slows. The slowing current has a reduced ability to transport sediments and deposition of the coarser grains begins, creating a submarine fan. The current continues to slow down as it moves towards the continental rise until it reaches the level bottom of the ocean. This final result is a series of graded sediments of <b>sand,</b> silt <b>and</b> <b>mud</b> <b>and</b> these are known as turbidites, as described by the Bouma sequence.|$|R
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the <b>muds</b> <b>and</b> <b>sands</b> are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|R
