500|$|Due to his non-ideal size as a pitcher, {{some have}} seen issues in Loup's stamina and durability. His pitches can also {{come across as}} [...] "a bit too hittable." [...] He is, however, {{especially}} effective when pitching against left-handed batters. In 2013, Loup was viewed by the Blue Jays' manager John Gibbons as [...] "not necessarily a long guy; he's more a situational, one-inning guy." [...] Despite his shortcomings, Loup has the lowest walk rate among all major league pitchers who have pitched at least seventy innings since 2012, having walked only 2.6% of the batters he has faced. His consistency and endurance have made Loup the Blue Jays' most-used reliever, and he says [...] "I'm {{one of those guys}} that if my body would let <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> pitch every day." ...|$|E
500|$|When Wilson asked Congress {{to declare}} war on Germany in April 1917, Taft was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter; Taft {{was chairman of the}} American Red Cross' executive committee, occupying much of the former president's time. He took leave from Yale to be co-chairman of the National War Labor Board, tasked with assuring industrial peace. In February 1918, the new RNC chairman, Will H. Hays, approached Taft seeking his reconciliation with Roosevelt. In May, Taft was in Chicago at the Blackstone Hotel, and when he heard that Roosevelt and his party were dining there, walked in on them. [...] The two men embraced to the applause of the room, but the renewed relationship did not progress past outward friendliness before Roosevelt's death in January 1919. Taft later wrote, [...] "Had he died in a hostile state of mind toward <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have mourned the fact all my life. I loved him always and cherish his memory." ...|$|E

All you can look for is a little respect when you come home." [...] An alternative story is told by Redding's friend and road manager, Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Sims, who states that the song [...] "came from a group I was singing with", and that even though Redding rewrote it, [...] "a lot of the lyric was still there"; Sims adds: [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get a credit, but I never did". [...] Sims also states that he sang the backing chorus of [...] "Hey hey hey". The song used for the fifth track, [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long", had been previously recorded in mono with Booker T. Jones on piano and released as a single in April 1965, becoming a number-two hit on Billboards R chart; it was rerecorded in stereo for the album.|$|E
500|$|According to Ranaut, she was [...] "stubborn and rebellious" [...] {{while growing}} up: [...] "If {{my father would}} gift my brother a plastic gun and get a doll for <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not accept that. I {{questioned}} the discrimination." [...] She did not subscribe to the stereotypes that were expected of her and experimented with fashion from a young age, often pairing up accessories and clothes that would seem [...] "bizarre" [...] to her neighbours. Ranaut was educated at the DAV School in Chandigarh, where she pursued science as her core subject, remarking that she was [...] "very studious" [...] and [...] "always paranoid about [...] results". She initially intended {{to become a doctor}} on the insistence of her parents. However, a failed unit test in chemistry during her twelfth grade led Ranaut to reconsider her career prospects and despite preparing for the All India Pre Medical Test, she did not turn up for the exam. Determined to find her [...] "space and freedom", she relocated to Delhi at the age of sixteen. Her decision not to pursue medicine led to constant feuding with her parents and her father refused to sponsor a pursuit he considered to be aimless.|$|E
500|$|The war had a {{significant}} influence on Moore's life - he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because [...] "there {{was no one else}} for me... second best is no good for <b>me...</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be." [...] In his autobiography he said that after sixty years he still thought about her, and because of her death [...] "if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down." [...] In May 2012 he said to the Radio Times magazine, [...] "We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance". He also said, in the same interview, that [...] "The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut." [...] However, some doubt has arisen over Moore's account, as researchers have been unable to identify Lorna, despite the meticulous records kept of wartime civilian casualties.|$|E

500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that actor Matt Damon would guest star on 30 Rock.

In December 2009, prior to the confirmation of his first guest appearance, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he {{was at the top of}} Fey's guest star wish list for the show. A fan of the series, Damon replied [...] "I would do [...] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people—or even better me. Or I could call her. Let's make this happen."

500|$|In March 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Disney had greenlit the third film with Hedlund reprising his role as Sam and Kosinski returning to direct the sequel. Wilde {{was revealed}} in April to be returning as Quorra. Filming was expected to start in Vancouver in October 2015. However, in May 2015, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Walt Disney Studios had chosen not to continue with a third installment, which was confirmed by Wilde the following month. In the end of July, Boxleitner stated he frequently heard about the pre-production of Tron 3 while shooting Cedar Cove in Vancouver, and was disappointed to hear about the cancellation. While expressing the opinion that Disney decided to [...] "play it safe" [...] and explore other properties, Boxleitner said that this broke his interest in continuing with the franchise, as [...] "it's been too up and down for <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather not just keep going. I don’t want to repeat my career anymore." [...] In September 2015, Hedlund stated that he was told that the third Tron film was not [...] "totally dead", but jokingly suggested that it could be released 30 years later, referencing the near 30-year gap between the first film and Legacy.|$|E

500|$|Diarra {{began the}} 2001–02 season {{by making the}} bench {{in several of the}} team's league matches in August and September, but failing to make an appearance. In October 2001, he was dropped back down to the club's reserve team and {{appeared}} in four matches before earning promotion back to the senior team for its 2001 Intercontinental Cup showdown with Argentine club Boca Juniors. Diarra made the bench for the match, but did not feature as Bayern won the match courtesy of an extra time goal from Samuel Kuffour. The victory gave Diarra his first major honour of his career. Afterwards, he returned to the reserve team and later suffered an injury, which required a lengthy absence. Diarra rejoined the team in March 2002 under new manager Hermann Gerland and made nine more appearances. Following the season, Diarra was offered a new three-year contract with the club, but rejected it citing his limited playing time. Despite his disappointing stint with Bayern, which included failing to make an appearance with the club's senior team, in 2009, Diarra stated [...] "I have very fond memories of my time in Bayern". Following Diarra's success at Bordeaux, Bayern's general manager Uli Hoeneß admitted that Diarra's rise to prominence as a footballer is [...] "one of the seven wonders of the world". Hoeneß admitted that he was surprised by Diarra's resurgence stating [...] "If somebody had told me [...] five years ago and made a bet with <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have lost a fortune". Since Diarra departing the club in 2002, due to FIFA compensation laws, Bayern have recouped over €800,000 {{as a result of the}} player's future transfers.|$|E
500|$|Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell {{writes that}} it was Ditko who noted the {{similarities}} to the Fly. Ditko recalled that, [...] "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that [...] "ays later, Stan told <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan's synopsis". It {{was at this point}} that the nature of the strip changed. [...] "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained". Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, a premise Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as [...] "the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko states, [...] "I still don't know whose idea was Spider-Man". Kirby noted in a 1971 interview {{that it was}} Ditko who [...] "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did". Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, has acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, [...] "If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [...] ". He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus more easily identify with the character. Writer Al Nickerson believes [...] "that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created the Spider-Man that we are familiar with today [...] ultimately, Spider-Man came into existence, and prospered, through the efforts of not just one or two, but many, comic book creators".|$|E
500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time and get it over with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E

It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1999, the Democratic polling firm Schroth and Associates {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} 400 Reform Party leaders and found Trump tied for third place for the Reform Party presidential nomination. [...] Both the Reform Party and Trump denied having commissioned the poll. Days later, Newsweek raised speculation when it cited an unnamed [...] "close friend" [...] of Trump who said Trump was [...] "toying" [...] {{with the idea of}} a presidential campaign, allegedly in response to rumors of Ventura's courting of Weicker for a run. [...] Trump purportedly held a grudge against Weicker for blocking his plans to build a casino in Bridgeport in 1994. [...] The two had an exchange of insults in which Weicker labeled Trump a [...] "dirt bag" [...] and Trump referred to Weicker as [...] "a fat slob who couldn't get elected dog catcher." [...] In response to the Newsweek report, Trump sent out a press release in which he criticized the two party system, praised the Reform Party, and stated [...] "If the Reform Party nominated <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably run and probably win." [...] However, he added that if the party nominated him, he would ask for [...] "an immediate recount." [...] In an interview, he told The New York Times, [...] "I'm honored and I'm flattered , but the fact is I've never had more fun than I'm having right now, building the most spectacular buildings in New York." [...] Chairman Verney denied that the Reform Party had any interest in Trump, explaining that party members had [...] "never spent one second thinking about him." [...] A CNN-Time poll conducted later in July showed Trump with seven percent support nationally in a match up against Republican candidate George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
