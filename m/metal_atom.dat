5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a halide atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the study}} of the vapor {{deposition}} of <b>metal</b> <b>atoms</b> onto long-chain alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (CnSH-SAMs, n> 10) on Au(111) substrate, <b>metal</b> <b>atoms</b> with different diameters can penetrate selectively into the CnSH-SAMs or not, which looks like the “size exclusion effect”. In this paper, we proposed a new mechanism for the <b>metal</b> <b>atoms</b> penetration by establishing a simple ideal penetration model of the long-chain CnSH-SAMs with defect-free structure on Au(111). The intrinsic and regular–distributed channels with ∼ 3 Å diameters (which are decided by the framework size of the three-aggregate of the CnSH molecules) were deduced. This new penetration mechanism can explain reasonably the selective penetration of <b>metal</b> <b>atoms</b> into the long-chain CnSH-SAMs on Au(111) : When the driving force is applied, the <b>metal</b> <b>atoms</b> with diameter smaller than 3 Å will overcome the van der Waals interaction among the neighboring hydrocarbon chains and penetrate into the CnSH-SAMs through the ∼ 3 Å channels reaching to the surface of Au(111), while the <b>metal</b> <b>atoms</b> with large diameter (> 3 Å) can not penetrate...|$|R

25|$|In {{complexation}} reactions, several ligands {{react with}} a <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> {{to form a}} coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central <b>metal</b> <b>atom</b> can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory.
