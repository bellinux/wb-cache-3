It is most often regarded {{as a kind of}} <b>marginal</b> <b>enterprise</b> to be offered by a faculty member who has some side-interest in these matters as a relief from the more serious social, economic and cultural questions with which History is properly concerned. This is, of course, not a new phenomenon. It is, quite to the contrary, a tradition which stretches back to the very beginning of history as an academic discipline in the 19 th century.

40|$|If {{there is}} one field within the study of {{international}} affairs where progress has undeniably been made {{over the past two}} decades, it surely is the study of human rights, which has grown from a <b>marginal</b> <b>enterprise</b> in which only a few scholars were engaged to a full-blown subfield of international affairs that attracts some of the most talented scholars publishing in the most prestigious outlets. Kathryn Sikkink and Emilie Hafner-Burton have each made remarkable contri-butions to our knowledge in this field. Sikkink’s work, especially Activists Beyond Borders (Keck and Sikkink 1998) and the Power of Human Rights (Risse-Kappen, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), continues to have an enormous influence on how scholars theorize about human rights and on how they design their case studies. Emilie Hafner-Burton has become, along with Beth Simmons, the most prolific human rights scholar primarily (though not exclusively) using quantitative methods. Now both scholars have written books that are aimed not just at academic audi-ences but also at policymakers and the educated public. Both books do a majesti...|$|E

40|$|Why, at {{the onset}} of a {{downturn}} in economic activity and an upswing in unemployment (in the early 2000 ’s), did the leading trade unions in Germany decide to demand-and in some cases strike for- larger wage increases and denounce a government-led policy of wage moderation, rather than strengthen their adherence to such a policy? Two (related) explanations of this apparently nonrational behavior were offered by German unionists at an informal conference on union policy-making in Germany, Japan, and the U. S. In the first place, it was claimed that at the grass roots union members might be expected to accept wage restraint only if they are convinced that they would be punished for failure to do so (e. g. to accept subcontract wages in <b>marginal</b> <b>enterprises)</b> or if acceptance would be virtually certain to ensure reward in the form of increased job security and employment (e. g. by the adoption of more expansionist fiscal or monetary policies). And second, some of the union participants at the conference claimed that the failure of real wages to grow as rapidly as productivity tends to engender feelings of unfair on inequitable treatment among unionists, which, if allowed to persist, could override the requirements of rational self-interest in pursuing wage policies aimed solely at maximizing the net wealth of the membership...|$|R
40|$|This study uses {{a variety}} of {{indicators}} such as patent grants, new product sales and R&D spending to examine the spatial patterns of industrial innovation in China during the 1990 s. It is found that industrial innovation in China has been concentrated in the coastal areas, and the spatial concentration has been increasing in the 1990 s, which is contrary to what Sun (2000) found on the patterns of all patent applications in 1985 to 1995. The study also reveals that large and medium-sized enterprises in China have experienced a switch in their modes of innovative behaviours in the late 1990 s: from more spending on imported technologies to more in-house R&D; though expenditure on absorbing imported technologies has been <b>marginal.</b> Finally, <b>enterprises</b> are not well integrated with independent R&D institutes regarding their R&D efforts, which indicates that the national innovation system in China is still fragmented.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{classification}} of credit markets in transition economies. It describes {{a continuum of}} systems by identifying its polar cases: countries where the entire financial system still relies on outside money, mostly republics of the former Soviet Union; and those where a more decentralized intermediation system is developing (Central/Eastern Europe). We believe that different outcomes of financial reform depend on several factors, such as initial macroeconomic conditions and a differential ability of enterprises to restructure. However, we submit that the major element is the different degree of institutional development. Our thesis is that outside money continues to dominate in circumstances when decentralized enforcement of credit is unreliable. The inability to enforce credit conditions is a more basic challenge than the scarcity of ability to assess creditworthiness (although serious in itself). As a result, there is no reintermediation of private savings, and the central bank remains the lender of first resort. The resulting money creation potentially leads to hyperinflation and capital flight, which further compromise {{the development of a}} private intermediation circuit. Ultimately, firms are induced to capture the banking sector, and more generally to build lobbying power to attract refinancing credit. In the latter system, macroeconomic stabilization has largely succeed: enforcement of credit obligations is more effective, permitting more decentralized credit decisions. However, the burden of non-performing loans, worsened by high real interest rates caused by stabilization, produces moral hazard in lending decisions. Banks have a perverse incentive to direct funding towards their former debtors, financing less efficient projects. The result is further concentration of loan portfolios, an overall lower productivity of investment and a greater concentration of risk in the transition phase. Finally, we identify an intermediate stage of transition in which decentralized credit is still not fully reliable, as it may be extended collusively to uncreditworthy borrowers. As restructuring is costly for many enterprises, and impossible for value-subtractors, a tight outside money policy subtracts more liquidity than the corporate sector can generate by internal restructuring. <b>Marginal</b> <b>enterprises</b> may then resist restructuring by extending unenforceable trade credit, recognizing that other firms will do the same. As a result, trade credit is plentiful and rapidly turns into arrears, and the probability of a collective rescue increases with the prospect of an output collapse driven by illiquidity. A collective bailout then validate the enterprises' view of private credit as nonbinding, and refocuses the system around flows of refinancing credit...|$|R
40|$|The author {{deals with}} the costs and {{benefits}} of globalisation. He also gives a simple explanation of the core economic forces behind the globalisation. The current technical development favours the decline of the fixed coordination costs of the multinational enterprises and this opens up the possibility for the enterprise to utilize the lower marginal costs elsewhere on the globe. The optimal degree of globalisation depends on the interplay between the fixed coordination costs and local marginal costs. Even though globalisation brings also costs in addition to benefits, the critics should remember, that any structural economic change tends to cause adjustment costs.

40|$|Significant {{changes in}} the {{insurance}} and financial markets are giv-ing increasing attention {{to the need for}} developing a standard frame-work for risk management. Today’s competitive and investment ori-ented marketplace requires from insurance directors to use all the ad-vantages of investing risk capitals of their enterprises. Recently, there has been growing interest among insurance and investment experts to focus on the use of a tail conditional expectation as a measure of risk, since it shares properties that are considered desirable and applicable in a variety of situations. In particular, such a method allows for a natural allocation of the total risk capital among its various con-stituents. This paper examines above risk measure {{in the case of a}} multivariate gamma portfolio. We demonstrate the explicit formulas for tail conditional expectation and based on it capital allocation when the proposed multivariate model consists of dependent and indepen-dent gamma <b>marginals.</b> Financial <b>enterprises</b> are always concerned of fairly allocating the total risk capital to these constituents. Conse-quently, this work is particularly meaningful in practice in the case of computing capital requirements for an institution who may have several lines of correlated business and whose data is distributed mul-tivariate gamma model considered here. ...|$|R
40|$|Within optimal {{investment}} programs, {{the accumulation}} of capital is a stable function of marginal q. Much of the interest in q, however, derives from its potential to reflect the demand for capital when the optimal program changes. If the marginal return on capital diminishes as capital increases, the correspondence between marginal q and the optimal stock of capital can shift whenever investors alter their assessments of prospective economic rents. At such times, marginal q even could rise as the optimal stock of capital falls. In general, robust investment functions express optimal investment in terms of those variables that determine marginal q, rather than marginal q itself. However, under some restrictions (e. g. price-taking <b>enterprises),</b> <b>marginal</b> q may be sufficient to determine the optimal accumulation of capital even as the program changes. The conditions that make marginal q a sufficient statistic also make q a sufficient statistic. Capital...|$|R
40|$|I {{present a}} unified {{theoretical}} framework that attributes output collapse to price liberalization and decentralization of the formerly integrated monopolistic industrial {{structure in the}} former Soviet bloc, and output expansion in China to marginal marketization and intramarginal regulation. In the model economy, all industries are interdependent in that they rely on each other for intermediate inputs. This circular dependence {{in the presence of}} imperfect competition creates a pecuniary externality in the sense that a price increase or an output reduction by one industry raises other industries' costs and reduces their intermediate demands. Under central planning, the industries are fully integrated, allowing the state to internalize the externality. Big bang reform decentralizes the state monopolized industrial structure. Price or quantity competition among decentralized, concentrated, and circularly dependent industries leads, in a Nash equilibrium, to reduced output, lower profits, and higher prices. The controlled reform in China, however, regulates enterprises intramarginally by forcing them to fulfill planned output quotas at planned prices, and liberalizes only marginally by allowing them to sell above-the-quota outputs at market prices. While the intramarginal regulation reduces the effect of the externality, the <b>marginal</b> liberalization encourages <b>enterprises</b> to produce beyond the quotas. Enterprise-level panel data from China are used to test the theory. ...|$|R

Globalization is a development of interaction and mixing among the people, corporations, and governments of different nations, a process driven by international trade and investment. In the present globalization economy impact the cross-culture management issues are readily apparent in international joint ventures, and often feature in examinations of joint ventures involving China in particular.
