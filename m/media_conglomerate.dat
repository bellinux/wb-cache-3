5|$|The Sundance Channel, {{which was}} {{partially}} owned by <b>media</b> <b>conglomerate</b> Viacom, divided TransGenerations production cost with Logo TV, an LGBT-themed cable channel that Viacom {{was preparing to}} launch. Sundance assumed most of the cost. The companies planned for Sundance to air the show first, followed by Logo several months later. One reason why they aired the series on both channels was because Sundance and Logo had distinct target audiences.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Billboard Publications {{was sold}} to a Dutch <b>media</b> <b>conglomerate,</b> Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen (VNU), for $220 million. VNU {{acquired}} the Clio Awards in advertising and the National Research Group in 1997, as well as Editor & Publisher in 1999. In July 2000, it paid $650 million for the publisher Miller Freeman. BPI was combined with other entities in VNU in 2000 to form Bill Communications Inc. By the time that CEO Gerald Hobbs retired in 2003, VNU had grown substantially larger, {{but it had a}} large amount of debt from the acquisitions. An attempted $7 billion acquisition of IMS Health in 2005 prompted protests from shareholders that halted the deal. It eventually agreed to an $11 billion takeover bid from investors in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The {{growth of}} <b>media</b> <b>conglomerates</b> in the U.S. since the 1980s has been {{accompanied}} by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded [...] "that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves". The empirical evidence for {{this is consistent with the}} conflicts of interest between the revenue sources for the <b>media</b> <b>conglomerates</b> and the mythology of an unbiased, dispassionate media: [...] advertisers have reduced their spending with media that reported too many unfavorable details. The major <b>media</b> <b>conglomerates</b> have found ways to retain their audience without the risks of offending advertisers inherent in investigative journalism.|$|R

5|$|In 2007 Hareide {{announced}} that he had left politics for the time being to pursue a career in the national <b>media</b> <b>conglomerate</b> Schibsted, as an organizational director. His career in the company started with the position of trainee in 1997. Outside politics, his only paid full-time appointments have been in Schibsted. He still works behind the scenes for his party, occasionally commenting on issues in the national media. He did not rule out a return to national politics in the future, and in late 2008 he was selected by his party as the top candidate on the party's ticket in Akershus county. The Christian Democratic Party formerly held a seat in this county, but lost it in 2005. Hareide has never lived in Akershus. Party leader Dagfinn Høybråten hails from Akershus, but he runs on the Rogaland ticket to secure a safe seat.|$|E

Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German <b>media</b> <b>conglomerate</b> Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his <b>media</b> <b>conglomerate</b> from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E

2500|$|Burger {{wrote to}} {{emphasize}} the difficulty in differentiating media corporations from other corporate entities.

Thus, Burger concluded that [...] "no factual distinction has been identified as yet that would justify government restraints on the right of appellants to express their views without, at the same time, opening the door to similar restraints on <b>media</b> <b>conglomerates</b> with their vastly greater influence". Burger pointed out that as newspapers merged with global <b>media</b> <b>conglomerates,</b> separating corporations from media had become untenable. Therefore, Burger argued, restrictions on speech such as the Massachusetts statute necessitated a great deal of caution. [...] "In short," [...] Burger wrote, [...] "the First Amendment does not 'belong' to any definable category of persons or entities: it belongs to all who exercise its freedoms." ...|$|R
