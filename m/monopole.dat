5|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>monopole</b> objection {{was raised}} in the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as magnetic monopoles. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, {{in the same way that}} it drives the geometry to flatness.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic <b>monopole</b> problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} ADHMN {{construction}} for SU(N) <b>monopoles</b> {{and show that}} a particular simplification arises in studying charge N - 1 <b>monopoles</b> with minimal symmetry breaking. Using this we construct families of tetrahedrally symmetric SU(4) and SU(5) <b>monopoles.</b> In the moduli space approximation, the SU(4) one-parameter family describes a novel dynamics where the <b>monopoles</b> never separate, but rather, a tetrahedron deforms to its dual. We find a two-parameter family of SU(5) tetrahedral <b>monopoles</b> and compute some geodesics in this submanifold numerically. The dynamics is rich, with the <b>monopoles</b> scattering either once or twice through octahedrally symmetric configurations...|$|R

40|$|We study {{radiative}} parton {{energy loss}} in an expanding quark-gluon plasma with magnetic <b>monopoles.</b> We find that for realistic number density of thermal <b>monopoles</b> obtained in lattice simulations parton rescatterings on <b>monopoles</b> can considerably enhance energy loss for plasma produced in $AA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. However, contrary to previous expectations, <b>monopoles</b> do {{not lead to}} the surface dominance of energy loss. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
25|$|Some {{condensed}} matter systems {{propose a}} structure superficially {{similar to a}} magnetic <b>monopole,</b> known as a flux tube. The ends of a flux tube form a magnetic dipole, but since they move independently, they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic <b>monopole</b> quasiparticles. Since 2009, numerous news reports from the popular media have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles, but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another.|$|E

25|$|Since Dirac's paper, several {{systematic}} <b>monopole</b> searches {{have been}} performed. Experiments in 1975 and 1982 produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but are now regarded as inconclusive.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue why the number and the {{location}} of magnetic <b>monopoles</b> detected on lattice configurations are gauge dependent, in contrast with the physical expectation that <b>monopoles</b> have a gauge invariant status. By use of the Non-Abelian Bianchi Identities we show that <b>monopoles</b> are gauge invariant, but the efficiency of the technique usually adopted to detect them depends on the choice of the gauge in a well understood way. In particular we have studied a class of gauges which interpolates between the Maximal Abelian gauge, where all <b>monopoles</b> are observed, and the Landau gauge, where all <b>monopoles</b> escape detection. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{prove that}} the space of SU(2) {{hyperbolic}} <b>monopoles</b> based at the centre of hyperbolic space is homeomorphic to the space of (unbased) rational maps of the two-sphere. The homeomorphism extends to {{a map of the}} natural compactifications of the two spaces. We also show that the scattering methods used in the study of <b>monopoles</b> apply to the configuration space for hyperbolic <b>monopoles</b> giving a homotopy equivalence of this space with the space of continuous self-maps of the two-sphere. AMS classification: 81 T 13, 53 C 07, 55 P 10 1 Introduction. It has long been known that moduli spaces of <b>monopoles</b> and holomorphic maps of the two-sphere are intimately related. In [1, 2] Atiyah introduced the space of hyperbolic <b>monopoles</b> showing that for integral mass the space of charge k SU(2) <b>monopoles</b> based at infinity is isomorphic to the space of degree k based holomorphic self-maps of the two-sphere. His approach was to identify hyperbolic <b>monopoles</b> as instantons over the four-sphere invariant under [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The Strouhal {{relationship}} {{suggests that}} the jet Mach number and the ratio of effective pipe length to the edge distance are important in a first approximation. Normal pipe operation would be a <b>monopole</b> sound source in Stage I with Class III feedback.|$|E
25|$|The dipole aspects {{are also}} {{relatively}} fixed. The jet orifice dimension {{and the distance}} to the edge, h is fixed. Although the jet speed U can vary, the fluid mechanical Strouhal number is relatively constant and normally operates in Stage I. When there is phase coherent gain of the two aspects, they operate as Class III <b>monopole</b> sources. The efficiency of the <b>monopole</b> radiation is considerably greater than that of the dipole so the dipole pattern is noticed, The details of system gain and interaction between these two dynamic systems is yet to be fully uncovered. It is a testimony to the skills of early instrument makers {{that they were able to}} achieve the right port sizes and positions for a given note without scientific measurement instruments.|$|E

40|$|We report Dirac <b>monopoles</b> with polar-core vortex {{induced by}} spin-orbit {{coupling}} in ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensates, which {{are attached to}} two nodal vortex lines along the vertical axis. These <b>monopoles</b> are more stable in the time scale of experiment and can be detected through directly imaging vortex lines. When the strength of spin-orbit coupling increases, Dirac <b>monopoles</b> with vortex can be transformed into those with square lattice. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, increasing the strength of interaction can induce a cyclic phase transition from Dirac <b>monopoles</b> with polar-core vortex to those with Mermin-Ho vortex. The spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates not only provide a new unique platform for investigating exotic <b>monopoles</b> and relevant phase transitions, but also can preserve stable <b>monopoles</b> after a quadrupole field is turned off.

50|$|High energy {{particle}} colliders {{have been}} used to try to create magnetic <b>monopoles.</b> Due to the conservation of magnetic charge, magnetic <b>monopoles</b> must be created in pairs, one north and one south. Due to conservation of energy, only magnetic <b>monopoles</b> with masses less than the center of mass energy of the colliding particles can be produced. Beyond this, very little is known theoretically about the creation of magnetic <b>monopoles</b> in high energy particle collisions. This is due to their large magnetic charge, which invalidates all the usual calculational techniques. As a consequence, collider based searches for magnetic <b>monopoles</b> cannot, as yet, provide lower bounds on the mass of magnetic <b>monopoles.</b> They can however provide upper bounds on the probability (or cross section) of pair production, as a function of energy.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{characteristic}} speed U and sound speed are essentially the same, {{it can be}} rewritten as the second equation. This equation has the same structure as the one for the point <b>monopole</b> shown above. Although the amplitude factor A replaces the dimensionless volumetric flow rate in these equations, the speed dependence strongly confirms the monopole-like characteristics of the Hartmann whistle. A cousin to the Hartmann whistle {{is shown in the}} figure on the right, the Galton whistle. Here the cavity is excited by an annular jet which oscillates symmetrically around the sharp edges of the cavity. It appears to be a circular version of the edge tone (discussed below) in which the symmetry of the otherwise dipole source of the edge tone is converted to a <b>monopole</b> source.|$|E
