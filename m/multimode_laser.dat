5000|$|A {{spatial filter}} is an optical device which uses the {{principles}} of Fourier optics to alter {{the structure of a}} beam of light or other electromagnetic radiation, typically coherent laser light. Spatial filtering is commonly used to [...] "clean up" [...] the output of lasers, removing aberrations in the beam due to imperfect, dirty, or damaged optics, or due to variations in the laser gain medium itself. This filtering can be applied to transmit a pure transverse mode from a <b>multimode</b> <b>laser</b> while blocking other modes emitted from the optical resonator. The term [...] "filtering" [...] indicatesthat the desirable structural features of the original source pass through the filter, while the undesirable features are blocked.Apparatus which follows the filter effectively sees a higher-quality but lower-powered image of the source, instead of the actual source directly. An example of the use of spatial filter can be seen in advanced setup of micro-Raman spectroscopy.|$|E
40|$|In analog RF fiber-optic (FO) {{links with}} {{directly}} modulated <b>multimode</b> <b>laser</b> diodes (LD's), nonlinear distortions of the received modulation signal occur due to fiber dispersion. Using a simple analytical two mode model, {{we show that}} the mutual compensation of strong nonlinearities between particular modes breaks down at high-modulation frequencies. The effect can be observed even in 1300 -nm links with single-mode (SM) standard fibers. Simulations as well as measurements of intermodulation (IM) illustrate this argument.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{spontaneous}} emission {{on the threshold}} characteristics of <b>multimode</b> <b>laser</b> oscillators with mixed line broadening are considered in detail. Most previous studies of <b>multimode</b> <b>laser</b> operation have emphasized the two limits of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. With homogeneous broadening {{there is a tendency}} for oscillation in a single longitudinal mode, while in the inhomogeneous limit oscillation over much of the gain spectrum is expected. All practical lasers are somewhere between these limits, and this study explores the mode characteristics of lasers with mixed line broadening. Special attention is given to the important practical case of semiconductor diode lasers, and band‐to‐band absorption is fully included...|$|E
40|$|The {{turn-on delay}} time jitter of four {{different}} unbiased gain-switched laser types is determined by measuring the temporal probability distribution of {{the leading edge of}} the emitted optical pulse. One single-mode 1. 5 -mu-m distributed feed-back <b>laser</b> and three <b>multimode</b> Fabry-Perot <b>lasers</b> emitting at 750 nm and 1. 3 -mu-m are investigated. The jitter is found to decrease for all lasers with increasing injection current. For <b>multimode</b> <b>lasers</b> it decreases from 8 ps excited slightly above threshold down to below 2 ps at three times the threshold current. The jitter of the distributed feedback (DFB) laser is a factor of 3 - 5 larger than the jitter of the three <b>multimode</b> <b>lasers.</b> A new model to predict the {{turn-on delay time}} jitter is presented and explains the experiments quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|The {{recent reports}} of the replica {{symmetry}} breaking (RSB) phenomenon in photonic experiments [1 - 5] boosted {{the understanding of the}} role of disorder in <b>multimode</b> <b>lasers,</b> as well as helped to settle enlightening connections [6 - 13] with the statistical physics of complex systems. RSB manifests when identically-prepared system replicas reach distinct states, yielding different measures of observable quantities [14]. Here we demonstrate the RSB in the spontaneous mode-locking regime of a conventional <b>multimode</b> Nd:YAG <b>laser</b> in a closed cavity. The underlying mechanism is quite distinct from that of the RSB spinglass phase in cavityless random lasers with incoherently-oscillating modes. Here, a specific nonuniform distribution of the gain takes place in each pulse, and frustration is induced since the coherent oscillation of a given subset of longitudinal modes dominates and simultaneously inhibits the others. Nevertheless, when high losses are introduced only the replica-symmetric amplified stimulation emission is observed. We therefore suggest that the RSB transition can be used as an identifier of the threshold in standard <b>multimode</b> <b>lasers,</b> as recently proposed and demonstrated for random lasers [1, 2]...|$|R
