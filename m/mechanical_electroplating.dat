This process {{is based on a}} <b>mechanical</b> bonding, using <b>electroplated</b> copper through silicon vias.

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the process {{is its ability to}} overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems, which is important for workpieces that have a hardness greater than HRC 40. Note that there still is some embrittlement of the workpiece. While this process does not cause problems with hydrogen embrittlement, and electroplating does, it still offers equivalent corrosion protection. There is a great cost savings in using <b>mechanical</b> plating over <b>electroplating</b> on hardened workpieces, because the electroplating processes requires a pre- and post-plating operation to overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems. Moreover, because mechanical plating occurs at room temperature there is no tempering of hardened workpieces.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} investigations {{toward a}} disposable polymer-based chip for {{the isolation of}} eukaryotic mRNA. This work focuses here on {{the improvement of the}} fabrication methods for rapid prototyping and the actual application at lowest RNA concentrations with total channel volumes of 3. 5 μL. Messenger RNA isolation was achieved using paramagnetic oligo (dT) 25 beads within a microfluidic channel which incorporated a sawtooth microstructured design to aid in mixing. The structures were shown to facilitate mixing beteen two fluids in parallel flow when compared to a channel without structures. The chip was fabricated by means of hot embossing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) using a copper master. Copper was used as the master material due to its excellent thermal, <b>mechanical,</b> and <b>electroplating</b> properties. Fabrication of the master consisted of the structuring of a polished copper plate using KMPR 1050 as an electroplating mold for forming the microchannel structures. The copper master was found to be much more robust than traditional silicon masters used for prototyping. The use of KMPR enabled the generation of high straight walls in contrast to SU- 8 masters. In addition, embossing times were able to be decreased by a factor of 3 due to improved heat conduction and avoidance of a lengthy and delicate de-embossing step...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} surface {{activated}} bonding (SAB) through Au thin films with {{the thickness of}} a few tens of nanometers {{can be applied to}} room temperature vacuum sealing for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) packaging. In previous study, it was found that room temperature bonding of Si/Si and Si/chemical <b>mechanical</b> polished (CMP) <b>electroplated</b> Cu could be successfully applied to vacuum sealing of micro cavities. However this method needs high vacuum in bonding process for keeping activated surfaces and the surfaces should be cleaned by wet processes. In this study we attempt to realize room temperature vacuum sealing in low vacuum without any wet surface pre-treatments utilizing Au thin films with controlled surface roughness. We propose and develop packaging structures with comb-drive resonators for characterization of sealing quality and show the applicability of SAB of Au-Au thin films to vacuum-seal packaging...|$|R
40|$|The {{in-plane}} {{motion of}} microelectrothermal actuator ("heatuator") has been analysed for Si-based and metallic devices. It {{was found that}} the lateral deflection of a heatuator made of a Ni-metal is about ~ 60 % larger than that of a Si-based actuator under the same power consumption. Metals are much better for thermal actuators as they provide a relatively large deflection and large force, for a low operating temperature, and power consumption. Electroplated Ni films were used to fabricate heatuators. The electrical and <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>electroplated</b> Ni thin films have been investigated as a function of temperature and plating current density, and the process conditions have been optimised to obtain stress-free films suitable for MEMS applications. Lateral thermal actuators have been successfully fabricated, and electrically tested. Microswitches and microtweezers utilising the heatuator have also been fabricated and teste...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new metallic actuators fabricated by LIGA technique depends on the <b>mechanical</b> characterization of <b>electroplated</b> coatings. Particular attention must be devoted to residual stresses in order to lower the degradation of the microsystems performances. The aim {{of this paper is}} the investigation of residual stresses in electroplated nickel plates clamped on silicon substrates using two methods based on optical measurements. The bulging test is a steady-state technique, which gives the in-plane stresses present in a plate as well as the Young's modulus of the material. As a complementary experiment, we have analyzed these stresses using a dynamic technique. The purpose of this method is to generate via a piezoelectric actuator stationary waves inside the plates. The frequencies of the different modes depend on the geometry of the plate and are strongly modified by in-plane stresses. The values obtained by these two techniques are compared to a previous work devoted to the X-ray analysis of the residual stresses on the same samples...|$|R
40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} X-ray lithography provides high structural resolution down to 0. 2 mym, {{where the}} pattern transfer capability is mainly {{limited by the}} feature size of the absorber patterns of the X-ray mask. Up to now, only gold has been set very successfully in our mask making process, but the disadvantage of gold is the low acceptance in IC production lines because it might contaminate the wafers and degrade the electrical parameters of chips. Therefore, the properties of electroplated lead as an alternative have been studied, because the acceptance of lead is by far higher in production lines. This paper shows that electroplated lead fulfills the demands on an absorber material for X-ray masks concerning resolution and contrast. Structures down to 0. 2 mym can be achieved, and 1. 5 mym of lead provides a sufficient contrast for pattern transfer even with a 4 -fold exposure dose. The <b>mechanical</b> stress of <b>electroplated</b> load is negligible and no significant mask distortion occurs due to absorber stress, even after annealing at 100 degrees C. (IMT...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic MEMS {{actuators}} {{are presently}} still relatively under-researched {{as compared to}} their electrostatic, piezoelectric and electro-thermal counterparts. Most existing magnetic MEMS actuators are limited to simply delivering a rotational output. The research presented in this thesis aims to develop novel magnetic MEMS actuators with complex structures {{that are capable of}} delivering more sophisticated and useful mechanical outputs than the existing devices. The study begins with an attempt {{to solve the problem of}} bending a freestanding ferromagnetic cantilever beam with an applied magnetic field. Analytical and numerical models have been constructed and the modelling results are compared to experimental results obtained from a microscopic and a laser measurement system. NiFe alloy has been used as both the magnetic and mechanical element. The magnetic and <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>electroplated</b> NiFe have been experimentally characterized. Fabrication processes for creating freestanding NiFe structures have been designed and optimized via a parametric experimental study. Finally, novel ferromagnetic microstructures have been designed by combining the motions of more than one ferromagnetic beam.

40|$|Historical photo camerasat the University of Tartu MuseumThe University of Tartu Museum has {{exhibits}} {{dating back}} to the beginningof photography. There is an incomplete wooden camera, ofwhich only the immovable ground box has survived. Based on theinventory number of the Department of Physics that is on the camerait was obtained in 1852. The measurements of the camera are 17. 6 x 13. 5 x 9. 0 cm, the length of the stand is 24. 5 cm. The camera alsoincludes two wooden boxes for daguerreotype plates. In the largerbox, there are six galvanically silver-plated daguerreotype plates inthe size 108 x 8 0 x 0. 5 mm by the French company 30 GARANTIHOUSSEMAINE. The smaller box holds five 80 x 69 x 0. 5 mm galvanicallysilver-plated plates. The mark of the company is H. B., imageof an eagle, 30. The company has not been identified, it is probablyFrench. The other slightly larger wooden camera has remained intact. The measurements of the immovable part are 20. 0 x 19. 2 x 8. 8 cm, the width of the outer side of the moving part is 4. 0 cm, the totallength of the camera stand is 26. 0 cm. The diffused glass in the woodenframe is 11. 4 x 12. 6 cm. There is no lens. Neither of the camerashas the name or symbol of the manufacturer. The article also provides a short overview of the history of coveringdaguerreotype plates with a layer of silver, i. e., <b>mechanical</b> andelectrochemical plating (<b>electroplating),</b> and matters related to researchingthe history of the daguerreotype. The article covers the discovery of galvanoplasty, i. e., electrotyping(plating) by the University of Tartu Professor of ArchitectureMoritz von Jacobi, and the debates over priorities. While studying the characteristics of the Daniell cell in the laboratoryof the university’s chemistry cabinet in 1837, M. v. Jacobidiscovered that the layer of copper that deposits on the cathode isan exact replica of the surface patterns of a copper cathode. Whenhe examined this phenomenon closely, he immediately sensed thepractical perspective of the discovery and notified the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences where the description of Jacobi’s discovery waspresented at the Academy’s session on 5 October 1838 and publishedin the Academy’s French-language journal. This piece gives a short overview {{of the history of the}} darkroomor camera obscura from ca 500 BC until the first cameras in the 19 thcentury AD.
