5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that <b>more</b> <b>education</b> about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother took}} {{an active role}} in her daughter's {{education}}, taking her to the library often. Celia had been a good student in her youth, graduating from high school at age fifteen, yet could not further her own education because her family chose to send her brother to college instead. Celia wanted her daughter to get <b>more</b> <b>education,</b> which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher. Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth's high school years and died the day before Ruth's high school graduation.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for <b>more</b> <b>education</b> for the monks. Peckham's reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E

She studied piano and violin, and started to teach music at White's when the teacher resigned. In June 1895 Zitkála-Šá was awarded her first diploma and gave a speech on women's inequality, which received high praise from the local paper.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the Saudi {{government}} began to slowly step up a public education campaign about AIDS-HIV.

The number {{of people living in}} the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret, as the official policy was often that the disease was not a serious problem in a kingdom because Saudis followed the principles of traditional Islamic morality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{evidence}} for the effect of environment stimulation upon the human brain is cognitive reserve (a measure of the brain’s resilience to cognitive impairment) {{and the level of}} a person’s education. Not only is higher education linked to a more cognitively demanding educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in cognitively demanding activities. The <b>more</b> <b>education</b> a person has received, the less the effects of aging, dementia, white matter hyperintensities, MRI-defined brain infarcts, Alzheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Also, aging and dementia are less in those that engage in complex cognitive tasks. The cognitive decline of those with epilepsy could also be affected by the level of a person’s education.|$|E

25|$|After Carnegie's death, an {{electric}} fence was built around Points North Landing's landfill {{to prevent future}} predatory animal incidents. Eleven years later, a lone timber wolf attacked a young male twenty-six-year-old worker in Cigar Lake. The worker was on his midnight break when it jumped and mauled him less than one hundred meters from the main camp. A nearby female security guard frightened the wolf away. She administered first aid and called for an air ambulance, which airlifted him six hundred and seventy-five kilometres {{to a hospital in}} Saskatoon, where he recovered. After the attack, authorities ordered that wolves in the area be tracked down and shot. In addition, authorities required food disposal systems and inspected the fence around Cigar Lake's landfill, as well as providing <b>more</b> <b>education</b> to the mining staff members.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes. In addition to moving towards a more wholistic style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular are focusing their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police now work with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided <b>more</b> <b>education</b> and after-school activities to try and keep them out of trouble. In addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E
25|$|John Shaw Neilson {{had little}} <b>more</b> <b>education</b> than his father. When {{about eight years}} old he was for 15 months at the state school at Penola, {{but he had to}} leave in 1881 when the family removed to Minimay in the {{south-west}} Wimmera in Victoria. There was no school at Minimay then, but four years later one was opened and Neilson attended for another 15 months. There was, however, a Bible and a tattered copy of Robert Burns' poems in the house, and when at the age of 15 a copy of Thomas Hood's poems came in his way, Neilson read them all with great joy. Driven out by drought, Neilson's father took his family to Nhill in 1889, and was employed as a farm worker and on the roads. His son soon after began to write verses of which some appeared in the local press and one in The Australasian in Melbourne.|$|E

500|$|Weber {{defines the}} {{importance}} of societal class within religion by examining {{the difference between the}} two theodicies and to what class structures they apply. The concept of [...] "work ethic" [...] is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant [...] "work ethic", there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and <b>more</b> <b>education</b> among Protestants. Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.|$|E
500|$|The Independent {{reported}} that Moffat [...] "stresses that Chalk is a sitcom, not some banner-waving, agitprop pamphlet", {{but is still}} [...] "passionate about education". Moffat criticises [...] "the [...] government talk about the specially talented needing <b>more</b> <b>education,</b> but that's absurd, the equivalent of hospitals for the healthy." [...] Moffat expected that teachers would find the show funny because it [...] "has certain notes of accuracy", recognising familiar myths such as the dead teacher and teachers' contempt for their pupils. Moffat continued to say that teachers would [...] "also recognise the pathological preference for science over arts and all that league-table shit. An official teaching organisation couldn't say, 'It's a very faithful portrayal,' but I hope they'd say, 'It's a comedy series. Why take it seriously?' You couldn't claim {{it is the most}} flattering series, but, there again, people continued to stay at hotels after Fawlty Towers." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} a house party near St. Charles, he met {{and fell in}} love with a farmer's daughter, Dellora Baker. Gates proposed to her at one of the house parties. [...] Dellora was willing to accept Gates' proposal, but wondered how he would be able to provide for a wife, as his only income came from winning at the railroad poker games. When his father discovered Gates in a poker game with some railroad men in the family's barn, Asel told his son he was no good and would never be any good. Only Mary's mediation stopped her son from leaving home. With the realization that he needed <b>more</b> <b>education</b> than grammar school had provided, he announced to his parents that he would be enrolling in some local college classes. Gates attended some courses at nearby Wheaton College and graduated from North Central College in 1876. [...] He had little opportunity to put his new business education to work, as the financial Panic of 1873 began just as he was completing his college work. In order to be able to marry Dellora, Gates accepted every type of job he could get for the next year; most of them were for farm work. Gates and Dellora were married on February 25, 1874.|$|E

500|$|Like his Republican predecessors, Arthur {{struggled}} {{with the question of}} how his party was to challenge the Democrats in the South and how, if at all, to protect the civil rights of black southerners. [...] Since the end of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats (or [...] "Bourbon Democrats") had regained power in the South, and the Republican party dwindled rapidly as their primary supporters in the region, blacks, were disenfranchised. [...] One crack in the solidly Democratic South emerged with the growth of a new party, the Readjusters, in Virginia. [...] Having won an election in that state on a platform of <b>more</b> <b>education</b> funding (for black and white schools alike) and abolition of the poll tax and the whipping post, many northern Republicans saw the Readjusters as a more viable ally in the South than the moribund southern Republican party. [...] Arthur agreed, and directed the federal patronage in Virginia through the Readjusters rather than the Republicans. [...] He followed the same pattern in other Southern states, forging coalitions with independents and Greenback Party members. [...] Some black Republicans felt betrayed by the pragmatic gambit, but others (including Frederick Douglass and ex-Senator Blanche K. Bruce) endorsed the administration's actions, as the Southern independents had more liberal racial policies than the Democrats. [...] Arthur's coalition policy was only successful in Virginia, however, and by 1885 the Readjuster movement began to collapse with the election of a Democratic president.|$|E

[...] Devout members of religions often choose names from their religious scriptures.
