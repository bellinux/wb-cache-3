40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this C-essay is to answer the question: What have been the {{consequences}} and effects of the <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system on language studies and the parties concerned (teachers, students and principals) {{during the school year}} of 2010 / 11 ? The <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system {{is the result of a}} political decision and was implicated for the first time in the Swedish upper secondary school during the school year 2010 / 2011. Being a completely new phenomenon it is of great interest and importance to study its effects. The study in this essay also aims to verify, falsify or nullify two hypotheses very often referred to in the political discussions regarding the <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system: The <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system will replace affection and interest as main reasons for language studies in upper secondary school and cause a rectification amongst the students choices of additional courses. The <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system will have a segregating effect upon society and make it harder for people to rise in society through education in the future. A verification of these hypotheses would imply the appearance of an increased rectification amongst students as well as an orientation towards an in the future more segregated society. The empiric material has been collected and examined with qualitative as well as quantitative methods (questionnaires and interviews) and belongs epistemologically to the phenomenological and hermeneutical traditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{construction}} procurement {{evaluation method}} using lowest price conforming methods often causes some quality problems for  owners {{and increases the}} probability of dispute and delay during the contract execution. On the other hand, <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system evaluation method can provide quality assurance, but the procurement committees are often dificult to apply it, and to determaine mesurable criteria evaluation. Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} a more in-depth study to find out the criteria evaluation for construction procurement. The research conducted in Bali, and adopted inductive qualitative approach involving 45 experts participated in construction procurements using <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system evaluation. Puposive sampling is applied to determine the respondents come from all actors included during procurement process. The data was collected through interviews, observation participant and questionnaires, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is choosed to analyse them. The result shows that : the <b>merit</b> <b>point</b> system evaluation for construction procurement can determine the contractor provides better quality than the lowest price conforming method when theevaluation criteria are clear, mesurable and transparant in the bidding document. There are two principle aspects that must be considered to assurethe quality that is: the technical aspect and the cost that weight consecutively 60 % and 40 %. The technical aspect comprises of : a) the existance of work plan (13. 51 %), comprising of construction methods (4. 12 %), supporting  equipment (4. 05 %), supporting material (3. 46 %), suporting workers (1. 88 %); b) competencies of human recources (19. 91 %), comprising of project management competencies(2. 31 %), existence of expert (7. 92 %) and certificated human resources (9. 68 %); c) existence of supporting equipments (15. 54 %) consisted of lifting support (4. 79 %), transportation support (6. 17 %), surveying support equipment(4. 58 %); d) the existing of time management (6. 30 %) consisted of network planning (4. 13 %), bar chart (1. 03 %), and S-curve (1. 14 %); and e) existence of quality assurance (2. 14 %) consisted of quality management system (1. 95 %), performance quality management (0. 66 %) and material management quality (2. 14 %).

40|$|This C-essay is a {{qualitative}} study {{designed to create}} a basis for understanding how managers involved in school affairs perceive the impact of <b>merit</b> <b>points</b> on students’ chances to continue on to higher education and how this will affect individuals' life chances. The study is based on three interviews with managers involved in school affairs. In this paper grades, <b>merit</b> <b>points</b> and socioeconomic class differences are discussed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to answer the following questions:  What impact does <b>merit</b> <b>points</b> in language studies and the way different languages are valued, in the system, have for the individual and for society?  Who are the winners in the new grading system and who are the losers; how are different socioeconomic groups affected?

The results show that class differences will increase and that it will be difficult to rise in the social hierarchy in the future...|$|R

40|$|Integrative (interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary) {{landscape}} {{research projects}} {{are becoming increasingly}} common. As a result, researchers are spending {{a larger proportion of}} their professional careers doing integrative work, participating in shifting interdisciplinary teams, and cooperating directly with non-academic participants. Despite the growing importance of integrative research, few studies have investigated researchers¿ experiences in these projects. How do researchers perceive the outcomes of integrative projects, or career effects? Do they view the projects generally as successes or failures? This study analyses researchers¿ experiences in integrative landscape studies and investigates what factors shape these experiences. The data stems from 19 semi-structured qualitative interviews and a Web-based survey among 207 participants in integrative landscape research projects. It finds that researchers experience participation in integrative projects as positive, in particular discussions among participants, networking, teamwork, and gaining new insights and skills. Furthermore, most researchers perceive the projects as successful and as having a positive effect on their careers. Less positive aspects of integration relate to publications and <b>merit</b> <b>points.</b> Factors found to contribute to positive experiences include reaching a high degree of integration amongst the involved disciplines, common definitions of integrative research concepts, and projects that include a large share of fundamental research as well as projects with many project outcomes. Based on these findings, we advise future projects to plan for integration, facilitate discussions, and reach agreement on integrative concepts. We suggest that aspects of fundamental research be included in integrative projects. We also suggest that planning be done at an early stage for peer-reviewed publications, to ensure that participants gain <b>merit</b> <b>points</b> from their participation in integrative research efforts...|$|R
