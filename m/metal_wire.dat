5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> {{designed to}} be inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E

25|$|Solid wire {{consists}} of one strand of copper <b>metal</b> <b>wire,</b> bare or {{surrounded by an}} insulator. Single-strand copper conductors are typically used as magnet wire in motors and transformers. They are relatively rigid, do not bend easily, and are typically installed in permanent, infrequently handled, and low flex applications.|$|E
25|$|A {{point-contact}} diode works {{the same as}} the junction diodes described below, but its construction is simpler. A pointed <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> is placed in contact with an n-type semiconductor. Some metal migrates into the semiconductor to make a small p-type region around the contact. The 1N34 germanium version is still used in radio receivers as a detector and occasionally in specialized analog electronics.|$|E
25|$|Any object {{containing}} pointed {{metal can}} create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in microwaves are safe, see below), twist-ties containing <b>metal</b> <b>wire,</b> the <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape. Forks {{are a good}} example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This {{has the effect of}} exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3×106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.|$|E

40|$|In {{the deep}} {{submicron}} era, the {{power supply voltage}} to the logic devices should be well within the bound limits. The degradation of power affects the timing closure of the chip, thus affecting the performance. In this thesis, the analysis flow used in previous study is modified to make it generic to all series of AVR processors. By extracting a power grid model and subjecting it to extensive simulations, the issue causing the power degradation is analysed. Analysis {{results show that the}} cause for the first voltage drop is due to two factors, that is, current loads and resistive property of the <b>metal</b> <b>wires.</b> The first overshoot after voltage drop increases for wider <b>metal</b> <b>wires</b> compared to lesser width of <b>metal</b> <b>wires.</b> Nodes of the power grid having large voltage drop show that on-chip self inductance can no longer be ignored in designing power distribution networks for high frequency circuits...|$|R

25|$|These are {{a type of}} {{point-contact}} diode. The cat's whisker diode {{consists of}} a thin or sharpened <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> pressed against a semiconducting crystal, typically galena {{or a piece of}} coal. The wire forms the anode and the crystal forms the cathode. Cat's whisker diodes were also called crystal diodes and found application in the earliest radios called crystal radio receivers. Cat's whisker diodes are generally obsolete, but may be available from a few manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|A twist tie is a <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> that is {{encased in}} a thin strip of paper or plastic and is used to tie the {{openings}} of bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.|$|E

The rifle can also use a fixed wooden or synthetic buttstock designed for AKM or AK-74 rifles. Both {{the upper and lower}} handguard and pistol grip are fabricated from bakelite, although a limited number of Tantal-specific black polymer handguards and pistol grips have also been produced. Most handguards designed for use with the wz. 1996 Beryl assault rifle may also be installed on the Tantal.|$|E

25|$|The design {{challenge}} for a Stirling engine regenerator {{is to provide}} sufficient heat transfer capacity without introducing too much additional internal volume ('dead space') or flow resistance. These inherent design conflicts are one of many factors that limit the efficiency of practical Stirling engines. A typical design is a stack of fine <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> meshes, with low porosity to reduce dead space, and with the wire axes perpendicular to the gas flow to reduce conduction in that direction and to maximize convective heat transfer.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> racks {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> run through it. Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E

25|$|Crafts form an {{important}} part of the state’s economy, providing all or part of many families’ income. The state government passed the Ley de Fomento a la Cultural in 1988 which works to protect crafts produced within the state. One type of handcraft produced in the state is metalworking with most precious and non-precious metals. The best known work produced in the state is made with silver, centered in the town of Taxco. Each year this town holds the annual National Silver Fair (Feria Nacional de la Plata). Gold is worked in locations such as Iguala, Ciudad Altamirano, Coyuca de Catalán, Arcelia and Ometepec. Steel machetes and other items are produced in Ayutla, Tixtla, Chilapa, Tecpan deGaleana and Ometepec. Gold leaf is done in Tlacotepec, Tlalchipa and Cuetzala del Progreso. Costume jewelry is made in Acatlán, and Chilapa, producing buttons of various colors, pieces made of brass coated in nickel, glass and <b>metal</b> <b>wire</b> to produce items such as necklaces, bracelets, and more. Other jewelry is made by twisting and weaving fine strands of silver or gold wire. Silver is mostly done in Taxco, with gold pieces in Ciudad Altamirano.|$|E
