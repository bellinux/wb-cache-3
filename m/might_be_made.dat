5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> into a trilogy of one-act operas.|$|E
5|$|In Bauer's view, the {{presence}} {{at one of}} the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks. Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. Himmler knew that attempts <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> on Hitler's life, though not where and when. It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive, using low-level agents for plausible deniability, and if Hitler did survive, Bauer argues, Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E
5|$|Some bootlegs {{consist of}} private or {{professional}} studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including demos, works-in-progress or discarded material. These <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> from private recordings {{not meant to}} be widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a recording studio or the offices of a record label, or they may be copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release. A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy deleted records, such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The Who's Zoo bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album Odds And Sods, which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the Nuggets series of albums.|$|E

25|$|Most {{regulatory}} agencies worldwide issue amateur radio call signs to the operator licensee, {{and not to}} the station. An amateur radio station may be operated under the call sign of the owner of the station or the call sign of the operator of the station. In some countries, special call signs <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available for clubs, and are frequently used at a club station established for use of the club's members.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a lawsuit, the {{plaintiff}} proferred his own plea. There is no trace of professional advocates, but the plea had to be in writing, and the notary doubtlessly assisted in the drafting of it. The judge saw the plea, called the other parties before him, and sent for the witnesses. If these were not at hand, he might adjourn the case for their subpoena, specifying a time for up to six months. Pledges <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to produce the witnesses on a fixed day.|$|E

25|$|An implant {{is a kind}} {{of medical}} device made to replace and act as a missing {{biological}} structure (as compared with a transplant, which indicates transplanted biomedical tissue). The surface of implants that contact the body <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite depending on what is the most functional. In some cases, implants contain electronics, e.g. artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or drug-eluting stents.|$|E
25|$|The yaylÄ± tanbur has {{a similar}} {{physical}} appearance, although the shell -a nearly perfect semi-sphere- <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of metal. It is played with a bow instead of a plectrum. The technique was introduced by Tanburi Cemil Bey {{in the end of}} the 19th century. ErcÃ¼ment Batanay was, after Tanburi Cemil Bey, the most outstanding virtuoso of this instrument, until his death. The yaylÄ± tanbur is held vertically on the knees, as opposed to the regular one where the neck is maintained horizontal to the ground at all times.|$|E
25|$|Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 {{to making}} the first crop circles in South England. When some people refused to believe them, they {{deliberately}} added straight lines and squares {{to show that they}} could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.|$|E

25|$|An analogy <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to {{the issue}} of legal {{opinions}} from courts in common-law systems. FatwÄs generally contain the details of the scholar's reasoning, typically in response to a particular case, and are considered binding precedent by those Muslims who have bound themselves to that scholar, including future muftis; mere rulings can be compared to memorandum opinions. The primary difference between common-law opinions and fatwÄs, however, is that fatwÄs are not universally binding; as Sharia is not universally consistent and Islam is very non-hierarchical in structure, fatwÄs do not carry the sort of weight as that of secular common-law opinion.|$|E
25|$|Barry then {{attempted}} to anticipate {{some of the}} counter-arguments that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> To the argument that someone denying the jurisdiction of a court must also indicate some jurisdiction that is competent, Barry said that the customary legal system of the Aboriginal people themselves was the correct jurisdiction. Barry indicated {{he was prepared to}} call witnesses to testify on the methods within the Aboriginal legal system of dealing with such matters, and also argued that although there were certainly differences between the Aboriginal and English legal systems, that did not mean that the former was not a valid jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Thielmann {{intended}} {{that the}} 9th Brigade should be posted {{in rear of}} this general disposition of his troops, so that its services <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> available according as circumstances might require; but through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the order, General Borcke was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road until near La Bawette, thence to turn off to his left, and continue his march, according to his original instructions {{in the direction of}} Fromont, Bourgeois, and Saint-Lambert, towards Couture-Saint-Germain; being under the impression that the whole corps had already commenced this march, in pursuance of the general plan, and that his brigade was destined to cover the movement.|$|E
