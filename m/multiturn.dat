40|$|By {{applying}} a time reversal to the <b>multiturn</b> extraction method recently proposed, {{a novel approach}} to perform <b>multiturn</b> injection is described.

The results of numerical simulations will be presented and discussed in detail, showing how to use the proposed approach to generate hollow bunches in the transverse phase space, and how different resonances can be used. The dependence of the final beam parameters on the key quantities of the proposed approach, such as emittance of the initial beam and the way the resonance is crossed, is investigated.

40|$|The CERN SPS <b>multiturn</b> facility, {{based on}} the new beam orbit {{measurement}} system MOPOS, enables the User to acquire {{the position of the}} beam at each beam position monitor (BPM) over a number of consecutive turns. When the <b>multiturn</b> acquisition is synchronised with a perturbation imposed on the beam (for instance a fast kick), useful information about the optics of the SPS and the dynamic behaviour of the beam can be extracted from the data. A measurement of the amplitude and phase of the betatron oscillation at each BPM can be used to compare the theoretical optics functions with the real ones, and possibly to detect localised errors. Differences between two such measurements can be used to study the dependence on a variable parameter (e. g. beam intensity, beam energy, etc) and therefore indirectly measure quantities, like the impedance, distributed along the ring. Finally, due to 90 degrees phase advance lattice, plotting the positions measured at two consecutive BPMs against each other gives information about the behaviour of the beam in the transverse phase space.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} depth {{analysis}} of the inductive power transfer (or wireless power transfer, WPT) along a metamaterial composed of cells arranged in a planar configuration, in order to deliver power to a receiver sliding on them. In this way, the problem of the efficiency strongly affected by the weak coupling between emitter and receiver can be obviated, and the distance of transmission can significantly be increased. This study is made using a circuital approach and the magnetoinductive wave (MIW) theory, in order to simply explain the behavior of the transmission coefficient and efficiency from the circuital and experimental point of view. Moreover, flat spiral resonators are used as metamaterial cells, particularly indicated in literature for WPT metamaterials operating at MHz frequencies (5 - 30 MHz). Finally, this thesis presents a complete electrical characterization of multilayer and <b>multiturn</b> flat spiral resonators and, in particular, it proposes a new approach for the resistance calculation through finite element simulations, in order to consider all the high frequency parasitic effects.
