Although Paul's (1920) dichotomy between emerging relationship (ACC) and existing relationship (DAT) constituted a major, though hardly noted improvement, it remains counterintuitive in that it characterizes ablative and perlative datives as expressing existing relationships.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to delimit the role of pragmatic {{specialisation}} in the evolution of negation in French. The change in the marking of sentential negation is believed to proceed in characterised stages that would together constitute the Jespersen cycle. As a marker becomes the default expression of negation, the other markers do not necessarily fade away, and are maintained with specialised roles that include pragmatic functions. One such pragmatic function is that of activation (Dryer 1996), by which a proposition is presented as accessible to the hearer. Activation is shown to motivate the use of preverbal non that competes with ne for several centuries. The claims that the emergence of postverbal pas in early French and the loss of ne in contemporary spoken French are associated with activation are considered on the basis of novel data. It is concluded that pragmatic functions contribute to language change by providing <b>marked</b> <b>options</b> that may be confered the default status in a grammatical paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{assumption}} that local and disciplinary cultures {{have an impact on}} the rhetorical organization of the text and on identity construction within a genre (Fløttum, Dahl and Kinn 2006, for academic genres), this paper takes a corpus-assisted approach to genre variation across English and Italian research articles in history. Specifically, the main emphasis lies on conclu* and its lemmatizations, or, more precisely, on second-level Summarizers and Concluders (Siepmann 2005), and the way they interact with other discourse markers (primarily Summarizers and Resumers, and Inferrers) and metadiscourse across moves. As will be seen, second-level discourse markers (SLDMs) represent a <b>marked</b> <b>option,</b> in that they add extra meaning to their more general, more transparent, more frequent, and less specific counterparts. Whereas variation within the unit or pattern results from combinations with discourse markers from the same or other categories, variation across English and Italian is better accounted for within an interpersonal model of metadiscourse (Hyland 2005, 2008), in terms of different strategies on the interactional level...|$|R

40|$|The article {{offers a}} {{systematic}} account of four basic types of nouns, of four basic types of nominal determination {{and of the}} interaction of noun type and determination type. The four basic noun types are sortal, individual, relational and functional; they correspond to the four logical types Æe,tæ, e, Æe,Æe,tææ and Æe,eæ on the one hand, and to four types of concepts on the other. The four basic types of nominal determination are singular definite, indefinite (a variety of determinations including simple indefinite), absolute and relative, where possessive determination {{is a combination of}} relative reference and possessor specification. Only inherently unique concepts are available for singular definite reference, only nonunique ones for indefinite use, only nonrelational concepts for absolute reference and only relational ones for relative use. However, determiners of each type can be combined with nouns of each lexical type: if the type restrictions are not met, the noun is shifted to an appropriate type. On this basis, congruent and incongruent determinations are distinguished. Statistical, typological and historical evidence is presented that corroborates the hypothesis that incongruent determination is a <b>marked</b> <b>option</b> and involves type shifts of the noun. ...|$|R

This presentation introduces the final phase of a project that has investigated and analysed the design of teamwork assessment across all discipline areas in order to provide a university-wide protocol for this important graduate capability. The protocol concentrates best practice guidelines and resources across a range of approaches to team assessment and includes an online diagnostic tool for evaluating the quality of assessment design. Guide-lines are provided for all aspects of the design process such as the development of real-world relevance; choosing the ideal team structure; planning for intervention and conflict resolution; and selecting appropriate <b>marking</b> <b>options.</b> While still allowing academic staff to exercise creativity in assessment design; the guidelines increase the possibility of students’ experiencing a consistent and explicit approach to teamwork throughout their course. If implementation of the protocol is successful, the project team predicts that the resulting consistency and explicitness in approaches to teamwork will lead to more coherent skill development across units, more realistic expectations for students and staff and better communication between all those participating in the process...|$|R

In the second semester of Biological Sciences, the most <b>marked</b> <b>option</b> was “God” whereas in the sixth semester the most marked one was “Evolution”, indicating the progress throughout the course towards the Theory of Evolution. Pedagogy students indicated predominantly alternatives linked to the religious field, since in all Pedagogy semesters both “God” and “Creation” answers were the most selected ones. These results are relevant since these future teachers may use their religious views when teaching their students the theme of the origin of life in sciences classes.

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to analyze {{relative}} constructions, especially restrictive relative clauses, by selectively combining two incompatible approaches to relativization. One approach is the standard one, which base-generates the head of a relative clause and adjoins the clause to it, and the other its alternative, which posits a determiner as selecting a CP relative clause and analyzes a DP comprising the relative pronoun plus the relative head as raising to SpecCP within the relative CP. The reasoning for this hybrid approach is that each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, and that the weaknesses of each are exactly the virtues of the other. The strategy that the hybrid approach adopts is to incorporate only the strengths of both approaches, shedding their drawbacks. Specifically, the approach basically follows the standard approach, base-generating the relative head externally to the relative clause, and then adopts the most crucial aspect of its alternative, generating both the relative pronoun and the matching nominal head internally to the clause and raising both of them to relative SpecCP. In order to circumvent the redundancy of the head, a deletion under identity operation is invoked to delete the matching head internal to the relative clause in phonology. This analysis predicts correctly that when the internal head does not match the external head, they both surface as, for example, in Japanese and Chinese gapless relatives. Deletion may exceptionally apply to the external head as a <b>marked</b> <b>option,</b> or more plausibly, the external head may be null in Classical Japanese, Ancash Quechua, Lakhota, etc...|$|R

40|$|The Manual of Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) {{includes}} a bicycle detector pavement marking (Section 9 C- 05) and accompanying explanatory sign (R 10 - 22) which may encourage cyclists to position themselves over detection at traffic signals. This paper {{presents the results}} of an observational and survey- based study evaluating the bicycle detector marking. Three minor actuated approaches at signalized intersections with significant bicycle volumes and without bicycle detector markings were selected for treatment. Three configurations were compared: 1) bicycle detector marking only 2) bicycle detector marking with the R 10 - 22 explanatory sign, and 3) an alternative bicycle detector installed over a contrasting green rectangle. Analysis of 688 observations, gleaned from over 300 hours of before and after video data, indicate that while all three <b>marking</b> <b>options</b> influence cyclist stopping position, the effect of the marking is not substantial. For the marking only, 23. 5 % of cyclists waited over the space where the marking was installed.

Analysis of survey responses of 227 cyclists indicates that only 45. 4 % of cyclists understand the roadway marking is meant to show where they should wait to be detected. An additional 11. 5 % understand that the marking indicates the recommended waiting location, but do not know that it is for the purpose of detection.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I mainly {{focus on the}} {{translation}} of linguistic varieties that are culture-specific or belong to a socially restricted speech community. These varieties, including slang, often display forms that rarely have equivalents (i. e. forms that are comparable in meaning and scope) in a different language. However, relevant theories on translation (e. g. Catford 1965, House 1997) state that the translator should assure ‘equivalence’ by preserving the semantic and pragmatic meanings across two different languages, and that a first requirement for equivalence is ‘equivalent function’. Accordingly, the translator should keep low semantic and pragmatic transparency – i. e. polysemy and multifunctionality – in the target language (TL), any time they are motivated by socio-pragmatic purposes (e. g. identification with a group, cryptic reasons, establishing intimacy, etc.) in the source language (SL). Therefore I believe that the lexical complexity of slang should be preserved {{in the process of}} translation. Lexical complexity in slang formations is first of all due to a marked (Merlini Barbaresi 1988), non-diagrammatic (Dressler et al. 1987) relation between the linguistic sign and its signatum. The cognitive area activated by the slang term includes a vast array of extra socio-pragmatic meanings, which typically belong to the restricted community in which the term is used. Recreating the same effects in a different language community by means of an ‘equivalent’ slang formation is nearly impossible. Still what can be recreated is a comparably complex signans/signatum relation. In this paper, I will examine some examples of free conversation which show slang use, ranging from in-group slang to general slang. I will then establish the status of markedness of some slang expressions (e. g. chick, groovy, hit, etc.) on one or more correlated semiotic parameter(s) (esp. transparency and biuniqueness), and finally demonstrate that <b>marked</b> <b>options</b> generally increase complexity and consequent difficulty in perception, and yet they must be kept in translation to preserve the rich layers of associative meanings normally entailed...|$|R
