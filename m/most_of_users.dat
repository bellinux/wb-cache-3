50|$|The second update MR2 went live in May and Windows Mobile was updated to the 6.5.3. This was a {{significant}} upgrade in terms of usability, performance, power management and the browser experience. Despite that MR2 was undoubtedly a move in the right direction, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> who send their feedback on official Sony Ericsson product blog, developer forums and Sony Ericsson fan sites continue to complain that even after MR2 device is still unstable and lacks some key features such as support for Bluetooth remote SIM access (rSAP) profile which make X2 unable to pair with any modern premium car kits which are built into Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Skoda etc. - an essential feature for business users and executives who were intended {{to be the main}} target customers for the handset. After the MR2 upgrade, Sony Ericsson ceased development for the phone. This decision from the Sony Ericsson management was an unfortunate move, because the phone still contained multiple bugs that made life difficult for its users. The phone still contains a serious bug that corrupts the SD-card's content, and makes it an unreliable tool for business-users. Many users confirmed this bug, and one user on the Xda-forum figured out the cause to this bug. Due to the dropped support from Sony Ericsson, a fix to the data-loss bug was introduced on the forum.|$|E

Its arc extinguishing capability is excellent compared to other breakers. But {{it has the potential}} to cause multi reignition surge by high extinguishing capability. Surge voltage is generated by the opening and closing of VCB. Multi reignition surge of VCB is steep-fronted waveform. It may have a detrimental effect on the motor winding insulation. So, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> install a protection device to limit steep-front waveform at the motor terminal or breaker side. So, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> install a protection device at the motor terminal or breaker side. This protective device is surge absorber(SA) such as ZnO and RC type.

40|$|Abstract. In an {{information}} retrieval (IR) context, users usually issue queries with few terms and no operators (e. g., and, or, +). However, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> ’ information needs involve more expressiveness (e. g., ‘Potato famine in Ireland, {{but not in}} Cork’). Our work deals with this category of queries that may be processed by geographic IR (GIR) systems to parse digital libraries according to spatial, temporal and topical criteria. We propose a GIR framework that supports expressive queries and aggregates results of a multi-criteria search. We also conduct experiments to verify that this approach improves the effectiveness of such search engines (improvement of 27 % for topical criteria only, and of 54 % for spatial and temporal criteria). ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Generally, grid {{services}} are implemented and deployed with {{various kinds of}} components. Intrinsically, this type of grid service ar-chitecture has unessential components only to use the small parts of function which provides. Hence, it can be criticized by reason of its own property like heaviness, redundancy and low performance. In real usage of grid service, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> would like to use a compact and flexible grid service because of convenience and easiness. In this paper, we have proposed flexible and compact grid service architecture for grid users. For the flexible service, we adopt a hierarchical structure and to achieve the property of compactness, we modularize our grid system architecture which can be deployed with existed Grid components. Conclusively, we show how to operate and implement our system. In addition, we present the result of experiments by using our system architecture with Medical Grid Service. ...|$|E
