Another benefit of the above information is that business owners {{will have the opportunity to}} know how much of their working capital will be devoted to technicians’ expenses. For instance, the highest number of technicians required for the routine and the overtime <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> was at period 3. For the routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks,</b> 31 technicians are required, while 26 technicians are required to cover the available overtime <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks.</b> The highest number of technicians for rework <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> was at periods 1 and 2.|$|R

40|$|Handling specialities of {{maintenance}} projects {{is a highly}} challenging task. On the one hand {{the operations of the}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> are fixed, and can be described with network or process planning methods. On the other hand the realization sequence of <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> depends on the risks and reliabilities. Therefore, traditional project and process planning methods are not well suited to manage the <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks.</b> In this paper a new multilevel planning method is introduced, where project constraints can be taken into account in determining the optimal <b>maintenance</b> project. <b>Tasks</b> which have to be realized can be ranked with our method based on their reliabilities or risk factors. The introduced procedures show how matrix-based methods can be applied for planning and scheduling the maintenance projects on the level of the whole system, the devices, the <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> and their operations...|$|R

40|$|A {{common problem}} in {{software}} maintenance {{is the lack}} of documentation required for carrying out the <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks.</b> Both expected and unexpected <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> use and produce important information, which is not systematically recorded during the evolution of a system. As a result, maintenance becomes unnecessarily hard. In this paper, we suggest the use of maintenance patterns to record information about <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> patterns are organized collections of software elements relevant for a particular maintenance concern. Such a pattern can be exploited for advanced tool support where the tool keeps track and guides the system developer step by step through a maintenance procedure. ...|$|R

50|$|The term tappet {{is widely}} used in {{relation}} to internal combustion engines, but imprecisely. It is most commonly encountered as a <b>maintenance</b> <b>task</b> for overhead valve engines, that of 'adjusting the tappets'. This operation adjusts the overall clearance in the valve actuation system: typically 20 thousandths of an inch (0.5 mm). The name arises {{because it is the}} clearance of the tappets that is being adjusted, even though the adjustment is not made to the tappets themselves.|$|E

On a user-friendly autoclave, the back door is swung open and the motor is quickly and easily lifted out with a forklift or simple spar hoist.|$|E

This paper presents an approach to evaluation {{of software}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>tasks</b> based on fuzzy screening. The construction of data set for the case study {{is based on the}} real data extracted from the maintenance repository available in a local very small software company. In the construction of data set participated researchers and experienced software experts from the selected company.

5000|$|Type 93 rev.1 torpedo was {{equipped}} with an oil-fueled twin-cylinder reciprocating engine. The engine used second type air gas, a code name for 98% pure, high-pressure oxygen—the word [...] "oxygen" [...] was not used for secrecy. It could easily explode if an oil spot remained inside the anfractuous air pipes. Cleaning pipes {{was the most important}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>task</b> on the Type 93 torpedo, and took four or five days. The practical use of the oxygen engine was top secret in the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the tanks}} were removable, this {{could only be}} done by first {{removing}} the outboard wing panel, and so was not a routine <b>maintenance</b> <b>task.</b> A drawback to the tanks {{was that there was}} no means of measuring remaining fuel quantity within the cells. Fuel was moved from the cells to the engine tanks by opening control valves within the bomb bay so that the fuel drained by gravity. Although the tanks were specified as self-sealing, vapor buildup within partially drained tanks made them explosive hazards in combat.|$|E

50|$|The {{drawback}} to the monobloc head is {{that access to}} the inside of the combustion chamber (the upper volume of the cylinder) becomes difficult. Access through the cylinder bore is restricted for machining the valve seats, or simply for inserting angled valves. An even more serious restriction is that for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>task</b> of de-coking and re-grinding the valve seats, a regular task on older engines. Rather than removing the cylinder head from above, the mechanic must now remove pistons, connecting rods and the entire crankshaft from beneath.|$|E
