5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E

25|$|A {{binary tree}} is a rooted tree {{that is also}} an ordered tree (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree {{naturally}} imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may {{be defined as the}} nodes connected to it a level below. Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> to distinguish left child from right child. But this still doesn't distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a one with right but no left child.|$|E

In 2005, Lin Yangchen published an article titled Singapore's Answer to Notre Dame de Paris in The Organ describing both instruments in detail (The Organ 334:8–10). He describes the unique situation presented by having separate organs in the same building, which <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> a dialogue between the Gallery and Choir Organs. In fact, this does happen during solemn occasions and when two organists are present. The choir and congregation are then accompanied separately, although {{this is no longer}} possible now {{that there is only one}} organ in the Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{unpredictable}} {{composition of}} the products (which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner) distinguishes fission from purely quantum-tunneling processes such as proton emission, alpha decay, and cluster decay, which give the same products each time. Nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons. Both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons, and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart. This <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction that releases energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.|$|E

25|$|Priesthood {{keys are}} conferred upon all {{the presidents of}} the quorums. A quorum is a group of priesthood holders who hold the same priesthood office. For a priesthood holder to {{exercise}} ecclesiastical power or authority, Latter Day Saints believe that a priesthood holder must have a specific set of keys or be authorized by one who holds those keys. Thus, even though a priesthood holder is called and ordained with general priesthood power, to formally lead others in the church or to conduct specific rites may also require specific keys not held by all priesthood holders. The existence of keys <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> a church hierarchy, in which particular priesthood holders specialize in a particular ecclesiastical function organized in a top-down manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{internet}} layer {{provides an}} unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol {{is the principal}} component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.|$|E
25|$|In {{the story}} of Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig (English: The Dream of Emperor Maximus), he is Emperor of Rome and marries a wondrous British woman, telling her that she may name her desires, to be {{received}} as a wedding portion. She asks that her father be given sovereignty over Britain, thus formalising the transfer of authority from Rome back to the Britons themselves. The marriage also <b>makes</b> <b>possible</b> British descendants, a point not lost on medieval kings. The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties, including those of Powys and Gwent, a role he also played for the rulers of medieval Galloway in Scotland, home to the Roman-era Novantae whose territory was also made independent of Roman rule by Maximus. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.|$|E
