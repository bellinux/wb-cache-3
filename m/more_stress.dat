5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put <b>more</b> <b>stress</b> on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he would read articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
5|$|The prototypes {{performed}} well; however, several design failings led to {{the loss}} of WB771 on 14 July 1954, when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three bolts, the tailplane was subject to considerably <b>more</b> <b>stress</b> than had been anticipated, and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue. Additionally, the prototypes were considerably tail heavy {{due to the lack of}} equipment in the nose; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened nose that also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes. The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on <b>more</b> <b>stress.</b> The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{established}} that couples experience and discuss romantic {{problems in their}} relationships. Various psychophysiological indicators have shown that when couples discuss romantic matters, they show increased levels of distress. In this study, {{we set out to}} understand the intersection between relationship work and several variables including the most frequent mode of communication, the impact of friends' approval on relationship work, and accompanying physiological processes associated with these interactions. Results revealed that emerging adults prefer to share romantic problems via fact-to-face interactions. Additionally, social network approval affects the frequency of relationship work for many partners. Finally, males tend to be significantly <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> when discussing romantic challenges than females, and partners appear <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> when discussing challenges with friends than with one another.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between Madagascar’s environment and the stress physiology of the red collared brown lemur, Eulemur collaris. Habitat disturbance in Madagascar is pervasive and lemurs possess many unique traits compared with other primates that are primarily attributed to environmental or nutritional stress. Glucocorticoids (GCs) like cortisol are stress indicators. The assessment of welfare in animals is a developing field of study, and stressors in natural habitat can be estimated by measuring GC metabolites (GCM) in faeces. The littoral forests of southeastern Madagascar {{are among the most}} endangered habitats in the world and Eulemur collaris is well adapted to survive in these forests. The red collared brown lemur is a mostly frugivorous and cathemeral lemur with an extraordinary ecological flexibility that allows it to tolerate a certain degree of habitat changes. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess whether the health state measured by GCM levels of animals which living in a degraded habitat is comparatively different than the state of con-specific individuals living in a more pristine area. For this we compared faecal GCM levels in wild adults Eulemur collaris in a degraded (Mandena) and an intact littoral forest (Sainte Luce) in South-eastern Madagascar over a one year period (February 2011 - January 2012). We analysed how GCM levels varied among reproductive stages and phenological seasons, using forest degradation, rank and sex as covariates. In general, lemurs at Mandena were <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> than lemurs at Sainte Luce. Lemurs showed higher GCM levels during the mating season, followed by gestation season, lactation season and the non-reproductive season. We found that females at Mandena were <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> than females at Sainte Luce during the gestation season. In relation to phenological seasons, individuals at Mandena were significantly <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> than individuals at Sainte Luce, and lemurs at Mandena were <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> during the lean season than lemurs at Sainte Luce. This study found no rank-related GCM levels. These results showed, as predicted, that lemurs in a degraded habitat are <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> and this has important implications for future conservation plans. Eulemur collaris is the largest frugivorous primate present in the littoral forest and is an important seed disperser, its presence is of vital importance for the forest per se. Due to its role of seed disperser, protecting this lemur species also means helping regeneration of degraded habitats...|$|R

The first hypothesis was rejected because the overall diurnal variation pattern of water relations was similar in all three species. There were quantitative differences in all parameters studied in various species from inland and coastal populations, and species also showed some individual differences in their responses to stress. The second hypothesis was accepted because coastal populations were generally <b>more</b> <b>stressed</b> in comparison to inland populations...|$|R

25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to <b>more</b> <b>stress</b> tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms out of sync with their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E
500|$|Thoroughbred {{horses are}} {{primarily}} bred for racing under saddle at the gallop. Thoroughbreds are often {{known for being}} either distance runners or sprinters, and their conformation usually reflects {{what they have been}} bred to do. Sprinters are usually well muscled, while stayers, or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer. The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse. Although there have been champion racehorses of every height, from Zenyatta who stood 17.2 hands, to Man o' War and Secretariat who both stood at 16.2 hands, down to Hyperion, who was only 15.1, the best racehorses are generally of average size. [...] Larger horses mature more slowly and have <b>more</b> <b>stress</b> on their legs and feet, predisposing them to lameness. [...] Smaller horses are considered by some to be at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them, especially in the starting gate.
