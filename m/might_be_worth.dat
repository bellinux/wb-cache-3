25|$|By the 1970s a new {{generation}} of sports agents were hawking the talents of players who knew baseball but didn't know how the business end of the game was played. The agents broke down what the teams were generating in revenue off of the players' performances. They calculated what their player <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> to energize a television contract, or provide more merchandise revenue, or put more fans into seats.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 60 class 411 and 11 class 415 {{have been built}} so far (units built after 2004 belong to the {{modified}} second generation ICE-T2 batch). Both classes work reliably. Austria's ÖBB purchased three units in 2007, operating them jointly with DB. It <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> noting that even though DB assigned the name ICE-T to class 411/415, the T originally did not stand for tilting, but for Triebwagen (railcar), as DB's marketing department at first deemed the top speed too low for assignment of the InterCityExpress brand and therefore planned to refer to this class as IC-T (InterCity-Triebwagen).|$|E
25|$|Tolkien's {{publisher}} was George Allen & Unwin Ltd. of London (A). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York {{arranged to}} publish Tolkien's {{books in the}} United States. Houghton Mifflin did not set their own type; rather they printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen & Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin's impressions did not identify which printing run {{they came out of}} or even a copyright date. This failure has led to intense confusion in the collectibles market. Very few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966. Hence people cannot be sure what they have or might be buying and therefore what it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth.</b>|$|E

500|$|The first {{downloadable}} content pack received mixed reception from IGN's Arthur Gies. [...] While {{he praised}} {{the design of}} the multiplayer maps, he noted that the lack of online players for War for Cybertron hurt the ability to play the new content online. [...] Gies stated that he attempted to host the two Escalation maps, adding that he waited for several minutes for players to join, but had no success. [...] "That's the problem", he stated. [...] "War for Cybertrons multiplayer is all-but-abandoned." [...] Gies went on to cite a peak population of approximately 4,600 players on Xbox Live, 800 on PlayStation Network, and only 158 players on the PC version {{at the time of his}} writing. [...] Despite the lack of online players he felt the content may fit a player's needs, stating [...] "If you've got nine other friends who bought War for Cybertron and can set up your own private matches, then Character and Map Pack 01 <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> checking out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Thirteen O'Clock", by Kornbluth, is {{generally}} regarded as the best story in {{the first issue of}} Stirring; Knight describes it as [...] "a delightful screwball fantasy", and adds that it made Kornbluth's reputation. [...] Other stories from later issues that have been well-received include [...] "The Long Wall", by Lowndes; [...] "The City in the Sofa", [...] "What Sorghum Says", [...] "The Golden Road", and [...] "The Words of Guru", all by Kornbluth; [...] "The Real Thrill" [...] by Blish; and [...] "The Goblins Will Get You", by Michel. Isaac Asimov contributed a story, [...] "The Secret Sense", which appeared in the March 1941 issue of Cosmic. [...] After Wollheim acquired the story, Asimov met with F. Orlin Tremaine, the editor of Comet—a competing science fiction magazine—and discovered that Tremaine was irate at the idea of a magazine that might [...] "siphon readership from magazines that paid" [...] by taking stories without paying the authors. [...] Tremaine felt that any author who contributed a story to these magazines should be blacklisted. Asimov acknowledged that a story of his would be appearing in Cosmic, but told Tremaine that he had been paid for it. [...] In Asimov's autobiographical anthology The Early Asimov he recalls that after hearing Tremaine's comments he requested a token payment of $5 from Wollheim; in Asimov's autobiography In Memory Yet Green the sequence of events is given slightly differently, with Asimov asking Wollheim for payment, or else for the story to be published under a pseudonym, before the story was published. [...] This was requested on the grounds that [...] "even though the story <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> nothing, my name was worth something". [...] Wollheim reluctantly agreed to a payment of $5, commenting that it was an effective word rate of $2.50 per word, since he was paying only for the use of Asimov's name. [...] Wollheim later commented that because of the payment he could sue Asimov for royalties whenever the latter's name appeared in print.|$|E

2500|$|Due to his {{willingness}} to articulate the most brutal possibilities, Kahn came to be disliked by some, although {{he was known as}} amiable in private, especially around children. Unlike most strategists, he was entirely willing to posit the form a post-nuclear world might assume. [...] Fallout, for example, would simply be another one of life's many unpleasantnesses and inconveniences, while the [...] "much-ballyhooed" [...] rise in birth defects would not doom mankind to extinction because a majority of survivors would remain unaffected by them. Contaminated food could be designated for consumption by the elderly, who would presumably die before the delayed onset of cancers caused by radioactivity. A degree of even modest preparationnamely, the fallout shelters, evacuation scenarios and civil defense drills now seen as emblematic of the [...] "Cold War"would give the population both the incentive and the encouragement to rebuild. He even recommended the government offer homeowners insurance against nuclear-bomb damage. Kahn felt that having a strong civil-defense program in place would serve as an additional deterrent, because it would hamper the other side's potential to inflict destruction and thus lessen the attraction of the nuclear option. A willingness to tolerate such possibilities, Kahn argued, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> sparing Europe the massive nuclear exchange more likely to occur under the pre-MAD doctrine.|$|E
