5|$|The Mexican {{state of}} Hidalgo, and the twin silver mining cities of Pachuca and Real del Monte (Mineral del Monte), have notable Cornish {{influences}} from the Cornish miners who settled there, with pasties being considered typical local cuisine.

The annual International Pasty Festival is held in Real del Monte for three days each October.|$|E
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
50|$|During the {{occupation}} of New Mexico by the United States Military starting in 1846, a military governor was appointed to oversee the area; military governors, at times, were assisted by civilian governors. In 1850, New <b>Mexico</b> <b>was</b> organized as a Territory, and the governor was appointed by the President of the United States. The office of Governor of the State of New <b>Mexico</b> <b>was</b> created in 1912 when New <b>Mexico</b> <b>was</b> officially admitted to the United States as the 47th state.|$|R

5|$|In {{a similar}} way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe/130Xe and 136Xe/130Xe are a {{powerful}} tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, the atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth (0.08parts per million) but Mars shows a greater abundance of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases from soon after Earth's formation.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which means it is not {{considered}} threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found {{in a number of}} protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> poor.|$|E

It is not until after the 1970s with the growth of demand from the United States and alliances with Colombian drug traffickers that cartels in <b>Mexico</b> <b>were</b> formed to control the production and distribution of narcotics.

5|$|The third Tom Swift series {{differs from}} the first two in that the setting is {{primarily}} outer space, although Swift Enterprises (located now in New <b>Mexico)</b> <b>is</b> occasionally mentioned. Tom Swift explores the universe in the starship Exedra, using a faster-than-light drive he has reverse-engineered from an alien space probe. He is aided by Benjamin Franklin Walking Eagle, a Native American who is Tom's co-pilot, best friend, and an expert computer technician, and Anita Thorwald, a former rival of Tom's who now works with him as a technician and whose right leg has been rebuilt to contain a miniature computer.|$|E
5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of South Dakota's natural lakes {{are located in the}} eastern half of the state, and most are the product of the most recent ice age. The title of largest natural lake is somewhat disputed; Lake Thompson is larger than Lake Poinsett, but Lake Poinsett has maintained its current size for a much longer period of time. Other major natural lakes include Lake Kampeska, Waubay Lake, Lake Madison, Lake Whitewood, and Lake Herman. Additionally, two large lakes, Big Stone Lake and Lake Traverse, form part of the border between South Dakota and Minnesota. The continental divide separating the drainage basin of Hudson Bay from that of the Gulf of <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> situated between these two lakes.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{has been}} an object of veneration in many {{cultures}} throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun {{was thought to be}} a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in <b>Mexico</b> <b>is</b> designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.|$|E
