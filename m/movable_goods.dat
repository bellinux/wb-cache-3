5|$|Marriage most {{commonly}} involved a betrothal (engue), before the bride was {{given over to}} her new husband and kyrios (ekdosis). A less common form of marriage, practised {{in the case of}} epikleroi, required a court judgement (epidikasia). Athenian women married with a dowry, which was intended to provide their livelihood. Depending on the family, a dowry might have been as much as 25 percent of the family's wealth. Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae. Rich families could provide much larger dowries; Demosthenes' sister, for instance, had a dowry of two talents (120 minae). Dowries usually consisted of <b>movable</b> <b>goods</b> and cash, although land was occasionally included.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 20 August 1462, Enrique's son Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia {{succeeded in}} {{capturing}} Gibraltar after launching a surprise attack. His {{success in the}} brief Eighth Siege of Gibraltar {{was due to the}} garrison being greatly depleted after its men of rank had left for Granada, with their retinues, to pay homage to the newly enthroned sultan Abu l-Hasan Ali. An initial assault by the Count of Arcos was beaten back with many casualties on both sides, but the men of the garrison realised that in their depleted state they could not withstand a second assault. They offered to surrender on condition that the garrison and inhabitants of Gibraltar would be allowed to leave with their wives, children and <b>movable</b> <b>goods,</b> with compensation to be paid for the property that they left behind. Although the proposal was welcomed, it fell through due to rivalry between the Christian commanders. The Moorish inhabitants of Gibraltar retreated to the castle and surrendered after a few days to Medina Sidonia. They were expelled along with the city's Jewish population, to be replaced by Spanish Christians.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a {{sequence}} of innovative but unpopular financial measures. John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total {{during the reign of}} the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied {{in the absence of any}} actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony. The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders. John created a new tax on income and <b>movable</b> <b>goods</b> in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriation}} of a found good is an offense, as stipulated by Art. 216 of the Criminal Code in two normative modalities.

The “found” good is a good that has been lost, forgotten or wandered by another person. The lost good (wandered) can only be a <b>movable</b> <b>good.</b> Immovable goods cannot be wandered and therefore cannot be found.

40|$|The Belgian, {{as well as}} the French, {{transfer}} system is often presented to be consensual, meaning that the obligatory agreement not only gives rise to the existence of contractual rights and obligations, but also triggers the proprietary effects of the agreement. However, from a comparative, as well as from a historical, point of view, not the consensus, but the delivery requirement seems to be essential for the transfer of <b>movable</b> corporeal <b>goods.</b> This research examines the possible existence of such a delivery requirement in the Belgian {{transfer system}} of <b>movable</b> corporeal <b>goods,</b> considering some exceptions, such as the so-called "retention of ownership clause", where the obligatory agreement and the transfer of property rights are separated from one another, and the "double sale" where the person who has first been given possession will prevail and will be considered as owner at the requirement that his possession is in good faith. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is one characterized by its constant {{search for new}} methods to finance and acquire new equipment as international markets develop. In this search, multiple legal and financial frameworks have been created resulting in economic flexibility for carriers, through very complex transactions. Inside this trend of financial arrangements {{the most frequently used}} method is to lease the equipment they need. The main concern related to these transactions is that aircrafts are highly movable assets that can travel to various jurisdictions. This faculty supposes a threat to lessors and owners' property interests over the aircraft because property law is encompassed into national laws and are not easily recognized in other countries in cases of controversies centered in a <b>movable</b> <b>good.</b> Chapter I of this thesis will focus on the different types of financing methods used by carriers to procure new equipment.

25|$|Friction {{intensified}} {{between the}} barons and the king. Henry repudiated the Provisions of Oxford and obtained a papal bull in 1261 exempting {{him from his}} oath. Both sides began to raise armies. Prince Edward, Henry's eldest son, was tempted to side with his godfather Simon de Montfort, and supported holding a Parliament in his father's absence, before he decided to support his father. The barons, under Montfort, captured most of south-eastern England. At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, Henry and Edward were defeated and taken prisoner. Montfort summoned the Great Parliament, regarded as the first English Parliament {{worthy of the name}} {{because it was the first}} time cities and burghs sent representatives. Edward escaped and raised an army. He defeated and killed Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Savage retribution was exacted on the rebels and authority was restored to Henry. Edward, having pacified the realm, left England to join Louis IX on the Ninth Crusade, funded by an unprecedented levy of one-twentieth of every citizen's <b>movable</b> <b>goods</b> and possessions. He was one of the last crusaders in the tradition aiming to recover the Holy Lands. Louis died before Edward's arrival and the result was anticlimactic; Edward's small force limited him to the relief of Acre and a handful of raids. Surviving a murder attempt by an assassin, Edward left for Sicily later in the year, never to return on crusade. The stability of England's political structure was demonstrated when Henry III died and his son succeeded as Edward I; the barons swore allegiance to Edward even though he did not return for two years.|$|E

60|$|When the “sacredness of property” is talked of, {{it should}} always be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed property. No man made the land. It is the {{original}} inheritance of the whole species. Its appropriation is wholly a question of general expediency. When private property in land is not expedient, it is unjust. The reverse {{is the case with}} property in movables, and in all things the product of labor: over these, the owner’s power both of use and of exclusion should be absolute, except where positive evil to others would result from it; but, in the case of land, no exclusive right should be permitted in any individual which can not be shown to be productive of positive good. To be allowed any exclusive right at all, over a portion of the common inheritance, while there are others who have no portion, is already a privilege. No quantity of <b>movable</b> <b>goods</b> which a person can acquire by his labor prevents others from acquiring the like by the same means; but, from {{the very nature of the}} case, whoever owns land keeps others out of the enjoyment of it. When land is not intended to be cultivated, no good reason can in general be given for its being private property at all. Even in the case of cultivated land, a man whom, though only one among millions, the law permits to hold thousands of acres as his single share, is not entitled to think that all this is given to him to use and abuse, and deal with as if it concerned nobody but himself. The rents or profits which he can obtain from it are at his sole disposal; but with regard to the land, in everything which he does with it, and in everything which he abstains from doing, he is morally bound, and should, whenever the case admits, be legally compelled to make his interest and pleasure consistent with the public good.|$|E

40|$|In {{some of the}} {{continental}} European countries (e. g.

Fonds de commerce represents a set of <b>movable</b> and immovable <b>goods</b> with a common destination, therefore having a unique legal status. Goodwill is an intangible asset item that is placed within the Balance Sheet. It holds together all the fonds de commerce elements which finally form a subset containing the following: (i) intangible assets; (ii) not evaluated, nor separately recorded; (iii) purchased, but not internally created; (iv) which compete for the maintenance and further development of the company’s activity potential.

Goodwill may be stated as the difference between the acquisition cost and the percentage belonging to the buyer within the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable acquired. In the advanced accounting systems, goodwill is no longer amortized. His useful life is undefined, but not unlimited. The fact that is no longer amortized determines an annual depreciation test.
