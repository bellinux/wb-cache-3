The forest ecosystem model (SIMA) was used to simulate the volume growth of young Norway spruce, Scots pine and silver birch stands under the current and gradually changing climate throughout Finland on sites with fertility varying from low to high. Compared with the current climate, the growth of Scots pine and silver birch increased under the changing climate throughout Finland. The increase was the highest on fertile sites under the SRESA 2 climate change scenario. The growth of Norway spruce decreased in southern and central Finland under the SRES A 1 B and A 2 climate change scenarios compared with the current climate, and especially on sites with low fertility. In northern Finland, the growth of Norway spruce was clearly higher under the changing climate similar to Scots pine and silver birch, regardless of site fertility and time span.

Investigation was targeted to six land cover classes. Multispectral laser scanner data can be used to distinguish land cover classes of the ground surface, including the roads and separate road surface classes. For forest inventory using point cloud metrics and intensity features combined, total accuracy of 93. 5 % was achieved for classification of three <b>main</b> boreal <b>tree</b> <b>species</b> (pine, spruce and birch). When using intensity features – without point height metrics - a classification accuracy of 91 % was achieved for these three <b>tree</b> <b>species.</b> It was also shown that deciduous trees can be further classified into more species. We propose that intensity-related features and waveform-type features are combined with point height metrics for forest attribute derivation in area-based prediction, which is an operatively applied forest inventory process in Scandinavia. It is expected that multispectral airborne laser scanning can provide highly valuable data for city and forest mapping and is a highly relevant data asset for national and local mapping agencies in the near future...|$|R

These studies have substantially improved {{the understanding of the}} impact on mechanical performance of structural timber of factors at the micro-structural level (e. g. cellulose structure and abundance) and at the forest-level (e. g. genetics, the environment and forest management).
