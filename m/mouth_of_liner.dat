40|$|Abstract. The yield {{strength}} <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> material affecting {{the performance of}} CNG-II composite cylinder was studied by finite element method (FEM) analysis. The {{yield strength}} <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> material 30 CrMo was changed from 730 MPa to 850 MPa with seven strength. The tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> material, structural parameters of CNG-II composite cylinder and winding parameters were fixed as the yield strength <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> material changing. The auto-frettage effects of CNG-II composite cylinder became worse and the fatigue life of CNG-II composite cylinder lowered with the increasing <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> yield strength. The yield strength <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> should be lowered to some extent for improving the performance of CNG-II composite cylinder {{in the production of}} CNG-II composite cylinder...|$|R

40|$|Key words: Liner system. Tensile force. Slope angle. FEM {{analysis}} Abstract. As {{there is}} a few area or topographic factors for landfill site, the slope angle becomes steeper because it makes much disposal capacity. Tensile force in the geotextile is caused by compaction work of disposed waste, and the tensile force is transferred into the liner system by friction, but the tensile force <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> system will change with a change of slope angle, so {{it is very important}} to determine the amount of tensile forces creating at the fixed ends <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> system for avoiding the tearing failure <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> system and designing the anchorage. In this paper, FEM analyses, in which the joint element was used to model the interface between the liner system, were conducted to estimate the tensile forces creating at the fixed ends <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> system with a change of slope angle from 1 : 2. 5 to 1 : 0. 2.

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the effect of crack length in the rocks {{penetrated}} by uneven-thickness-covered linear-shape tandem charges, ANSYS/LS-DYNA code is {{used to describe the}} penetration process of four kinds of rocks. The results indicate that this kind of charges can deepen the penetration depth of rocks than that <b>of</b> the single <b>liner.</b> The vary rates <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> thickness in the preposition charge and postposition charge can influence the jet length and rock crack obviously. It is found that the penetrated crack length is mainly determined by yield strength of rocks and by the vary rate <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> thickness. Therefore, the appropriate vary rate <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> thickness in postposition charge can be adjusted for tandem linear shaped charge to obtain a better penetrating effect in rock blasting engineering. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{bentonite}} {{alone or}} amended with natural soils for construction <b>of</b> <b>liners</b> for water-retention and waste- containment facilities is very common.

At a given clay content, the hydraulic conductivity increases with an increase in the size of the coarser fraction. But when the clay content is more than that which can be accommodated within the voids of the coarser fractions, the hydraulic conductivity is controlled primarily by clay content alone. Four different methods of predicting hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> the <b>liners</b> are presented. Using two constants, related to the liquid limit, the hydraulic conductivity can be predicted at any void ratio...|$|R
