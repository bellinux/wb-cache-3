In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was {{due to lack of}} airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
