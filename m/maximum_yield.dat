25|$|Growth {{overfishing}} {{occurs when}} fish are harvested {{at an average}} size that is smaller than the size that would produce the <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the total yield less {{than it would be}} if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> per recruit.|$|E
25|$|There are twelve main appellations of Beaujolais wines {{covering}} {{the production of}} more than 96 villages in the Beaujolais region. They were originally established in 1936, with additional crus being promoted in 1938 and 1946, plus Régnié in 1988. About half of all Beaujolais wine is sold under the basic Beaujolais AOC designation. The majority of this wine is produced in the southern Bas Beaujolais region located around the town of Belleville. The minimum natural alcohol level for the grapes is 10%, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> is 60 hl/ha (65 hl/ha for a bumper crop) The wine may be labeled as Beaujolais Supérieur in case the minimum natural alcohol level for the grapes is 10,5%, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> is 58 hl/ha (63 hl/ha for a bumper crop). Exactly the same limits are effective for Beaujolais-Villages. Maximum chaptalization levels are established at 3 g/l (glucose + fructose).|$|E

In theory, {{it had a}} <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> of 100 megatons {{if it were to}} have {{included}} a U-238 tamper, but because only one bomb was built, this was never demonstrated. The single bomb was detonated at the Sukhoy Nos cape of Severny Island, part of Novaya Zemlya. It was decided that a full 100 Mt detonation would create too great a risk of nuclear fallout, as well as a near certainty that the release plane and crew would be destroyed before it could escape the blast radius.|$|E
25|$|The {{hot wire}} method for the {{production}} of KrF2 uses krypton in a solid state with a hot wire running a few centimeters away from it as fluorine gas is then run past the wire. The wire has a large current, causing it to reach temperatures around 680°C. This causes the fluorine gas to split into its radicals, which then can react with the solid krypton. Under ideal conditions, it has been known to reach a <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> of 6g/h. In order to achieve optimal yields the gap between the wire and the solid krypton should be 1cm, giving rise to a temperature gradient of about 900°C/cm. A major downside to this method is the amount of electricity that has to be passed through the wire. It is dangerous if not properly set up.|$|E
25|$|The {{torpedo scad}} is an {{important}} species to commercial fisheries in parts of Asia, and as such has had significant research published on its biology and ecology. All of this information is published in relatively obscure Indian journals and is unavailable to most institutions. The torpedo scad is a predatory fish which both consumes larger prey and filter feeds to consume planktonic organisms. Larger prey items include a variety of fish and cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish. Smaller foods are mostly crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, stomatopods, cladocerans and crabs. Molluscs and gastropods are also reported to be minor constituents of the diet of the species. The species also appears to have dietary shifts as it grows, however in all size classes fish are the dominant prey. Species recorded as being predators of torpedo scad include species of drums and requiem shark. Each sex of the torpedo scad reach sexual maturity at different lengths; females are mature by 22cm and males by 26.4cm. Other studies have suggested similar lengths, including 17cm in males and 27cm in females, {{as well as an}} average of 25cm in both sexes. Spawning has not been directly observed, however peaks in larval abundance are known from March to July, with a peak in June in India. the eggs are pelagic, and are spherical and transparent with a yolk and single oil globule. The larval stage is extensively described, with the species having 24 myomeres. The growth of the species is not reported, however numerous morphometric (length vs weight) studies have been carried out on the species. The population structure in Indian waters has also been well studied, with the most recent of these suggesting a major recruitment event occurs between May and August. These studies also guide fisheries regulations, with a theoretical <b>maximum</b> <b>yield</b> achieved when fish are only taken once they reach 18cm.|$|E
