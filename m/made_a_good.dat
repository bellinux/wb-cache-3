5|$|By this stage, Yorkshire {{regarded}} Yardley as {{the heir}} to Brian Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At {{the end of the}} 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to Wally Hammond. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other Tests on the tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E

5|$|Craig <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{start to}} the tour in two warm-up matches against Rhodesia, scoring a century in each match. Australia won the matches by an innings and ten wickets respectively. Craig led his men in five {{first-class}} matches before the Tests and Australia won all by convincing margins; three ended in innings victories {{and the others were}} won by nine and ten wickets. This included a match against a South African XI, in which Craig scored 88 as Australia amassed 8/519 declared before winning by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Despite City {{finishing}} {{outside the}} play-off places, they were again installed as favourites for promotion by bookmakers for the 2008–09 season. McCall released 13players from his squad and {{replaced them with}} a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign. McCall's side <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league – the first time City had led the table in seven years.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star {{performer}} as he took 7–77 and 5–32, {{but this time he}} did well with the bat and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E

Selma sends the Simpsons a tape of their honeymoon, {{including}} Sideshow Bob's tirade over {{the absence of a}} gas fireplace in their hotel room. Bart realizes that Selma has one hour to live and the Simpsons rush to the hotel room.|$|E
5|$|The fourth caution {{came out}} on lap 181 because of debris on the back straightaway. The first nine {{positions}} stayed off of pit road while the rest made pit stops. On lap 186, Hamlin <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start and maintained the first position. On lap 188, Jimmie Johnson, who restarted twelfth, had moved up to the sixth position. On lap 193, Hamlin had a growing lead over Kahne. Denny Hamlin crossed the line to win the race, a second ahead of second place Kasey Kahne. Kurt Busch maintained third while Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart finished fourth and fifth.|$|E

5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC being described as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel they had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC {{with a group of}} core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new experiences for players.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thesis topic.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{start to}} the 1919 season and, despite a brief spell of failure through over-aggression, batted consistently. He scored a double century for Surrey against a touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team and centuries {{in each of the}} three Gentlemen v Players matches—the only player ever to do so in one season. His rescheduled benefit match raised £1,670, money he used to open a sports shop in London. The shop was {{successful}} and he ran it until just before his death. The additional income gave him considerable financial independence. In total that year, Hobbs scored 2,594 runs in first class matches, more than anyone else, at an average of 60.32. After a winter working in his shop, his good form continued into 1920. Four of his eleven first-class centuries came in consecutive innings in June, and he totalled 2,827 runs at 58.89. He also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire, and his 17 wickets at an average of 11.82 placed him at the top of the Surrey bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he had been told that the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start, moving from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E

5|$|On the forty-eighth lap, {{debris in}} turn two {{brought out the}} second caution. Robby Gordon and David Gilliland stayed out while the other teams made pit stops. Gordon and Gilliand made pit stops the next lap and gave the lead to Kurt Busch. Kurt Busch brought the field to the green flag with Hamlin in second, Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kahne in fifth on lap 51. After Hamlin <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> restart he passed Kurt Busch on lap 52. Afterward, on lap 54, Landon Cassill {{returned}} to the track while J.J. Yeley returned to the garage. Kahne passed Montoya for the third position. After 67 laps, Hamlin had a 2.4second lead over Kurt Busch in the second position. On lap 87, green flag pit stops began. One lap later, most drivers in the first ten positions made pit stops. Denny Hamlin, {{who was in the}} first position, came to pit road on lap 92, but had problems leaving which gave Kurt Busch the lead.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reference}} to the nickname of Senators was in a game report ("The Ottawas <b>Made</b> <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> Start") of the Ottawa Journal on January 7, 1901 and used in other newspapers around that time. While the nickname was used occasionally, the club continued {{to be known as}} the Ottawa Hockey Club. In 1909, a separate Ottawa Senators pro team existed in the Federal League. Ottawa newspapers referred to that club as the Senators, and the Ottawa HC as 'Ottawa', 'Ottawas' or the 'Ottawa Pro Hockey Club'. The Globe newspaper of Toronto first refers to the Ottawa Hockey Club as the Senators in an article entitled 'Quebec defeated Ottawa' on December 30, 1912. Eventually this became the official nickname, and was the only name used in descriptions of the club in NHL play.|$|E
5|$|He had eleven known children, all by Elizabeth. His eldest son, and heir, John, Earl of Lincoln (c. 1462–16 June 1487), eventually, due to King Richard III {{losing his}} own son, became heir to his {{maternal}} uncle's throne. Following Richard's death at Bosworth Field, Lincoln rebelled {{against the new}} king Henry VII, and himself was killed at the Battle of Stoke. John de la Pole's second son, Geoffrey, was born circa 1464, but died young. Next, Edward (1466–1485) joined the church and became Archdeacon of Richmond. John de la Pole's first daughter, Elizabeth (c. 1468–1489), married Henry Lovel, 8th Baron Morley (1466–1489), and had no issue. John's dukedom descended to his fourth son, Edmund (1471–30 April 1513), who had to bargain energetically with the king and pay a substantial amount before it was granted. He eventually became a Yorkist pretender to Henry VIII's crown, who had him beheaded. Another daughter, Dorothy, {{who was born in}} 1472, died young, whilst next, Humphrey (1474–1513) took Holy Orders, while Anne (1476–1495) became a nun. John's final daughter, Katherine (c. 1477–1513), <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> marriage to William, Baron Stourton, with whom she had no issue. John de la Pole's two youngest sons both seem to have been involved in a plot against Henry VII that was discovered in 1501. Sir William de la Pole, of Wingfield Castle (1478–1539) was imprisoned in the Tower of London, for thirty-seven years. Before this he had married Katherine Stourton; she was twenty years older than him, and they had no issue. The youngest son, Richard de la Pole (1480–1525), managed to escape to France on the discovery of the 1501 plot. Taking part in France's campaigns during the Italian Wars, he was killed at the Battle of Pavia, 24 February 1525.|$|E
