5|$|Legacy of the Drow is a tetralogy, {{unlike the}} {{previous}} two trilogies. The 1993 short story, Dark <b>Mirror,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Realms of Valor anthology, describes events {{just prior to the}} series. The first three books, The Legacy, Starless Night, and Siege of Darkness, describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is seemingly slain by a yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the Time of Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends.|$|E

The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E

5|$|Soma meets Arikado, who is {{initially}} angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma {{a letter and}} a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals. Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him. Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into the <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma {{to come to the}} castle's center.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{features}} {{raster graphics}} on a CRT monitor displaying 4096 colors and amplified stereophonic sound. The visuals are reflected into view via a <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabinet. The arcade cabinet is upright, with the marquee bearing the game's name protruding outward. There are large, blue plastic molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon. The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto Yagishita of Zuntata, Taito's music division. A soundtrack CD (a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids) {{was released by}} Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21, 1991.

25|$|The {{commercialization of}} Huichol art began when a Franciscan priest {{by the name}} of Ernesto Loera Ochoa began a Huichol museum at the Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan just north of Guadalajara. One of the artists {{exhibited}} here was Ramón Medina Silver, whose work was exhibited and sold at the museum. Medina’s work {{came to the attention of}} American Peter Furst, who suggested that Ramón represent the traditions and beliefs of his people by pressing colored yarn into a wax and resin-covered baseboard. These yarn paintings first appeared in 1962 in Guadalajara and were derived from “nierikas” a small board or disc with a hole or <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center. Nierikas were initially produced by shamans to represent visions they experienced while consuming peyote, then left as offerings to the gods in places such as caves, temples and streams.|$|E
25|$|If {{a single}} photon is emitted into the entry port of the {{apparatus}} at the lower-left corner, it immediately encounters a beam-splitter. Because {{of the equal}} probabilities for transmission or reflection the photon will either continue straight ahead, be reflected by the mirror at the lower-right corner, and be detected by the detector {{at the top of}} the apparatus, or it will be reflected by the beam-splitter, strike the <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper-left corner, and emerge into the detector at the right edge of the apparatus. Observing that photons show up in equal numbers at the two detectors, experimenters generally say that each photon has behaved as a particle from the time of its emission to the time of its detection, has traveled by either one path or the other, and further affirm that its wave nature has not been exhibited.|$|E

25|$|On 20 March 2017 the Mirror {{painted the}} {{traditional}} Russian pancake celebration Maslenitsa as a Hooligan training ground. One of the centuries-old tradition in this Russian festival is “wall-to-wall” (‘’, Ru) which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes. This tradition was wrongly {{represented by the}} <b>Mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pictures and text, labeled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all. The Mirror article was titled “Russia's Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup.”, and received negative receptions from Russian media and was also labeled as Fake news. The organizers of the traditional Russian folk festival event are looking to sue the Daily Mirror, it is reported later. Representatives of Daily Mirror acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival. In the updated version of the article the newspaper continues {{to insist that the}} photographed people were hooligans in the pictures, but gives no evidence of their participation in the festival.|$|E

500|$|The {{motel room}} that Cranston and Beaver appear in {{was a set}} {{constructed}} by Breaking Bad production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Director Michelle MacLaren wanted a genuine [...] "rundown motel feel", but believed {{it would be too}} difficult to film in an actual motel room because it would be too small for the cast and crew to fit inside. Instead, the set was designed so that several of the walls could be removed to make space for the cameras and crew. This allowed greater flexibility in shooting and camera angles, and the walls could be placed back into position if they were needed for the background of a shot. The first shot of the episode includes Walter speaking directly into the camera, and it quickly revealed he is speaking into a <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> motel room. MacLaren filmed the shot so it would be deliberately disorienting and unclear to the viewer where Walter was until the camera movement revealed the motel room. New York magazine writer Logan Hill interpreted Walter's speaking into the mirror as a symbol for self-reflection: [...] "He stares at a mirror reflection of himself, studying his own image, wondering if the Walt other people see gives any hint of what he’s carrying inside." ...|$|E

500|$|Since The Guardian (formerly The Manchester Guardian) {{moved to}} London in 1964, no major {{national}} paper {{is based in}} the North, and Northern news stories tend to be poorly covered in the national press. The Yorkshire Post promotes itself as [...] "Yorkshire's national paper" [...] and covers some national and international stories, but is primarily focused on news from Yorkshire and the North East. An attempt in 2016 to create a dedicated North-focused national newspaper, 24, failed after six weeks. Across Northern England as a whole, The Sun is the best selling newspaper, but the ongoing boycott around Merseyside following the newspaper's coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster has seen the paper fall behind both the Daily Mail and the Daily <b>Mirror</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North West. In general national readership in the North drags behind that of the South; the Mirror and the Daily Star are the only national papers with more readers in Northern England than in the South East and London. Local newspapers are the top-selling titles in both the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, although Northern regional newspapers have seen steep declines in readership in recent years. Only seven daily Northern papers have circulation figures above 25,000 as of June 2016: Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo, Hull Daily Mail, Newcastle Chronicle, The Yorkshire Post and The Northern Echo.|$|E
