5|$|Frazier {{demands to}} inspect the hostages before {{allowing}} the robbers to leave and Russell takes him {{on a tour of}} the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another of the robbers. Afterwards he explains that he deliberately tried to provoke Russell and judges that the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a killer. However, this is disproven when the robbers execute one of the hostages.|$|E
5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E

5|$|The {{palladium}} core in the arc reactor {{that keeps}} Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and {{choosing not to}} tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{poems in}} the sequence recommend the benefits of marriage and children. With the famous Sonnet 18 ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day") the tone changes dramatically towards romantic intimacy. Sonnet 20 explicitly laments that the young <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a woman. Most of the subsequent sonnets describe {{the ups and downs}} of the relationship, culminating with an affair between the poet and the Dark Lady. The relationship seems to end when the Fair Youth succumbs to the Lady's charms (Sonnet 144).|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E
25|$|The fate of Israel is {{of central}} concern because Israel is the elect people of God through whom God's redemptive {{work is done}} in the world. However tragic human {{suffering}} is on the human plane, what happens to Israel is directly tied to its role as that nation to which God attaches His name and through which He will redeem man. He who strikes Israel, therefore, engages himself in battle with God and {{it is for this reason}} that the history of Israel is the fulcrum of human history. The suffering of others must, therefore, be seen in the light of Israel's suffering. The travail of <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> abandoned, precisely because Israel suffers and, thereby, God's presence is drawn into human history and redemption enters the horizon of human existence.|$|E

50|$|The law {{holds for}} the A and E {{proposition}}s of the Aristotelian square of opposition. For example, the A proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' and the E proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since no one can <b>be</b> honest and <b>not</b> honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, and some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> For if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, the proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false. And if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> honest, the proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false also.|$|R
25|$|Anne realises the 'doctor' did not {{examine the}} dead man in an {{appropriate}} manner, and becomes suspicious. After fruitless investigations at Mill House, where she finds an undeveloped canister of film, Anne discovers that Kilmorden Castle {{is the name of}} a ship sailing on 17 January 1922 from Southampton to Cape Town. She books passage on it. On board the ship, Anne meets Suzanne Blair, Colonel Race, and Sir Eustace Pedler himself. In addition to his normal secretary, Guy Pagett, he has employed a man who goes by the name of Harry Rayburn. At 1:00 am {{on the morning of the}} 22nd, a young man staggers into Anne's cabin having been stabbed. Anne is able to dress the man's slight wound but the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in the least bit grateful and leaves after an altercation with her.|$|E
25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers {{over and over again}}, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} {{over and over again in}} such a way or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E
25|$|Under British law, the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{part of the}} United Kingdom. However, the UK {{takes care}} of its {{external}} and defence affairs, and retains paramount power to legislate for the island. There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man, although HMS Ramsey is affiliated with the town of the same name. From 1938 to 1955 there was the Manx Regiment of the British Territorial Army, which saw extensive action during the Second World War. In 1779, the Manx Fencible Corps, a fencible regiment of three companies, was raised; it was disbanded in 1783 {{at the end of}} the American War of Independence. Later, the Royal Manx Fencibles was raised at the time of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. The 1st Battalion (of 3 companies) was raised in 1793. A 2nd Battalion (of 10 companies) was raised in 1795, and it saw action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The regiment was disbanded in 1802. A third body of Manx Fencibles was raised in 1803 to defend the Island during the Napoleonic Wars and to assist the Revenue. It was disbanded in 1811. In 2015 a multi-capability recruiting and training unit of the British Army Reserve was established in Douglas.|$|E

25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E
