Another advantage is that <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> apertures can be precisely placed in time, and matched to each other in duration, due to the RACE's ability to be easily integrated on a monolithic integrated circuit. A further advantage is the RACE's tolerance of aberrations {{at the beginning and end}} of the control signal.|$|E

50|$|Like other {{encoding}} formats, ADX supports <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> frequencies such as 22050 Hz, 44100 Hz, 48000 Hz, etc. {{however, the}} output sample depth is locked at 16bits, generally {{due to the}} lack of precision already mentioned. It supports multiple channels but there seems to be an implicit limitation of stereo (2 channel) audio although the file format itself can represent up to 255 channels. The only particularly distinctive feature that sets ADX apart from alternatives like IMA ADPCM (other than having a different prediction function) is the integrated looping functionality, this enables an audio player to optionally skip backwards after reaching a single specified point in the track to create a coherent loop; hypothetically, this functionality could be used to skip forwards as well but that would be redundant since the audio could simply be clipped with an editing program instead.|$|E

5000|$|... ==== Sampling ==== In a {{classroom}} setting or {{in a program}} level assessment, it is often possible to assess {{the entire population of}} interest, referred to as a census. However, it is sometimes impractical or ineffective to assess an entire population, due to the time and effort involved as well as survey fatigue if the same group of students are being asked to take multiple surveys. Therefore, sampling strategies can be used to pick a subset of the population of interest. The goal of sampling is to select a smaller group that represents the population on key characteristics. <b>Multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> approaches are commonly used in higher education assessment, including random and stratified sampling. In a random sample, each individual is equally likely to be selected. In a stratified sample, individuals are grouped based on specific characteristics of interest and then randomly selected from each group to ensure adequate numbers of each group.|$|E

The 12 -bit SAR ADC using the proposed <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> method decreases the A/D conversion time by repeatedly converting a pixel output to 4 -bit after the first 12 -bit A/D conversion, reducing noise of the CIS by one over the square root {{of the number of}} samplings. The area of the 12 -bit SAR ADC is reduced by using a 10 -bit capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with four scaled reference voltages. In addition, a simple up/down counter-based digital processing logic is proposed to perform complex calculations for <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> and digital correlated double sampling. To verify the proposed <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> method, a 256 × 128 pixel array CIS with 12 -bit SAR ADCs was fabricated using 0. 18 μm CMOS process.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} a pixel level analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuit for hybrid CMOS image sensors. There are several methods to increase the dynamic range of the sensor through the readout algorithm. The <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> method can increase the dynamic range (DR) without a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The idea is to acquire several images during one frame. Based on the <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> method, the method described in this thesis uses the special feature of the pinned photodiode to select the charge transfer time locally to change the total integration time in one frame based on the input light intensity. The comparator is reused during the different conversion phases to save power and area. Only one comparison is needed after each charge transfer, so compared with traditional <b>multiple</b> <b>sampling</b> method for DR enhancement this method can save a lot of power. In-pixel memory is used to store the converted data, and these data are read by column wise current sense amplifiers. The simulation results show that the charge transfer of the pinned photo diode is controlled locally and for a 7 -bit dynamic range enhancement the additional power is only 2. 2 % compared with no DR enhancement.

40|$|International audienceThe {{subject of}} {{antialiasing}} techniques has been actively explored {{for the past}} 40 years.

Computing <b>multiple</b> <b>samples</b> (MSAA) can be very costly depending on {{the complexity of the}} shading, {{or in the case of}} raytracing. Moreover, image-space techniques like deferred shading are incompatible with hardware implementation of MSAA since the lighting stage is decorrelated from the geometry stage. A filter based approach called Morphological Antialiasing (MLAA) was recently introduced [2009]. This technique does not need <b>multiple</b> <b>samples</b> and can efficiently be implemented on CPU using vector instructions. However, this filter is not linear and requires deep branching and image-wise knowledge which can be very inefficient on graphics hardware.
