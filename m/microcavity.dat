2500|$|The {{most common}} types of optical {{cavities}} consist of two facing plane (flat) or spherical mirrors. The simplest {{of these is}} the plane-parallel or Fabry–Pérot cavity, consisting of two opposing flat mirrors. While simple, this arrangement is rarely used in large-scale lasers due to the difficulty of alignment; the mirrors must be aligned parallel within a few seconds of arc, or [...] "walkoff" [...] of the intracavity beam will result in it spilling out of the sides of the cavity. However, this problem is much reduced for very short cavities with a small mirror separation distance (L < 1nbsp&cm). Plane-parallel resonators are therefore commonly used in microchip and <b>microcavity</b> lasers and semiconductor lasers. In these cases, rather than using separate mirrors, a reflective optical coating may be directly applied to the laser medium itself. The plane-parallel resonator is also the basis of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 c {{shows the}} {{variation}} in the lasing threshold density as {{the size of the}} ZnO <b>microcavities</b> changed. Note that the larger-sized ZnO <b>microcavities</b> had a lower lasing threshold density than the smaller <b>microcavities</b> because the larger volume of the cavities increased the length of the optical gain. Thus, RL could be easily achieved. In addition, the number of resonance modes clearly increased as the size of the cavities increased. The number of lasing modes was also directly related {{to the size of the}} <b>microcavities.</b> Figure  4 c also shows the number of lasing modes as a function of the size of the <b>microcavities</b> just above their lasing threshold. For the smallest <b>microcavities,</b> only four peaks were observed. As the size of the <b>microcavities</b> increased further, the number of lasing modes increased. The finite size of the cavities limited the number of lasing modes as a result of the gain competition between the random lasing <b>microcavities.</b> If the path loop of the cavity mode spatially overlapped other cavity loops, the lasing behavior did not occur. These results were in agreement with the theoretical calculation for RL [29].|$|R

Richly illustrated, with chapter summaries and ample range of exercises throughout the book. Combines basic theoretical concepts with descriptions of recent experiments.

This book addresses the large variety of optical phenomena taking place in confined solid state structures: <b>microcavities.</b> Realisations include planar and pillar <b>microcavities,</b> whispering gallery modes, and photonic crystals. The <b>microcavities</b> represent a unique laboratory for quantum optics and photonics. They exhibit a number of beautiful effects including lasing, superfluidity, superradiance, entanglement etc. Written by four practitioners strongly involved in experiments and theories of <b>microcavities,</b> it is addressed to any interested reader having a general physical background, but in particular to undergraduate and graduate students at physics faculties. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|Compound optical <b>microcavity</b> systems provide {{beneficial}} spectral controls. These controls impact both phonon laser {{action and}} cooling and define some finely spaced optical levels whose transition energies are proportional to phonon energies. These level spacings are continuously tunable {{by a significant}} adjustment of optical coupling. Therefore, amplification and cooling occur around a tunable line center, in contrast with some cavity optomechanical phenomena. The creation of these finely spaced levels does not require increasing the optical <b>microcavity</b> dimensions. Hence, these finely spaced levels do not affect the optomechanical interaction strength in a significant degree. [...] The approach uses intermodal coupling, induced by radiation pressure and can also provide a spectrally selective mean to detect phonons. Moreover, some evidences of intermodal cooling are observed {{in this kind of}} experiments and thus, there is an interest in optomechanical cooling.

40|$|Organic <b>microcavities</b> are {{photonic}} nanostructures that strongly confine {{the electromagnetic}} field, allowing exotic quantum regimes of light-matter interaction with disordered organic semiconductors. The unambiguous {{interpretation of the}} spectra of organic <b>microcavities</b> has been a long-standing challenge due to several competing effects involving electrons, vibrations and cavity photons.

40|$|Exciton-polaritons in {{semiconductor}} <b>microcavities</b> generate fascinating effects such as long-range {{spatial coherence}} and Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC), which are attractive for their potential use in low threshold lasers, vortices and slowing light, etc. However, currently most of exciton-polariton effects either occur at cryogenic temperature or rely on expensive cavity fabrication procedures. Further exploring new semiconductor <b>microcavities</b> with stronger exciton photon interaction strength is extensively needed. Herein, we demonstrate room temperature photon exciton strong coupling in hybrid inorganic-organic CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 Fabry-Pérot <b>microcavities</b> {{for the first}} time. The vacuum Rabi splitting energy is up to 390 meV, which is ascribed to large oscillator strength and photon confinement in reduced dimension of optical <b>microcavities.</b> With increasing pumping energy, exciton-photon coupling strength is weakened due to carrier screening effect, leading to occurrence of photonic lasing instead of polartion lasing.

50|$|The {{coupling}} {{of the two}} oscillators, photons modes in {{the semiconductor}} optical <b>microcavity</b> and excitons of the quantum wells, results in the energy anticrossing of the bare oscillators, giving rise to the two new normal modes for the system, known as {{the upper and lower}} polariton resonances (or branches). The energy shift is proportional to the coupling strength (dependent, e.g., on the field and polarization overlaps). The higher energy or upper mode (UPB, upper polariton branch) is characterized by the photonic and exciton fields oscillating in-phase, while the LPB (lower polariton branch) mode is characterized by them oscillating with phase-opposition. <b>Microcavity</b> exciton-polaritons inherit some properties from both of their roots, such as a light effective mass (from the photons) and a capacity to interact with each other (from the strong exciton nonlinearities) and with the environment (including the internal phonons, which provide thermalization, and the outcoupling by radiative losses). In most cases the interactions are repulsive, at least between polariton quasi-particles of the same spin type (intra-spin interactions) and the nonlinearity term is positive (increase of total energy, or blueshift, upon increasing density).|$|E

40|$|Communication oraleThe recent {{development}} of interbranch optical parametric oscillation (OPO) in 2 D vertical coupled <b>microcavities</b> [1] or 1 D <b>microcavities</b> [2] opens new path towards {{the realization of}} monolithic micro-OPOs and for the generation of twin photon beams useful in quantum optics applications. It is now well established that very large Chi(3) polaritonic non-linearities in semiconductor <b>microcavities</b> operating in the strong-coupling regime [3] {{can be used to}} achieve low-threshold OPO. In conventional planar <b>microcavities,</b> the required phase-matching is obtained thanks to the strong coupling of excitons and photons. Nevertheless, single planar <b>microcavities</b> suffer from several drawbacks that prevent its use as a convenient device: (i) the required strong light-matter coupling regime is achieved only at low temperature, (ii) the pump laser must be adjusted to a specific angle, (iii) signal and idler beams are intrinsically strongly un-balanced, thus precluding practical applications. Alternatively, it has been demonstrated that interbranch parametric scattering in coupled <b>microcavities</b> allows to relax the requirement for a strong-coupling regime, thus leading to higher operating temperature [1]. In the present work, we show that interbranch parametric scattering in 1 D <b>microcavities</b> also allows to relax this constraint as well as to generate efficient signal and idler beams with balanced intensities. The OPO regime is achieved and studied both at 4 K in the strong-coupling regime, as well as above 100 K in the weak-coupling regime. [1] C. Diederichs, et al., Nature 440, 904 (2006). [2] G.
