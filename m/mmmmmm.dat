Cavanagh approached Pålsson to compose VVVVVV after playing Space Phallus, an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him. [...] Pålsson {{wrote on the}} Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was [...] "amazed at the depth {{that came with the}} games, even though they were small and short." [...] In writing the music for VVVVVV, Pålsson aimed to make [...] "uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds whether you want to or not, hopefully so much so that you’d go humming on them when not playing, and making you {{want to come back to}} the game even more." [...] The complete soundtrack, titled PPPPPP, was released alongside VVVVVV and is sold as a music download or CD on Pålsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled <b>MMMMMM</b> which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy. [...] The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks.|$|E

This thesis measures and analyses the perfor-mance of the internal mechanisms of the system, including all of the sys-tem calls, interprocess communication mechanisms and process migra-tion.

40|$|International audienceMechanistic {{features}} of the isoselective polymerization of styrene promoted by racemic allyl ansa-lanthanidocene complexes rac-{CMe 2 (Ind) 2 }Ln(allyl) (THF) n (Ind = 5 -indenyl; allyl = C 3 H 5, n = 1, Ln = Y (1), Nd (2); allyl = 1, 3 -(SiMe 3) 2 C 3 H 3, n = 0, Ln = Y (3), Nd (4)), which act as unique single-component catalysts, have been investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. Combined 1 H NMR and MALDI−ToF−MS analyses conducted on low molecular weights isotactic polystyrene (iPS) produced by compounds 1 or 2 established the presence of allyl end-groups and therefore that polymerization is initiated by insertion of styrene into Ln−C(allyl). 1 H, 2 D, and 13 C NMR analyses performed on H(D) -iPS-nBu polymers, selectively produced by coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of styrene with the binary system 3 /Mg(nBu) 2 (1 : 10), evidenced that the polymerization is highly regioselective and proceeds in a secondary insertion mode, both in the initiation and propagation steps. Microstructural analyses of the backbone of crude (unfractionated) polymers produced with 1 − 4 evidenced a virtually perfect isoselective (<b>mmmmmm</b> > 0. 99) polymerization up to 120 °C. Stereoerrors observed in the 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectra of the iPS produced at 130 °C with 1 − 4 are consistent with an enantiomorphic site control operative during the polymerization. DFT computations {{of the first and}} second insertions of styrene in 3 confirmed the above features and the overall mechanistic scenario...|$|E
