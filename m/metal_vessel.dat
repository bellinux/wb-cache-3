40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>vessels</b> {{made from}} {{precious}} materials are often noticeably {{absent from the}} archaeological record. This dearth of precious <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> is especially acute on Crete during the Middle Minoan period. Considering the vital role of metals in the socio-economic life of ancient societies, the loss of precious <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> represents a critical gap {{in our understanding of}} Minoan society during this period. Rather than relying on the fortuitous discovery of <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> in future excavations, this study offers an alternative method of 2 ̆ 2 recovering 2 ̆ 2 these 2 ̆ 2 lost 2 ̆ 2 vessels. Concentrating on the Middle Minoan ceramic assemblages from the palatial sites of Knossos and Phaistos on Crete, this dissertation demonstrates the feasibility of using ceramic skeuomorphs with 2 ̆ 2 metallic 2 ̆ 2 features to re-construct the appearance, function, and roles of <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> in Minoan society. ^ The conclusions reached in this study represent only the first glimpses of the possibilities skeuomorphs may offer to the archaeological community. The study of ceramic surface treatments did, in fact, allow for the 2 ̆ 2 re-construction 2 ̆ 2 of the appearance of certain <b>metal</b> <b>vessels,</b> even permitting the distinction between metallic decorative techniques that were likely first seen on foreign imports and those that were likely developed on Crete—including some that were previously unattested, such as inlay and enamel work, for the Middle Minoan period. The analysis of the origins of the shapes of these skeuomorphs suggest a possible trade in metal goods with the southwestern coast of Anatolia or northern Levantine coast—at a time when the first palaces were being built on Crete—and the analysis of the functional use of the skeuomorphs suggests that the majority of <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> were used as luxurious 2 ̆ 2 drinking sets 2 ̆ 2 for the socio-political elite, engendering, in turn, the emulation of ceramic copies to be used by the 2 ̆ 2 sub-elite 2 ̆ 2 as substitutes in competitive feasting ceremonies. In the end, the verdict falls squarely in favour of the skeuomorph; the study of these objects can only provide new avenues of research into the past. ...|$|R
2500|$|Metal vessels were {{produced}} in Crete {{from at least}} as early as EM II (c. 2500) in the Prepalatial period through to LM IA (c. 1450) in the Postpalatial period and perhaps as late as LM IIIB/C (c. 1200), although {{it is likely that}} many of the vessels from these later periods were heirlooms from earlier periods. [...] The earliest were probably made exclusively from precious metals, but from the Protopalatial period (MM IB – MM IIA) they were also produced in arsenical bronze and, subsequently, tin bronze. [...] The archaeological record suggests that mostly cup-type forms were created in precious metals, but the corpus of bronze vessels was diverse, including cauldrons, pans, hydrias, bowls, pitchers, basins, cups, ladles and lamps. [...] The Minoan <b>metal</b> <b>vessel</b> tradition influenced that of the Mycenaean culture on mainland Greece, and they are often regarded as the same tradition. [...] Many precious metal vessels found on mainland Greece exhibit Minoan characteristics, and it is thought that these were either imported from Crete or made on the mainland by Minoan metalsmiths working for Mycenaean patrons or by Mycenaean smiths who had trained under Minoan masters.|$|E

One, old Ursel, the wife of Hatto the forester, was a bent, worn, but not ill-looking woman, with a motherly face; the younger ones were hard, bold creatures, from whom Christina felt a shrinking recoil. The meal was dressed by Ursel and her kitchen boy. From a great cauldron, goat's flesh and broth together were ladled out into wooden bowls. That every one provided their own spoon and knife--no fork--was only what Christina was used to in the most refined society, {{and she had the}} implements in a pouch hanging to her girdle; but she was not prepared for the unwashed condition of the bowls, nor for being obliged to share that of her father--far less for the absence of all blessing on the meal, and the coarse boisterousness of manners prevailing thereat. Hungry as she was, she did not find it easy to take food under these circumstances, and she was relieved when Ermentrude, overcome by the turmoil, grew giddy, and was carried upstairs by her father, who laid her down upon her great bed, and left her to the attendance of Christina.

5000|$|It is {{not clear}} what the {{functions}} of the vessels were, but scholars have proposed some possibilities. [...] Cup-types and bowls were probably for drinking and hydrias and pitchers for pouring liquids, while cauldrons and pans may have been used to prepare food, and other specialised forms such as sieves, lamps and braziers had more specific functions. [...] Several scholars have suggested that <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> {{played an important role in}} ritual drinking ceremonies and communal feasting, where the use of the valuable bronze and precious <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> by elites signified their high status, power and superiority over lower-status participants who used ceramic vessels. During later periods, when Mycenaean peoples settled in Crete, <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> were often interred as grave goods. [...] In this type of conspicuous burial, they may have symbolised the wealth and status of the individual by alluding to their ability to sponsor feasts, and it is possible that sets of vessels interred in graves were used for funerary feasting prior to the burial itself. [...] <b>Metal</b> <b>vessels</b> may also have been used for political gift exchange, where the value of the gift reflects the wealth or status of the giver and the perceived importance of the recipient. This could explain the presence of Minoan vessels in the Mycenaean shaft graves of Grave Circle A and their depiction in an Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty tomb at Thebes.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to extend the {{traditional}} formal/stylistic approach to <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> and access issues such as their role in ancient societies and social dynamics through the application to their study of a theory-informed approach. The choice of geographical and temporal focus, the Bronze Age Aegean and Anatolia, was informed by the complex socio-cultural transformations that these two regions experienced at this time, and an interest in how a study of this aspect of elite material culture might contribute {{to our understanding of}} the emergence and maintenance of social differentiation in pre and proto-historic societies. The current study therefore revolves around a diachronic exploration of the advent and development of <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> in terms of their style, functions, the techniques involved in their construction, and any inter-regional influences that can be detected and traced. In order to accomplish this it was necessary to devise a combined typology that encompassed the material of both regions, as well as create a database of the Anatolian corpus and update that of the Aegean, both of which are included in the thesis. Another aspect of this work is the study of the ceramic skeuomorphs of these <b>metal</b> <b>vessels,</b> as a means of gaining additional windows onto how notions of valuation, prestige and emulation operated in these ancient societies, and filling some of the gaps in the extant corpora. Given the dialectic that societies produce artefacts as a means of reproducing cultural logic and social relations, the patterns which emerge from the resulting diachronic analysis should be meaningful in terms of the social imperatives behind the changing nature and use of the <b>metal</b> <b>vessels.</b> By relating and comparing these to a variety of theoretical models, it should be possible to infer how <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> and their ceramic skeuomorphs fulfilled their roles in, and contributed to, the reproduction of society.

5000|$|Minoan <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> were {{generally}} manufactured by raising sheet <b>metal,</b> although some <b>vessels</b> {{may have been}} cast by the lost wax technique. [...] Research suggests that Minoan metalsmiths mostly used stone hammers without handles and wooden metalsmithing stakes to raise vessels. [...] Many vessels have legs, handles, rims and decorative elements which were cast separately and riveted onto the raised vessel forms. Separate pieces of raised sheet were also riveted together to form larger vessels. Some vessels were decorated by various means. Cast handles and rims of some bronze vessels have decorative motifs in relief on their surfaces, and the walls of some vessels were worked in repoussé and chasing. Precious <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> were ornamented with repoussé, ornamental rivets, gilding, bi-metallic overlays and inlaying of other precious metals or a niello-type substance. [...] Motifs on <b>metal</b> <b>vessels</b> correlate to those found on other Minoan art forms such as pottery, frescoes, stone seals and jewellery, including spirals, arcades, flora and fauna, including bulls, birds and marine life.

50|$|The notorious RBMK {{graphite}} moderated, water-cooled reactors of Chernobyl Power Plant disaster {{were designed}} {{with a positive}} void coefficient with boron control rods on electromagnetic grapples for reaction speed control. To the degree that the control systems were reliable, this design did have a corresponding degree of active inherent safety. The reactor was unsafe at low power levels because erroneous control rod movement would have a counter-intuitively magnified effect. Chernobyl Reactor 4 was built instead with manual crane driven boron control rods that were tipped with the moderator substance, graphite, a neutron reflector. It was designed with an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) that depended on either grid power or the backup Diesel generator to be operating. The ECCS safety component was decidedly not passive. The design featured a partial containment consisting of a concrete slab {{above and below the}} reactor - with pipes and rods penetrating, an inert gas filled <b>metal</b> <b>vessel</b> to keep oxygen away from the water-cooled hot graphite, a fire-proof roof, and the pipes below the vessel sealed in secondary water filled boxes. The roof, <b>metal</b> <b>vessel,</b> concrete slabs and water boxes are examples of passive safety components.
