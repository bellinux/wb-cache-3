40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made in this article to {{critically}} survey the field of low Reynolds number flows, with particular regard to the hydrodynamic resistance of particles in this regime. A remarkable burgeoning of interest in such problems has occurred wlthin the past decade. Significant advances have been recorded on both the theoretical and experimental sides, with the former gains far outdlstancing the latter <b>m</b> <b>scope.</b> Problems which would have been impossible to solve rigorously before the advent of singular perturbation techniques are now being regularly solved, though hardly in a routine fashion; insight, intuition, inspiration, and ingenuity are still the order of the day. For those interested in direct engineering applications of the material covered by this review, the perspective from which many of the more general results set forth here should be viewed is, perhaps, best illustrated by an example: The resistance of any solid particle to translational and rotational motions in Stokes flow may be completely calculated from knowledge of a set of 21 scalar coefficients (Section II,C,l). While it seems highly improbable to expect that all these coefficients could be experimentally measured in practice, except perhaps in the trivial case of highly symmetrical bodies for which many of the coefficients vanish identically, this does not detract from the conceptual advantages of knowing exactly how much one does not know. Having an ideal goal against which the extent of present knowledge can be gaged permits a rational decision as to how to optimize one's investment of time, effort, and money in the pursuit of additional data. Furthermore, with the development of high-speed digital computers it may soon be possible to calculate all these coefficients for any given body (O 1 b). The general theory provides a rigorous framework into which such knowledge may be embedded. Use of symbolic" drag coefficients" (Section II,C, 2) and symbolic heat- and mass-transfer" coefficients" (Section IV,A) furnishes a unique method for describing the intrinsic, interphase transport properties of particles {{for a wide variety of}} boundary conditions. Here, the particle resistance is characterized by a partial differential operator that represents its intrinsic resistance to vector or scalar transfer, independently of the physical properties of the fluid, the state of motion of the particle, or of the unperturbed velocity or temperature fields at infinity. Though restricted as yet in applicability, the general ideas underlying the existence of these operators appear capable of extension in a variety of ways. A recurrent theme arising throughout the analysis pertains to the screwlike properties of particles and of their intrinsic right- and left-handedness (Sections II,C, 1; II,C, 2; III,C and IV,B). Such properties reflect an inseparable coupling between the translational and rotational motions of the particle. Helicoidally isotropic particles furnish the simplest examples of bodies manifesting screw-like behavior. These particles are isotropic, in that their properties are the same in all directions. Yet they possess a sense, and spin as they settle in a fluid. These id eas are likely to be of interest to microbiologists, biophysicists, geneticists, and others in the life sciences for whom handedness and life are intimately intertwined. The microscopic dimensions of the objects of interest to them insures ipso Jacto that the motion takes place at very small Reynolds numbers. Readers interested in an elementary but broad survey of sense in the physical and biological sciences are referred to Gardner's delightful book "The Ambidextrous Universe" (01). First-order corrections to the Stokes force on a particle, arising from wallor inertial-effects, can be directly expressed in terms of the Stokes force on the body in the absence of such effects. Thus, with regard to wall-effects in the Stokes regime, Eq. (135) expresses the force experienced by a particle falling in, say, a circular cylinder, in terms of the comparable force experienced by the particle when falling with the same velocity and orientation in the unbounded fluid. Equation (139) expresses a similar relationship for the torque on a rotating particle in a circular cylinder, as does Eq. (166) for the first-order interaction between two particles in an unbounded fluid in terms of the properties of the individual particles. Analogously, Eq. (234) expresses the inertial correction to the Stokes drag force in terms of the Stokes force itself. A comparable relationship exists (Section IV, A) between the heat-transfer coefficient at small, nonzero Peelet numbers and the heat-transfer coefficient at zero Peelet number-that is, the coefficient for conduction heat transfer. Finally, Eqs. (78) -(79) (or their symbolic operator counterparts) permit direct calculation of the Stokes force and torque experienced by a particle in an arbitrary field of flow solely from knowledge of the elementary solutions of Stokes equations for translation and rotation of the particle in a fluid at rest at infinity. The utility of already available knowledge is thus greatly extended by the existence of such relations. It permits one whose interests lie entirely in the macroscopic manifestation of the motion, e. g., the force and torque on the body, to bypass the oftentimes difficult problem of obtaining a detailed solution of the equations of motion, and to proceed directly to the computation of the force and torque on the body from the prescribed boundary conditions alone. The calculation is thereby reduced to a quadrature. The contents of this review may be read simultaneously from two different points of view. First and foremost it may be regarded as a compendium of recent advances in low Reynolds number flows. Secondly, from a pedagogic viewpoint it may be profitably used to illustrate the direct application of invariant techniques, that is, vector-polyadic and tensor methods, to a class of physical problems. Because of the relative simplicity and rich variety of physical problems associated with low Reynolds number motions, intuitive arguments may be employed to gain insight into the nature of polyadics and tensors; the role played by the concept of direction as a primitive entity is brought out here to a degree not usually found in standard works on tensor analysis...|$|E

However, as shown in Fig.  6, the latency of the Cassandra-X deployment setup keeps on increasing even after SCOPE switches to the Cassandra-Y deployment setup. The increase is mainly caused by a number additional processes started to generate the write-heavy workloads on the Cassandra-X deployment setup.

As a result, the Cassandra-X deployment is stressed with write-heavy workloads even after SCOPE switches to the Cassandra-Y deployment setup.|$|R
40|$|Ramsey {{theory is}} the study of {{conditions}} under which mathematical objects show order when partitioned. Ramsey theory on the integers concerns itself with partitions of [1,n] into r subsets and asks the question whether one (or more) of these r subsets contains a k-term member of F, where [1,n]={ 1, 2, 3, [...] .,n} and F is a certain family of subsets of Z^+. When F is fixed to be the set of arithmetic progressions, the corresponding Ramsey-type numbers are called the van der Waerden numbers. I started the project choosing F to be the set of semi-progressions of <b>scope</b> <b>m.</b> A semi-progression of scope m∈Z^+ is a set of integers {x_ 1,x_ 2, [...] .,x_k} such that for some d∈Z^+, x_i-x_i- 1 ∈{d, 2 d, [...] .,md} for all i∈{ 2, 3, [...] .,k}. The exact values of Ramsey-type functions corresponding to semi-progressions are not known. We use SP_m(k) to denote these numbers as a Ramsey-type function of k for a fixed <b>scope</b> <b>m.</b> During this project, I used the probabilistic method to get an exponential lower bound for any fixed m.

The considered target geometry is the one with the final part of the guide tube slanted at an angle of about 9 degrees. The Pb-Bi flow in the last 2150 mm of the target have been simulated, including the calculation of the thermal field in all the solid structures (window, hull and flow guide). Due to geometrical symmetry, only half of the real domain was considered. Turbulence was simulated using a Chen k-ε model, combined with a Two-layer model in the most critical near-wall regions (window and flow guide in the spallation region) and with Wall Functions along the riser and the down-comer. Modified wall functions for low Prandtl number fluids were implemented. Results are presented for both cases with the beam footprint major axis parallel (benchmark M 1. 0) and normal (benchmark M 1. 1) to the guide-tube slant. In order to estimate the effect of the variation of the turbulent Prandtl number on the heat exchange, two calculation have been performed, one with Prt = 0. 9 and one using a relationship Prt = f(Ret, Pr), yielding a locally variable turbulent Prandtl number. Results show a very complex flow pattern in the spallation region, with 3 D vortex structures being generated in the reversing region and dragged along the rising duct. In case M 1. 0 with Prt = 0. 9, results show maximum window temperatures of 521 °C and 487 °C in the external and internal side respectively, with a maximum Pb-Bi temperature of 486 °C located nearby the window centre. The maximum flow velocity is 1. 35 m/s. A significant heat exchange takes place across the 1. 5 mm thick flow guide, causing a mean temperature increase along the down-comer of about 34 °C. Due to the high Reynolds number of the flow, the effect of using a variable Prt is limited to near wall regions, where the heat exchange is slightly reduced. The combination of a lower heat exchange across the flow guide (resulting in a lower temperature increase of the Pb-Bi along the down-comer) and a worse window cooling yielded a maximum window temperature of 524 °C, namely 3 °C more than in the case with Prt = 0. 9. In case M 1. 1, maximum window temperatures of 447 °C and 414 oC were found using Prt = 0. 9 with a maximum Pb-Bi temperature of 423 °C located in {{the central part of the}} spallation region.

Results: The focus of researchers on children with CP and the lack of evidence for children with other health conditions, the persistence of physiotherapists to assess mainly physical outcomes and not emotional needs of children, and the measurement tools used for this purpose are presented. Conclusions: For children with chronic health conditions who attend physiotherapy sessions, play could serve as a mediate and an appropriate developmental approach in order to achieve physical and emotional changes. There is a need for physiotherapists to balance physical and emotional needs, and have a more ‘human’ relationship, rather than a ‘bodily’ - strict professional relationship with children. Although the information presented in this review is not considered as sufficient to draw conclusions, it could serve as a first step for researchers to study this integration in greater depth, and to focus on children with conditions other than CP...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the level of}} the students from ”Secondary School Dr. A. Şafran” of Bacău compared with {{the level of the}} students from ”Secondary School T. V. Ştefănelle” of Câmpulung-Moldovenesc, Suceava. The comparison was done by the results obtained at two running events. We chose running events for assessment as the content of the curriculum with elements of sports athletics can be fully met, since each school can provide the material conditions necessary to achieve the objectives of the instructive-educational activity. The running events are means with a great weight for the curriculum and for the general educational activity of students. In this study we evaluated 200 subjects, students in grade V and VI at the schools stated above, with ages between 11 and 12 years old, who participated in speed and endurance running assessments, from which the results obtained ware analysed and interpreted. The assessment was: speed running on the distance of 50 m with standing start up and endurance running (600 m girls and 800 <b>m</b> boys). The <b>scope</b> {{of this study was to}} highlight the level of the secondary school students from the mountains compared with the level of the secondary school students from lowland in the running events, with an eye for eventual selection for performance level. The hypothesis from which we started was that speed running event on a distance of 50 m with standing start up and endurance running on the distance of 600 m and 800 m can show us the students’ level that can be selected for practicing performance athletics. The methods used in the research were: the bibliographic study method, the conversation method, the method of observation, the method of testing, the analysis and data processing and graphical method. In this study we concluded that there is a valuable difference between the two groups. The results of students in secondary schools from the mountains are better compared with the results of students from secondary schools...|$|R
40|$|Phenolics and {{condensed}} tannins {{in relation}} to altitude in neotropical Pteridium spp. A field study in the Venezuelan Andes (Alonso Amelot, Miguel; Oliveros, Alberto and Calcagno Pisarelli, María Pía) Abstract Two species of neotropical bracken, Pteridium caudatum (L.) Maxon (P. c.) and P. arachnoideum (Kaulf.) (P. a.), thrive dominantly in habitats extending from near the sea level to the Andean alpine zone around 3000 <b>m</b> altitude. The <b>scope</b> of sources of stress associated with elevation has three main components: plant competition for resources, activity of herbivores/ pathogens, and climate. The contribution of each component varies greatly {{from place to place}} and bracken must respond with considerable physiological/genetic plasticity to maintain its dominant status in all these habitats. Phenolic compounds have a number of properties for plant adaptation to evolutionary selective forces of biotic and climatic nature, in particular with reference to their protective role against excessive solar radiation. We have examined the second of these properties by studying the dynamics of low (LMP) and high (HMP) molecular weight phenolics in neotropical bracken ferns in two groups of field experiments: (1) their variation during the phenologic development of blades in sympatric populations of both bracken species to examine the synthesis and allocation of these materials under similar conditions of competition, predation and solar UV-B radiation; (2) the contents of LMP and HMP in six bracken populations of P. c. along its typical altitudinal range [1180 - 2140 m above sea level (asl) ] and six additional populations of P. a. (1880 - 3190 m asl), which grows at higher elevations in the western Andes of Venezuela, to investigate the phenolics' response to the ecological gradients associated with elevation in these plants. From series (1), we recorded the progressive accumulation of both types of phenolics with frond expansion, and hence increased surface of lamina exposed to sunlight, in P. c. and P. a. However, phenolics in mature blades of P. a. were 1. 6 (LMP) and 3. 26 (HMP) greater in amount than in P. c. From series (2), synthesis and accumulation of LMP was found to be independent of altitude, except forthe subalpine population of P. a. at 3190 m asl, where a 167 % increment of the average contents was recorded. By contrast, the levels of HMP correlated positively with elevation in both bracken species. The independent response of both types of phenolics to solar radiation may be interpreted as either more effective and metabolically cost-effective protection of HMP against UV-B light than LMP or differential light activation of key steps in the biosynthesis of HMP and LMP in bracken. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
