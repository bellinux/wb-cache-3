40|$|Abstract. Benign mammary <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> in dogs {{resemble}} human salivary pleomorphic adenomas {{with regard}} to their histogenesis, including the occurrence of cartilaginous or bony metaplasia as well as the ex-pression pattern of cytoskeletal proteins in proliferative myoepithelial cells. Recently, a monoclonal antibody specific for class II b-tubulin has been developed. The epitope it recognizes was determined to be the hepta-peptide Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Gly-Glu-Asp, which is the common sequence found among the canine, rat, mouse, and human class II b-tubulin–specific regions. We carried out immunohistochemical studies on mammary <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> obtained from three female dogs using this the monoclonal antibody. The antibody to class II b-tubulin reacted intensely with proliferative myoepithelial cells in canine mammary <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors,</b> whereas staining was barely detectable in normal myoepithelial cells surrounding alveoli and alveolar ducts within the tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Proliferative myoepithelial cells also expressed vimentin, but a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) staining was barely detectable. Immunoblot analysis showed that class II b-tubulin and vimentin were expressed in myoepithelial cell lines prepared from the three mammary <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors.</b> On the other hand, only one cell line, which was negative for aSMA, produced cartilage-specific type II collagen. These results suggest that class II b-tubulin could be a new molecular marker of proliferating myoepithelial cells in canine mammary <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> and that differential expression of cytoskeletal components is associated with cartilaginous meta...|$|R

40|$|Midkine (MK; a low {{molecular}} weight heparin-binding growth factor) is a multifunctional cytokine. MK {{plays a role in}} morphogenesis of many organs including teeth through epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. We immunohistochemically examined MK expression in various human odontogenic tumors. There was no difference in positive rate and intensity of MK between benign odontogenic tumors and their malignant counterparts. Ameloblastoma showed MK localization in the peripheral columnar cells in budding processes from the parenchyma, which frequently expressed proliferating cell nuclear antigen. MK was also preferentially expressed in keratinized cells in acanthomatous ameloblastoma and keratocystic odontogenic <b>tumor.</b> In odontogenic <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> except for odontoma, intense immunoreactivity to MK was found in epithelial follicles, the surrounding odontogenic ectomesenchymal tissue, and the basement membrane between them. Intensity in the odontogenic ectomesenchyme decreased in relation to distance from the epithelial follicles. No expression was found in tumor cells associated with production of dental hard tissues in odontogenic <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> including odontoma. These findings suggested that MK is involved in the reciprocal interaction between odontogenic epithelium and odontogenic ectomesenchymal tissue in areas without dental hard tissue formation in odontogenic <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors.</b> Coexpression of MK and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was also observed in epithelial follicles and highly cellular nodules in the ectomesenchyme of odontogenic <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors.</b> MK is considered to mediate growth activity of odontogenic tumors and cell differentiation of odontogenic <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> through molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in morphogenesis of the tooth...|$|R

Objectives: The aim {{of the present study}} was to prospectively evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of benign and malignant soft tissue tumors and to determine if ADC can help differentiate these tumors. Patients and Methods: DWI was performed on 25 histologically proven soft tissue masses. It was obtained with a single-shot echo-planar imaging technique using a 1. 5 T magnetic resonance (MR) machine. The mean ADC values were calculated. We grouped soft tissue tumors as benign cystic, benign solid or mixed, malignant cystic and malignant solid or <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> and compared mean ADC values between these groups. Results: There was only one patient with a malignant cystic tumor and was not included in the statistical analysis. The median ADC values of benign and malignant tumors were 2. 31 ± 1. 29 and 0. 90 ± 0. 70 (median ± interquartile range), respectively.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} compare {{malignant}} behavior and prognosis between solid <b>tumors</b> and <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> with a ground-glass opacity component on high-resolution computed tomography. MethodsWe examined 436 of 502 consecutive patients with clinical stage IA adenocarcinoma {{who had undergone}} preoperative high-resolution computed tomography and F- 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography; 66 patients with tumors with pure ground-glass opacity components were excluded. Tumor type (solid, n =  137; mixed, n =  299) and surgical results were analyzed for all patients and their matched pairs. ResultsIn all patients, solid tumors showed a significantly greater association (P < . 001) with lymphatic, vascular, and pleural invasion and lymph node metastasis compared with <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors.</b> The disease-free survival was also worse in patients with solid tumors (P = . 0006). Analysis of 97 pairs matched for solid component size confirmed that solid tumors {{were significantly associated with}} lymphatic, vascular, and pleural invasion (P = . 008, P = . 029, P = . 003, respectively) and poor prognosis. When maximum standardized uptake value and solid component size were matched (n =  79), the differences in pathologic prognostic parameters and disease-free survivals between patients with solid and <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> disappeared. ConclusionsSolid tumors exhibit more malignant behavior and have a poorer prognosis compared with <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors,</b> even when the solid component size is the same in both tumor types.

The present study demonstrates that stable expression of sst 2 in the hamster pancreatic cancer cells PC- 1 and PC- 1. 0 activates an autocrine negative loop {{leading to an}} in vitro inhibition of cell proliferation. In vivo studies conducted in Syrian golden hamsters after orthotopic implantation of PC- 1. 0 cells showed that both tumor growth and metastatic progression of allografts containing 100 % of sst 2 -expressing cells were significantly inhibited for up to 20 days after implantation, as compared with control allografts that did not express sst 2. A local antitumor bystander effect was observed after induction of <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> containing a 1 : 3 ratio of sst 2 -expressing cells to control cells. Tumor volume and incidence of metastases of <b>mixed</b> <b>tumors</b> were significantly reduced at day 13 post implantation.

Tyrosine dephosphorylation of E-cadherin may participate in restoring the E-cadherin function, reducing in turn pancreatic cancer cell motility and invasiveness. This dephosphorylation depends on the tyrosine phosphatase src homology 2 -containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP- 1) positively coupled to sst 2 receptor.
