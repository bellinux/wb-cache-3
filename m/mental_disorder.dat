5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> to Soviet mentality.|$|E

40|$|Criminal {{responsibility}} {{is an important}} factor in criminal offense. Determining a criminal responsibility of people with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> is problematic. <b>Mental</b> <b>disorders</b> affect free will because they can affect one’s ability to determine his or her alternative action. This juridical normative research studied the correlation between <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> and criminal behaviors, the criminal responsibility of people with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders,</b> and the settlement of criminal offense done by people with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> at the investigation phase and before the court. Nearly all of <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> are related to criminal behaviors because they affect reasoning abilities. According to literatures, the mental condition that is most related to the criminal behaviors is automatisms: hallucination, illusion, and suspicion; impulse control disorders; personality disorders; mental retardation; and substance abuse.   On the evaluation of people with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders,</b> there is not solely one formulation applicable to all cases, but the there shall be a case-by-case review. Law and Psychiatrics have different concepts on the <b>mental</b> <b>disorders.</b>   Many law enforcement officers regard that all of people with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> cannot be responsible.

40|$|Objective: The study {{examined}} the nature and prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> in primary care in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: Cross-sectional survey of a consecutive sample of attenders (N = 571) to three primary health care facilities were recruited, using the PRIME-MD questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and ten (37. 8 %) subjects satisfied the DSM-IV primary care version for <b>mental</b> <b>disorders.</b> Depression was the common pres-entation (73. 1 %) of all subjects with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders.</b> There were no significant {{gender differences in the}} frequency of <b>mental</b> <b>disorders,</b> but the intensity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was significantly higher in female subjects. Sub-jects with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> showed significantly more somatic symptoms than subjects without <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> and they were also more significantly exposed to stress. Psychosocial impairment was found in over two thirds of subjects with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders.</b> PHC physicians recognized less than 1 % of subjects with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders.</b> Conclusions: Sub-jects with <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> are commonly seen in primary health care settings.

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders.

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder.</b> A large-scale {{study of}} homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{association}} between non-psychotic serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> and earnings in the general population of Belgium on both the individual- and society-level. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data stem from a cross-sectional population study of the non-institutionalized adult (between 18 and 64) population from Belgium (N= 863). The third version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI- 3. 0) was administered to assess 12 -month non-psychotic serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> and annual earnings. Multivariate approaches were used to estimate the observed and estimated annual earnings for persons with serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders,</b> controlling for sociodemographic variables and alcohol disorders. RESULTS: On the individual-level, 12 -month serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> significantly predicted the probability of having any earnings (OR= 0. 32; 95 %CI= 0. 14 - 0. 74). Respondents with serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> had 12 -month earnings of 5, 969 Euro less than expected in the absence of serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders.</b> Taking into account the prevalence of serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> (i. e. 4. 9 %), the society-level effects of serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> in 2002 can be estimated at about 1, 797 million Euro per year for the Belgian general population. DISCUSSION: Non-psychotic serious <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> had considerable impact on annual earnings. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in Belgium that addresses the association between mental illness and earnings.

Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code.

50|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{classified}} as a psychological condition marked primarily by sufficient disorganization of personality, mind, and emotions to seriously impair the normal psychological and often social functioning of the individual.

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{intervention}} of Denmark, Sweden and Poland-Lithuania into Livonia began {{a period of}} struggle {{for control of the}} Baltic, known contemporaneously as the dominium maris baltici. While the initial war years were characterised by intensive fighting, a period of low-intensity warfare began in 1562 and lasted until 1570 when fighting once more intensified. Denmark, Sweden and to some extent Poland–Lithuania were occupied with the Nordic Seven Years' War (1563–1570) taking place in the Western Baltic, but Livonia remained strategically important. In 1562, Denmark and Russia concluded the Treaty of Mozhaysk, respecting each other's claims in Livonia and maintaining amicable relations. In 1564, Sweden and Russia concluded a seven-years truce. Both Ivan IV and Eric XIV showed signs of <b>mental</b> <b>disorder,</b> with Ivan IV turning against part of the Tsardom's nobility and people with the oprichina that began in 1565, leaving Russia in a state of political chaos and civil war.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Estimate {{predictive}} {{associations of}} <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> with marriage and divorce in a cross-national sample. Method: Population surveys of <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> included assessment of {{age at first}} marriage in 19 countries (n = 46 128) and age at first divorce in a subset of 12 countries (n = 30 729). Associations between <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> and subsequent marriage and divorce were estimated in discrete time survival models. Results: Fourteen of 18 premarital <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> are associated with lower likelihood of ever marrying (odds ratios ranging from 0. 6 to 0. 9), but these associations vary across ages of marriage. Associations between premarital <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> and marriage are generally null for early marriage (age 17 or younger), but negative associations come to predominate at later ages. All 18 <b>mental</b> <b>disorders</b> are positively associated with divorce (odds ratios ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 8).

5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a <b>mental</b> <b>disorder</b> defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
