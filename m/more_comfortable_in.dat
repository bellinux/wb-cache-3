They were Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Adrian Newey of Williams; Fedrico Bendinelli representing {{the owners of the}} Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari; Giorgio Poggi as the circuit director and Roland Bruynseraede who was race director and sanctioned the circuit. The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants of manslaughter charges. The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking. The column had been cut and welded back together at Senna's request in order for him to be <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> the car.|$|E
5|$|Janowitz {{originally}} intended {{the part of}} Cesare {{to go to his}} friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer, {{but by the time the}} film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director Paul Czinner, leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover. Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Dr. Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, who Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz said only Krauss or Paul Wegener could have played the part. The parts of Dr. Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and Conrad Veidt, respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production. Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape, and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character. The actors in Caligari were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes, and appearance to match the visual style of the film. Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre. The performances of Krauss and Veidt in Caligari were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result John D. Barlow said they appear <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> their surroundings in the film than the other actors. Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, Reinhold Goering's Seeschlacht, at the Deutsches Theater. By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style.|$|E

Leonard, concerned {{that he was trying}} to sabotage his relationship with Penny, meets with the woman he kissed on the boat. She barely remembers the incident and quickly grows bored with Leonard's ramblings, taking a sarcastic and dismissive tone toward him. From that meeting Leonard comes to terms with his insecurities and he and Penny are able to become <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> dealing with their mutual fears about their relationship. Leonard seriously tries to move into Penny's apartment though Sheldon has serious objections and makes them compromise to spend multiple nights a week in Leonard's old room.

The event {{had a significant impact on}} the band and especially on Richards as he wrote their next album. However, the resulting work was not mournful; Richards described it as optimistic and humorous. To replace Dawson, Melbournian Kiernan Box joined the band as a keyboardist. The band produced Strange Bird independently; Donovan said this worked to their advantage as they felt <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> their own studio, and that as a result Strange Bird was a better album than Sunset Studies, though the band's debut album was [...] "probably received better by our fans". In response to complaints concerning Richards' Sunset Studies wordplay, Augie March included a lyrics booklet with Strange Bird.|$|E
500|$|Black Eye is {{the only}} {{full-length}} album by the English punk rock band Fluffy. The band formed in London in late 1994 by singer and guitarist Amanda Rootes, guitarist Bridget Jones, bassist Helen Storer, and drummer Angie Adams. Unsatisfied with the Britpop invasion at the time, the band sought to recapture the punk rock phenomenon. According to Rootes, [...] "We want to infiltrate and conquer the masses. It's like, Americans think English music's shit – 'cause it is. We want [...] to gain a little respect that we haven't had for a while." [...] The band also felt <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> North America than in the UK because the British press [...] "can't handle {{the concept of a}} sexually frank all-girl band"; the name of the band comes from a lesbian novel titled Fluffy Butch, which Rootes thought was funny.|$|E

Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E

500|$|Barber {{scored a}} total of 16,402 runs in his career with 29 {{hundreds}} and 182 catches, and was described by Gerald Howat as [...] "the fourth pillar" [...] of the Yorkshire batting in the mid-1930s (after Herbert Sutcliffe, Maurice Leyland and Arthur Mitchell). A generally defensive batsman, he played carefully {{in the tradition of}} Yorkshire opening batsmen. Jim Kilburn said that Barber was [...] "small in stature but upright in style". He was a good batsman on the off side and had a very good defensive technique, while his strength on the leg side was noted on his Test debut. Although an opening batsman, he often went in lower down the batting order. He was <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> normal circumstances than in a crisis and did not enjoy batting on difficult pitches. Bill Bowes called him the most correct and orthodox batsman he had seen, even more so than Len Hutton. Barber was a kind, modest man, who never believed that his contribution was good enough, even if he had scored a century. On his death, Wisden described him as having [...] "rendered admirable service." ...|$|E
500|$|Kemp {{struggled}} defensively {{in center}} field during {{the first couple of}} months of the season, a problem that came to a head after a particular bad series for him against the New York Mets in mid-May. Manager Don Mattingly was openly critical of his outfield play following the series. Immediately afterward, the Dodgers made Andre Ethier the starting center fielder, and informed Kemp that he would be moving to left field. However, he was kept out of the lineup for five straight games as he was learning the new position, and was vocally unhappy about it. After playing in left for several weeks, he was moved to right field, a position he had not played regularly since 2009. He was <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> right which led to the Dodgers moving Yasiel Puig to center field. The last week of July, he hit five home runs in six games to win Player of the Week honors for the fifth time in his career. He also won Player of the Month for September, when he hit [...]322 with nine homers and 25 RBI. For the season, Kemp hit [...]287 with 25 homers and [...] 89 RBI in 150 games.|$|E

As a young man Nosaka was known for his fashionable taste in clothing and for the large dog that often accompanied him in public. He was quiet, serious, studious, introverted, and <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> libraries than at public demonstrations. After his secondary education, Nosaka attended Keio University, which was then considered a [...] "rich boys school". [...] At Keio, Nosaka became interested in the international labor movement, an interest that was largely supported by one of his professors, Kiichi Horie. Nosaka decided to write his senior thesis on the moderate labor organization founded by Bunji Suzuki, [...] "Yuaikai" [...] ("The Friendly Society"). To research his thesis, Nosaka contacted Yuaikais head office, and acquainted himself with its senior leaders: Suzuki initially mistook Nosaka for a salesman the first time they met, but eventually grew fond of Nosaka. When Nosaka graduated from Keio, in 1915, he joined Yuaikai and worked for the organization as a research staff member and as an editor of the organization's journal, Rodo Oyobi Sangyo (Labour and Industry).|$|E

(It will be years, if ever, before she can connect with a crowd like, for instance, Marilyn Maye.) ... She covers a lot of bases musically. ... Her rendition of [...] "Music of the Night" [...] is especially moving. ... Hearing Jackie Evancho in such an intimate space is a rare chance to experience perfection at close proximity." [...] Linda Amiel Burns, however, wrote of the piano-only accompaniment that additional instrumentation [...] "would have made the arrangements more interesting and exciting". She praised Evancho's voice but thought that some of the song choices were odd, and that sometimes [...] "it was difficult to understand the lyrics." [...] She felt that Evancho sounded <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> her classical selections, but that pop songs require [...] "a different vocal technique with more emphasis on the lyrics ... she has to watch her phrasing ... breathe in the right places, and find the deeper meaning and longing that the song expresses." ...|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith and Lavington {{consider}} that Lazenby [...] "had chosen to play Bond {{the same way}} as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity"; they {{went on to say that}} [...] "Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows" [...] in the film, and that [...] "he invariably rises to the occasion". Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard said that, [...] "The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies". Judith Crist of New York Magazine commented that, [...] "This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby". Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice: [...] "Lazenby... seems <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> <b>in</b> a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates".|$|E
