500|$|Chatwin's {{early years}} were spent moving {{regularly}} {{with his mother}} while his father was at sea. Prior to his birth, Chatwin's parents had lived at Barnt Green, Worcestershire, but Margharita moved to her parents' house in Dronfield, near Sheffield, shortly before giving birth. [...] Mother and son remained there {{for only a few}} weeks. Worried about Nazi bombs, Margharita sought a safer place to stay. She took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war. They would remain in one place until Margharita decided to move, either because of concern for their safety, or because of friction among family members. [...] Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war, [...] "Home, if we had one, was a solid black suitcase called the Rev-Robe, in which there was a corner for <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> my Mickey Mouse gas mask." ...|$|E
500|$|Waugh did not query his friend's judgement, {{but took}} his {{manuscript}} to the school's furnaces and unceremoniously burnt it. Immediately afterwards {{he received the}} news that the job with Scott Moncrieff had fallen through. The double blow affected Waugh severely; he wrote in his diary in July: [...] "The phrase 'the end of the tether' besets me with unshakeable persistence". In his biography Waugh writes: [...] "I went down alone to the beach with my thoughts full of death. I took off <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> began swimming out to sea. Did I really intend to drown myself? That was certainly in my mind". He left a note with his clothes, a quotation from Euripides about the sea washing away all human ills. A short way out, after being stung by jellyfish, he abandoned the attempt, turned round and swam back to the shore. He did not, however, withdraw his resignation from the school, returning instead to London.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> <b>and</b> looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, that is possible!" [...] {{the countess}} exclaimed; [...] "I could knot <b>my</b> bed <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> slide down. It matters not about getting back again, {{since we have}} no ladder." ...|$|R
