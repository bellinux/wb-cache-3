50|$|A <b>measuring</b> <b>spoon</b> is a spoon used {{to measure}} an amount of an ingredient, either liquid or dry, when cooking. Measuring spoons may be made of plastic, metal, and other materials. They are {{available}} in many sizes, including the teaspoon and tablespoon.|$|E
50|$|Medical {{syringes}} {{are sometimes}} used without a needle for orally administering liquid medicines {{to young children}} or animals, or milk to small young animals, because the dose can be measured accurately and {{it is easier to}} squirt the medicine into the subject's mouth instead of coaxing the subject to drink out of a <b>measuring</b> <b>spoon.</b>|$|E
50|$|A level tablespoon, {{the usual}} meaning without further qualification, is {{measured}} by filling the spoon and scraping it level. In contrast, a heaped, heaping, or rounded spoonful is not leveled off, and includes a heap above the spoon. The exact volume of a heaped tablespoon depends somewhat on the shape and curvature of the <b>measuring</b> <b>spoon</b> being used, and so is not a precise unit of measurement.|$|E

50|$|Cutlery in many {{countries}} includes (besides the fork and knife or butterknife) two spoons, which {{are referred to as}} a teaspoon and tablespoon — but {{not to be confused with}} measuring spoons. As cutlery, these spoons are not standardized and frequently hold somewhat less than their <b>measuring</b> <b>spoon</b> counterparts, that is 2-6 ml for teaspoons and 7-20 ml for tablespoons. The difference in size can be dangerous when used for critical measuring, like medication.|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section H of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This method describes test procedures for determination of sulfate content of soils and waters. These results are used in determining the corrosive nature of the environment for concrete structures, as well as for other purposes. In this test method the sulfate ion is precipitated with barium chloride, in an acidic medium, to barium sulfate crystals of uniform size. The barium sulfate present in suspension is determined by a measurement of its turbidity and comparison with a known standardization curve. Color or suspended materials in large quantities may interfere with this test method. If the amount of color or suspended materials are small in comparison to the sulfate concentration, interference can be corrected by running blanks from which the barium chloride is missing. Large amounts of organic materials and silica in excess of 500 mg/L may inhibit satisfactory barium sulfate precipitation. B. APPARATUS 1. A Photometer shall be operative at 420 mm, or nephelometer. The Hach turbidimeter, Model 2100 A, has been found to be satisfactory for this method. 2. A magnetic stirrer, with teflon covered magnetic stirring bars, is required. 3. A stopwatch shall be needed if the magnetic stirrer is not equipped with an accurate timer. 4. A <b>measuring</b> <b>spoon</b> shall have a capacity of 0. 2 to 0. 3 mL. C. REAGENTS 1. Conditioning Reagent. In 300 mL of distilled or deionized water, dissolve 30 mL of concentrated HCl, 100 mL of 95 % ethyl or isopropyl alcohol and 75 g of sodium chloride.

Este estudo objetivou avaliar o teor de sódio e glicose em soro de reidratação oral preparado por Agentes Comunitários de Saúde (ACS) que atuam em Unidades Básicas de Saúde (UBS), caracterizando o perfil e o conhecimento destes sobre a TRO. Após responderem questionário com informações profissionais e sobre a TRO, os ACS a prepararam por três métodos. O teor de glicose e de sódio das TRO foi determinado e comparado ao proposto pela OMS. Na análise estatística foram utilizados ANOVA, Tukey e odds ratio. Participaram do estudo 52 ACS, majoritariamente mulheres e com ensino médio completo (90, 4 %). A adequação da TRO foi de 3, 9; 9, 8 e 28, 9 % para a colher caseira, colher medida e punhado pitada, respectivamente. O preparo da TRO com a colher caseira resultou em 88, 0 % das amostras com teor de sódio perigoso à saúde (> 101 mmol/L). Entre os ACS, 38, 5 % tinham menos de 2 anos de trabalho, com risco 4, 8 vezes maior de preparar TRO inadequada em sódio. Os ACS referiram indicar a TRO no tratamento da diarreia infantil, desconhecendo efeitos colaterais do preparo inadequado. A composição da TRO produzida pelos ACS foi inadequada em todos os métodos. É recomendável treinamento dos ACS no preparo da TRO. Infant Diarrhea is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality in children and oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is required. This study evaluates the composition of ORT prepared by Community Health Agents (CHAs) working in Basic Health Units, assessing their profile and knowledge about ORT. After the CHAs answer specific questions, they are invited to prepare ORT using three methods. Glucose and sodium levels were then quantified and compared with WHO recommendations. ANOVA, Tukey and odds ratio were used for statistical analysis. 52 CHAs participated, mainly females, and 90. 4 % with full high school education. The adequacy of the ORT was 3. 9; 9. 8 and 28. 9 % for table spoon, <b>measuring</b> <b>spoon</b> and pinch and scoop, respectively. The ORT preparation by table spoon resulted in 88 % of samples with dangerous levels of sodium (> 101 mmol/L). 38. 5 % of the CHAs had less than 2 years experience, leading to a 4. 8 times greater risk of preparing ORT with high sodium. The CHAs indicated ORT as a treatment for diarrhea, though they were unaware of the side effects of inadequate preparation. The composition of the ORT produced by the CHAs was inadequate in all methods tested. The CHAs revealed a lack of knowledge of the side effects iof ORT with inadequate salt levels. The recommendation is to train the CHAs in ORT preparation...|$|E

40|$|While {{researchers}} have documented the premium consumers place on these products, {{little research has}} examined the meaning that these products hold for consumers. In essay 1, I identify {{the factors that influence}} both the meaning that consumers build into their customized products and the composition of that meaning (i. e., public versus private). Using two studies that engage participants in real customization tasks, I find that consumers 2 ̆ 7 identity motives interact with factors under the firm 2 ̆ 7 s control (e. g., design freedom) to influence product meaning, product evaluations, and satisfaction with customized products. In two additional studies, I ask other consumer to evaluate the designs. These measures are then used to assess the degree to which those customized products contain public and private meaning. By pairing these studies, I examine the relationship between the meaning that a product holds for the individual who created it and the meaning that it communicates to others. Together, four studies demonstrate that consumers 2 ̆ 7 identity-based motivations influence both the amount and the type of meaning that consumers build into their products. While much of the existing consumer behavior literature on signaling focuses on how consumers signal their identity to others (e. g., Berger and Heath 2007), the second essay of my dissertation examines how consumers may also use products to signal information to themselves (i. e., self-signal). Prior research (e. g., Townsend and Sood 2010) examines how choosing aesthetically pleasing products influences self-evaluations, but to my knowledge, no research has looked at how simply using attractive products influences self-evaluations and evaluations of resulting creations (i. e., cookies made with attractive vs. unattractive cooking utensils). In two studies, I find that even in seemingly mundane product categories (i. e., <b>measuring</b> <b>spoons</b> and writing paper), simply using aesthetically pleasing products may signal positive information about a consumer to himself. This effect is strongest when domain uncertainty is low and when the task is completed in private...|$|R

40|$|Background. Hand {{function}} {{is essential to}} a person’s self-efficacy and greatly affects quality of life. Adapted utensils with handles of increased diameters have historically been used to assist individuals with arthritis or other hand disabilities for feeding, and other related activities of daily living. To date, minimal research has examined the biomechanical effects of modified handles, or quantified the differences in ranges of motion (ROM) when using a standard versus a modified handle. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the ranges of motion (ROM) required for a healthy hand to use different adaptive spoons with electrogoniometry for the purpose of understanding the physiologic advantages that adapted spoons may provide patients with limited ROM. Methods. Hand measurements included the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP), proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP), and metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) for each finger and the interphalangeal (IP) and MCP joint for the thumb. Participants were 34 females age 18 – 30 (mean age 20. 38 ± 1. 67) with no previous hand injuries or abnormalities. Participants grasped spoons with standard handles, and spoons with handle diameters of 3. 18 cm (1. 25 inch), and 4. 45 cm (1. 75 inch). ROM measurements were obtained with an electrogoniometer to record the angle at each joint for each of the spoon handle sizes. Results. A 3 × 3 × 4 repeated <b>measures</b> ANOVA (<b>Spoon</b> handle size by Joint by Finger) found main effects on ROM of Joint (F(2, 33) = 318. 68, Partial η 2 =. 95, p <. 001), Spoon handle size (F(2, 33) = 598. 73, Partial η 2 =. 97, p <. 001), and Finger (F(3, 32) = 163. 83, Partial η 2 =. 94, p <. 001). As the spoon handle diameter size increased, the range of motion utilized to grasp the spoon handle decreased in all joints and all fingers (p < 0. 01). Discussion. This study confirms the hypothesis that less range of motion is required to grip utensils with larger diameter handles, which in turn may reduce challenges for patients with limited ROM of the hand...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of food portion size {{is critical in}} dietary studies. Hands are potentially useful as portion size estimation aids; however, their accuracy has not been tested. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the accuracy of a novel portion size estimation method using the width of the fingers as a 'ruler' to measure the dimensions of foods ('finger width method'), as well as fists and thumb or finger tips. These hand measures were also compared with household <b>measures</b> (cups and <b>spoons).</b> A total of sixty-seven participants (70  % female; age 32 · 7  (sd 13 · 7) years; BMI 23 · 2  (sd   3 · 5)  kg/m(2)) attended a 1 · 5 h session in which they estimated the portion sizes of forty-two pre-weighed foods and liquids. Hand measurements were used in conjunction with geometric formulas to convert estimations to volumes. Volumes determined with hand and household methods were converted to estimated weights using density factors. Estimated weights were compared with true weights, and the percentage difference from the true weight was used to compare accuracy between the hand and household methods. Of geometrically shaped foods and liquids estimated with the finger width method, 80 % were within ± 25  % of the true weight of the food, and 13  % were within ± 10  %, in contrast to 29  % of those estimated with the household method being within ± 25  % of the true weight of the food, and 8  % being within ± 10  %.
