50|$|In the Second World War, all shower valves for British {{military}} {{use were}} made by them. By 1950 the Leonard brand of shower equipment was becoming the main brand used for institutional buildings - schools and hospitals.

5000|$|Oil mist {{lubrication}} oils {{are applied to}} rolling element (antifriction) bearings as an oil mist. Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header). The point of origin is usually a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system.|$|E
5000|$|Temperature compensation: A {{temperature}} {{compensating valve}} tends {{to eliminate the}} issue where the temperature and pressure from tankless heaters decrease during continuous use. Most new generation tankless water heaters stabilize water pressure and temperature by a bypass valve and a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> incorporated in the unit. Modern tankless are not inversely proportional, because they regulate {{the amount of water}} they heat and discharge, and therefore stabilize water temperature by using a flow control valve. Temperature change, not flow speed, is the issue the water heater must address. The wider the temperature rise, the less flow from the unit—the smaller the temperature rise, the greater the flow. The flow control valve, in conjunction with thermistors, maintains a stable temperature throughout the use of the unit.|$|E
50|$|In industry, {{cavitation}} {{is often}} used to homogenize, or mix and break down, suspended particles in a colloidal liquid compound such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with hydraulic devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of <b>mixing</b> <b>valve,</b> against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as stainless steel, Stellite, or even polycrystalline diamond (PCD).|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{synthesise}} {{and evaluate}} {{the evidence of the}} effectiveness of interventions to prevent scalds in children. MethodsAn overview of systematic reviews (SR) and a SR of primary studies were performed evaluating interventions to prevent scalds in children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted covering various resources up to October 2012. Experimental and controlled observational studies reporting scald injuries, safety practices and safety equipment use were included. ResultsFourteen systematic reviews and 39 primary studies were included. There is little evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the incidence of scalds in children. More evidence was found that inventions are effective in promoting safe hot tap water temperature, especially when home safety education, home safety checks and discounted or free safety equipment including thermometers and thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> were provided. No consistent evidence was found for the effectiveness of interventions on the safe handling of hot food or drinks nor improving kitchen safety practices. ConclusionEducation, home safety checks along with thermometers or thermostatic <b>mixing</b> <b>valves</b> should be promoted to reduce tap water scalds.

5000|$|One {{surviving}} Hugon {{engine is}} owned by the Science Museum (London) and is currently on display at the Anson Engine Museum, there appear to be no other survivors. It is the same engine described in detail by Clerk, which was a half horse power engine at that time located at the South Kensington Museum (first edition of his work was in 1886). Clerk notes that [...] "The only parts that gave trouble were the bellows pumps controlling the gas supply to cylinder and igniting ports these were made of rubber, and deteriorating after some use gave trouble by leaking and occasional bursting. In some of the engines in use they were replaced with metal pumps and a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve.</b> With these additions the engine at the Patent Office Museum ran for many years." [...] The Patent Office Museum was transferred to the South Kensington Museum in 1883.

40|$|Many {{physiological}} experiments involve switching {{between two}} or more solutions. For example, when drugs are applied to tissues the concentration of the drug is usually changed as a step function, by switching from a control saline to a saline containing the drug. There are many instances {{where it would be}} advantageous to change the concentration according to some other function such as a ramp. This paper describes how this has been achieved by a <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> under electronic control. The <b>mixing</b> <b>valve</b> (incorporating a Lee Products, solenoid valve No LFAX 050303 AC) was arranged to control the mixing of two solutions and thus vary the composition of the effluent stream. The composition of the solution leaving the output is directly proportional to the time that the valve allows each of the inputs to be connected to the output (Cook & Hokanson, 1976). The electronic circuit for control of the valve is shown in Fig. 1. Driving current for the valve is provided by TRX under control of a pulse width modulator, ICi Fig. 1 (A). Permanently connected to the non-inverting input of ICi is a triangula...|$|E

2500|$|Hot {{water can}} cause painful, {{dangerous}} scalding injuries, especially {{in children and}} the elderly. Water at the outlet should not exceed 49 degrees Celsius.
