25|$|In 2001, AECL began {{tests at}} Chalk River Labs to {{determine}} the feasibility of using surplus <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX) from the Russian and U.S. defence programs (which contains plutonium) as a fuel in CANDU reactors.|$|E
25|$|The main {{by-product}} of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some {{is used in}} applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as anti-tank shells, and {{on at least one}} occasion even a sailboat keel. It is also used with plutonium for making <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.|$|E
25|$|Reprocessing can {{potentially}} recover up to 95% {{of the remaining}} uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel.</b> This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors, which are not commercially available.|$|E
50|$|The complex has {{an interim}} storage facility. There {{is also a}} 60 t/year {{commercial}} <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> (MOX) <b>fuel</b> fabrication facility (MFFF). The place employs 7000 people.|$|R
40|$|Mixed-oxide fuels {{containing}} uranium with thorium and/or plutonium {{may play}} {{an important part in}} future nuclear fuel cycles. There are, however, significantly less data available for these materials than conventional uranium dioxide fuel. In the present study, we employ molecular dynamics calculations to simulate the elastic properties and thermal expansivity of a range of <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> compositions. These are then used to support equations of state and oxygen self-diffusion models to provide a self-consistent prediction of the behaviour of these <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> at arbitrary compositions...|$|R
25|$|UO2 is used {{mainly as}} nuclear fuel, {{specifically}} as UO2 or as {{a mixture of}} UO2 and PuO2 (plutonium dioxide) called a <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> (MOX <b>fuel),</b> {{in the form of}} fuel rods in nuclear reactors.|$|R
25|$|Since its {{inception}} as a nuclear facility, Sellafield {{has also been}} host to reprocessing operations, which separate the uranium, plutonium, and fission products from spent nuclear fuel. The uranium can then {{be used in the}} manufacture of new nuclear fuel, or in applications where its density is an asset. The plutonium can be used in the manufacture of <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX) for thermal reactors, or as fuel for fast breeder reactors, such as the Prototype Fast Reactor at Dounreay. These processes, including the associated cooling ponds, require considerable amounts of water and the licence to extract water from Wast Water, formerly held by BNFL, is now held by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this effect {{is the use of}} nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a fertile {{material}} that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term activity curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types {{can be seen in the}} figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and <b>Mixed</b> <b>Oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see Long-lived fission product#Actinides).|$|E
2500|$|... 238U from {{depleted}} uranium and natural uranium {{is also used}} with recycled Pu-239 from nuclear weapons stockpiles for making <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX), which is now being redirected to become fuel for nuclear reactors. This dilution, also called downblending, means that any nation or group that acquired the finished fuel would have to repeat the very expensive and complex chemical separation of uranium and plutonium process before assembling a weapon.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> (MOX) <b>fuel,</b> the xenon tends to diffuse out of the plutonium-rich areas of the fuel, and it is then trapped in the {{surrounding}} uranium dioxide. The neodymium tends to not be mobile.|$|R
40|$|Some example {{applications}} are presented, {{in which the}} peculiar Raman fingerprint of PuO 2 {{can be used for}} the detection of crystalline Pu 4 + with cubic symmetry in an oxide environment in various host materials, like <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels,</b> inert matrices and corium sub-systems. The PuO 2 Raman fingerprint was previously observed to consist of one main T 2 g vibrational mode at 478 cm − 1 and two crystal electric field transition lines at 2130 cm − 1 and 2610 cm − 1. This particular use of Raman spectroscopy is promising for applications in nuclear waste management, safety and safeguard. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{advanced}} <b>Mixed</b> <b>Oxide</b> (MOX) <b>fuel</b> forms {{are currently being}} investigated at Los Alamos National Laboratory that {{have the potential to}} be effective plutonium management tools. Evolutionary <b>Mixed</b> <b>Oxide</b> (EMOX) <b>fuel</b> is a slight perturbation on standard MOX fuel, but achieves greater plutonium destruction rates by employing a fractional nonfertile component. A pure nonfertile fuel is also being studied. Initial calculations show that the fuel can be utilized in existing light water reactors and tailored to address different plutonium management goals (i. e., stabilization or reduction of plutonium inventories residing in spent nuclear fuel). In parallel, experiments are being performed to determine the feasibility of fabrication of such fuels. Initial EMOX pellets have successfully been fabricated using weapons-grade plutonium...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] is {{a nuclear}} power plant in the town of Ikata in the Nishiuwa District of Ehime Prefecture, Japan. It is the only nuclear plant on the island of Shikoku. It is owned and {{operated}} by the Shikoku Electric Power Company. The plant was shut down along with all other nuclear plants in Japan following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Unit 3 was reactivated using plutonium-uranium <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> on 12 August 2016 and began providing electricity to the grid three days later.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} stage, fast breeder {{reactors}} (FBRs) {{would use a}} mixed oxide (MOX) fuel made from plutonium-239, recovered by reprocessing spent fuel from the first stage, and natural uranium. In FBRs, plutonium-239 undergoes fission to produce energy, while the uranium-238 present in the <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> transmutes to additional plutonium-239. Thus, the Stage II FBRs are designed to [...] "breed" [...] more fuel than they consume. Once the inventory of plutonium-239 is built up thorium can be introduced as a blanket material in the reactor and transmuted to uranium-233 {{for use in the}} third stage.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 December 2011 {{a lawsuit}} was started against Kyūshū Electric Power Company by 290 local residents. Most of them {{living in the}} prefectures Saga and Fukuoka. They said that the {{disaster}} in Fukushima had made it clear, that an accident at the Genkai-plant caused by a possible earthquake or tsunami could damage the lives and health of the people living nearby. They questioned in particular {{the safety of the}} 36-year-old nr. 1 reactor near the sea. Kyushu Electric commented, that it would examine the suit and would act [...] "appropriately." [...] This was already the third time that locals tried to stop this plant. Because in July 2011 90 people asked the local court for an injunction order to stop the nr. 2 and nr. 3 Genkai-reactors from going back online, like was done in August 2010 when about 130 local residents and others demanded from the district court to halt to the use of plutonium-uranium <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel,</b> or MOX, at the No. 3 Genkai-reactor.|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of spent fuel produced in nuclear power generation {{is one of}} the most important issues to both the nuclear community and the general public. One of the viable options to long-term geological disposal of spent fuel is to extract plutonium, minor actinides (MA), and potentially long-lived fission products from the spent fuel and transmute them into short-lived or stable radionuclides in currently operating light-water reactors (LWR), thus reducing the radiological toxicity of the nuclear waste stream. One of the challenges is to demonstrate that the burnup-dependent characteristic differences between Reactor-Grade <b>Mixed</b> <b>Oxide</b> (RG-MOX) <b>fuel</b> and RG-MOX fuel with MA Np- 237 and Am 241 are minimal, particularly, the inert gas generation rate, such that the commercial MOX fuel experience base is applicable. Under the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), developmental fuel specimens in experimental assembly LWR- 2 are being tested in the northwest (NW) I- 24 irradiation position of the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). The experiment uses MOX fuel test hardware, and contains capsules with MOX <b>fuel</b> consisting of <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> manufactured <b>fuel</b> using reactor grade plutonium (RG-Pu) and <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> manufactured <b>fuel</b> using RG-Pu with added Np/Am.

500|$|... 232Th absorbs {{neutrons}} {{more readily}} than 238U, and 233U has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0%) than 235U (85.5%) or 239Pu (73.5%). It also releases more neutrons upon fission on average. A single neutron capture by 238U produces transuranic waste along with the fissile 239Pu, but 232Th only produces this waste after five captures, forming 237Np. This number of captures does not happen for 98–99% of the 232Th nuclei because the intermediate products 233U or 235U undergo fission, and fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.|$|R
40|$|The {{plutonium}} redistribution model (PUREDI) calculates the steady-state and transient radial plutonium concentration as {{a function}} of the radial temperature profile and the time for <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> (MOX). In the context of developing a TRANSURANUS version for Gen-IV fast reactor fuels, PUREDI has been modified and extended to include the effects of the local power density profile and the oxygen-to-metal ratio on plutonium transport. The model has been extensively verified by means of specific numerical tests, and after incorporation in the TRANSURANUS fuel performance code, has been assessed on the basis of post irradiation examinations of the SUPERFACT experiment, showing a good agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|AbstractThe three stage Indian {{nuclear power}} {{programme}} envisages efficient use of its modest uranium resources and full exploitation of its vast Thorium resources. Indian economy is on a fast growth track. The growth in population and economy is creating huge demand for energy which has to be met with environmentally benign technologies. Nuclear Energy is best suited to meet this demand without causing undue environmental impact. In view of limited resources of Uranium and vast resources of Thorium, a closed fuel cycle to fully exploit {{the potential of the}} two resources is co nsidered essential. In conformity with such a strategy, Recycle fuel fabrication technologies have been under development in India for over three decades.
