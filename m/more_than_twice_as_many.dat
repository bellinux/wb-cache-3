5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> {{points in the second}} half of the season than they did in the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|When {{the heated}} and air {{conditioned}} McDonald's Cycle Center opened, bicycle parking facilities with amenities, which had {{first appeared in}} the U.S. on the West Coast, did not exist in the Midwest. When it opened in 2006 the bike station was one of the country's largest and most modern. The Cycle Center's bicycle parking facilities use high-capacity, two-tiered DoubleParker racks that accommodate <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> bicycles per square foot as traditional bike racks. These racks were manufactured by Josta, a German manufacturer of bicycle parking systems and stands. The interior design was a joint collaboration between the city of Chicago, Josta, and Cycle-Safe, Inc. of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which also produces lockers and racks for bicycles. The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick's 12 ODI {{hundreds}} are {{the most}} by an English cricketer, followed by Graham Gooch with eight, and current player Kevin Pietersen with seven. Trescothick passed Gooch's tally when he scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI in 2005. This was also the fastest of his career, off 76 balls, the third fastest ODI century for an English batsman. Trescothick made his first ODI century against Pakistan, scoring a career-best 137. His century the following year against India in {{the final of the}} 2002 NatWest Series, along with two fifties earlier in the competition, saw him named Man of the Series. He was again named Man of the Series in the 2003 NatWest Challenge, finishing the three-match series with a century, a fifty and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> runs as any other player. Only six days later, captaining his side against South Africa, Trescothick scored another century and, alongside fellow opener Vikram Solanki, set an English record first wicket partnership of 200. His ODI hundreds have been made against 10 different opponents, on seven different grounds. Six of his centuries have been scored in London, equally split between The Oval and Lord's.|$|E

25|$|Indian wars were fought {{throughout}} the western regions, with more {{conflicts in the}} states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state's boundaries between Americans and the natives. Arizona ranked highest in war deaths, with 4,340 killed, including soldiers, civilians and Native Americans. That was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as occurred in Texas, the second highest ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the Apache. Michno also says that fifty-one percent of the Indian war battles between 1850 and 1890 took place in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico, as well as thirty-seven percent of the casualties in the county west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
25|$|Although Cook's strike {{rate was}} poor {{compared}} with other forwards in the team, manager Len Goulden kept faith {{with him for the}} following campaign. One of three players to play in all 50 of Watford's fixtures, he finished as the club's top scorer with 31 goals in all competitions, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as his nearest competitor—and the previous season's top scorer—Roy Brown. Cook scored 15 and 16 goals in 1955–56 and 1956–57 respectively, and amassed 10 goals in 30 Watford games {{in the first half of}} 1957–58. Between his debut and his final appearance, Cook made 218 appearances in the Football League and FA Cup, scoring 77 goals and missing only four games.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{found that}} the two {{versions}} of the manuscript transcripts disagreed with each other, and contained material not found in the official report of the court. He concluded that the report was an attempt by the Court to suggest that formal trials had been held, when the proceedings did not follow accepted procedures for trials and due process. Their proceedings had been held in secret and defendants could not confront their accusers. After Vesey and the first five conspirators were executed, the Court had another 82 suspects arrested in July, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as had been arrested in June. Johnson suggested that, after public criticism, the Court was motivated to prove there was a conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Ferguson is the joint-most {{decorated}} {{manager in}} European football competitions with seven honours, a record {{he shares with}} Giovanni Trapattoni and Carlo Ancelotti.

He is also the first manager {{in the history of}} the English league to win three consecutive league titles, which he did twice.

Although Davis had initially been the favourite, it was widely acknowledged that his candidacy was marred by a disappointing conference speech. Cameron's election as the Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition was announced on 6 December 2005. As is customary for an Opposition leader not already a member, upon election Cameron became a member of the Privy Council, being formally approved to join on 14 December 2005, and sworn of the Council on 8 March 2006.|$|E

During his time on the three member court he wrote the majority opinion on 845 of the nearly 2300 cases he presided over. That was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> decisions authored by any other justice in the court's history and remains a record.

25|$|In {{the opening}} {{race of the}} 1997 Formula One season, David Coulthard {{produced}} victory for McLaren and ushered {{in a new era}} of success for the British based squad. Coincidentally this was the first race in which McLaren had competed with a silver livery due to West replacing Marlboro, who moved to Ferrari, as title sponsor. The colour drew inevitable comparisons to the Silver Arrows of a previous era, and the nickname was applied to the McLarens. This was a significant result in F1 racing, McLaren's first victory for three seasons and the first win for Mercedes-Benz since Juan Manuel Fangio's success at the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. McLaren and Mercedes-Benz still, however, finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship behind the same three teams as the previous two seasons, but they had collected <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> points in '97 as they had in '95.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century (40 years after the Qing reconquest), there were about 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. According to an early-19th-century Xinjiang census, the population was 30 percent Han and 60 percent Turkic. In the 1953 census the percentages were six percent Han and 75 percent Uyghur, and the 2000 census indicated 40.57 percent Han and 45.21 percent Uyghur. Stanley W. Toops said that the current demographic situation {{is similar to that of}} the early Qing period. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing settled Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the region's Zunghar Oirat Mongols; one-third of Xinjiang's population were Hui and Han in the northern area, and about two-thirds were Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in the southern Xinjiang oases (the Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria). Critics have said that the government's response to Uyghur concerns do little to address the underlying issues.|$|E
