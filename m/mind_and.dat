40|$|This chapter proposes that, though {{based in}} the social sciences, the {{tripartite}} model of disability {{can be used to}} enrich critical approaches to the arts and humanities. The aim is to recognise not only the difficulties but also the positivisms of disability. How have the arts and humanities privileged certain <b>minds</b> <b>and</b> bodies; problematised other <b>minds</b> <b>and</b> bodies; and promoted an appreciation of the <b>minds</b> <b>and</b> bodies that come under the rubric of disability? These are the considerations that underpin the methodological application of the tripartite model of disability...|$|R

5|$|Electric Music for the <b>Mind</b> <b>and</b> Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the <b>Mind</b> <b>and</b> Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

60|$|Those who are {{unaccustomed to}} {{philosophical}} speculation may {{be inclined to}} dismiss such a doctrine as obviously absurd.
