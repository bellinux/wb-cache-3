2500|$|Between 1946â€“1948 the Santa Fe {{increased}} {{the length of}} the El Capitan and added new cars built during and after World War II. The new El Capitan included a <b>storage</b> <b>mail</b> <b>car,</b> baggage-dormitory, eight 44-seat [...] "leg-rest" [...] coaches, two lunch counter-dining cars, a club-lounge, and a coach-observation car. Most of the coaches were built by Pullman-Standard. The reduced seating in the coaches was given over to improved leg room for passengers.|$|R
50|$|The Shoshone was a named {{passenger}} train of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and its subsidiary the Colorado and Southern Railway. The train operated between Denver, Colorado and Billings, Montana via Casper, Wyoming and the Wind River Canyon. The train operated until September 1, 1967. In 1946 the train featured standard heavyweight sleeping car accommodation, dining car service, and reclining chair cars. By 1967 {{the name was}} dropped and the train consisted of only a modernized heavyweight coach and <b>storage</b> <b>mail</b> <b>cars</b> which were picked up and dropped off en-route.|$|R
50|$|Shortly before W.W.I, the Post Office Department began {{assigning}} {{railway mail}} clerks to new Transfer Office positions which were established {{at many of}} the larger railroad junction points as well as passenger terminals in larger cities. These transfer clerks supervised mail exchanges between trains, served as the local liaison between the Railway Mail Service and the host railroad, and maintained detailed statistical records which were used to audit railroad charges for mail transportation and car usage. This latter task involved determining the amount of mail in baggage <b>cars</b> or <b>storage</b> <b>mail</b> <b>cars,</b> a unique process of estimating the car area occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been mailed at depot letter boxes and providing a hand-to-hand receipt for registered mail transferred between connecting railway post office routes. Many of the transfer offices had a unique postmark to cancel the mail which was sorted by the office, and these cancellations are still collected by philatelists and postal historians.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> {{requires}} more stringent and diligent packing than standard moving, since the packages will {{be handled by}} shippers or a <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> company's pickup/delivery service. For example, the thin walls of standard moving boxes cannot withstand the multiple transfers, stacking and other rigors of the shipping / mailing process. Further, failing to pack the boxes fully may result in boxes that [...] "cave in" [...] when other boxes are stacked on them. <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> companies often request customers to use thick walled or reinforced shipping boxes, to reinforce the seams with heavy duty packing tape, and to pack boxes to their fullest (while not over-stuffing them). This advice applies to boxes provided by <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> firms as well as boxes provided by the customer. Many <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> companies charge re-boxing and handling fees for boxes that are poorly packed or damaged on arrival. In addition, insurance charges that were paid by customers may not apply for boxes that were damaged in transit.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, the A&WP, Western of Alabama, and L&N {{continued}} {{to run the}} Crescent between Atlanta and New Orleans. Each morning, the Crescent and the Southern Crescent departed Atlanta for New Orleans over different routes. After November 1968, the Crescent was a coach-only train sustained by two <b>storage</b> <b>mail</b> <b>cars.</b> With the discontinuance of the [...] "Humming Bird" [...] on January 9, 1969, it was run combined with the Pan-American south of Montgomery, leaving Atlanta at 7:15 p. m. on the old [...] "Piedmont Limited" [...] schedule. In 1970, with the mail contract cancelled, the Crescent was discontinued.Southern Railway, a predecessor of Norfolk Southern, initially opted out of Amtrak in 1971. After May 1, 1971, Amtrak, assuming the services of the Penn Central, carried the Southern Crescent between New York and Washington. For {{a portion of the}} mid-1970s, Southern only operated tri-weekly between Atlanta and New Orleans, and carried a run-through Amtrak 10-6 sleeper on those days to connect to the Sunset Limited. On occasion, when the Southern deemed an Amtrak car to be unfit for the level of service that the SOU subscribed to, a Southern sleeper would be substituted in the consist. Also, one of the two dome coaches in the Southern car fleet was added for the leg south of Atlanta.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>storage</b> is a {{relatively}} new concept with startup companies in Great Britain and the US. In the US, many companies have launched and continue to offer services today, while a few early innovators are no longer in business. The market has quickly evolved to become specialized, with a number of variations on the initial <b>Mail</b> <b>Storage</b> concept currently being offered. For example, services that target the higher education populations offer drop off and pick up to college dormitories, and [...] "micro self-storage" [...] services offer less-than-full storage containers delivered to a residence. Some services provide customized cardboard or plastic boxes and/or packing materials as part of the cost, standardizing the boxes for optimal storage while adding a requisite waiting time for the packing materials and boxes to arrive. Other variants allow customers to self pack and send boxes directly to self-storage one box at a time (or as many boxes as needed) and offer to-the-doorstep delivery in another location, eliminating the requirement to pick up items in the same location as where they were stored.|$|R

50|$|LMTP is {{designed}} {{as an alternative}} to normal SMTP for situations where the receiving side does not have a mail queue, such as a <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> server acting as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA). Mail queues are an inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since a <b>mail</b> <b>storage</b> server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more <b>storage</b> for a <b>mail</b> queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for a mail message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients. LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each recipient, allowing the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be an Internet-facing mail gateway. LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks. In other words, the Message transfer agent (MTA) still handles all outgoing mail, including the mail stream from the LMTP, to another mail server located somewhere on the Internet.|$|R

50|$|IMAP {{supports}} both on-line and off-line {{modes of}} operation. E-mail clients using IMAP generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.
