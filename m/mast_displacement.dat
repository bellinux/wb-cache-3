40|$|An {{experimental}} {{wind tunnel}} study on the dynamic response of a 300 m tall guyed telecommunication mast under various wind loads was undertaken at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL) in the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada. Although the dynamic response of guyed masts subjected to turbulent wind loads has been routinely analyzed using a number of numerical models, typically in the frequency domain, limited experimental verification of the dynamic analysis results has been performed. Full-scale measurements, where available, {{have proven to be}} difficult to correlate with analytical models due to the tremendous uncertainty inherent in field measurements. As a result, the need for systematic validation of existing analytical models remains. In this investigation, a representative 300 m tall guyed telecommunication mast has been designed and modeled to an appropriate scale. Based on Canadian Standard CSA S 37 - 01, and an empirical study on 41 existing guyed masts, the 300 m tall guyed mast was designed using wind load conforming to representative Canadian climate data obtained from National Building Code of Canada (NBCC 1995). Appropriate properties for the dynamically scaled full aeroelastic model were derived from the 300 m tall prototype guyed mast, which was intended to represent a realistic guyed mast for broadcasting applications in Canada. The wind tunnel test of the guyed mast model was carried out in both open country and over water exposures, simulating medium and low turbulence flow conditions, respectively. Dynamic response characteristics measured during the wind tunnel tests have been analysed and summarized, including dynamic displacements, bending moments, response spectra and peak factors, as well as natural frequencies, mode shapes and structural damping. Comparisons have been made with predictions obtained from an existing frequency domain analysis model. The wind tunnel test results show that good agreement was generally achieved between the frequency domain analytical model and the wind tunnel model with respect to both the magnitude and distribution of the monitored responses. It was found that measured dynamic bending moments were distributed in a fairly uniform manner over the mast height, and that mean (static) bending moments exhibit large variations, along with near-zero response zones at points of contraflexure. It was also found that nonlinear damping effects, associated with vibrations of the highly slackened leeward guys on the upper levels of the mast, may be beneficial in reducing dynamic mast displacements. The spectrum studies indicated that lowest modes were dominated by large guy movements at top guy level and small mast movements, the middle modes were characterized by coupled effects between the guyed cables and mast, meanwhile the highest modes involved significant mast movements with little guy vibration. It is evident that the top of the <b>mast</b> <b>displacement</b> are dominated by the first and second modes...|$|E
500|$|The {{engineering}} of the masts {{was complicated}} because stability {{was so important}} to the overall design success of the suspension structure. [...] <b>Mast</b> <b>displacements</b> could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|R

The objective behind this method of modelling is to utilize the basic partial differential equations of motion for this distributed parameter system and {{not to use the}} modal expansion in developing the model. The final model obtained is in terms of a transfer function matrix which relates the flexible <b>mast</b> parameters like <b>displacement,</b> slope, shear stress, etc. to external forces and moments...|$|R
50|$|The replica frigate {{has three}} <b>masts</b> and her <b>displacement</b> is 220 tons. She is 25 metres (82.0 ft) long at her centre line, 27.5 metres (90 ft) long on deck and 34.5 metres (113 ft) long overall. The Shtandart is 6.9 metres (23 ft) wide with {{a draft of}} 3.3 metres (11 ft). The ship is {{designed}} for speeds between 8-9 knots under sail, and under auxiliary engines required by modern standards up to 15 knots (28 km/h). The original crew complement in 1703 was between 120 and 150, and the modern crew consists of 30 trainees and 10 officers.|$|R

The technical part of the measurement and evaluation program considers topics as climate statistics, wind and wave loading, detailed performance monitoring of the wind turbines, etc. The meteorological measurements at the 116 m high meteorological mast at the location of the wind farm are published on the project website and are widely used. Data at measurement sample frequency have been stored since May 2007 and recently have become available. From the acceleration measurements at the <b>mast</b> top, the <b>displacements</b> are reconstructed and the effect of these movements on the uncertainty of the wind speed measurements are estimated. From the acceleration measurements it is found that the influence of the mast-top movements on the wind speed measurements is limited and smaller than the flow distortion of the mast itself. The project is carried out under assignment of NoordzeeWind BV...|$|R
