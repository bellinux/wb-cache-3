The ‘Interpretation Manual for <b>Marine</b> <b>Habitats</b> within the 25 NM Fisheries Management Zone around the Republic of Malta’ provides an updated description of <b>marine</b> <b>habitats</b> found around the Maltese Islands, as well as a cross-referencing scheme for the different <b>habitat</b> classification systems. <b>Marine</b> <b>habitats</b> are listed according to bathymetric zone, going from shallow to deep water.

Habitats listed in the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) database were reviewed, habitats which are present in the Maltese Islands were identified, and ‘new’ habitat categories have been included in the manual where there was no equivalent EUNIS habitat.

The depth gradient covered by the surveys (30 – 84 m) and variability in structure density and relief also permitted analyses of the effects of these characteristics on fish richness, diversity, and assemblage composition. ROVs captured a variety of species inhabiting these reefs from large transient piscivores to small herbivorous reef fishes.

40|$|Background: Many studies {{compare the}} {{population}} dynamics of single <b>species</b> within multiple <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> while much less {{is known about}} the differences in population dynamics in closely related species in the same habitat. Additionally, comparisons of the effect of <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> and <b>species</b> are largely missing. Methodology and Principal Findings: We estimated the importance of the <b>habitat</b> <b>type</b> and <b>species</b> for population dynamics of plants. Specifically, we compared the dynamics of two closely related species, the allotetraploid species Anthericum liliago and the diploid species Anthericum ramosum, occurring in the same <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> We also compared the dynamics of A. ramosum in two contrasting habitats. We examined three populations per <b>species</b> and <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> The results showed that single life history traits as well as the mean population dynamics of A. liliago and A. ramosum from the same <b>habitat</b> <b>type</b> were more similar than the population dynamics of A. ramosum from the two contrasting habitats. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that when transferring knowledge regarding population dynamics between populations, we need to take habitat conditions into account, as these conditions appear to be more important than the species involved (ploidy level). However, the two species differ significantly in their overall population growth rates, indicating that the ploidy level has an effect on species performance. In contrast to what has been suggested by previous studies, we observed a higher population growth rate in the diploid species. This is in agreement with the wider range of habitats occupied by the diploid species...|$|R

40|$|Using benthic habitat {{data from}} the Florida Keys (USA), we {{demonstrate}} how siting algorithms can help identify potential networks of marine reserves that comprehensively represent target <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> We applied a flexible optimization tool-simulated annealing-to represent a fixed proportion of different <b>marine</b> <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> within a geographic area. We investigated the relative influence of spatial information, planning-unit size, detail of habitat classification, and magnitude of the overall conservation goal on the resulting network scenarios. With this method, {{we were able to}} identify many adequate reserve systems that met the conservation goals, e. g., representing at least 20 % of each conservation target (i. e., <b>habitat</b> <b>type)</b> while fulfilling the overall aim of minimizing the system area and perimeter. One of the most useful types of information provided by this siting algorithm comes from an irreplaceability analysis, which is a count of the number of, times unique planning units were included in reserve system scenarios. This analysis indicated that many different combinations of sites produced networks that met the conservation goals. While individual 1 -km(2) areas were fairly interchangeable, the irreplaceability analysis highlighted larger areas within the planning region that were chosen consistently to meet the goals incorporated into the algorithm. Additionally, we found that reserve systems designed {{with a high degree of}} spatial clustering tended to have considerably less perimeter and larger overall areas in reserve-a configuration that may be preferable particularly for sociopolitical reasons. This exercise illustrates the value of using the simulated annealing algorithm to help site marine reserves: the approach makes efficient use of;available resources, can be used interactively by conservation decision makers, and offers biologically suitable alternative networks from which an effective system of marine reserves can be crafted...|$|R
