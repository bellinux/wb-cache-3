5|$|<b>MOL</b> Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate <b>MOL</b> space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early <b>MOL</b> stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E

5|$|Big Gemini, or Big G, {{grew out}} of a 1963 {{proposal}} called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets. It was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space, {{and to be able to}} dock with space stations, in support of Apollo Applications and <b>MOL</b> missions. It would have been launched by a Heavy lift launch vehicle; either a Titan IIIG or Saturn INT-20, the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended for NASA missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply <b>MOL</b> space stations later in the program. NASA also proposed several Saturn IB derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to the INT-20, offering similar payload capacity.|$|E

For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access to the space station.|$|E
40|$|Oligodendrocyte {{precursor}} cells (OPCs) are most susceptibleto oxidative {{stress in the}} brain. However, the cause ofdifferences in susceptibility to oxidative stress between OPCsand mature oligodendrocytes (<b>mOLs)</b> remains unclear. Recently,we identified in vivo that αB-crystallin (aBC) is expressedin <b>mOLs</b> but not in OPCs. Therefore, we examined in thepresent study whether aBC expression could affect cellsurvival under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxideusing primary cultures of OPCs and <b>mOLs</b> from neonatal ratbrains. Expression of aBC was greater in <b>mOLs</b> than in OPCs,and the survival rate of <b>mOLs</b> {{was significantly higher than}} thatof OPCs under oxidative stress. Suppression of aBC by siRNAtransfection resulted in a decrease in the survival rate of mOLsunder oxidative stress. These data suggest that highersusceptibility of OPCs than <b>mOLs</b> to oxidative stress is due, atleast in part, to low levels of aBC expression. [BMB Reports 2013; 46 (10) : 501 - 506...|$|R
