Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls. According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain, or took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market.|$|E

Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 USD and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, resentment {{amongst the}} {{population}} of Italy against the foreigner Avitus grew. The Gallo-Roman Emperor had given to {{other members of the}} Gallo-Roman aristocracy many key offices of the public administration usually filled by Romans. Furthermore, {{the population of}} Rome, devastated by the sack of Rome, suffered from food shortages due to the Vandal control of the naval routes, aggravated by the requirements of the foreign troops that had arrived with Avitus. The imperial treasury was almost empty and, after disbanding his Visigoth guard because of popular pressure, Avitus was obliged to pay their huge wages by <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> and selling the bronze of some statues.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{comprises}} six separate {{boiling water}} reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and {{maintained by the}} Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At {{the time of the}} quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).|$|E

500|$|With the Persians at {{the very}} gate of Constantinople, Heraclius thought of abandoning the city and moving the capital to Carthage, but the {{powerful}} church figure Patriarch Sergius convinced him to stay. Safe behind the walls of Constantinople, Heraclius was able to sue for peace in exchange for an annual tribute of a thousand talents of gold, a thousand talents of silver, a thousand silk robes, a thousand horses, and a thousand virgins to the Persian King.

500|$|After heavy mintages of the nickel in 1883 and 1884, {{production}} was much lower in 1885 and 1886. [...] This {{was due to}} an economic downturn which lowered demand for the coins. [...] The 1886 {{production was}} also depressed by the Treasury's decision to reissue large numbers of worn minor coins. [...] It was not until September 1886 that the Mint resumed full production of the coin. [...] By 1887, however, the Mint was overwhelmed by orders, <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> large quantities of older copper-nickel coins to meet the demand. [...] Despite these efforts, the Mint was forced to return many orders unfilled. [...] Demand remained strong until 1894, when the Mint temporarily suspended production as it had accumulated a surplus during the Panic of 1893.|$|E
500|$|The {{piece was}} struck by the tens of millions, at all three mints (Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco), through the {{remainder}} of the 1910s. In 1921, a recession began, and no nickels at all were struck the following year. [...] The low mintage for the series was the 1926-S, at 970,000â€” the only date-mint combination with a mintage of less than 1 million. [...] The second lowest mintage for the series came with the 1931 nickel struck at the San Francisco Mint. The 1931-S was minted in a quantity of 194,000 early in the year. There was no need for more to be struck, but Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly asked the San Francisco Mint to strike more so that the pieces would not be hoarded. [...] Using materials on hand, including the <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> of worn-out nickels, San Francisco found enough metal to strike 1,000,000more pieces. Large quantities were saved in the hope they would become valuable, and the coin is not particularly rare today despite the low mintage.|$|E

500|$|In December 1943, the Treasury Department {{announced}} that the steel cent would be discontinued after 1943, to be replaced with coins containing 95% copper and 5% zinc (pre-1943 cents contained the same percentage of copper but might also contain tin in place {{of some of the}} zinc). [...] The Treasury also stated that some of the metal for the new coins would be obtained by <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> small arms ammunition shells. [...] However, numismatic writer Shane Anderson, in his study of the Lincoln cent, doubts that any shells were melted down, except perhaps ceremonially. After the war, the Treasury quietly retired as many steel cents as it could from circulation, while denying it was doing soâ€”no public admission of the program was made until 1959, as the Treasury feared that were it publicly known, the coins would be hoarded. [...] A few 1943 bronze cents and 1944 steel cents are known to exist, and are valuable. [...] Only one 1943-D cent in bronze is known; it sold in [...] for $1.7million. [...] One of the four known 1943-S cents in bronze was sold to [...] Texas Rangers baseball team co-chairman Bob R. Simpson for $1 million. [...] There are also many cents dated 1943 that were coated with copper to imitate the genuine rarity. [...] These pieces may be distinguished from genuine off-metal strikes by the use of a magnet. [...] The planchets from which the 1943 and 1944 off-metal strikes were coined were most likely concealed in the coining equipment and were struck when coinage resumed after year end. [...] The cent returned to its prewar composition in 1946.|$|E

[...] According to the New York Daily News, an associate of Trump said the move was meant to appease Reform Party leaders. [...] Roger Stone denied the suggestion. [...] In addressing the matter, Trump complimented Knauss and commented, [...] "she will be missed." [...] Shortly thereafter, {{in an attempt to}} bring the two Reform Party factions together, Trump invited party leaders to the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Addressing the 170 party members, who attended the event (including former chairman Russ Verney), Trump proclaimed [...] "I'm very proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura." [...] Verney appreciated the gesture and in shifting from his once-chilly reception to the Trump candidacy, he welcomed Trump into the race. [...] After opening the event to questions, one attendee asked Trump whether he would appear at the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Trump said he would consider it [...] "very seriously." [...] Concerning Buchanan, Trump repeated he could not support Buchanan as the party's nominee. [...] Despite the retreat, the intra-party dispute over the location of the convention continued. [...] Citing scheduling conflicts, Trump did not attend the Florida Reform Party's state convention. [...] Reports suggested that Trump insiders believed Buchanan had packed the convention with supporters and would embarrass Trump by winning all the state's delegates. [...] There were also growing indications Trump was considering withdrawing from the race, commenting that he was [...] "deeply concerned" [...] about the conflict within the party. [...] In another attempt to unite the party's factions, Trump wrote letters to Ventura and Perot, requesting the two make peace. [...] Trump believed the instability of the party would hinder his chances of presidential success. Stone commented that [...] "the [...] party is <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> before our very eyes." [...] On the final day of January, Trump was removed from the New York primary ballot after a judge determined that Trump's supporters had failed to obtain the required 5,000 signatures from registered Reform Party members. [...] This marked a victory for Buchanan's supporters, including leftist activist Lenora Fulani, who had hoped to prevent Trump from appearing on the ballot in his home state.|$|E

2500|$|Gresham was not {{the first}} to state the law which took his name. The {{phenomenon}} had been noted much earlier, in the 14th century, by Nicole Oresme. In the year that Gresham was born, 1519, it was described by Nicolaus Copernicus in a treatise called Monetae cudendae ratio: [...] "bad (debased) coinage drives good (un-debased) coinage out of circulation." [...] Copernicus was aware of the practice of exchanging bad coins for good ones and <b>melting</b> <b>down</b> the latter or sending them abroad, and he seems to have drawn up some notes on this subject while he was at Olsztyn in 1519. He made them the basis of a report which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522, attending the session with his friend Tiedemann Giese to represent his chapter. Copernicus's Monetae cudendae ratio was an enlarged, Latin version of that report, setting forth a general theory of money for the 1528 diet. He also formulated a version of the quantity theory of money.|$|E
