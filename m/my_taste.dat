In later life, Ravel recalled, [...] "Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music. My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age." [...] There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father. although free compulsory secular education became the law in 1882.|$|E

He later adds, [...] "I shall thoroly thoroly [...] {{understand}} [...] if you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine".

500|$|Concerned for his health, Irving's {{brothers}} financed {{an extended}} tour of Europe from 1804 to 1806. Irving bypassed {{most of the}} sites and locations considered essential {{for the development of}} an upwardly mobile young man, to the dismay of his brother William. William wrote that, though he was pleased his brother's health was improving, he did not like the choice to [...] "gallop through Italy... leaving Florence on your left and Venice on your right". Instead, Irving honed the social and conversational skills that would later make him one of the world's most in-demand guests. [...] "I endeavor to take things as they come with cheerfulness", Irving wrote, [...] "and when I cannot get a dinner to suit <b>my</b> <b>taste,</b> I endeavor to get a taste to suit my dinner". While visiting Rome in 1805, Irving struck up a friendship with the American painter Washington Allston and nearly allowed himself to be persuaded into following Allston into a career as a painter. [...] "My lot in life, however", Irving said later, [...] "was differently cast".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{also pointed}} to the {{dominance}} of Warren Thomson, who single-handedly chose the repertoire and all the jurors, {{many of whom are}} associated with the Australian Institute of Music (AIM), of which he was Artistic Director, Professional Development Programs. With assistance from others, he also auditioned all the entrants, and chose the 36 competitors. Alexei Yemtsov, a competitor at the 2000 competition, lived in Thomson's home and Thomson became his official guardian. That year, the minimum age was lowered from 18 to 17, although Thomson denied it {{had anything to do with}} Yemtsov's being only 17 at the time. The pianist Simon Tedeschi has said he [...] "has no intention of ever collaborating with Thomson and SIPCA ... The school of pianism with which he associates himself is not to <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> ... The trained-seal mentality makes for poor musicianship, and, ultimately, unhappy lives". Margaret Hair, AIM's former head of keyboard studies, said: [...] "There's a feeling among teachers that with Warren [...] in charge, Australian students have little chance of making the final cut. The most tragic outcome of his effect on the piano scene in this country is a sense of hopelessness that most students now feel".|$|E

Of course, that depends on their expertise. As an independent producer, I {{have to be a}} type of skilled laborer. There were many times that I had to make a film quickly. At those times, I kept entertainment-value in mind. Not once have I made a film for the sake of making the film itself. <b>My</b> <b>taste</b> is in looking through the camera. Filming happens to correspond with that taste. Art films are what Yu Hyun-mok makes. That's because director Yu wants to make art films. I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you." [...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel."

Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for <b>my</b> <b>taste,</b> too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details."

[...] (He added the name [...] "Silver" [...] to set himself apart from the multitudes of other Camerons.

2500|$|Ruiz de Burton is very {{critical}} of the United States in her fiction, both objectively and in relation to her native Mexico. [...] She accuses the US of childishly holding on to a provincial mentality, maintaining that Europe still sets the standard for cultural judgment.. [...] In The Squatter and the Don, the characters Clarence and Hubert discuss wines from California, {{which appears to be}} patronizing criticism of California from Northeasterners, but, according to Anne Elizabeth Goldman, is in fact more of a criticism of the provincial sensibilities maintained by Bostonians. [...] Like the Norval sisters in Who Would Have Thought It? who travel to Europe to learn good taste, Clarence notes this mentality saying [...] "Don't you know I like some of our California wines quite as well as the imported, if not better? [...] I suppose I ought to be ashamed to admit it, thus showing <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> is not cultivated...I think sooner or later our wines will be better liked, better appreciated." [...] Hubert responds: [...] "I think so too, but for the present it is the fashion to cry down our native wines and extol the imported.

2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed <b>my</b> <b>taste,</b> but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E

2500|$|Rating {{the film}} 4/5 stars, Eye for Film commented that [...] "Of all the {{films in the}} Texas Chainsaw series, this is {{probably}} the least gory, a fact that will no doubt disappoint some fans. It certainly has its moments and those disturbed by gore should still approach it with caution, but it's nothing like as gratuitous as much of what has gone before. Events happen to serve the story more than the theme. Horror is found in different places." [...] Staci Wilson of Dread Central wrote that [...] "Not to say I loved Leatherface - It’s far too disgusting for <b>my</b> <b>taste</b> (I'm okay with gore, but there's some gooey necrophilia in this flick that I felt was just thrown in for the ick of it), and there are too many plot holes. Still, it's a very well made film, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting is aces across the board", giving a final verdict of 3/5 stars. Anton Bitel of SciFiNow appraised, [...] "In spite, or perhaps because, of all the splatter and excess, this still does not come close to the elusively non-explicit horrors of the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even as it serves as their grim rites of passage. If 'Nobody messes with our family' is the ultimate message, then Maury and Bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite the old clan, as Jed pieces together his future identity from the different influences around him." [...] For being what he called [...] "the most entertaining and pleasing TCM film since 1974's classic", ComingSoon.Net writer Jerry Smith gave the prequel a positive review. He assessed that [...] "Do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so, would the explanation be anything we haven't seen before? The answers to these questions are quite refreshing", contrasting the origin story given to that of [...] as having been able to [...] "acknowledge what came before it without ever seeming like a wink-wink to the previous films in the series". V.O.D.zillas Matthew Turner assigned a 6.2 rating, opining [...] "This Texas Chainsaw prequel lacks the original's terror but gets by on style, strong performances and a bucket or two of the red stuff." ...|$|E
