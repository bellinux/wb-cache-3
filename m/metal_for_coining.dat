5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the <b>metal</b> <b>for</b> <b>coins</b> in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|R
50|$|Clipping is {{the act of}} shaving off a {{small portion}} of a {{precious}} <b>metal</b> <b>coin</b> <b>for</b> profit. Over time, the precious metal clippings could be saved up and melted into bullion or used to make new coins.|$|R
25|$|In 1908 a Canadian {{branch of}} the British Royal Mint was opened in Ottawa. As well as {{producing}} silver and base <b>metal</b> <b>coins</b> <b>for</b> everyday use, the new Canadian mint also turned the recently discovered gold into sovereigns striking intermittently between 1908 and 1919.|$|R
50|$|In 546 BC, Croesus of Lydia was {{defeated}} and {{captured by the}} Persians, who then adopted gold as the main <b>metal</b> <b>for</b> their <b>coins.</b> There are accounts in the biblical Book of Esther of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far out as India and the Kingdom of Kush {{during the reign of}} Xerxes the Great (485-465 BC). By the time of Herodotus (c. 475 BC), the Royal Road of the Persian Empire ran some 2,857 km from the city of Susa on the Karun (250 km east of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern İzmir in Turkey) on the Aegean Sea.|$|R
5000|$|Gold {{was used}} in {{commerce}} (beside other precious metals) in the Ancient Near East since the Bronze Age, but coins proper originated much later, during the 6th century BC, in Anatolia. The name of king Croesus of Lydia remains associated with the invention (although the Parian Chronicle mentions Pheidon of Argos as a contender). In 546 BC, Croesus was captured by the Persians, who adopted gold as the main <b>metal</b> <b>for</b> their <b>coins.</b> The most valuable of all Persian minted coinage still remains the gold drahms, minted in 1 AD as a gift by the Persian King Vonones Hebrew Bible new testament ( [...] Matthew 2.1-23). [...] Ancient Greek coinage contained a number of gold coins issued by the various city states.|$|R
50|$|During the war, cheaper <b>metals</b> were {{introduced}} <b>for</b> <b>coins,</b> including aluminium, zinc and iron, although silver ½ Mark pieces continued in production until 1919. Aluminium 1 Pfennig were produced until 1918 and the 2 Pfennig until 1916. Whilst iron 5 Pfennig, both iron and zinc 10 Pfennig and aluminium 50 Pfennig coins were issued until 1922. Aluminium 3 Mark were issued in 1922 and 1923, and aluminium 200 and 500 Mark were issued in 1923. The quality {{of many of}} these coins varied from decent to poor.|$|R
50|$|Silver mining {{has been}} {{undertaken}} since early times. As silver is a precious <b>metal</b> often used <b>for</b> <b>coins,</b> its mining has historically often been lucrative. As with {{other precious metals}} such as gold or platinum, newly discovered deposits of silver ore have sparked silver rushes of miners seeking their fortunes. In recent centuries, large deposits were discovered and mined in the Americas, influencing the growth and development of Mexico, Andean countries such as Bolivia, Chile, and Peru, as well as Canada and the United States.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Hieu C. Truong, the RCM engineering division designed the two-dollar coin to be made from two different <b>metals.</b> The <b>metals</b> <b>for</b> the bimetallic <b>coin</b> would be lighter and thinner than those produced anywhere in the world. To join the two parts, the engineering division selected a bimechanical locking mechanism. By the end of 1996, the Winnipeg facility had struck 375 million of these coins. The coin was officially launched at Ben's Deli in Montreal on February 19, 1996.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{a system}} of rice {{warehouses}} arose, evolving naturally out of the rice storehouses which formed {{a part of this}} trade network. Centered in Osaka, the rice brokers bought the daimyo's rice and issued paper bills, representations of value, in exchange. This was probably the first paper money in Japan, but the concept was picked up quickly, and the credit of the brokers was good enough to warrant the kind of trust that such a system relies upon. Many merchants throughout the country were willing to exchange the paper bills <b>for</b> <b>metal</b> <b>coins</b> or bars, recognizing that the Osaka brokers would take back the bills, as payment for rice.|$|R
5000|$|Section 19 of the Act {{established}} a penalty {{of death for}} debasing the gold or silver coins authorized by the Act, or embezzlement of the <b>metals</b> <b>for</b> those <b>coins,</b> by officers or employees of the mint; {{this section of the}} Act apparently remains in effect and would, in theory, continue to apply in the case of [...] "any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint." [...] (At present the only gold or silver coins struck by the US mint are the American Silver Eagle and the American Gold Eagle coins, some Proof coinage at the San Francisco Mint, such as the silver US State Quarters, and much of the Commemorative coinage of the United States.) All other sections of the act have been superseded, as for example the Coinage Act of 1834 changing the silver-to-gold weight ratio. Various acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in U. S. coins, so that today there is no legal definition of the term [...] "dollar" [...] to be found in U. S. statute. [...] Current statutes regulating coinage in the United States may be found in Title 31 of the United States Code.|$|R
500|$|In January 1791, at {{the request}} of Congress, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issued a report on the currency. [...] At the time, there was no mint in the United States; foreign coins were used. Hamilton {{proposed}} a monetary system based on bimetallism, in which the new currency would be equal to a given amount of gold, or a larger amount of silver; at the time a given weight of gold was worth about 15 times as much as the same amount of silver. Although Hamilton understood that adjustment might be needed from time to time as precious metal prices fluctuated, he believed that if the nation's unit of value were defined only by one of the two precious <b>metals</b> used <b>for</b> <b>coins,</b> the other would descend to the status of mere merchandise, unusable as a store of value. He also proposed the establishment of a mint, at which citizens could present gold or silver, and receive it back, struck into money. On April 2, 1792, Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792. This legislation defined a unit of value for the new nation, to be known as a dollar. The new unit of currency was defined to be equal to [...] of gold, or alternatively, [...] of silver, establishing a ratio of value between gold and silver of 15:1. The legislation also established the Mint of the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the {{government}} of Finland authorized the striking of the first modern Olympic coin, a 500 Markka. At first, the coins circulated as currency in the issuing country and the mintages were high. In borrowing from the traditions of ancient Greece, the coins were a memento of the 1951 Games, and a coin that numismatists could now add to their collection. With the exception of Canada’s Lucky Loonie program and its 2007 25-cent pieces to commemorate the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games, it is rare that Olympic <b>coins</b> are minted <b>for</b> circulation. Traditionally, Olympic coins are numismatic coins.. However several host countries minted so many coins particularly silver that their value has become just slightly above {{the value of their}} <b>metal</b> content. <b>Coins</b> <b>for</b> the 1976 Montreal, 1984 Los Angeles, and 1988 Seoul are generally considered to fall into that category.|$|R
50|$|During the American Civil War {{silver and}} gold coins were hoarded by the public because of {{uncertainty}} about {{the outcome of the}} war. People began to use postage stamps instead, encasing them in <b>metal</b> <b>for</b> better protection. The U.S. government decided to substitute paper currency of denominations under a dollar <b>for</b> <b>coins</b> in order to solve the problem. The denominations issued were 3¢, 5¢, 10¢, 15¢, 25¢ and 50¢. There were five issues of fractional currency.|$|R

The average values (96.9 % of silver <b>for</b> <b>coin</b> A and 92.56 % <b>for</b> <b>coin</b> B) can only cautiously be used to deduce the silver content in the whole volume of coins.

40|$|In the {{official}} records, copper mines {{in the southwest}} of the Qing empire seem to suddenly appear in the late 1730 s. In part, this impression is an effect of government attention. Copper, which {{was the most important}} <b>metal</b> <b>for</b> casting cash <b>coins,</b> became a pressing concern when imports of Japanese copper dwindled. The government responded by developing domestic resources. Seemingly overnight, Yunnan mines reached impressive levels of productivity and replaced imports. For several decades, the Tangdan mines in northeastern Yunnan supplied most of the copper consumed by the centrally important metropolitan mints. The sudden boom is remarkable and not entirely plausible. This article reassesses the history of Qing-period mining by examining a particular case study. It explores an essay about the Dongchuan earthquake of 1733 that provides a glimpse at the empire’s leading copper mines {{on the eve of the}} recorded boom. A close analysis of figures, mining technology, and organizational structures reveals that the mines had been developed by mining entrepreneurs and migrant workers for a considerable period of time outside government attention, operating in a gray zone of unlicensed exploitation. The studied case permits a new assessment of the role of the state and of nonstate players in the industry. Moreover, it throws a new light on the image of Qing society and economy created by {{the official}} emphasis on agriculture and the actual role of the nonagrarian sector...|$|R
500|$|On June 3, 1965, President Johnson sent {{a special}} message to Congress, asking it to pass {{legislation}} allowing the dime and quarter to be made from base metal, and to reduce the silver content of the half dollar to 40 percent. [...] The silver dollar would be unaffected if any were struck, {{but there were no}} plans to do so. He noted that the <b>metal</b> <b>for</b> the silver coinage was being struck from dwindling Treasury stocks, rather than from newly mined silver, and that the government bullion would be entirely used up by 1968. Johnson argued that the <b>metal</b> necessary <b>for</b> industry must not be wasted as a means of exchange. He urged the passage of draft legislation, attached to the message, and said the bill would [...] "ensure a stable and dignified coinage, fully adequate in quantity and in its specially designed technical characteristics to the needs of our Twentieth Century life. It can be maintained indefinitely, however much the demand <b>for</b> <b>coin</b> may grow." ...|$|R

50|$|A coin assayer {{is often}} {{assigned}} to each mint or assay office to determine and assure that all coins produced at the mint have the correct content or purity of each metal specified, usually by law, to be contained in them. This was particularly important when gold and silver <b>coins</b> were produced <b>for</b> circulation and used in daily commerce. Few nations, however, persist in minting silver or gold <b>coins</b> <b>for</b> general circulation. For example, the U.S. discontinued the use of gold in coinage in 1933. The U.S. was perhaps the last nation to discontinue the use of silver in circulating coins after its 1970 half dollar coin, although the amount of silver used in smaller denomination coins was ended after 1964. Even with the half dollar, the amount of silver used in the coins was reduced from 90% in 1964 and earlier to 40% between 1965 and 1970. Copper, nickel, cupro-nickel and brass alloys now predominate in coin making. Notwithstanding, several national mints, including the Perth Mint in Australia, the Austrian Mint, the British Royal Mint, the Royal Canadian Mint, the South African Mint, and the U.S. Mint continue to produce precious <b>metal</b> bullion <b>coins</b> <b>for</b> collectors and investors. The precious metal purity and content of these coins is guaranteed by the respective mint or government, and, therefore, the assay of the raw materials and finished coins is an important quality control.|$|R
