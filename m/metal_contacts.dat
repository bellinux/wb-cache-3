2500|$|A full area {{metal contact}} is {{made on the}} back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine [...] "fingers" [...] and larger [...] "bus bars" [...] are {{screen-printed}} onto the front surface using a silver paste. This is an evolution of the so-called [...] "wet" [...] process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by Bayer AG. The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in ohmic contact with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the <b>metal</b> <b>contacts</b> are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into modules or [...] "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of tempered glass on the front, and a polymer encapsulation on the back.|$|E

50|$|A normal relay uses a {{wire coil}} and the {{mechanical}} {{movement of the}} <b>metal</b> <b>contacts</b> to switch the load on and off. The <b>metal</b> <b>contacts</b> may weld shut after repeated operation cycles. If this happens, the machine would continue running if the operator pressed the emergency stop pushbutton. This would be hazardous for the operator. For this reason, many European, American, national and international norms and safety standards prohibit the use of simple relays or contactors on hazardous machines.|$|E

The results indicate that, with the various <b>metals</b> <b>contacting</b> iron, the cohesively weaker will adhere and transfer to the cohesively stronger.
