5|$|What {{is perhaps}} <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> is that Prince of Wales {{returned}} to British ownership. There is an entry {{for her in}} the supplemental (i.e., late addition) pages for the 1797 volume. One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured her in the West Indies, but so far evidence for the conjecture is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Zoologists have {{frequently}} mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed {{one after another}} of his <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> claims, including the active camouflage of the octopus {{and the ability of}} elephants to snorkel with their trunks while swimming. The evolutionary zoologist Armand Leroi has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E

The Dahije requested aid from the neighbouring pashas, but all refused except Pasvanoglu. Aganlija returned humiliated to Belgrade, which greatly excited the commonfolk (rayah), from which the rebels drew <b>more</b> volunteers, <b>surprising</b> the Ottomans who sought to suppress the uprising.|$|R
50|$|The second season's revamped format {{makes the}} show's break-ins seem <b>more</b> realistic, <b>surprising,</b> and suspenseful. The producers, rather than Johnston, now make the initial {{contact with the}} owners. They are warned that the {{burglary}} could happen unannounced {{at any time and}} are told to continue with their normal routines, as opposed to watching the burglary live on closed-circuit television (CCTV).|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man (Chris Owens) in the X-Files office and, on his whim, they test his DNA. They learn that the man shares DNA with Fox Mulder (Duchovny), and may possibly even be him. The answers become even <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> when Scully's son, baby William, is put on the line.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{pathways}} used in microorganisms {{differ from}} those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast Candida glabrata and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae are NAD auxotrophs– they cannot synthesize NAD– but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD or its precursors. precursors in Candida glabrata | journal = Mol.

5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{records of}} Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College {{had been set}} out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry. Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry, with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays. Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts. The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> element is {{the sheer number of}} texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.|$|E

5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1917, Ball {{was under}} strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans {{five times in}} his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his {{preferred}} belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once <b>more,</b> <b>surprising</b> five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and <b>more</b> <b>surprising.</b> The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E
50|$|During Dasara, a {{group of}} drama artists come to the village to perform and make their living. Every day, they start their {{performance}} first at the zamindar's home per the custom. The zamindar is away {{and there is no}} one to watch or reward them. The youngest artist of the troupe, Raju (Suman) is irritated by this, but others in the troupe convince him to perform in front of the zamindar's closed doors. One day, Sitaara watches Raju's performance through a broken window and takes a liking for him. He sees her watching him, and the next day performs with even <b>more</b> vigour, <b>surprising</b> his colleagues.|$|R

30|$|Financial investors. Some {{specific}} categories analysed in {{the paper}} have also attracted our attention. For example, {{although the number of}} investors in the sample is not very high, there is significant diversity within the dataset: from philanthropic investors to angel, early-stage and equity investors. What is even <b>more</b> positively <b>surprising</b> is that even mainstream investment banks (such as Goldman Sachs or BNP) operate in this field. This should be interpreted as a positive sign, in order to make impact investment more mainstream. This would be a crucial step to finally drop the word “impact” before investment, simply reflecting the cultural shift in the financial sector making the so-called impact investing the new standard practice.|$|R
25|$|There {{were three}} general {{categories}} of artifacts on {{and around the}} ship. Firstly, cooking pots, enamel-ware, bottles, and cups. Secondly, a broad variety of wood and metal-working tools, including hand tools required to maintain and repair a steamboat. Finally, there were the personal effects of the crew, including small bits of clothing and shoes together with bottles of ink and vanilla. One of the <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> finds was a gramophone in a wooden case and three Berliner records.|$|E
25|$|Seven hoards of Byzantine and Arabic coins (more than 1,100 of the latter) and a Byzantine dish bearing {{an image}} of Simargl {{have shown that the}} local {{community}} carried on a prosperous trade along the Dnieper. The metal objects represented include hauberks (not typical for Scandinavian sites), helmets, battle-axes, Carolingian swords, and arrows. Among the <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> discoveries were an early folding razor with a copper handle and a pivoted scissors, probably the earliest found in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the ability to read Greek, Thucydides and Herodotus were largely {{forgotten}} during the Middle Ages in Western Europe, although their influence continued in the Byzantine world. In Europe, Herodotus become known and highly respected only in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century as an ethnographer, in part due to the discovery of America, where customs and animals were encountered even <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> than what he had related. During the Reformation, moreover, information about Middle Eastern countries in the Histories provided a basis for establishing Biblical chronology as advocated by Isaac Newton.|$|E
5000|$|Nyx {{played a}} crucial role in the arc [...] "A Tale of Three Brothers" [...] when Spawn himself was taken captive by the sin eater demons who fed on the past faults of the victim. Using her magick - which has become <b>more</b> potent, <b>surprising</b> even her - she was able to {{overcome}} the several sin eaters to release Spawn and Richard Simmons, Al Simmons' brother. She then sets up a barrier preventing Ab and Zab from leaving the house where the conflict occurred. Her powers also became instrumental in finding Al Simmons' parents who were trapped in a curse set up by Mammon preventing them from leaving their house and backyard, while making them invisible to the rest of the world.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lord patted {{him on the}} head, {{gave him}} two large sticks of candy, and, what was <b>more</b> kind and <b>surprising,</b> {{considering}} the fact that he wore glasses and was cross eyed, he winked at Toby. A wink from Mr. Lord must have been intended to convey a great deal, because, owing to the defect in his eyes, it required no little exertion, and even then could not be considered as a really first class wink.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{installments}} {{were published}} {{so soon after}} Maupin wrote them, {{he was able to}} incorporate many current events into the plot of the series, as well as gauge reader response and modify the story accordingly. At one point Maupin received a letter from a reader who pointed out that one of the characters' names was an anagram, providing Maupin with one of the <b>more</b> memorable and <b>surprising</b> plot twists in the book. [...] Maupin's books are also some of the first to deal with the AIDS epidemic.|$|R
25|$|Against Canada on March 9, Italy {{pulled off}} one of the <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> upsets in the 2009 WBC, winning 6–2, and {{eliminating}} the heavily favored Canadian team. Italy led 3–0 heading into the fourth inning, until Canada jumped on starter Dan Serafini for two runs. With the bases loaded and only one out, reliever Chris Cooper struck out Peter Orr, then got Chris Barnwell to fly out to center to end the threat, and keep Italy in the lead. In all, Italy's bullpen pitched six innings without giving up a run.|$|E
25|$|Fears of {{disturbances}} increased {{again in}} 1928 as the scheduled presidential elections approached. The ruling PNH nominated General Carías while the PLH, united again {{following the death}} of Policarpo Bonilla in 1926, nominated Vicente Mejía Colindres. To the surprise of most observers, both the campaign and the election were conducted with a minimum of violence and intimidation. Mejía Colindres won a decisive victory—obtaining 62,000 votes to 47,000 for Carías. Even <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> was Carías's public acceptance of defeat and his urging of his supporters to accept the new government.|$|E
25|$|In {{replacing}} Constantius's {{political and}} civil appointees, Julian drew heavily from {{the intellectual and}} professional classes, or kept reliable holdovers, such as the rhetorician Themistius. His choice of consuls for the year 362 was more controversial. One was the very acceptable Claudius Mamertinus, previously the Praetorian prefect of Illyricum. The other, <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> choice was Nevitta, Julian's trusted Frankish general. This latter appointment made overt {{the fact that an}} emperor's authority depended on the power of the army. Julian's choice of Nevitta appears to have been aimed at maintaining the support of the Western army which had acclaimed him.|$|E
30|$|A {{flagrant}} {{example of}} these practices {{was seen in}} the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, where the national secretary of state for the environment handed out in 2013 a ‘sustainability-award’ to the owner of a restaurant built on the Matalascañas beach ([URL] Its construction was in clear violation of national environmental laws (and denounced as such), for being located in a protected maritime area where any new construction was prohibited. Nevertheless the owner was interested in obtaining an award for being ‘the greenest in town’. And he got it. Separating waste, using LED-illumination and controlled water discharge was enough in this case to be the called the winner. One strange thing is obviously that a national administration hands out an award under these circumstances. But even <b>more</b> interesting (<b>surprising,</b> worrying…) might be the fact that an entrepreneur, lacking sincere environmental interest, does have a desire to promote himself as ‘green’.|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} of Markov chains indexed by trees, one lets time be the {{vertices}} of a tree, instead of the the integers. This generalization leads {{to a number of}} <b>more</b> or less <b>surprising</b> properties. For example, one can construct a chain which has an infinite Green function, but is transient. In this note, we consider that and some other examples in some detail, and other things in less detail. Since the literature on the subject is rather limited, in essential everything here is based on the papers by Benjamini and Peres [1], [2]...|$|R
40|$|Terms in {{arithmetic}} of {{the form}} s in the formula s=t(), with t a term with one free variable and a numeral denoting the Gödel number of s, are examined by writing the explicit definition of the encoding functions whose representation they include.

The <b>surprising</b> result of each such construction, involving conventionally defined substitution or diagonalization functions and using conventional systems of encoding, is {{shown to be a}} non-terminating symbolic expression...|$|R
25|$|Napoleon had {{undoubtedly}} {{gained the}} victory {{from the moment}} he succeeded in penetrating the Prussian centre; but it was not distinguished by that brilliant success, or by those immediate and decisive advantages, which might have been anticipated from the admirable manner in which the attack had been prepared, and the care with which it was concealed from the Prussians, at a moment when they had no reserve remaining, and when the co-operation of Wellington's army on their right, or the arrival of IV Corps (Bülow's) from Hannut, had become quite impracticable. This appears the <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> when we reflect that he had a considerable corps of cavalry under Grouchy at hand to support this attack, and that the whole of IV Corps (Lobau's) was on the field, fully prepared for active operations.|$|E
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>surprising</b> was the {{analysis}} of the rat-poison paste; {{it turned out to be}} nothing more than a mixture of flour, water and soda. This led to the possibility that Marie used the real arsenic to murder her husband. Any remaining doubts that may have lingered vanished when Emma Pontier turned over the small malachite box, and Dr. Lespinasse found it to contain arsenic. Marie was arrested and held in jail in Brive. A young French lawyer, Charles Lachaud, was appointed to her defence and was assisted by three others, Maîtres Théodore Bac (who later became mayor of Limoges during the 1848 Revolution), Paillet, and Desmont. Before they began their work, there was another surprise in store. The newspaper stories regarding Marie Lafarge turned up something from her past.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{a comment}} by Pausanias, who compares {{sacrificial}} practice in Olympia {{with that in}} Pergamon, {{this is the only}} written reference to the altar in all of antiquity. This is all the <b>more</b> <b>surprising</b> because the writers of antiquity otherwise wrote a great deal about such works of art and Ampelius, after all, considered the altar {{to be one of the}} wonders of the world. The absence of written sources from antiquity about the altar has given rise to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the Romans did not regard this Hellenistic altar as important since it did not date from the classic epoch of Greek, especially Attic, art. Only this art and later evocation of the associated values were considered significant and worth mentioning. This view was held particularly by German researchers starting in the 18th century, especially after the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann became known. The only graphic representations of the altar are on coins of the Roman Empire, which show the altar in a stylized form.|$|E
40|$|Brain scans have {{frequently}} {{been credited with}} uniquely seductive and persuasive qualities, leading to claims that fMRI research receives {{a disproportionate share of}} public attention and funding. It has been suggested that functional brain images are fascinating because they contradict dualist beliefs regarding the relationship between the body and the mind. Although previous research has indicated that brain images can increase judgments of an articleʼs scientific reasoning, the hypotheses that brain scans make research appear <b>more</b> interesting, <b>surprising,</b> or worthy of funding have not been tested. Neither has the relation between the allure of brain imaging and dualism. In the following three studies, laypersons rated both fictional research descriptions and real science news articles accompanied by brain scans, bar charts, or photographs. Across 988 participants, we found little evidence of neuroimagingʼs seductive allure or of its relation to self-professed dualistic beliefs. These results, taken together with other recent null findings, suggest that brain images are less powerful than has been argued...|$|R
60|$|When {{we came to}} Pampeluna itself, {{we found}} it so indeed; and to me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to {{countries}} where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed, was it <b>more</b> painful than <b>surprising,</b> to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes.|$|R
5000|$|Brothers Ezra and Edward Grim, both physicians, had {{a desire}} to {{consolidate}} their medical practices under one roof. In 1904 they contracted with the St. Louis, Missouri architectural firm of Weber and Groves for a building large enough to house offices, examination rooms and operating suites. [...] Local contractor Albert L. Holmes was chosen for the construction, which was finished in October, 1905 for a final cost of $11,248. This was considered only slightly higher than a similar size building of <b>more</b> utilitarian design, <b>surprising</b> considering the ornate details often associated with a Jacobethan Revival building.|$|R
