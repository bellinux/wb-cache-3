40|$|In {{this work}} a control {{structure}} {{capable of handling}} controllability problems, which emerge from the presence of constraints, and improve {{the performance of the}} system by coordinating the use of several <b>manipulated</b> variables is introduced. In this scheme, the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to handle the transient response while the auxiliary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to keep the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable away from saturation. These two <b>manipulated</b> variables are coordinated through a user-defined non-linear function, which decides when and how the control structure changes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} output unreachability under input {{saturation}} phenomenon is studied: under a large disturbance or set-point change, the process output may never reach the set-point {{even when the}} <b>manipulated</b> variable has been driven to saturation. The process output can only be {{brought back to the}} set-point by activating an auxiliary <b>manipulated</b> variable. A new feedback cooperative control strategy capable of solving such a problem is proposed. In this scheme, the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to handle the transient response while the auxiliary <b>manipulated</b> variable is used to keep the primary <b>manipulated</b> variable away from the saturation. These two <b>manipulated</b> variables are coordinated through a user-defined non-linear function. This function decides when and how the control structure changes.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>manipulated</b> Instagram photos on {{adolescent}} girls' body image, and whether social comparison tendency moderates this relation. A between-subject experiment was conducted in which 144 girls (14 - 18 years old) were randomly exposed to either original or <b>manipulated</b> (retouched and reshaped) Instagram selfies. Results showed that exposure to <b>manipulated</b> Instagram photos directly led to lower body image. Especially, girls with higher social comparison tendencies were negatively affected by exposure to the <b>manipulated</b> photos. Interestingly, the <b>manipulated</b> photos were rated more positively than the original photos. Although the use of filters and effects was detected, reshaping of the bodies was not noticed very well. Girls in both conditions reported to find the pictures realistic. Results of this study implied that the recent societal concern {{about the effects of}} <b>manipulated</b> photos in social media might be justified, especially for adolescent girls with a higher social comparison tendency...|$|R

Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hyōdō to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hyōdō forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. Hōinbō found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw Hōinbō kill Teikun Ō on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed Hōinbō, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, <b>manipulating</b> them into killing Naitō and Kagome, and killing the body double.

5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by <b>manipulating</b> the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter.
