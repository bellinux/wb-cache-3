World War I created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado. World War I also drew men from campus to Europe's battlefields. In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the Reserve Officers Training Corps. A few months later CAC applied to establish an ROTC unit in Fort Collins and resurrected a defunct National Guard unit on campus.|$|E
25|$|This {{elected and}} en-stooled chief enjoys a great majestic {{ceremony}} {{to this day}} with much spectacle and celebration.

Upon the stool, the Chief is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> real. His powers hinge on his attention to the advice and decisions of the Council of Elders. The chief can be impeached, de-stooled, if the Elders and the people turn against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.|$|E
25|$|Some {{differences}} between the Moon and that part of Mercury observed in this quadrangle may be <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> real. Apparent differences {{may be the result}} of resolution of the imaging system, and small viewing and illumination angles that do not allow inspection of the surface under varied conditions. Real differences {{may be the result of}} Mercury’s size, gravitational field, proximity to the Sun, internal composition and structure, or timing of major volcanic episodes relative to the decrease in impact craters. Surface differences include the preservation of secondary craters around older craters and basins, and the absence of recognizable textured and lineated ejecta blankets such as those surrounding the Imbrium and Orientale Basins on the Moon. Possible differences in volcanic features include the absence of widespread dark mare-type deposits, volcanic domes and cones, and sinuous rilles. Whereas plains and terra divisions may be distinguished on Mercury, the distinct lunar dichotomy of mare and highlands is not present on that half of Mercury observed by Mariner 10.|$|E

500|$|During the 16th century, this [...] "turbulence" [...] {{began to}} recede, and the monarch became truly independent. Under Henry VIII and his successors, {{the king was}} the head of the Protestant English church, and {{therefore}} not answerable to the clergy. The rise of Parliament in this period, however, was problematic. While the monarch was [...] "the predominant partner in the English constitution", the courts stopped short of declaring him all-powerful, recognising the role that Parliament played. In Ferrer's Case, Henry recognised this, noting that he was far more powerful with the consent of Parliament than without. Nowhere was this <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> in the matter of taxation: Sir Thomas Smith and other writers of the period pointed out the monarch could not impose taxation without Parliament's consent.|$|E

As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|In Dumville's view Æthelstan {{has been}} seen by historians as a shadowy figure because of an {{apparent}} lack of source material, but {{he argues that the}} lack is <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> real. Charters, law codes, and coins throw considerable light on Æthelstan's government. The scribe known to historians as [...] "Æthelstan A", who was responsible for drafting all charters between 928 and 935, provides very detailed information, including signatories, dates, and locations, illuminating Æthelstan's progress around his realm. [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] may have been Bishop Ælfwine of Lichfield, who was close to the king. By contrast with this extensive source of information, no charters survive from 910 to 924, a gap which historians struggle to explain, and which makes it difficult to assess the degree of continuity in personnel and the operation of government between the reigns of Edward and Æthelstan. Historians are also paying increasing attention to less conventional sources, such as contemporary poetry in his praise and manuscripts associated with his name.|$|E

500|$|... "Shivers" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and became a}} major underground success in Australia, bringing more national attention to the band. Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as {{the main reason for}} the Boys Next Door's eminence. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Will Lerner wrote that [...] "it's impressive how, even at this early stage, Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer, perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … he knows how to come across in a scary and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music. Nowhere is this <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> on … 'Shivers', an unashamedly melodramatic example of post-adolescent anguish". [...] "Shivers", along with other songs Howard composed, were [...] "crucial to guiding the band in the darker, wilder direction" [...] that defined the Birthday Party's music, according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum. The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as [...] "possibly Australia's most enduring cult hit".|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you wonder why they weren't thought of before." [...] Game Informer called the interface [...] "absolutely inspired" [...] and its inventory system [...] "second to none." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from review website The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, {{saying that it}} was [...] "a funny episode that managed to be only fitfully satisfying." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White commented that [...] "it's <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> ever that 'Goodbye, Michael' should have ended the season, if not the series," [...] and that [...] "the show is just spinning its wheels now". Despite this, she praised the scenes featuring Creed Bratton and James Spader, believing Bratton's performance consisted of [...] "the funniest scenes of the episode", and that Spader [...] "was given the meatiest part, gamely channeling his dominating boss role from Secretary". White ultimately gave the episode a 6.5/10, calling it [...] "Okay". TV Squad writer Joel Keller criticized the episode for not featuring a true plot, writing that [...] "this felt like a series of sketches in search of a plot." [...] The Office co-creator Ricky Gervais also commented on the outlandishness, particularly Warren Buffett's appearance, saying [...] "If you're going to jump a shark, jump a big one." [...] He also compared the episode to the Chris Martin episode of Gervais's other series, Extras. The shark quote was repeated multiple times on other media outlets; Gervais eventually commented that [...] "I fucking didn't , that's for sure." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Joey Lynch of Billboard compared the song's demo {{to the studio}} versions, claiming that [...] "The studio version of 'Joan of Arc' is a massive improvement on the illegally leaked demo that preceded news of the album itself. [...] Nowhere is this <b>more</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> on 'Joan of Arc,' a solid album track that sounds 10 times better than the leaked version." [...] While reviewing the three tracks released prior to the album, Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it [...] "arguably the standout of the whole over-blown affair," [...] noting that the song [...] "sounded like a highlight even in its more acoustic demo form, but the album version is a full-on stunner... The song sounds {{a bit like a}} Cardigans leftover circa 'Long Gone Before Daylight'. It's the strongest (anti-)ballad of Madonna's last few albums, and a strong argument for artists responding to the denigration of their art through the more considered medium of the art itself, rather than snap public statements. [...] More than any of the previously released songs, 'Joan of Arc' also establishes one of the foundational themes of Rebel Heart, albeit one not always evident when wading through the poorly sequenced album." [...] Adding to the previous review, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised the juxtapositions in the album's lyrical content, which according to her, [...] "make some of her most vulnerable, engaging work in years— in particular 'Joan of Arc'." ...|$|E

50|$|In contrast, Krauth and his {{collaborators}} (who eventually included his own father and Beale Melanchthon Schmucker, the son of Samuel Simon) preferred a more literal reading of the Lutheran Confessions.

In both theology and worship, they sought to create Lutheranism in which the medieval heritage was <b>more</b> readily <b>apparent</b> <b>than</b> the Enlightenment adaptations.
