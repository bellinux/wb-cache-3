Unfired {{specimens}} {{were made}} with different aluninum content (0, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %) respectively,using high pure magnesia, magnesia-spinel and Aluninum as the main raw material. Unfired specimens were treated under the condition: 110 ℃× 24 h drying,then 300 ℃× 6 h heating treatment. The properties and microstructure of the specimens were analyzed to investigate the reaction mechanism of these speciments and RH refinery slag. The result are shown that the addition of aluninum improves cold crushing strength of specimens,reaching to 63 Mpa. The specimen with aluninum content of 8 % shown the best slag resistance. The reaction mechanism between aluninum-magnesia-spinel complosite material and RH slag is different from <b>magnesite-chrome</b> <b>brick.</b> The major penetration element is Ca, and the Ca elment penetrated into the matrix reacts with corundum turning out a CA 2 protective layer which can stop penetrating of slag...|$|E
