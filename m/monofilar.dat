40|$|A {{design and}} ground test program was {{conducted}} to study {{the performance of the}} <b>monofilar</b> absorber for vibration reduction on a four-bladed helicopter. A <b>monofilar</b> is a centrifugal tuned two degree-of-freedom rotor hub absorber that provides force attenuation at two frequencies using the same dynamic mass. Linear and non-linear analyses of the coupled monofilar/airframe system were developed to study tuning and attenuation characteristics. Based on the analysis, a design was fabricated and impact bench tests verified the calculated non-rotating natural frequencies and mode shapes. Performance characteristics were measured using a rotating absorber test facility. These tests showed significant attenuation of fixed-system 4 P hub motions due to 3 P inplane rotating-system hub forces. In addition, detuning effects of the 3 P <b>monofilar</b> modal response were small due to the nonlinearities and tuning pin slippage. However, attenuation of 4 P hub motions due to 5 P inplane hub forces was poor. The performance of the 5 P <b>monofilar</b> modal response was degraded by torsional motion of the dynamic mass relative to the support arm which resulted in binding of the dynamic components. Analytical design studies were performed to evaluate this torsional motion problem. An alternative design is proposed which may alleviate the torsional motion of the dynamic mass...|$|E
40|$|<b>Monofilar,</b> bifilar, {{trifilar}} and quadrifilar Archimedean spiral metamaterial {{particles are}} analyzed by using point group symmetry {{and the methods}} of crystallography. From the symmetry properties electromagnetic response is determined. Magnetic, electric and magnetoelectric modes of the particles are identified along with their isotropy characteristics. Theoretical methods show that all the particles, except <b>monofilar</b> spiral, are non-bianisotropic. Numerical simulation results are presented to verify the analysis. Finally, effective medium theory is applied to extract the effective permeability of the spiral medium. The results indicate negative values for permeability in certain frequency ranges. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|So {{far as the}} {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves is concerned, an underground tunnel behaves like a pipe or hollowed waveguide. Waves propagate in this tunnel with a low attenuation only if their frequency is higher than a so-called critical frequency which depends on the shape and mostly on the cross -dimensions of the tunnel and which value is in the neighbourhood of several tenths of MHz. However, when a metallic conductor is stretched along the gallery the electromagnetic characteristics of the latter are considerably modified {{and the effect of}} the cut-off frequency disappears; {{this is due to the}} fact that the gallery equipped with such a conductor works like a coaxial cable where the conductor serves as the outward conductor and the wall of the gallery as the return conductor. This is the principle of the <b>monofilar</b> waveguide cable which has been perfectly studied by Gabillard. Two mean characteristics of the <b>monofilar</b> mode are as follows: first of all, when the cable is suspended in the middle of the cross section of the gallery, the electromagnetic field occupies all the space between the wire and the walls of the gallery. When the wire is close to the wall, the electromagnetic field tends to become concentrated between the wire and the wall, with the consequence that, with the given <b>monofilar</b> mode power, the aerial of a receiver standing somewhere in the tunnel will capture a weaker and weaker signal. Secondly, owing to the fact that the mode of <b>monofilar</b> propagation uses the ground as return conductor, its power of propagation is considerably diminished; the closer the wire is to the wall the higher the attenuation, for only a very small part of the wall is utilized as return conductor. To cover great distances, everything else being equal, two or more conductors must be placed in the gallery...|$|E
40|$|Archimedean spiral {{resonators}} as {{the unit}} inclusion for a metamaterial structure is studied. These inclusions are very compact, which {{make them a}} good candidate for practical metamaterial applications. Equivalent circuit models and analytical design formulas are derived for <b>monofilar</b> and bifilar spiral resonators. The circuit parameters and resonance frequencies are directly predicted by the geometry of the spiral and dielectric substrate/resonator configuration. Numerical simulations on both bulk and planar designs show that the predicted resonance frequencies are accurate enough for a preliminary design. Finally, complementary spiral structures, that is, spiral-shaped apertures in the ground plane, are considered. Loading two transmission lines with a complementary <b>monofilar</b> and a complementary bifilar spiral resonator, two planar band rejection structures are built. Measured results for two prototypes present a good accuracy. 7 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} research {{sponsored by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines shows that medium frequency (MF) electromagnetic (EM) signals propagate great distances in an underground environment such as a tunnel or mine. This propagation is enhanced by different mechanisms associated with the geology, and with the existence of metallic conductors in the entryways. In stratified geologies, a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode of signal propagation is possible if a low conducting layer is bounded above and below by higher conducting layers. In general, the difference in conductivities {{must be at least}} several orders of magnitude. Such geological waveguide conditions often exist in underground mines. Propagation via the waveguide effect is known as the "seam mode" of propagation. Another mode of propagation, the "tunnel mode," exists in underground entries with electrical conductors such as power cables, metal pipes, and phone lines. A <b>monofilar</b> mode of propagation exists when signals are impressed upon conductors and return via the surrounding rock. A bifilar mode of propagation exists when all signals exist only on local conductors. In a given location there is a combination of <b>monofilar</b> and bifilar modes that make possible an interaction between the conductors and a transmitting device in a tunnel or entryway. Signals can be impressed on or received from local conductors via magnetic dipole antennas (loops) or line couplers...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{mechanisms}} of tunnel propagation and of underground radio systems are briefly reviewed. The TEM approximation of the <b>monofilar</b> mode is compared with available rigorous solutions. Below the tunnel cutoff frequencies, the leaky feeder techniques {{can be described}} by the coupled line methods or, with a simpler physical picture, {{by the use of}} two eigenmodes. The only valid explanation of the leaky feeder radiation at higher frequencies is the random diffraction of the feeder leakage fields by the wall irregularities. To avoid the inefficiency of this process, the insertion of leaky stubs in a well-shielded coaxial cable is proposed. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} wireless energy transfer via near-field electromagnetic induction that is inexpensive, simple and {{can be applied to}} almost any type of system, regardless of size and energy demands. The method uses a primary unit consisting of an oscillator, amplifier and inductive coil that transfers energy to a secondary unit consisting of a coil, rectifier and voltage regulator. Two types of oscillators and several amplifier designs were realized and evaluated together with a multitude of flat coils of both <b>monofilar</b> and bifilar type. The results show {{that it is important to}} use an oscillator whose frequency is dependent on the inductance of the connected transmission coil, such as the Colpitts oscillator. This is preferable to an oscillator with a preset frequency, such as a Schmitt-trigger oscillator...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and {{experimental study of}} electrodynamics of a planar spiral superconducting resonator of a finite length. The resonator {{is made in the}} form of a <b>monofilar</b> Archimedean spiral. By making use of a general model of inhomogeneous alternating current flowing along the resonator and specific boundary conditions on the surface of the strip, we obtain analytically the frequencies f_n of resonances which can be excited in such system. We also calculate corresponding inhomogeneous RF current distributions ψ_n (r), where r is the coordinate across a spiral. We show that the resonant frequencies and current distributions are well described by simple relationships f_n=f_ 1 n, and ψ_n(r) ≃sin[π n (r/R_e) ^ 2], where n= 1, 2 [...] ., and R_e is the external radius of the spiral. Our analysis of electrodynamic properties of spiral resonators' is in good accord with direct numerical simulations and measurements made using specifically designed magnetic probe and laser scanning microscope.

40|$|International audience—Aircraft {{designers}} {{believe that}} Power Line Communication (PLC) {{technology is a}} solution {{to reduce the number}} of cables aboard. One strategy to implement PLC networks in aircrafts is adapting commercial residential PLC solutions to the avionic environment. We propose in this paper a coupling architecture that improves PLC performance in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) when deployed on <b>monofilar</b> avionic networks. We also show that our proposal complies with the aeronautical electromagnetic standard (DO- 160) through experimental validation. The proposed coupling architecture is investigated and validated through simulations and measurements. We analyze the performance of the PLC in terms of 3 parameters: S-parameters (transfer function), SNR and currents circulating on the aircraft circuit that must comply with the aeronautical electromagnetic regulations. The study also includes a real case scenario with the presence of a switch-mode power supply, which introduces distortion on the network and deteriorates the PLC performance. A comparison with a standard coupling circuit is performed and the results are promising...|$|E
40|$|A helical {{wire antenna}} with a two-wavelength {{circumference}} is analysed {{using the method}} of moments. The helix radiates a circularly polarized (CP) wave in the conical-beam mode. A 10 % axial ratio bandwidth is obtained with a gain of approximately 6. 5 dB for a right-hand CP wave. Next, the CP axial-beam mode radiation characteristics of a <b>monofilar</b> helical strip antenna printed on a hollow dielectric rod are revealed using the finite-difference time domain method. The input impedance is transformed to 50 ohms by inserting a strip matching section along the arm near the feed point. A frequency bandwidth of approximately 49 % for a VSWR = 2 criterion is obtained. In addition, a quadrifilar helical strip antenna (QH), printed on a solid dielectric rod, is analysed. A 50 -ohm input impedance is realized by appropriately choosing the antenna arm length, without inserting a strip matching section. The QH shows a VSWR frequency bandwidth of 7. 4 % with a gain of approximately 7 dB for a right-hand CP wave...|$|E
40|$|We present analytical, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} investigations of electromagnetic resonant modes of a compact <b>monofilar</b> Archimedean spiral resonator shaped in a ring, with no central part. Planar spiral resonators are interesting as components of metamaterials for their compact deep-subwavelength size. Such resonators couple {{primarily to the}} magnetic field component of the incident electromagnetic wave, offering properties suitable for magnetic meta-atoms. Surprisingly, the relative frequencies of the resonant modes follow the sequence of the odd numbers, despite the nearly identical boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields at the extremities of the resonator. In order to explain the observed spectrum of resonant modes, we show that the current distribution inside the spiral satisfies a particular Carleman type singular integral equation. By solving this equation, we obtain a set of resonant frequencies. The analytically calculated resonance frequencies and the current distributions are in good agreement with experimental data {{and the results of}} numerical simulations. By using low-temperature laser scanning microscopy of a superconducting spiral resonator, we compare the experimentally visualized ac current distributions over the spiral with the calculated ones. Theory and experiment agree well with each other. Our analytical model allows for calculation of a detailed three-dimensional magnetic field structure of the resonators.

40|$|The {{present study}} reports the {{kinetics}} of both, isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization, of a biodegradable <b>monofilar</b> suture commercialized as MonosynTM. This polymer is constituted by hard blocks of polyglycolide and soft segments derived from glycolide, ε- caprolactone and trimethylene carbonate. Specifically, the segmented nature in copolymers improves their properties and allows {{their use in}} biomedical area as a surgical suture. First of all, the polymer was characterized by using different techniques as Gel Permeation Cromatography (GPC), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H-NMR), Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The crystallization analyses were followed by DSC and Optical Microscopy (OM) equipped with temperature control system. The sample was crystallized from melt and glass state giving rise to spherulites which included the non crystallizable soft segment and showed different morphology depending on the crystallization temperature. Avrami analysis indicated a heterogeneous nucleation and a three dimensional growth, despite it tended to be bidimensional when isothermal crystallizations were performed under a low supercooling. The Lauritzen and Hoffman treatment was applied to determine the crystallization regimes showing high secondary nucleation constants due to the significant role of hampering from soft segment. The particular morphology of spherulites, flower-like appearance or fibrillar texture, was analyzed in detail with Atomic Force (AF) and Transmission Electron (TE) Microscopies.

40|$|Non-isothermal {{crystallization}} kinetics of polydioxanone (PDO), a polymer with well-established applications as bioabsorbable <b>monofilar</b> suture, {{was investigated}} by Avrami, Mo, and isoconversional methodologies. Results showed Avrami exponents appearing {{in a relatively}} narrow range (i. e., between 3. 76 and 2. 77), which suggested a three-dimensional spherulitic growth and instantaneous nucleation at high cooling rates. The nucleation mechanism changed to sporadic at low rates, with both crystallization processes being detected in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) cooling traces. Formation of crystals was hindered as the material crystallized because of {{a decrease in the}} motion of molecular chains. Two secondary nucleation constants were derived from calorimetric data by applying the methodology proposed by Vyazovkin and Sbirrazzuoli through the estimation of effective activation energies. In fact, typical non-isothermal crystallization analysis based on the determination of crystal growth by optical microscopy allowed secondary nucleation constants of 3. 07 × 105 K 2 and 1. 42 × 105 K 2 to be estimated. Microstructure of sutures was characterized by a stacking of lamellae perpendicularly oriented to the fiber axis and the presence of interlamellar and interfibrillar amorphous regions. The latter became enhanced during heating treatments due to loss of partial chain orientation and decrease of electronic density. Degradation under various pH media revealed different macroscopic morphologies and even a distinct evolution of lamellar microstructure during subsequent heating treatments.
