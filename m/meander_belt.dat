30|$|The {{identification}} of a single bend from a complex compound <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> contains uncertainty due {{to the complexity of}} generations among the bends, and therefore estimation and reconstruction of a subsurface <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> are difficult.

30|$|The {{descriptive}} sedimentological terminologies for {{meandering channel}} processes {{in this study}} are mainly from Harms et al. (1975), whereas the hierarchical descriptive terminologies for small-scale bedding structures are derived from Collinson et al. (1982). On this basis, the architecture of a <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> was recognised along the longitudinal <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> instead of the transverse, which is an efficient way to reconstruct the subsurface reservoir architecture (Ghinassi et al. 2014). In particular, ancient meandering channels are more difficult to identify because they are buried thousands of metres deep.

30|$|Meandering bend {{expansion}} (Figs.  4 a, 12 c) increases curvature, {{flow path}} length, and sinuosity, and the bend apex migrates {{away from the}} <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> axis (Jackson 1976; Ghinassi et al. 2013). Meandering bend translation (Figs.  4 b, 12 b) was characterised by a bend apex parallel to the <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> axis without an obvious change in sinuosity aside from the translation and expansion mode. On the other hand, meandering bend rotation (Figs.  4 d–f, 12 a) was characterised by increasing bend asymmetry, an apex shifting away from the <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> axis, and a nonlinear migration path. The upstream point bar crawled on or was intercalated with the downstream point bar, which indicated strong expansion of the <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> (Fig.  12 c). Furthermore, more upstream point bar deposits from the <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> axis were well-preserved during continuous expansion (Fig.  12 d). During meandering channel transport and deposition, {{almost all of the}} upstream bar suffered from partial erosion, leading to thalweg trajectories of the expansion mode migrating downstream. In contrast, those of the translation mode migrated upstream, indicating the paleo-current direction (Fig.  12). The continuous expansion and rotation mode could have led to higher frequency cut-offs because the expansion mode tended to form cut-offs. Moreover, the rotation mode was more prone to form chute channels, which may form a branch channel within a certain period of time.|$|R

40|$|The {{delineation}} of a <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> {{has been}} recognized in Ontario through land use planning policies as a primary tool for determining the extent a river or stream requires for natural meandering tendencies; thus, providing input to channel restoration projects, development constraints or limits, and regulated areas for species-at-risk. Current delineation procedures utilize site-specific historical migration assessments, or published empirical equations to predict <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> width. In the case of altered, low order watercourses in southern Ontario, the <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> width dimension is usually assessed by the application of empirical relations, as the available historic record often lacks the information necessary to conduct meander morphology and migration assessments.

Drawing on a sample population of river reaches in the Credit River watershed, this research project evaluates the current standards of practice for <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> delineation in southern Ontario, focusing on empirical equations {{to determine whether the}} width of the <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> can be reliably predicted from hydro-geomorphic variables.

40|$|Fluvial <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> sediments form some of {{the most}} architecturally complex {{reservoirs}} in hydrocarbon fields due to multiple scales of heterogeneity inherent in their deposition. Currently, characterization of <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> bodies largely relies on idealized vertical profiles and a limited number of analogue models that naively infer architecture from active river dimensions. Three-dimensional architectural data are needed to quantify scales of grain-size heterogeneity, spatial patterns of sedimentation and bar preservation in a direct relationship with the relevant length scales of active river channels. In this study, three large flume experiments and a numerical model were used to characterize and construct the architecture (referred to as ‘archimetrics’) and sedimentology of <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> deposits, while taking reworking and partial preservation into account. <b>Meander</b> <b>belt</b> sandbody width-to-thickness ratios between 100 and 200 were observed, which are consistent with reported values of natural meander belts. For the first time, the relief of the base of a <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> is quantified, enabling improved estimates of connectedness of amalgamated meander belts. A key observation is that the slope and number of lateral-accretion packages within natural point bar deposits can be well predicted from fairly basic observables, a finding subsequently tested on several natural systems. Probability curves of preserved architectural characteristics for three dimensions were quantified allowing estimates of bar dimensions, baffle and barrier spacing distributions and container dimensions. Based on this, a set of rules were identified for combining reservoir parameters with the identified probability curves on sandbody dimensions and character, to help create more realistic geomodels for estimating exploration success on the basis of seismic and core data...|$|E

40|$|Channel belt {{deposits}} from meandering river systems commonly display {{an internal}} architecture of stacked depositional features with scoured basal contacts due to channel and bedform migration across {{a range of}} scales. Recognition and correct interpretation of these bounding surfaces is essential to reconstruction of palaeochannel dimensions and to flow modelling for hydrocarbon exploration. It is therefore crucial to understand the suite of processes that form and transfer these surfaces into the fluvial sedimentary record. Here the numerical model ‘NAYS 2 D’ is used to simulate a highly sinuous meandering river with synthetic stratigraphic architectures that can be compared directly to the sedimentary record. Model results highlight the importance of spatial and temporal variations in channel depth and migration rate to the generation of channel and bar deposits. Addition of net uniform bed aggradation (due to excess sediment input) allows quantification of the preservation of meander morphology {{for a wide range of}} depositional conditions. The present authors found that the effect of vertical variation in scouring due to channel migration is generally orders of magnitude larger than the effect of bed aggradation. This explains the limited impact bed aggradation has on preservation of meander morphology. Moreover, lateral differences in stratigraphy within the <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> are much larger than the stratigraphic imprint of bed aggradation. Repeatedly produced alternations of point bar growth followed by cut-off result in a vertical trend in channel and scour feature stacking. Importantly, this vertical stacking trend differs laterally within the <b>meander</b> <b>belt.</b> In the centre of the <b>meander</b> <b>belt,</b> the high reworking intensity results in many bounding surfaces and disturbed deposits. Closer to the margins, reworking is infrequent and thick deposits with a limited number of bounding surfaces are preserved. These marginal areas therefore have the highest preservation potential for complete channel deposits and are thus best suited for palaeochannel reconstruction...|$|E

However, in general, the ancient flow of the cut-off bend appeared discontinuous and frequently developed on the apex of the channel towards the concave bank. The assembly from different profile segments must be reasonable and obey meandering fluid dynamics. To some extent, this assembly method had a multiplicity of solutions and some uncertainty consequently remains.|$|R

Some useful reservoir parameters, such as volume of meander loops, areas of interconnection and fluid flow barriers, are calculated from the obtained model. Sandstone porosity is mainly of primary origin and mechanical compaction is the most iotense diagenetic feature. Models of estimated permeability evolution in the point bar sequences have been developed.

Furthermore, complex channelised reworking increased uncertainty (Eschard et al. 1991; Miall 1994; Miall and Jones 2003; Ielpi and Ghinassi 2014), and the isochronism of chronostratigraphic correction influenced the results.|$|E

The Nabileque megafan is formed by the Paraguay River at the exit of the Pantanal wetland, coalescing with the Pilcomayo megafan of the Chaco basin. A geomorphological zonation analysis was performed making use of remote sensing data with field verification.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this work}} is {{to assess the impact}} of reservoir heterogeneities on heavy oil recovery of a reservoir analogue of <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> through the Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) process by using numerical models. These models are obtained with different scales of upscaling of the geological model. Meander belts consist of point bar deposits, characterized by a 3 D complex internal architecture, with different scales of heterogeneities, which distribution is associated with the depositional processes. Based on a 3 D outcrop description of a <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> analogue to the Canadian heavy-oil fields, the approach includes three steps: 1) the construction of a reference static reservoir model based on a very fine description of the outcrops in terms of architecture and geological heterogeneities, 2) upscaling of the grid at different scales using different upscaling factors in order to evaluate their impact on the heterogeneity distribution in the reservoir, 3) reservoir SAGD simulations using horizontal well doublet (steam injector and producer) across the <b>meander</b> <b>belt,</b> so as {{to assess the impact of}} upscaling of heterogeneities on heavy oil production. The impact of heterogeneities on simulation results are evaluated for several upscaling stages. Results show that heterogeneity distribution has an impact on fluid flow at different stages of production. On the fine gridded model, small scale heterogeneities impact the steam chamber development and fluid flow in the wellbore vicinity at the beginning of the steam injection, whereas large scale heterogeneities strongly influence oil recovery during the whole recovery process and lower the efficiency of the reservoir drainage. On coarser grids, the effect of small-scale heterogeneities can be diminished, depending on the upscaling stage. The geomechanical effect is not taken into account in this work, the objective being to assess the impact of heterogeneities on oil recovery. The performance of SAGD is clearly linked to the steam chamber development, which depends on the degree of heterogeneities present in the reservoir. The simulation workflow and the sensitivity study on the upscaling method contribute to a better restoration of the heterogeneity distribution in the reservoir. The negative effect of these heterogeneities during the oil recovery must thus be quantified in order to monitor the thermal production at crucial periods of the production process...|$|E

Two-stage {{meandering}} channels with cut-off structures (i.e. light blue line representing original channel centreline and blue line representing the final channel centreline) were interpreted {{and supported by}} abundant core data (Fig.  9). Bend (C) was characterised by low curvature accompanying a cut-off in the earlier stage of growth. The cut-off was adjacent to bend (C), which developed before forming a residual point bar, whereas bend (D) was characterised by chute channel formation. This chute segment was inferred from an inflection in bend (C), which migrated with the translation and expansion mode, deviating from the <b>meandering</b> <b>belt</b> axis downstream.

The Sao Lourenço and the Taquari are coalescent megafans, having the Piquiri interfan meander river in between them. Based on the interpretation of satellite images and field validation, it was possible to identify channel patterns, to interpret depositional and erosional processes, to recognize the phenomena of river avulsion and to map depositional lobes. Three geomorphological zones were recognized on the São Lourenço megafan: 1) abandoned depositional lobes located in the upper/intermediate fan, composed of Pleistocene fluvial deposits and exhibiting distributary paleochannels on their surfaces, which are currently being dissected by tributary channels; 2) an active Holocene confined <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> formed by fluvial aggradation in a N 65 E incised-valley; 3) active depositional lobes placed on the distal part of the system, which are the main site of sedimentation and are characterized by frequent avulsion events, channel bifurcation, distributary drainage pattern and the presence of depositional lobated landforms.

A downstream sequence of reaches was observed, each with a typical fluvial style and channel migration rate: (a) a narrow <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> anda highly sinuous channel with intermediate migration rate, {{in the middle of an}} extensive floodbasin; (b) a wide <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> and high rates oflateral channel migration, especially where large meanders impinged upon valley bluffs, as part of an incised setting; (c) a low sinuosity,embanked channel with low rates of downstream migration because of confinement by dikes, occurring in an inland delta with sandy sediments. Local variation in meander migration rates was observed within reach B. This was caused by the spatial variability of bank resistance asreflected by the width-depth ratio of the channel and the silt-clay ratios of deposits. River banks are: 1) very erodible when consisting of channeldeposits, aeolian dune deposits or when coarse fluvio-periglacial deposits occur at their base; 2) erodible when dominated by overbank depositsor aeolian sand sheet deposits; 3) resistant when a plaggen-layer is exposed; and 4) very resistant when dominated by floodbasin deposits.

In an attempt to determine the po-tential corrosiveness of the soil to buried metallic structures in Bayelsa State, surface geoelectrical sounding was carried out. Twenty-five Schlumberger Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) was carried out in the freshwater and <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> geomorphic zone and the salt water mangrove swamp and estuary complex of the state using a maximum current elec-trode separation ranging from 200 - 400 m.

Comparison of oxbow lake and meander scar dimensions along an inactive <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> of the Río Mamoré (Llanos de Moxos, north-eastern Bolivia) and its modern counterpart suggests significant regional paleohydrological variability. We used these features as geomorphological and sedimentary archives to enhance our understanding of longer-term variations of the fluvial system. Late Pleistocene to Holocene hydrological changes of the Río Mamoré are inferred from: (i) the analysis of satellite imagery, (ii) discharge estimates from meander morphology, (iii) stratigraphic, and (iv) chronological information based on luminescence and radiocarbon dating. The combined data from three oxbows indicate that the now abandoned <b>meander</b> <b>belt</b> – the paleo-Mamoré – continued to be active at least until ∼ 5 ka, and likely even postdating 3 ka. An up to threefold increase in discharge is estimated for the modern Río Mamoré versus the paleo-Mamoré.

The preceding increase in discharge in turn, was possibly related to a shift in climatic conditions, which changed markedly between the mid- and late Holocene in tropical South America. In addition, {{it may have been the}} indirect result of capturing the avulsive Río Grande system to the east of the Río Mamoré.
