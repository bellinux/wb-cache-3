Another innovation, {{of which he}} was proud, was an automatic self-recording <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer</b> that memorialized its measurements on a paper strip; with this meteorological instrument he kept a continuous barometric record that covered a span of 30 years.|$|E
5|$|An old style <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer</b> {{consists}} of a vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer</b> and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E

25|$|Evangelista Torricelli (1607–1647) {{was best}} known for his {{invention}} of the <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer.</b> The motivation for the invention was to improve on the suction pumps that were used to raise water out of the mines. Torricelli constructed a sealed tube filled with mercury, set vertically into a basin of the same substance. The column of mercury fell downwards, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above.|$|E
25|$|However, Pascal went {{even further}} {{to test the}} {{mechanical}} theory. If, as suspected by mechanical philosophers like Torricelli and Pascal, air had lateral weight, {{the weight of the}} air would be less at higher altitudes. Therefore, Pascal wrote to his brother-in-law, Florin Perier, who lived near a mountain called the Puy de Dome, asking him to perform a crucial experiment. Perier was to take a barometer up the Puy de Dome and make measurements along the way of the height of the column of mercury. He was then to compare it to measurements taken {{at the foot of the}} mountain to see if those measurements taken higher up were in fact smaller. In September 1648, Perier carefully and meticulously carried out the experiment, and found that Pascal's predictions had been correct. The <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer</b> stood lower the higher one went.|$|E
2500|$|Design {{changes to}} make the {{instrument}} more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers. Fitzroy barometers combine the standard <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer</b> with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. [...] Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom. [...] This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. [...] To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to the zero level before the pressure is read on the column. [...] Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. [...] This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>mercury</b> <b>barometer</b> has a {{glass tube}} closed {{at one end}} with an open mercury-filled {{reservoir}} at the base. [...] The weight of the mercury creates a vacuum {{in the top of}} the tube known as Torricellian vacuum. Mercury in the tube adjusts until the weight of the mercury column balances the atmospheric force exerted on the reservoir. [...] High atmospheric pressure places more force on the reservoir, forcing mercury higher in the column. [...] Low pressure allows the mercury to drop to a lower level in the column by lowering the force placed on the reservoir. Since higher temperature levels around the instrument will reduce the density of the mercury, the scale for reading the height of the mercury is adjusted to compensate for this effect. [...] The tube has to be at least as long as the amount dipping in the mercury + head space + the maximum length of the column.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} observation of capillary action was by Leonardo da Vinci. [...] A former student of Galileo, , {{was said to}} have investigated capillary action.

Boyle then reported an experiment in which he dipped a capillary tube into red wine and then subjected the tube to a partial vacuum. He found that the vacuum had no observable influence on the height of the liquid in the capillary, so the behavior of liquids in capillary tubes was due to some phenomenon different from that which governed <b>mercury</b> <b>barometers.</b>|$|R

Edwin had been asked to consult with Hector, and in January 1874 he proposed an expanded scheme of weather forecasting and storm warnings to the commissioner of customs (nominal head of the Marine Department), volunteering to set it up.

40|$|The {{eruption}} of Mount Tambora (Indonesia) in April 1815 {{is the largest}} documented volcanic eruption in history. It caused a large global cooling during the following year, felt particularly in parts of Europe and North America, where the year 1816 {{became known as the}} "year without a summer". This paper describes an effort made to collect surface meteorological observations from the early instrumental period, with a focus on the years immediately following the eruption (1815 – 1817). Although the collection aimed in particular at pressure observations, correspondent temperature observations were also recovered. Some of the series had already been described in the literature, but {{a large part of the}} data, recently digitised from original weather diaries and contemporary magazines and newspapers, is presented here for the first time. The collection puts together more than fifty sub-daily series from land observatories in Europe and North America, and from ships in the tropics. The pressure observations have been corrected for temperature and gravity and reduced to mean sea level, moreover an additional statistical correction was applied to take into account common error sources in <b>mercury</b> <b>barometers.</b> To assess the reliability of the corrected dataset, the variance of the pressure observations is compared with modern climatologies and single observations are used for synoptic analyses of three case studies in Europe.
