The geomorphologic study of this island was done based SRTM data, geological map of the island and images data, ASTER-TERRA system and the ETM+ sensor images. Volcanic rocks that make up Faial Island consist of four volcano stratigraphic units, with ages between 730 ka and the present.

50|$|Based on the ionic radii {{and charge}} alone, Ni2+ should easily {{substitute}} for Mg2+ in octahedral coordination. The fact that Ni readily substitutes for Mg in garnierite explains why as NiO content goes up, <b>MgO</b> <b>content</b> goes down. The nickel in garnierite is not evenly {{distributed throughout the}} structure, but is concentrated in small zones of nickel surrounded by magnesium zones. Garnierite is a layer silicate. The main difference between the serpentine-like and talc-like variants of garnierite is the spacing between layers in the structure, seen in x-ray powder diffraction studies. The serpentine-like variants have 7 Å basal spacings while the talc-like variants have a basal spacing of 10 Å. At 106X magnifications, the 7 and 10 Å layer spacings (d(001)) are obvious and measureable, with the 7 Å spacings being better defined than the 10 Å spacings. 7 Å, serpentine-like minerals show rod and tube shaped particles, as well as platy particles and fluffy particles that are most likely aggregates while the 10 Å variety shows much less variation in particles, showing only platy and fluffy forms with very few tube or rod shaped particles. Some particles exhibit interstratification of 7 and 10 Å spacings. There is no correlation between NiO content and {{the shapes of the}} particles in the mineral. 7 Å type garnierites usually resemble chrysotile or lizardite in their structures, while 10 Å types usually resemble pimelite.|$|E

This pro- cess, referred to as "Fe-loss", can operate during natural pre-eruptive cooling of host magma and results in lower FeOt and higher <b>MgO</b> <b>contents</b> within the initially trapped volume of inclusion. The extent of Fe-loss is enhanced by large temperature intervals of magma cooling before eruption. The compositions of homoge- nised melt inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from several subduction-related suites demonstrate that (1) Fe-loss is a common process, (2) the maximum observed degree of re-equilibration varies between suites, and (3) within a single sample, variable degrees of re-equilibration can be recorded by melt inclusions trapped in olivine pheno- crysts of identical composition. Our modelling also demonstrates that the re-equilibration process is fast going to completion, in the largest inclusions in the most magnesian phenocrysts it is completed within 2 years. The results we obtained indicate {{that the possibility of}} Fe-loss must be considered when estimating composi- tions of parental subduction-related magmas from nat- urally quenched glassy melt inclusions in magnesian olivine phenocrysts. Compositions calculated from glassy inclusions affected by Fe-loss will inherit not only erroneously low FeOt contents, but also low MgO due to the inherited higher Mg# of the residual melt in re- equilibrated inclusions. We also demonstrate that due to the higher <b>MgO</b> <b>contents</b> of homogenised melt inclu- sions affected by Fe-loss, homogenisation temperatures achieved in heating experiments will be higher than original trapping temperatures.
