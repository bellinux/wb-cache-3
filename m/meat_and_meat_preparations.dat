40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Salmonella is a foodborne pathogen which causes gastrointestinal illness in consumers, and exhibits resistance to antimicrobials of eterinary and clinical significance. The {{aim of this}} study is to detect the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella isolates from meat in Latvia. Material and Methods A total of 3, 152 samples of raw and ready-to-eat (RTE) meats were collected during the official control and in-house control procedures in 2015. Samples were tested in accordance with ISO 6579 : 2002. All S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis and other isolates recovered from the official control samples (S. Derby, S. Give) were tested for antimicrobial resistance. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were investigated in line with the requirements of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Results The prevalence of Salmonella was 0. 8 % (25 / 3152). The highest prevalence (1. 5 %) of Salmonella was found in minced <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> (7 / 481), while the lowest (0 %) in frozen <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> (0 / 349) and RTE meats (0 / 364). The most common serovars were S. Typhimurium (36 %, 9 / 25) and S. Derby (32 %, 8 / 25). In total, 62 % (13 / 21) of Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. Altogether, 40 % (8 / 20) of isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole, 25 % (5 / 20) to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and 20 % (4 / 20) to tetracycline. All isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, meropenem, azithromycin and tigecycline. S. Typhimurium exhibited antimicrobial resistance more often (87. 5 %) than other serovars. Conclusions The study shows that the presence of Salmonella in meat, together with the high prevalence of resistant strains, is a significant public health related issue in Latvia...|$|E

As the same somatic mutations occur in sporadic adenomas and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) -related adenomas, similar exogenous factors may play a role in the development of both types of adenoma. In a case control study among 57 sporadic colorectal adenoma cases and 62 adenoma cases from HNPCC families (and 148 adenoma-free controls) from the Netherlands, we examined whether <b>meat</b> consumption <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> are similarly associated with sporadic and suspected HNPCC colorectal adenomas. Frequency of meat consumption was not significantly associated with adenoma risk in our population of sporadic and HNPCC family cases and controls (Odds Ratios (OR) for high versus low consumption were 1. 0 and 0. 6, respectively). Interestingly, consumption of red <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> specific <b>preparation</b> methods (i. e., “not adding any water” and “ closed lid with most meat types”) slightly, but non-significantly, increased the risk of adenomas in the sporadic group only (OR, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 4. 1, 0. 7 – 23. 0, 2. 0, 0. 6 – 6. 5 and 2. 6, 0. 9 – 7. 2, respectively).

It analysis the major determinants of Ethiopian’s bilateral exports and explores the unexploited export potentials that the country may have in the Middle East using two different methods. First, the augmented gravity model estimated by G 2 SLS estimation technique using 13 years data of 15 exporting partners. The estimated coefficients then used to analyze the existing bilateral export and predict the export potential that the country could have in the three Middle Eastern countries. Accordingly, GDPpc of both exporting and importing countries found to have positive and significant impact on Ethiopia’s bilateral exports whereas, distance between countries negatively affect their bilateral trade. In this light, the export potentials of the country are estimated using the estimated coefficients of the gravity model. Accordingly, Ethiopia has the highest unexploited potential in U. A.

The microbial {{profile of the}} carcasses intended for cutting and mincing was investigated by detecting spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Samples of diced meat (DM), marrowbones (MB), steaks (S) and minced meat (MM) were packaged in MAP (66. 0 % O 2, 25. 0 % CO 2 and 9. 0 % N 2) and stored at + 2 and + 8 °C. At 0, 7 and 14 days, gas composition of headspace was measured. Moreover, in all the samples colony count at 30 °C, Enterobacteriaceae, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Pseudomonas spp. were determined. The carcasses contamination was {{in compliance with the}} criteria fixed by EC Reg. 2073 / 2005. Gas composition of the headspace changed significantly during the storage, mainly at + 8 °C, where a significant decrease of O 2 (until 0. 1 - 0. 6 %) and an increase of CO 2 (until 81. 0 - 89. 0 %) were recorded. This could be related to the level of LAB and Pseudomonas spp. Less significant changes were observed at + 2 °C.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{assessment}} was to identify public health risks linked to mechanically separated meat (MSM) types from pork and poultry and compare them with fresh meat, minced <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> (non-MSM); and to select, rank and suggest objective measurement methods and values for parameters to distinguish MSM types. Microbial hazards in MSM {{are expected to be}} similar to those in non-MSM, although the risk of microbial growth increases with the degree of muscle fibre degradation, thus with the separation pressure. For the distinction between the different types of MSM and non-MSM chemical, histological, molecular, textural and rheological parameters were considered as potential indicators. The analysis of available published data suggested that calcium and, if confirmed cholesterol content, was the only appropriate chemical parameters which could be used to distinguish MSM from non-MSM products. On the basis of published data, a model was developed to derive probabilities for a product to be classified as MSM based on the calcium content. Calcium content of 100 mg/ 100 g, as specified in the Reg. (EC) No. 2074 / 2005, corresponds to probability of 93. 6 % for a product to be classified as MSM, according to the model developed. Calcium content alone does not allow differentiation between low pressure MSM and other meat products, and other validated tests would be necessary. Histological parameters considered include microscopic detection of different tissues and their changes. The latter is a promising method for distinction of MSM types, but further validation is needed. In order to improve methods for MSM identification, specifically designed studies for the collection of data obtained by standardised methods on indicators such as calcium and cholesterol should be undertaken, while studies based on combinations of different parameters could also be useful...|$|E
40|$|At present, carbon {{footprint}} labelling {{is at the}} heart of debates on the environmental impact of products, but there are other environmental criteria related to the sustainability of products that could also have an impact on developing countries' exports in the future. Furthermore, this issue has proved to be highly dynamic and subject to constant change over time; it is thus clear that its evolution needs to be closely monitored in view of the diverse consequences it might have on the Argentine export sector. The present study shows how relevant the European Union is for Argentina as a destination market for Argentine export products that could be potentially affected by {{carbon footprint}} standards or labelling. The actions taken in the United Kingdom and France, where special attention is paid to the carbon footprint of food products sold in large retail chains, and the European Commission's initiative on Environmental Footprint of Products are outstanding examples of initiatives aimed at measuring carbon footprint. It was also found that the basket of exports likely to be affected by carbon footprint measurement schemes accounts for around one-fourth of Argentine exports to each of the destinations included in this study: the United Kingdom, France, the European Union, the United States and Japan. In 2007 - 2010, average exports of these products to the European Union reached USD 2. 82 billion, which totalled 29. 1 % of Argentine exports of the affected products to the world. In turn, the United States accounted for 11. 1 % of total exports of affected products, whereas the share of Japan only reached 2. 1 %. France and the United Kingdom accounted for only a small portion of this trade: 1. 8 % and 2. 4 % respectively. A more detailed analysis - at the level of heading - reveals that the main Argentine exports which in 2007 - 2010 were destined to the main markets implementing carbon footprint labelling schemes corresponded to bovine meat and its preparations, wines, crustaceans and fish, citrus fruit, apples and pears and other fruit, fruit juices and natural honey. According to 2003 data, an analysis of the degree of vulnerability of Argentine products destined to other markets shows that the most vulnerable productive sectors were honey, fruit juices, tea and apples and pears as well as bovine, swine and ovine <b>meat</b> <b>and</b> <b>meat</b> <b>preparations,</b> citrus fruit, fruit, vegetables and canned vegetables, and olive oil...|$|E
