40|$|Nowadays, {{traditional}} {{services are}} {{being replaced by}} mobile or <b>M-business</b> that is more efficient, faster and accessible. To enable <b>M-business</b> operators to service many customers efficiently but with {{the impression of a}} personalized individual service, a method called mass customization is used. For this service to work, detailed information about each customer is needed and is achieved by customer profiling. The big challenge is how to profile <b>M-business</b> customers who have very short attention span and want to quickly conclude a transaction on their mobile device to avoid expensive air time charges and restriction to their mobility. Currently, <b>M-business</b> companies do not have sufficient strategic information about their customers to correctly target them for mass customization. To answer this question, research was conducted in Iran and Malaysia to determine what technique is most suitable for profiling. Various on-line psychographic profiling methods are available and three methods, namely Big Five, Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), and ProScan were found to be most suitable. Big Five was found to be the best method but requires customers to answer 40 to 120 questions. NLP on the other hand, only requires customers to answer a minimum of 10 questions. The number of questions to be answered matters significantly in a <b>M-business</b> service. This was confirmed by a survey conducted in Iran and Malaysia, on the willingness of the respondents to answer profiling questions. After NLP was chosen, another survey was conducted to determine the different NLP profiles of <b>M-business</b> customers. This information was used to design and implement a prototype system for a mobile news service that is able to profile customers by NLP and then mass customize news messages either in the form of text, audio, or interactive multimedia messaging system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This study {{presents}} a usability assessment of mobile {{presence in the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), with a particular focus on the variance between <b>M-business</b> and M-government presence. In fact, a general hypothesis was developed that <b>M-business</b> software is more usable than M-government software, with eleven sub-hypotheses derived from Nielsen’s heuristics method. To examine the hypotheses, a true representative sample of thirty-six (n= 36) mobile software applications in Saudi Arabia were identified from prior research, representing two main categories: <b>M-business</b> and M-government. Within each category, eighteen (n= 18) mobile software applications were carefully chosen for further evaluation, representing {{a wide variety of}} sectors. A questionnaire was devised based on Nielsen’s heuristics method; this was tailored to fit the context at hand (mobile computing) to establish a usability checklist (consisting of eleven constructs). A group of thirty-six (n= 36) participants were recruited to complete the usability assessment of examining each software application against the usability checklist, by rating each item using a Likert scale. The results herein reveal that mobile interactions in KSA were, in general, of an acceptable design quality with respect to usability aspects. The average percentage score for all heuristics met by the evaluated mobile software applications was 68. 6 %, this reflected how well the usability practices in mobile presence were implemented. The scores for all usability components exceeded 60 %, with five components being below the average score (of 68. 6 %) and six components being above it. The variance between <b>M-business</b> and M-government software usability was significant, particularly in favor of <b>M-business.</b> In fact, the general hypothesis was accepted as well as seven other sub-hypotheses, as only four sub-hypotheses were rejected.

40|$|A new {{economic}} order has developed that {{is referred to}} as the New Economy and has brought about a shift in focus from manufactured goods and services to an economy that places emphasis on knowledge and the application thereof within a specific context (Leung, 2002). Furthermore, this economy places emphasis on the saliency of information and how it can be used as a competitive and commercial tool. The New Economy is characterised by a unique consumer that functions within it called the New Consumer and this individual functions as a ubiquitous entity that is always on as this individual uses mobile devices that enables them to conduct business and communicate anywhere and at any time. The New Consumer is characterised by being individualistic, involved, independent and informed but also suffers from scarcities such as time, attention and trust. In view hereof, value has become a pivotal matter that all organisations should place emphasis on when delivering products and services to this consumer. Furthermore, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has brought about a technological revolution in the New Economy and has changed the way in which the consumer works and conducts business. Mobile devices form an important component of the New Economy as it also offers organisations the opportunity to adopt new business models, using wireless technology, that enable mobile business (<b>m-business)</b> solutions. <b>M-business</b> refers to the purchasing of information, goods and services via a mobile device (Anon., 2000 c) and organisations offering <b>m-business</b> in the New Economy are enabled to offer the advantages such as delivering just the right information, to just the right people at just the right time which means that convenient and personalised location-based information can be delivered to the individual. One industry that has adopted the <b>m-business</b> solution, as a value-added service, is the banking industry and various banks are offering the mobile financial solution to consumers meaning that they can access their accounts, pay their bills and make transfers using a mobile device. As many banks have adopted m-banking, as a value-added <b>m-business</b> offering, a credible source that elaborates on the implementation of m-banking and the industry requirements pertaining to the implementation process is Mobey Forum who has published the Mobey Forum White Paper (Anon., 2004 p) that explains the implementation requirements of mobile financial services such as customer proposition, business priorities, technical issues and implementation issues. This study focuses on the industry requirements of m-banking, as set out by the Mobey Forum White Paper (Anon., 2004 p).

Most of the e-busines [9] applications uses the traditional model client/server in which a commercial operation requires generally a link of stable communication being established between the customer and the server, and the traditional approach client/server [8] constitutes an obstacle to the development of application of <b>m-business.</b> The proposed architecture introduces several advantages: in the first place, allow the consumers to manage their commercial business driven by types of mobile devices (phones, PDAs, etc. [...] ) at any time and wherever. Secondly, minimize the waiting time of the customer, and the quantity of transferring information. Third, this architecture addresses the problem of time limited and expensive connection for mobile users. The Mobile agents will be used on a single level: research agent.

However, {{in order to increase}} business value, innovative industrial product companies are increasingly looking for new <b>m-Business</b> services related to their core business. With the emergence of such virtual markets (services, information, knowledge, life-style support, security) we need a new paradigm for understanding and predicting business performance. The concept “value constellation ” replaces the value chain. A <b>m-Business</b> model is not sustainable if it lacks a sound economic value proposition to the end-user.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of the {{internet}} and mobile telephony, many agree that Mobile-Business is the logical next step in the Electronic-Business revolution. Investigation of mobile electronic marketing is essential to ensure both consumers and organisations gain true value from the adoption and consumption of <b>M-Business</b> into their personal and working lives. Marketing to date has primarily focused on understanding the diffusion of M/E-Business technologies, adopter categories and adoption rates, whereas research in Information Systems (IS) often focuses on quantitatively predicting its adoption and usage by individuals and organisations.
