25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of Millionaires the band chose to start anew {{in their approach}} to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour {{in the autumn of}} that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, Pleased To <b>Meet</b> <b>You,</b> was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E

500|$|Mardas and Aspinall joined Lennon and Harrison in India, {{where they}} were {{studying}} meditation {{under the tutelage of}} Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; Starr had flown back to England—complaining that the Indian food did not agree with him—and McCartney had left on 24 March 1968. When Mardas first met the Maharishi, he said sarcastically, [...] "I know you! Didn’t I <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> in Greece years ago?" ...|$|E
500|$|Back in the Verona Arena, Jordan {{starts the}} concert in an angry, apathetic manner. While performing, Jordan sees {{a vision of}} Heer walking towards him, smiling lovingly. The {{audience}} cheers on, despite his tears and oblivious to his anguish. A montage of all the happy times the couple spent together plays, ending with a line from Mawlana Jalal-ud-Din Rumi's poem: [...] "Away, beyond all concepts of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I'll <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> there".|$|E
500|$|When Debs was {{released}} from the Atlanta Penitentiary, the other prisoners sent him off with [...] "a roar of cheers" [...] and a crowd of 50,000 greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music.

500|$|Balked again, Butler {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} campaign personal, calling Tillman a liar and trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler's tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a questioner who asked why he did not meet Butler's insults with violence, [...] "Yes, I tell you, you cowardly hound, why I took them , and I'll <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> wherever you want to. I took them because I, as governor of the State, {{could not afford to}} create a row at a public meeting and have our people murder each other like dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{finale of}} [...] "Don't Stop" [...] {{received}} good grades—"A" [...] from Gonzales and [...] "B+" [...] from Benigno, {{and four of}} five stars from Berk. Kubicek found a bright spot in that Sam got to sing a solo. The performance received encomiums such as [...] "pretty great" [...] from Semigran and [...] "inspired" [...] from Futterman. The portion of an original song for the April Rhodes musical sung by April and Will, [...] "Nice to <b>Meet</b> <b>You,</b> Have I Slept with You?", received little commentary, though Flandez made specific mention of [...] "her operatic range, and their charismatic stage presence".|$|E

500|$|... "I Need A Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad, {{featuring}} guitar riffs. According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com, {{the song}} contains familiar qualities of Songz's breakout hit [...] "Can't Help But Wait", also produced by Stargate. The song is lyrically about finding and pleasing the right woman, through lines such as, [...] "I don't even know your name, but I know that I'm your man {{and you are}} my girl, if I ever <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> I'm gonna give you the world, Baby please believe me when I tell you that I need a girl." [...] The song has been described to be a mix of Usher and Justin Timberlake, and {{has been compared to}} Chris Brown's [...] "With You." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, Tubman escaped again, {{this time}} without her brothers. Beforehand, {{she tried to}} send word to her mother of her plans. She sang a coded song to Mary, a trusted fellow slave, that was a farewell. [...] "I'll <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> in the morning," [...] she intoned, [...] "I'm bound for the promised land." [...] While her exact route is unknown, Tubman made use of the network known as the Underground Railroad. This {{informal}} but well-organized system was composed of free and enslaved blacks, white abolitionists, and other activists. Most prominent among the latter in Maryland {{at the time were}} members of the Religious Society of Friends, often called Quakers. The Preston area near Poplar Neck in Caroline County contained a substantial Quaker community, and was probably an important first stop during Tubman's escape. From there, she probably took a common route for fleeing slaves – northeast along the Choptank River, through Delaware and then north into Pennsylvania. A journey of nearly 90 miles (145 kilometers), her traveling by foot would have taken between five days and three weeks.|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. [...] People want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. [...] Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman , Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared to <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up." ...|$|E
