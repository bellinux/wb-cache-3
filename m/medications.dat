5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} <b>medications</b> are {{reported}} in 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain <b>medications</b> have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some <b>medications</b> are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used <b>medications,</b> such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the <b>medications.</b> Among the antiepileptic <b>medications,</b> levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E

40|$|Background: The <b>medication</b> cart can {{be filled}} using an {{automated}} system or a manual method and when using a manual method the <b>medication</b> {{can be arranged}} either by round time or by <b>medication</b> name. For the manual methods, it is hypothesized that the latter method {{would result in a}} lower frequency of <b>medication</b> administration errors because nurses are forced to read the <b>medication</b> labels, but evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the frequency of <b>medication</b> administration errors of two different manual <b>medication</b> cart filling methods, namely arranging <b>medication</b> by round time or by <b>medication</b> name. Design: A prospective, observational study with a before-after design. Participants and settings: Eighty-six patients who stayed on an orthopaedic ward in one university medical centre in the Netherlands were included. Methods: Disguised observation was used to detect <b>medication</b> administration errors. The <b>medication</b> cart filling method in usual care was to fill the cart with <b>medication</b> arranged by round time. The intervention was the implementation of the second <b>medication</b> cart filling method, where the <b>medication</b> cart was filled by arranging medicines by their names. The primary outcome was the frequency of <b>medication</b> administrations with one or more error(s) after the intervention compared with before the intervention. The secondary outcome was the frequency of subtypes of <b>medication</b> administration errors. Results: After the intervention 170 of 740 (23. 0 %) <b>medication</b> administrations with one or more <b>medication</b> administration error(s) were observed compared to 114 of 589 (19. 4 %) before the intervention (odds ratio 1. 24 [95 % confidence interval 0. 95 - 1. 62]). The distribution of subtypes of <b>medication</b> administration errors before and after the intervention was statistically significantly different (p < 0. 001). Analysis of subtypes revealed more omissions and wrong time errors after the intervention than before the intervention. Unauthorized <b>medication</b> errors were detected more frequently before the intervention than after the intervention. Conclusion: The frequency of <b>medication</b> administration errors with the <b>medication</b> cart filling method where the <b>medication</b> is arranged by name was not statistically significantly different compared to the <b>medication</b> cart filling method where the <b>medication</b> is arranged by round time.

40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Medication</b> {{adherence}} studies usually rely on {{a narrow}} aspect of a patient’s <b>medication</b> history. Studies using administrative claims data such as insurance pharmacy claims cannot compute adherence for patients who don’t fill their <b>medication</b> orders or who use spousal benefits. Studies using <b>medication</b> orders from the electronic health record (EHR) assume that all patients fill their <b>medication</b> orders. Linking EHR <b>medication</b> orders to pharmacy claims can create a more robust picture of a patient’s <b>medication</b> history. The {{aim of this study}} was to create an algorithm for linking EHR orders to pharmacy claims to create a new metric of <b>medication</b> adherence – the eMPR (electronic <b>Medication</b> Possession Ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Medication</b> {{errors are}} common through {{all phases of}} a {{hospitalization}} and represent a significant patient safety risk. <b>Medication</b> errors lead to Adverse Drug Events which {{are the most common}} type of error experienced in a hospital. Such events represent a significant public health issue and have gained national attention. Despite this attention, the current financial structure of the United States’ healthcare system inhibits providers from fully embracing efforts to reduce <b>medication</b> errors. <b>Medication</b> Reconciliation is the act of completing a <b>medication</b> history and correcting discrepancies between a patient’s previous <b>medication</b> regimen and the proposed <b>medication</b> order. <b>Medication</b> reconciliation characterizes a sustainable solution that can significantly reduce <b>medication</b> errors if performed correctly. Often, <b>medication</b> reconciliation is performed by a nursing admissions team or physicians, despite the research that proves pharmacists are suited best. When pharmacists perform <b>medication</b> reconciliation it denotes the most effective solution for reducing drug related errors. A case study of a large academic medical system’s Emergency Department examined the effectiveness of a nursing based <b>medication</b> reconciliation process. A pharmacist reviewed <b>medication</b> histories performed by a nursing admissions team to assess the prevalence and type of <b>medication</b> discrepancies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Medication</b> {{reconciliation}} aims {{to correct}} discrepancies in <b>medication</b> use between health care settings and {{to check the}} quality of pharmacotherapy to improve effectiveness and safety. In addition, <b>medication</b> reconciliation might also reduce costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of <b>medication</b> reconciliation on <b>medication</b> costs after hospital discharge in relation to hospital pharmacy labor costs. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed. Patients discharged from the pulmonology department were included. A pharmacy team assessed <b>medication</b> errors prevented by <b>medication</b> reconciliation. Interventions were classified into 3 categories: correcting hospital formulary-induced <b>medication</b> changes (eg, reinstating less costly generic drugs used before admission), optimizing pharmacotherapy (eg, discontinuing unnecessary laxative), and eliminating discrepancies (eg, restarting omitted preadmission <b>medication).</b> Because eliminating discrepancies does not represent real costs to society (before hospitalization, the patient was also using the <b>medication),</b> these <b>medication</b> costs {{were not included in}} the cost calculation. <b>Medication</b> costs at 1 month and 6 months after hospital discharge and the associated labor costs were assessed using descriptive statistics and scenario analyses. For the 6 -month extrapolation, only <b>medication</b> intended for chronic use was included. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-two patients were included. Correcting hospital formulary changes saved € 1. 63 /patient (exchange rate: EUR 1 = USD 1. 3443) in <b>medication</b> costs at 1 month after discharge and € 9. 79 at 6 months. Optimizing pharmacotherapy saved € 20. 13 /patient in <b>medication</b> costs at 1 month and € 86. 86 at 6 months. The associated labor costs for performing <b>medication</b> reconciliation were € 41. 04 /patient. <b>Medication</b> cost savings from correcting hospital formulary-induced changes and optimizing of pharmacotherapy (€ 96. 65 /patient) outweighed the labor costs at 6 months extrapolation by € 55. 62 /patient (sensitivity analysis € 37. 25 - 71. 10). CONCLUSIONS: Preventing <b>medication</b> errors through <b>medication</b> reconciliation results in higher benefits than the costs related to the net time investment...|$|R
40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore {{the effects of}} introducing an electronic <b>medication</b> management system on reported <b>medication</b> errors. Background Computerised <b>medication</b> management systems {{have been found to}} improve <b>medication</b> safety; however, introducing <b>medication</b> management system into healthcare environments can create unanticipated or new problems and opportunities for <b>medication</b> error. Design Descriptive analysis of <b>medication</b> error reports. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 359 incident reports drawn from the period of 1 May 2005 – 30 April 2006 across two hospital sites of a single not-for-profit private health service located in metropolitan Melbourne. Site A used a conventional pen and paper system for <b>medication</b> management, and Site B had introduced a computerised <b>medication</b> management system. Results Most <b>medication</b> errors occurred at the nurse administration (71 · 5 %) and prescribing (16 · 4 %) stages of delivery. The most common <b>medication</b> error type reported at Site A was omission (33 %), and at Site B was wrong documentation (24 · 2 %). A higher proportion of errors at the prescribing phase, and less nurse administration errors, were detected at Site B where the <b>medication</b> management system was in use. The incidence of other, less frequent errors was similar across the two hospital sites. Conclusions This examination of <b>medication</b> error reports suggests there are differences in the types of <b>medication</b> errors that are reported in association with the introduction of electronic <b>medication</b> management system compared to pen and paper system systems. The findings provide a new insight into the effects of introducing an electronic <b>medication</b> management system on the types of <b>medication</b> errors reported. Relevance to clinical practice The findings provide a new insight into the types of <b>medication</b> errors that are reported during implementation of an electronic <b>medication</b> management system.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} factors that may explain variance in adherence to <b>medication</b> in stroke patients. Design. A qualitative comparison of high and low adherers to <b>medication.</b> Methods. Thirteen participants, selected from a sample of 180 stroke survivors because they self-reported the lowest adherence to <b>medication</b> regimes, were matched with 13 reporting maximal adherence. All took part in semi-structured qualitative interviews. Results. Thematic analysis revealed that those with poor adherence to <b>medication</b> reported both intentional and non-intentional non-adherence. Two main themes emerged: the importance of stability of a <b>medication</b> routine and beliefs about <b>medication</b> and treatment. High adherers reported remembering to take their <b>medication</b> and seeking support from both family and health professionals. They also had a realistic understanding of the consequences of non-adherence, and believed their medicine did them more good than harm. Low adherers reported forgetting their <b>medication,</b> sometimes intentionally not taking their <b>medication</b> and receiving poor support from medical staff. They disliked taking their <b>medication,</b> had limited knowledge about the <b>medication</b> rationale or intentions, and often disputed its benefits. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that appropriate <b>medication</b> and illness beliefs coupled with a stable <b>medication</b> routine are helpful in achieving optimal <b>medication</b> adherence in stroke patients. Interventions designed to target both intentional and non-intentional adherence may help maximize <b>medication</b> adherence in stroke patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether a <b>Medication</b> Report also can reduce the number of patients with clinical outcomes due to <b>medication</b> errors. Method A prospective intervention study with retrospective controls on patients at three departments at Lund University Hospital, Sweden that where transferred to primary care. The intervention group, where patients received a <b>Medication</b> Report at discharge, was compared with a control group with patients of the same age, who were not given a <b>Medication</b> Report when discharged from the same ward one year earlier. For patients with at least one <b>medication</b> error all contacts with hospital or primary care within 3 months after discharge were identified. For each contact it was evaluated whether this was caused by the <b>medication</b> error. We also compared <b>medication</b> errors that have been evaluated as high or moderate clinical risk with <b>medication</b> errors without clinical risk. Main outcome measures Need for medical care in hospital or primary care within three months after discharge from hospital. Medical care is readmission to hospital as well as visits of study population to primary and out-patient secondary health care. Results The use of <b>Medication</b> Report reduced the need for medical care due to <b>medication</b> errors. Of the patients with <b>Medication</b> Report 11 out of 248 (4. 4 %) needed medical care because of <b>medication</b> errors compared with 16 out of 179 (8. 9 %) of patients without <b>Medication</b> Report (p = 0. 049).
