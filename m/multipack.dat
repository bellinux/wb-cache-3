The game was originally {{planned to be}} released in September 1992, but got delayed two months to November 1992. It was the first adventure game by Core Design as well {{as one of the first}} CD-ROM adventure games. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC CD-ROM drives in 1993.

40|$|A vertex subset M of a graph G is a <b>multipacking</b> if {{for each}} vertex v, and each {{positive}} integer s {{less than or}} equal to the diameter of G, v is within distance s of at most s vertices of M. The <b>multipacking</b> number of a graph is the maximum cardinality of a <b>multipacking</b> of G. A generalization of 2 -packings, multipackings offer interesting insight into the minimum cost broadcast domination problem. This paper surveys recent results in the study of multipackings, including the equality of the <b>multipacking</b> number and broadcast number in trees, an extension of Farber's Algorithm for finding dominating sets and 2 -packings of strongly chordal graphs, and some early results on fractional multipackings. The paper closes with a series of in-depth examples of the various algorithms presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis The issues of the trade with Fair Trade products is a proposal of stratified offer for sales support of Fair Trade products. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part describes the basic issues of Fair Trade and is focused on one of the fair trade products - coffee. The practical part concentrates on the drugstore dm drogerie and is mainly based on a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire survey revealed that randomly selected respondents are mostly unaware of Fair Trade products, and if they do know them, they can be further divided into two groups: those who buy them and those who do not. The ones who buy them spend approximately 100 CZK per month and the ones who do not buy these products stated that the main reason for not doing so was the misnomer in stores. Based on the results, a proposal for sales support for the entire Pardubický region was presented, together with the drugstore dm drogerie, using the tools for sales support such as leaflets, <b>multipacks,</b> bonuses, advertisement and much more...|$|R
40|$|Given two graphs G and H, a (G,H) -multidecomposition of K_n is a {{partition}} of {{the edges of}} K_n into copies of G and H such {{that at least one}} copy of each is used. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of (C_ 6,C_ 6) -multidecomposition of K_n where C_ 6 denotes a cycle of length 6 and C_ 6 denotes the complement of C_ 6. A (G,H) -multipacking of K_n is a {{partition of}} a subset of the edges of K_n into copies of G and H such that at least one copy of each is used. The set consisting of the edges of K_n that are not used in any copy of either G or H is called the leave of the <b>multipacking.</b> A (G,H) -multipacking of K_n is called maximum if the cardinality of the leave is minimum with respect to all (G,H) -multipackings of K_n.

A (G,H) -multicovering is called minimum if the cardinality of the padding is minimum with respect to all (G,H) -multicoverings of K_n.
