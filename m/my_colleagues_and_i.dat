The time scale of the model is suitable for storm events to seasonal changes, currently up to one year period. The model is very stable and is capable of handling complicated topographies including inlets and irregularly-shaped structures such as curved jetties and breakwaters. The purpose of three-dimensional models is to predict the change of bottom topography from the spatial distribution of the sediment transport rates, which are evaluated from the nearshore wave and current fields computed point by point in small areas defined by a horizontal grid placed over the region of interest. Models of 3 -D beach topography change require much fewer idealizations than do the line models. (Document has 43 pages.) ...|$|R
2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI.

[...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E

6000|$|... [377] {338}While I {{was in the}} {{sub-committee}} of Drury Lane Theatre, I can {{vouch for}} <b>my</b> <b>colleagues,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope for myself, that we did our best {{to bring back the}} legitimate drama. I tried what I could to get De Montford revived, but in vain, and equally in vain in favour of Sotheby's Ivan, which was thought an acting play; and I endeavoured also to wake Mr. Coleridge to write us a tragedy[A]. Those who are not in the secret will hardly believe that the School for Scandal is the play which has brought the least money, averaging the number of times it has been acted since its production; so Manager Dibdin assured me. Of what has occurred since Maturin's Bertram I am not aware[B]; so that I may be traducing, through ignorance, some excellent new writers; if so, I beg their pardon. I have been absent from England nearly five years, and, till last year, I never read an English newspaper since my departure, and am now only aware of theatrical matters through the medium of the Parisian Gazette of Galignani, and only for the last twelve months. Let me, then, deprecate all offence to tragic or comic writers, to whom I wish well, and of whom I know nothing. The long complaints of the actual state of the drama arise, however, from no fault of the performers. I can conceive nothing better than Kemble, Cooke, and Kean, in their very different manners, or than Elliston in Gentleman's comedy, and in some parts of tragedy. Miss O'Neill[C] I never saw, having made and kept a determination to see nothing which should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons. Siddons and Kemble were the ideal of tragic action; I never saw anything at all resembling them, even in person; for this reason, we shall never see again Coriolanus or Macbeth. When Kean is blamed for want of dignity, we should remember that it is a grace, not an art, and not to be attained by study. In all, not super-natural parts, he is perfect; even his very defects belong, or seem to belong, to the parts themselves, and appear truer to nature. But of Kemble we may say, with reference to his acting, what the Cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose, [...] "that he was the only man he ever saw who reminded him of the heroes of Plutarch."[D] ...|$|E

As reading teachers, we strive to capitalize on that moment. We decided to combine our efforts as we attempted to improve our reading instruction for the fifth through eighth grade students at Sauganash School. Our inquiry stems from the desire to better understand what students think about while they read and what meaning they create as a result of that interaction. Through the use of reading journals, it has been our observation that we gai...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} article discussing {{the politics of}} language in Australian Indigenous Studies teaching <b>and</b> learning contexts, <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> stated our objective in writing that article was to ‘‘instill’’ {{a sense of the}} importance of the political nature of language to our student body (McGloin and Carlson 2013). We wanted to engage students in the idea that language, as a conduit for describing the world, is not a neutral channel for its portrayal or depiction; rather, that it is a political device that is often a contributing force to racism and the perpetuation of colonial violence. While reviews of the article were favorable to, and enthusiastic about its aims and content, and some suggestions for refinement helpful, one of the reviewer’s comments presented a quandary: we were advised to replace the word instill (as in the above context) with develop, a term considered ‘‘less invasive. ’’ In stating that our aim was to develop a sense of the importance of language, we were advised, our article would better ‘‘recognise the varying trajectories of student learning. ’’ After much consideration, we declined this suggestion contending that the word instill fit the aims of the article in that were introducing a practice that would inculcate the importance of language in Indigenous contexts...|$|R

40|$|Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and its wild progenitor, {{teosinte}} (Z. mays ssp. parviglumis) differ {{dramatically in}} inflorescence and plant architecture {{despite the fact}} that their evolutionary divergence occurred within the past 10, 000 years or less. To elucidate the genetic control of the morphological differences between maize <b>and</b> teosinte, <b>my</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> employed quantitative trait locus mapping with molecular markers. Results indicated that most of the variation in plant and inflorescence morphology between maize and teosinte can be explained by five restricted regions of the genome. In this paper, characterization of three of these regions and their effects on plant and inflorescence development will be discussed. Each of these regions appears to contain a single major locus of large effect. One of these loci, teosinte branched 1, largely controls the difference in plant architecture. Another, teosinte glume architecture 1, controls the formation of the teosinte cupulate fruitcase that encases the kernel. A third candidate, terminal ear 1, is hypothesized to control internode elongation within the inflorescence. In addition to their main effects, each locus appears to have pleiotropic effects on other traits. Genetic analyses also demonstrate that some of these loci exhibit epistatic interactions. The results suggest that mutations at a small number (five) of regulatory loci may have been the initial steps in the domestication of maize, supporting a model for maize evolution proposed by George Beadle in 1939...|$|R
