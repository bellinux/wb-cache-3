By November 1927, the forces of Sultan Osman Mahamuud of the Majeerteen Sultanate were also defeated. The Dubats colonial troops and the Zaptié gendarmerie were extensively used by De Vecchi during these military campaigns. However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.|$|E

500|$|Dorsetshire was {{deployed}} in November, {{to join the}} search for the German commerce raider , that had been attacking Allied shipping off the coast of Africa. Admiral Algernon Willis formed Task Force 3, with Dorsetshire and [...] to patrol likely refuelling locations for Atlantis. On 1 December, Dorsetshire intercepted the German supply ship Python, based on Ultra intelligence. The German ship was refuelling a pair of U-boats—U-A and U-68—in the South Atlantic. The U-boats dived while Python tried to flee. U-A fired five torpedoes at Dorsetshire but all missed her due to her evasive manoeuvres. Dorsetshire fired a salvo to stop Python and the latter's crew abandoned the ship, after detonating scuttling charges. Dorsetshire left the Germans in their boats, since the U-boats still presented too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> for the British to pick up the Germans.|$|E
500|$|Hualālai is {{expected}} to erupt again in the near future, as a 200–300year estimated pause in activity {{is coming to an}} end. This presents a distinct hazard to the communities around it as well; for example, {{in the event of an}} eruption similar to the 1801 event, Kailua-Kona, which is [...] from the volcano's summit, could be covered completely in a matter of hours. According to the USGS Lava Flow Hazard Zones, on a scale of 1 to 9, all of Hualālai is listed as threat level 4. For comparison, almost all of Kīlauea and Mauna Loa is listed as threat levels 1 through 3. The flanks of the volcano do not pose a lower threat to the population than the area near the rift zones because the distance is short and the slopes are steep; lava poses as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> as it does near its source.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur's Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Richard K.

There was debate over how <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> the Japanese base at Kavieng was. Nimitz felt {{that as a result}} of the Battle of Eniwetok, Truk itself would soon be under constant attack and the flow of aircraft to Rabaul would be cut off. On 12 March, orders went out to MacArthur and Nimitz canceling Operation FOREARM [...] and ordering them to [...] "complete the isolation of the Rabaul-Kavieng area with the minimum commitment of forces". In the opinion of the commander of the South Pacific Area, Admiral William Halsey, Jr., [...] "the geography of the area begged for another bypass". On receipt of orders from MacArthur revoking plans for Kavieng and ordering him to occupy Emirau, Halsey ordered the commander of the III Amphibious Force, Rear Admiral Theodore S.

30|$|Perhaps {{the only}} {{limitation}} arose in achieving such performance resemblances is the inevitable derivation of large length binary string per user when high entropy strength is desired by a system. As shown in Figure 3 Ia, IIa, bitstring {{that is at}} least four times longer than the entropy is needed to offer 222 - and 224 -bit entropy respectively, while bit string that is at least six times longer is required to fulfil a 285 - and 288 -bit system-specific entropy respectively. Indeed, these amounts of binary bits pose high processing challenges to the system capability. However, with the current state of technology advancement, it is expected that processing these binary strings would not raise so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> critical <b>threat</b> to the current systems.|$|R

500|$|Like {{many animals}} that evolved in {{isolation}} from significant predators, the dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors. Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships' provisions, archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones {{of at least two}} dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century, which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius (an area of [...] ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats were perhaps not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the nests, since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs.|$|E

He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at [...] "half pace". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, {{and a lack of}} adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976–77. Following relegation he formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978–79 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were [...] "boring", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> for him.|$|E

50|$|As {{multiple}} virgin queens {{approach the}} age of reproductive success, they begin to accumulate the reddish-brown pigmentation associated with adult members. At this time, male workers will begin individually courting them on the layers of wax on the comb or on the comb itself. Courting occurs {{in the form of}} buccal contact between the males and females through a lateral hole in the thorax of the female. Some virgin queens will begin manipulating the cerumen (wax) layers in preparation for the construction of brood cells by the workers. If the physogastric queen deems a virgin queen is too <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sexual <b>threat,</b> it may be imprisoned in a specialized cell in groups of one to five along with one or two worker bees. This is done in order to limit interference to the cell provisioning and oviposition processes of the physogastric queen.|$|R

Multilayered, networked governance is a reality and is <b>much</b> less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to viable states than might be imagined.

50|$|Public {{morality}} {{often means}} regulation of sexual matters, including prostitution and homosexuality, but also matters of dress and nudity, pornography, acceptability in social terms of cohabitation before marriage, {{and the protection}} of children. It is a main justification for censorship; it can lead to campaigns against profanity, and so be at odds with freedom of speech. Gambling is generally controlled: casinos have been considered <b>much</b> more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> than large-scale lotteries or football pools. Public drunkenness is quite unacceptable in some societies, and legal control of consumption of alcohol is often justified in terms of public morality, just as much as for medical reasons or to limit alcohol-related crime. Drug legislation, historically speaking, has sometimes followed on similar reasoning. Abortion is sometimes treated as <b>an</b> aspect <b>of</b> public morality, even if it is legally defined, regulated by medical professionals, and almost entirely hidden from public view. AIDS as a health policy issue is linked to public morality in a complicated manner.|$|R

2500|$|Everett Ferguson {{states that}} the charges against Christians by Pliny may have been partly based on the [...] "secret crimes" [...] {{associated}} with Christianity, later characterized by Athenagoras as atheism, cannibalistic feasts and incest. The cannibalistic feasts and incest charges were based on misunderstanding of the Eucharistic act and Christians being [...] "brothers and sisters", even after marriage. However, the charge of atheism related to the failure to worship the state gods, and made Christianity a superstition and not a religion. George Heyman {{states that the}} refusal of Christians to participate in sacrificial rituals that honored the emperor and instead follow their own sacrificial rhetoric and practices conflicted with the Roman forms of social control, making them an undesirable minority. Ferguson states that Pliny viewed the obstinacy (contumacia) of Christians as <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Roman rule and order as the divergence of their beliefs from the Romans; and considered Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition.|$|E
