6000|$|... 'Gentlemen,' {{returned}} Dick, 'I thank you. Anybody in {{the helpless}} state {{that you see}} me in, is naturally anxious. Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent--excellent. I {{only wish}} there were more of it," [...] he chirruped. [...] "Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt.</b> <b>You</b> {{were just going to}} hand over to someone, weren't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Rigby,' {{said the}} Duke, 'pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you.</b> Unhappily, {{there is no}} doubt Lord Spencer is dead, for I am one of his executors.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must excuse <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> Mrs. Tulliver; I have {{business}} {{that must be}} attended to; and I think {{there is nothing more}} necessary to be said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow <b>me</b> to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Mason. I {{think it}} will be better that you should hear me before you commit {{yourself}} to any expression as to your relative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure. And I know that's what you're {{here for}} now. Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you.</b> It's a mighty hard job, finding that letter, and the folks'll be back by and by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, there are," [...] Ezra Girdlestone remarked, {{coming into}} the room. He had been {{standing}} between the two doors {{which led to the}} counting-house, and had overheard the latter portion of the conversation. [...] "Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you.</b> You were saying that you would blacken my father's character unless he increased your salary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Mr.--" [...] {{she was at}} a loss, as usual, for the name, and Katharine {{thought that}} she did not {{recognize}} him. [...] "I hope you've found something nice to read," [...] she added, pointing to the book upon the table. [...] "Byron--ah, Byron. I've known people who knew Lord Byron," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> but allow <b>me</b> {{to suggest}} that any further remarks {{you may have to}} make on the subject had better be made to my friend, Major Macdonnel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> my dear fellow," [...] he said. [...] "We {{are having}} our coffee outside, {{just on the}} left there. Miss Thorpe-Hatton wants you to stop {{for a moment on}} your way out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] I <b>interrupted,</b> [...] "excuse <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> but how {{has this}} been brought about? The {{obstacles}} you told me of on Saturday appeared even {{to me to be}} quite insurmountable; how has it been contrived?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! our worthy Moody. How well he wears! Not a {{gray hair}} on his head--and look at mine! What dye do you use, Moody? If he had my open {{disposition}} he would tell. As it is, he looks unutterable things, and holds his tongue. Ah! if I could only have held my tongue--when I was in the diplomatic service, you know--what a position I might have occupied by this time! Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Moody, if {{you have anything to}} say to Lady Lydiard." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{entering}} his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the Mayor walked {{on through the}} tunnel-shaped passage into the garden, and thence {{by the back door}} towards the stores and granaries. A light shone from the office-window, and there being no blind to screen the interior Henchard could see Donald Farfrae still seated where he had left him, initiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling the books. Henchard entered, merely observing, [...] "Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> if ye will stay so late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> fellows," [...] he said, flinging a log {{upon his}} horse, and dashing his saw gaily into it. [...] "Don't mind me! I know {{you hate to}} lose a minute of this fun; I {{understand}} just {{how you feel about}} it, and I don't want you to stand upon ceremony with me. Treat me just like one of yourselves, gents. This beech- wood is the regular Nova Scotia thing, ain't it? Tough and knotty! I can't bear any of your cheap wood-lot stuff from around here. What I want is Nova Scotia wood, every time. Then I feel that I'm gettin' the worth of my money." [...] His log dropped apart on each side of his horse, and he put on another. [...] "Well, mates," [...] he rattled on, [...] "this is lovely, ain't it? I wouldn't give up my little quarter of a cord of green Nova Scotia before breakfast for anything; I've got into the way of it, and I can't live without it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> {{but it is}} very {{important}} that I should understand the position exactly before you go farther. Whatever this matter may be of which you are about to tell me, do I understand that it was one entirely between Miss Hawtrey and yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive <b>me</b> that I <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> my liege," [...] said Nigel, placing himself {{between the}} king and his steed; [...] "hear me but a moment!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Edie," [...] I said, laying {{powerful}} restraint on myself, {{and looking}} her calmly in the face, [...] "you must {{bear with me}} to-night. You know that weakness sometimes causes men to act unaccountably. Forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you.</b> I won't do it again, as the naughty boys say.--Go on, dear, with your story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow <b>me</b> to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you</b> for one moment, Smith," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, who had been {{listening}} attentively to my words. [...] "We understood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity you should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can you explain to us {{what you mean by}} dressing in accordance with the fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit <b>me</b> here to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> mother. Whatever you {{may have}} seen in me; she,--I mean Lucy,--has never been in the {{slightest}} hurry to be married;--that's all. But I shall regard it as a lapsus-lingua in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> black villain! Can't you {{see that}} if Hester's father is a Bagnio slave {{there is no chance}} of her having found refuge with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, nobody, nobody!' said Mrs Gowan. 'I {{was going}} to say--but you put <b>me</b> out. <b>You</b> <b>interrupting</b> Papa, what was I going to say?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Instead of {{instantly}} leaping {{into his}} chair and cheering himself hoarse, as the Brotherhood in public meeting assembled would infallibly have done on this cue, Mr. Crisparkle merely reversed the quiet crossing of his legs, and said mildly: ‘Don’t let <b>me</b> <b>interrupt</b> your explanation—when <b>you</b> begin it.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> madam," [...] cried Mr. Collins; [...] "but if she {{is really}} headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would {{altogether}} be a very desirable wife {{to a man in}} my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, forgive <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> {{but you are}} not {{shooting}} at those wood-pigeons in the right way. Although they seem to hover just before they settle, they are dropping much faster than you think. Your keeper was mistaken when he said that you knocked a feather out of the tail of that last bird at which you fired two barrels. In both cases you shot at least a foot above it, and what fell was a leaf from the ilex tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Milly, I {{said the}} cliffs laughed; but don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> naughty child! Well, I {{was going to}} tell you that my heart {{softened}} a little towards the young man, for, as you know, I am not naturally unforgiving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. He was too gentle a jailer for the Council. They {{have given}} her Sir Amias Paulett, a mere Puritan and Leicestrian, who is as hard as the nether millstone, and well-nigh as dull," [...] said Babington, with a little {{significant}} chuckle, which perhaps alarmed one of his companions, a small slight man with a slight halt, clad in black like a lawyer. [...] "Mr. Babington," [...] he said, [...] "pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> but we shall make Mr. Gage tarry supper for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oldbuck's {{anathema}} {{against the}} preposition but was internally echoed by Lovel. [...] "Forgive <b>me</b> if I <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Miss Wardour; {{you need not}} fear my intruding upon a subject where I have been already severely repressed;--but do not add to the severity of repelling my sentiments the rigour of obliging me to disavow them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me.</b> Have <b>you</b> told Horace Holmcroft what {{my letter}} {{positively}} forbade you to communicate, either {{to him or}} to any living creature? I want no protestations and excuses. Answer me instantly, and answer in one word--Yes, or No." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very {{superior}} dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let <b>me</b> not <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I'm {{more careful}} of what I eat," [...] replied the Sea Serpent. [...] "But I was saying when Trot <b>interrupted</b> <b>me,</b> that <b>you</b> all belong to me, because I have saved your lives. By {{the law of}} the ocean, you must obey me in everything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ian Restil, a 15-year-old {{computer}} hacker {{who looks like}} an even more adolescent version of Bill Gates, is throwing a tantrum. [...] "I want more money. I want a Miata. I want a trip to Disney World. I want X-Men comic book number one. I want a lifetime subscription to Playboy—and throw in Penthouse. Show me the money! Show me the money! ..."Across the table, executives from a California software firm called Jukt Micronics are listening and trying ever so delicately to oblige. [...] "Excuse me, sir," [...] one of the suits says tentatively to the pimply teenager. [...] "Excuse me. Pardon <b>me</b> for <b>interrupting</b> <b>you,</b> sir. We can arrange more money for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon meeting Premier Li Peng for {{the first}} time in May 1989, in an {{encounter}} recorded on national television, Wu'er Kaixi interrupted Li during his introduction, saying [...] "I understand it is quite rude of <b>me</b> to <b>interrupt</b> <b>you,</b> Premier, but there are people sitting out there in the square, being hungry, as we sit here and exchange pleasantries. We are only here to discuss concrete matters, sir." [...] After being interrupted by Li, who said that he was being somewhat impolite, Wu'er Kaixi continued. [...] "Sir, you said you are here late of traffic congestion... we've actually been calling you to talk to us since 22 April. It's not that you are late, it's that you're here too late. But that's fine. It's good that you are able to come here at all ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your <b>interrupting</b> <b>me</b> before <b>you</b> {{heard all}} I {{had to say}} proves you to be too hasty, sister," [...] said Gudrid, with a playful laugh. [...] "I was about to add that it seems we have come here rather early in the spring. Who knows but the land may wear a prettier dress when the mantle of winter is gone? Even Greenland looks green and bright in summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a very}} {{interesting}} little incident, Fan," [...] said Katie with delight when they were alone; [...] "quite a romancelet of real life. Let me see; here is a poor boy--the boy who deceived us, you remember--whom bad companions are trying to decoy into the wicked meshes of their dreadful net, and a sweet young girl, a sort of guardian angel as it were, comes to me and asks my aid to save the boy, and have him sent to sea. Isn't it delightful? Quite the ground-work of a tale--and might be so nicely illustrated," [...] added Katie, glancing at her drawings. [...] "But forgive <b>me,</b> Fan; I <b>interrupted</b> <b>you.</b> What were you going to tell me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you'll be saying to {{yourself}} the moment my back is turned. You'll be {{calling me a}} stage heavy father and an old snob {{and a number of}} other things. Don't <b>interrupt</b> <b>me,</b> dammit! <b>You</b> will, I tell you! And you'll be wrong. I don't think the Marshmoretons are fenced off from the rest of the world by some sort of divinity. My sister does. Percy does. But Percy's an ass! If ever you find yourself thinking differently from my son Percy, on any subject, congratulate yourself. You'll be right." ...|$|R
