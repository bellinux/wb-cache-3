40|$|Reasons {{for lack}} of {{hydrological}} studies in mountainous regions are: absence of hydrological measurements {{and the fact that}} measurements were not continuous.

We review the issue, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>well</b> studied networks where the coefficient is insufficient in the task of describing their local topology. Motivated by this, we present an extension, the clustering profile, following with three applications that illustrate the relevance of this more complete and robust measure of clustering. It gives us a fresh perspective of networks that have been extensively studied, shedding {{new light on the}} small-world effect and providing means to compare different mechanisms of cluster formation. We stress its use to better differentiate and understand network growth processes, in particular to provide stringent constraints on theoretical growth models...|$|R

40|$|Imaging {{has played}} a central role in gauging the {{potential}} therapeutic effects of cellular therapies in cardiovascular medicine. In earlier studies, left ventriculography was used as the means of evaluation of the global myocardial function. 1 Although this modality had its benefits with convenience and availability, the method does not allow for sufficient global ventricular cavity reconstruction because it only allows one to measure the ventricle in 2 planes. Some earlier transition to 2 -dimensional echocardiography was made in clinical trials 2; however, cardiac MRI soon became the gold standard modali-ty to image patients undergoing cellular therapy in clinical tri-als. The fact that the modality not only allows for very precise global and regional function but also very effectively measures what we consider fibrotic or scar burden made it the obvious front-runner. Subsequent studies bore this <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>well.</b> 3, 4 In fact, therapies that had a great deal of promise in earlier stage...|$|R
