5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal, {{also known}} as white metal, Jesus <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> heavenly metal, {{is a form of}} heavy metal music usually defined by its message using song lyrics as well as the {{dedication}} of the band members to Christianity.

5|$|Heavy <b>metal</b> (<b>or</b> simply metal) is a {{genre of}} rock music that {{developed}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.|$|E
5|$|Silver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily {{formed from}} its {{constituent}} elements {{and is the}} cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.|$|E

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E
5|$|Barium, as a <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> when alloyed with aluminium, is used {{to remove}} {{unwanted}} gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the <b>metal,</b> <b>or</b> through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing <b>metal,</b> <b>or</b> working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E
5|$|Military squads can be {{assigned}} to a barracks to train in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be directly commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows {{can be made for}} ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas can be made to train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing mechanisms and using <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or cages. More complex lever-operated and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available.|$|E

In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> wood are used. The alternative to using simulated weapons is to pause role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5|$|The barite {{reserves}} are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion tonnes.

Barite production has risen since {{the second half of}} the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).|$|E
5|$|The modern event sees athletes {{run down}} {{a strip of}} track, plant the pole in the metal box, and vault over the {{horizontal}} bar before {{letting go of the}} pole and falling backwards onto the landing mattress. While earlier versions used wooden, <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> bamboo, modern poles are generally made from artificial materials such as fibreglass or carbon fibre. The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships. The first women's Olympic pole vaulting competition occurred in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
5|$|While every {{implementation}} of each kind of ALF is different, the vapor cell in each is relatively similar. The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important {{qualities of the}} filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let {{into and out of}} this vapor chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride. The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material, though generally a heat-resistant <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> ceramic is used as the vapor is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100°C.|$|E
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered <b>metal</b> <b>or</b> plastic tag to the leg or wing of a {{wild bird}} to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
