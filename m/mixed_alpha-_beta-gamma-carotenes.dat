40|$|BackgroundTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} pretreatment with the <b>mixed</b> <b>alpha-</b> and beta-adrenergic blocker, labetalol, on blood pressure instability during surgical resection of pheochromocytoma. MethodsBlood pressure stability and surgical results were compared between patients in the saline (n = 11) and labetalol (n = 15) groups. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, sodium thiopental and atracurium, and maintained with isoflurane in a 50 % oxygen/nitrous oxide mixture. Intravenous labetalol was administered in the labetalol group before surgical incision, with the maximal dose being 1. 2 mg/kg, while normal saline was administered to patients in the control, saline, group. Supplemental intravenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP) infusion was administered whenever systolic blood pressure exceeded 180 mmHg. The number of patients with intraoperative hypertension or hypotension, dosage of SNP administered, number of intraoperative hypertension episodes, use of fluid and blood transfusion, and heart rate (defined as the mean of heart rate every 5 minutes throughout the operation) were compared between these two groups. ResultsThe number of patients with intraoperative hypertension, number of patients receiving SNP, dose of SNP administered, and number of hypertension episodes were significantly lower in patients who received labetalol pretreatment than in control patients. ConclusionThis study has demonstrated that labetalol pretreatment (1. 2 mg/kg) with supplemental SNP provides more favorable blood pressure control during surgical resection of pheochromocytoma than with SNP alone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Methods of first-principles {{computer}} simulation {{have been used}} to calculate the magnetic moments at the component atoms and the energies of mixing in disordered substitutional fcc and bcc solid solutions of manganese in iron. It has been established that the energies of <b>mixing</b> in <b>alpha-</b> and gammasolid solutions have not only different magnitudes but even different signs. It is shown that in alpha- solid solutions there is a thermodynamic anomaly at a manganese concentration of approximately 1. 5 at. %, namely, a change in the concentration dependence of the energy of mixing caused by a reorientation of magnetic moments at manganese atoms. With increasing Mn content in dilute solutions, there occurs a continuous variation of the orientation of magnetic moments of manganese atoms from strictly antiparallel with respect to the ferromagnetic iron matrix to predominantly parallel one.

Both tasks elicited significant increases in sIgA secretion rate, reflecting increases in both salivary volume and sIgA concentration. Whereas mental arithmetic elicited a <b>mixed</b> pattern of <b>alpha-</b> and beta-adrenergic cardiovascular reactions, the pattern of reactions to cold pressor was predominantly alpha-adrenergic.

40|$|Clonidine is a <b>mixed</b> <b>alpha-</b> 2 /alpha- 1 {{adrenoceptor}} agonist. It reduces {{sympathetic and}} increases parasympathetic tone {{which results in}} a lowering of the baseline blood pressure and heart rate. Descending posjunctional noradrenergic antinociceptive pathways originating in the brainstem are believed to contribute to pain control of both nociceptive and neuropathic origin after clonidine challenge. The sedative effect of clonidine is due to alpha- 2 adrenoceptor stimulation in the locus coeruleus. In adults, oral clonidine provides preoperative sedation, increases perioperative haemodynamic stability, reduces the requirements of volatile anaesthetic requirements, and attenuates the stress response secondary to intubation. A pure analgesic effect is seen after both systemic and neuraxial administration. In paediatric anaesthesia similar beneficial effects have been observed. To provide safe and effective use of clonidine in children further studies delineating its specific pharmacokinetic and haemodynamic characteristics are needed, despite its recently increased clinical use. Randomised controlled trials comparing the clinical use of clonidine as a premedicant drug to the currently widely used premedicant gold standard represented by midazolam are warranted. The primary aims of this dissertation were to describe the pharmacokinetics after different routes of administrations and delineate the intraoperative haemodynamic profile. The magnitude of the stress-response caused by endotracheal intubation with special emphasis on the Neuropeptide Y response was compared after premedication with low-dose clonidine and rnidazolam. The postoperative analgesic and sedative effects of clonidine after epidural co-administration together with bupivacaine has also been evaluated. The influence of epidural co-infusion of clonidine and ropivacaine on postoperative blood pressure variability was furthermore investigated. Effects on postoperative analgesia, sedation, delirium shivering and postoperative vomiting after premedication with clonidine and midazolam were compared. Clonidine analysis was made by radioimmunoassay. NPY was analysed with a competitive radioimmunoassay. Postoperative analgesia was assessed by Objective Pain Scale and sedation was assessed by the Vancouver Sedative Recovery Scale. A new statistical procedure for calculations of bioavailability from two independent populations was introduced. Parental preferences were assessed using a written questionnaire. In total 238 children, age 1 - 10 years, were included in seven different studies. The haemodynamic response after clonidine administration was moderate and should be well tolerated in otherwise healthy children. Epidural clonidine improves blood pressure stability by reducing blood pressure variability. The pharmacokinetic profile after intravenous, rectal, and epidural administration were similar to that reported in adults. We therefore conclude {{that there are no}} pharmacokinetic or haemodynamic aspects contraindicating further use of clonidine in paediatric anaesthesia. The stress response after endotracheal intubation is of only moderate magnitude, as indicated by the lack of NPY release, and is not attenuated by low dose of clonidine. Rectal administration of clonidine was associated with a significant reduction of pain scores in the early postoperative period following adeno-tonsillectomy when compared to rectal midazolam. The analgesic effect seen after epidural and rectal clonidine cannot be explained by residual sedation alone. The use of clonidine is also associated with slightly increased sedation ratings during the first 24 postoperative hours compared to midazolam. However, this observation is in agreement unequivocal parental preference of a calm and sedated child during the early post- operative time period. Based on our own results, as well as data published by other research groups, we conclude that clonidine represents a useful pharmacological alternative in paediatric anaesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Macromolecular {{assemblies}} {{constitute the}} world in which we live. The work contained within this thesis has studied three different types of macromolecular assemblies: human gamma-crystallin protein aggregation, the synthesis of glutamic acid bottle brushes, and cross-linked hyaluronic acid hydrogels. The in vitro study of human lens gamma-crystallin protein aggregation is the main component of this thesis. Separate projects that aid the body of this work include a description for the synthesis of glutamic acid bottle brush macromolecules and novel cross-linked networks of hyaluronic acid hydrogels. Cataract is the number one cause of blindness worldwide. Despite being a widespread disease, the epidemiology of cataract is still largely unknown. Cataracts are protein aggregates consisting of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallin protein which are the major components of the lens in the human eye. In this work, in vitro investigations of protein-protein interactions were performed on dilute solutions of recombinant human alpha- and gamma-crystallin protein using dynamic light scattering technique. It was discovered that in phosphate buffered solutions, gamma-crystallin exists as two distinct populations of unaggregated and large aggregated protein. On the other hand, alpha-crystallin protein does not aggregate, but forms small oligomeric assemblies. Upon <b>mixing</b> <b>alpha-</b> and gamma-crystallin the aggregation of gamma-crystallin was removed. The impact of temperature, protein concentration, the reducing agent dithiothreitol, salt concentration, and pH on gamma-crystallin were all subsequently investigated. It was concluded that in vitro aggregation of gamma-crystallin protein arises from non-covalent electrostatic interactions. To further investigate the electrostatic hypothesis, point mutations were performed on human gamma-crystallin in an attempt to prevent protein aggregation. Using recombinant DNA technology, twelve different gammaS-crystallin protein mutants were created. The mutations were designed to change the proteins overall surface charge by substituting positively charged amino acids with neutral hydrophilic amino acids. The aggregation behavior of the mutant proteins was then studied by dynamic light scattering. It was observed that all gamma-crystallin mutants resulted in continued aggregation. The result suggests that the in vitro aggregation behavior of gamma-crystallin is likely due to electrostatic interactions between specific amino acids not probed in this work. Due to the time consuming nature of point mutations, chemical modifications of gamma-crystallin were subsequently performed in an alternative method to disrupt electrostatic interactions which are believed to cause gamma-crysatllin protein aggregation. GammaD- and GammaS-crystallin proteins were chemically modified with seven different molecules. Chemical modifications were characterized with a combination of mass spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results demonstrated that modifying positively charged amino acids of human gamma-crystallin protein with poly(ethylene) glycol prevented in vitro protein aggregation. The chemical modification of lens crystallin protein provides a possible route by which protein aggregation and ultimately cataract can be prevented, arrested or reversed. In a separate project, glutamic acid bottle brushes were synthesized for future translocation experiments. Translocation is viewed as a potential method by which genomic DNA can be sequenced. In an attempt to understand the effect of polymer diameter on translocation kinetics, bottle brush polymers with varying thicknesses were synthesized. The complex synthesis and subsequent characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic force microscopy, capillary electrophoresis, static and dynamic light scattering are described herein. In summary, glutamic acid bottle brushes of three different thicknesses were successfully synthesized, characterized, and purified. Finally, the novel synthesis of thiol cross-linked hyaluronic acid hydrogels is described. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide which is of interest for potential biomedical applications. The biopolymer was modified with cystamine and placed under reducing conditions which provides free thiol groups capable of crosslinking under oxidizing conditions. The synthesis, characterization, and gelation procedure for the cross-linked hyaluronic acid hydrogels is described in detail. The modified hyaluronic acid is a material capable of in situ gelation. ...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{resistance}} to different classes of insecticides is a potential threat to malaria control. With the increasing coverage of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets in Tanzania, the continued monitoring {{of resistance}} in vector populations is crucial. It may facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent or minimize the spread of resistance. In this study, metabolic-based mechanisms conferring permethrin (pyrethroid) resistance were investigated in Anopheles arabiensis of Lower Moshi, Kilimanjaro region of north-eastern Tanzania. WHO susceptibility test kits were used to detect resistance to permethrin in An. arabiensis. The levels and mechanisms of permethrin resistance were determined using CDC bottle bioassays and microplate (biochemical) assays. In bottle bioassays, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and s,s,s-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) were used as synergists to inhibit mixed function oxidases and non-specific esterases respectively. Biochemical assays were carried out in individual mosquitoes to detect any increase in the activity of enzymes typically involved in insecticide metabolism (<b>mixed</b> function oxidases, <b>alpha-</b> and beta-esterases). Anopheles arabiensis from the study area {{was found to be}} partially resistant to permethrin, giving only 87 % mortality in WHO test kits. Resistance ratios at KT 50 and KT 95 were 4. 0 and 4. 3 respectively. The permethrin resistance was partially synergized by DEF and by PBO when these were mixed with permethrin in bottle bioassays and was fully synergized when DEF and PBO were used together. The levels of oxidase and beta-esterase activity were significantly higher in An. arabiensis from Lower Moshi than in the laboratory susceptible strain. There was no difference in alpha-esterase activity between the two strains. Elevated levels of mixed function oxidases and beta-esterases play a role in detoxification of permethrin in the resistant An. arabiensis population of Lower Moshi...|$|R
