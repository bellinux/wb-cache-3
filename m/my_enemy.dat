He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says {{that he would have}} to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb-held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post-war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: [...] "It is easy. I find myself in Hitler's character because he fought against <b>my</b> <b>enemy.</b> The enemy of <b>my</b> <b>enemy</b> is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies." [...] About his physical similarity to Hitler, he says: [...] "I am not a dictator like him, but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him." ...|$|E

In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing. Warner Bros. agreed to co-finance A.I. and cover distribution duties. The film labored in development hell, and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989. Bob Shaw served as writer very briefly, leaving after six weeks because of Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, [...] "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired <b>my</b> <b>enemy</b> [...] instead." [...] Kubrick handed Watson The Adventures of Pinocchio for inspiration, calling A.I. [...] "a picaresque robot version of Pinocchio".|$|E

Unlike previous efforts The Day Is <b>My</b> <b>Enemy</b> became a band-album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett.
