50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of the knife}} switch are the slow opening speed and {{the proximity of the}} operator to exposed live parts. <b>Metal-enclosed</b> safety disconnect switches are used for isolation of circuits in industrial power distribution. Sometimes spring-loaded auxiliary blades are fitted which momentarily carry the full current during opening, then quickly part to rapidly extinguish the arc.|$|E
50|$|Outdoor, {{above-ground}} {{substation structures}} include wood pole, lattice metal tower, and tubular metal structures, although other variants are available. Where space is plentiful and {{appearance of the}} station is not a factor, steel lattice towers provide low-cost supports for transmission lines and apparatus. Low-profile substations may be specified in suburban areas where appearance is more critical. Indoor substations may be gas-insulated switchgear (at high voltages), or <b>metal-enclosed</b> or metal-clad switchgear at lower voltages. Urban and suburban indoor substations may be finished on the outside so as {{to blend in with}} other buildings in the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} central {{power stations}} used simple open knife switches, mounted on insulating panels of marble or asbestos. Power levels and voltages rapidly escalated, making opening manually operated switches {{too dangerous for}} anything other than isolation of a de-energized circuit. Oil-filled equipment allowed arc energy to be contained and safely controlled. By the early 20th century, a switchgear line-up would be a <b>metal-enclosed</b> structure with electrically operated switching elements, using oil circuit breakers. Today, oil-filled equipment has largely been replaced by air-blast, vacuum, or SF6 equipment, allowing large currents and power levels to be safely controlled by automatic equipment.|$|E

50|$|Switches, circuit breakers, {{transformers}} {{and other}} apparatus may be interconnected by air-insulated bare conductors strung on support structures. The air space required increases with system voltage {{and with the}} lightning surge voltage rating. For medium-voltage distribution substations, <b>metal-enclosed</b> switch gear may be used and no live conductors exposed at all. For higher voltages, gas-insulated switch gear reduces the space required around live bus. Instead of bare conductors, bus and apparatus are built into pressurized tubular containers filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas. This gas has a higher insulating value than air, allowing {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus to be reduced. In addition to air or SF6 gas, apparatus will use other insulation materials such as transformer oil, paper, porcelain, and polymer insulators.|$|E

Enclosures may include fixed and removable components and may be filled with fluid (liquid or gas) to provide insulation. This standard defines several types of metal enclosed switchgear and controlgear which differ due to - the consequences on network service continuity in case of maintenance on the switchgear and controlgear; - the need and convenience of maintenance of the equipment. For <b>metal-enclosed</b> switchgear and controlgear containing gas-filled compartments, the design pressure is limited to a maximum of 300 kPa (relative pressure). <b>Metal-enclosed</b> switchgear and controlgear for special use, for example, in flammable atmospheres, in mines or on board ships, may be subject to additional requirements. Components contained in <b>metal-enclosed</b> switchgear and controlgear are to be designed and tested in accordance with their various relevant standards. This standard supplements the standards for the individual components regarding their installation in switchgear and controlgear assemblies. This standard does not preclude that other equipment may be included in the same enclosure. In such a case, any possible influence of that equipment on the switchgear and controlgear is to be taken into account.

40|$|Internal arc fault {{tests are}} {{important}} for ensuring the safety of medium-voltage <b>metal-enclosed</b> switchgears. Since these tests are conducted at full scale, {{the costs of the}} test objects as well as the high-power laboratory are significant. This paper presents an experimental study to clarify whether such tests can be simplified by downscaling. Tests with volume and energy downscaled to 1 / 3 and 1 / 10, respectively, were performed on a single-phase arrangement with air as the insulating gas. The test results showed that the internal pressure rise caused by the arc can be reproduced well using a smaller compartment and lower current. The potential damage caused by the exhaust of the hot gas escaping through the pressure-relief openings is more challenging to predict from small-scale tests...|$|E
40|$|The arcing {{duration}} of a switching operation {{is a critical}} input parameter in condition-based switchgear monitoring algorithms. In this {{paper we propose a}} new non-intrusive method that directly measures the {{duration of}} the electrical arc discharge during current interruption in switchgear. The method relies on coupling of the VHF electric fields generated by the arc. The required hardware used for the measurement is simple and inexpensive, making the proposed methodology potentially commercially viable for application in monitoring systems. One significant complication of the measurement is the interference of co-existing arc signals in three-phase switchgear. We discuss this interference problem and show that a simple strategy based on shielding between phases may give satisfying results in the application to <b>metal-enclosed</b> three-phase switchgear...|$|E

In {{order to}} ensure power supply {{reliability}} and reduce a variety of power supply failure, we analyze the development status, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} partial discharge detection techniques about the various Gas-insulated <b>Metal-enclosed</b> Swith Gear (GIS).

According to the deficiency of the traditional ultra high frequency sensor, we developed a new window type of ultra high frequency sensor, and compared with conventional in vitro type UHF sensor. Experimental results show that that the window-type UHF sensor sensitivity and anti-jamming capability are superior to conventional high-frequency sensor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a partial discharge measurement system that utilises a multiplexed approach to ultra-high-frequency monitoring on many pieces of equipment using a single cable loop connected to only two sampling channels. It is envisioned that the system could be used in partial discharge monitoring of medium voltage <b>metal-enclosed</b> switchgear, or several power transformers within a distribution substation. Conventionally, ultra-high-frequency monitoring of high voltage systems has used an array of sensors installed on each unit to facilitate PD location within the unit. The proposed system allows multiple small units to be monitored simultaneously, thus potentially spreading the cost of the measurement hardware across many pieces of equipment. This capability comes at the expense of limiting the partial discharge location capability to a particular item of plant rather than to a specific location within it...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{desire to}} apply {{short-range}} wireless communication systems to telemetry sensor networks in a <b>metal-enclosed</b> chamber has prompted this study. This thesis {{will discuss the}} design of an infrared (IR) communication system for a wireless low-power, low-data- rate sensor network in a metal enclosure. This design requires an in-depth understanding {{of the environment and}} how IR will propagate in it. The metal enclosure o®ers the advantage of little background (ambient) lighting noise, which is the main noise source in IR communication. Also, due to the small dimensions of this enclosure, the non-line-of- sight (NLOS) communication will take advantage of the re°ected paths o® the walls. To improve system performance in this di®use NLOS communication environment, angular diversity will be employed and tested. It will be shown that these di®use re°ections are an advantage at low data rates ( 10 Mbps) due to inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by channel excess delay. All measurement results, including bit error rate (BER) versus transmitted power, will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} sensor {{presented in this}} paper is based on a microwave dielectric resonator, which uses alumina ceramic as a substrate to survive in harsh environments. The resonant frequency of the resonator is determined by the relative permittivity of the alumina ceramic, which monotonically changes with temperature. A rectangular aperture etched {{on the surface of the}} resonator works as both an incentive and a coupling device. A broadband slot antenna fed by a coplanar waveguide is utilized as an interrogation antenna to wirelessly detect the sensor signal using a radio-frequency backscattering technique. Theoretical analysis, software simulation, and experiments verified the feasibility of this temperature-sensing system. The sensor was tested in a <b>metal-enclosed</b> environment, which severely interferes with the extraction of the sensor signal. Therefore, frequency-domain compensation was introduced to filter the background noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor signal. The extracted peak frequency was found to monotonically shift from 2. 441 to 2. 291 GHz when the temperature was varied from 27 to 800 °C, leading to an average absolute sensitivity of 0. 19 MHz/°C...|$|E
40|$|Very fast overvoltages are {{characteristic}} of high-voltage <b>metal-enclosed</b> SF 6 insulated substations. During the transient phenomenon, on the SF 6 substation enclosure an undesired, short-lasting induced overvoltage may appear, which cannot be prevented easily. This induced overvoltage {{is connected to the}} amplitude, form and duration of an atmospheric overvoltage that enters the substation as a travelling wave, dielectric strength of the SF 6 gas and the geometry of the substation and its earthing. The objective of our research is to analyze the appearance of this undesired induced overvoltage on the substation enclosure. The above-mentioned phenomena can be examined by analyzing the results obtained through simulation. Due to the complexity of the equivalent electric model of a high-voltage SF 6 substation and the analytic interpretation of the transient phenomenon in such complex substation, it is difficult to precisely analyze the overvoltage on the substation enclosure. The simulation results encourage us to do further research. Computer simulations also allow examination of various influences that affect the observed phenomenon. However, a suitable simulation model is necessary for performing simulations. Literature sources often do not provide a simulation model with simulation program objects. Thus, this paper focuses on the manner of presenting a simulation model with objects in the ATP program...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Pulsed ultra-wideband (UWB) radio uses {{extremely}} short pulses {{to transmit}} information. Such pulses provide very fine timing information, {{which has led}} to technological advances in high-precision localization. This thesis investigates UWB localization strategies with a focus on receiver synchronization algorithms for time-difference-of-arrival localization to achieve centimeter accuracies in a 3 -dimensional space. The system that consists of a reference transmitter, several receivers each with a sampling module and a wireless local area network interface, and a computer to process the data and to run the localization algorithm is targeted for deployment in a dense-multipath environment [...] a <b>metal-enclosed</b> space with substantial amount of metallic objects inside it. An algorithm based on the existing reference broadcast synchronization with a coarse synchronization stage and a fine synchronization stage is developed for this application. Coarse synchronization synchronizes the clocks of the independently running receivers to within nanoseconds or tens of nanoseconds, and is implemented in an FPGA. The sampled data by all receivers are transmitted to a computer and then processed by a fine synchronization algorithm. This proposed algorithm is simulated in Matlab and Simulink. Major factors that may cause a synchronization error such as propagation delay and path overlap are modeled and included in this simulation model. In addition, challenges due to non-idealities of a practice environment are examined by implementing this algorithm in a properly working hardware. In particular, different sampling rates of all receivers are found to be a major issue that must be resolved. Different clock speeds affect both the coarse and the fine synchronization accuracies. Therefore, this thesis proposes a method that uses a reference signal with a stable pulse repetition frequency to overcome this issue...|$|E
