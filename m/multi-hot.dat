This three-dimensional (3 D) <b>multi-hot</b> spot decorated nanocomposite presents an {{as high as}} 108 Raman enhancement using Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) as the probe with the concentration down to 10 (- 10) M. The high density hot spots in a unit area and strong field intensity around each individual hot spot in 3 D layout {{are believed to be}} the major reasons for this high sensitivity Raman phenomenon, which is further proved by the theoretical simulation results. Given its high Raman sensitivity and good reproducibility in a large area, this urchin-like Ag NP/ZnO HNS hybrid nanoarray can be reasonably proposed {{to be used as a}} SERS substrate in practical applications, including bio-sensing, materials characterization, environmental science and so on...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{production}} process of magnesium alloy strips involves many steps, including <b>multi-hot</b> rolling and multi-heat treatment, which is time-consuming and needs high energy cost. By use of thin strip casting, magnesium alloy cast strip with a thickness {{of less than}} 8 mm can be produced and then rolled to the strip of the needed thickness, which is a short, energy saving and high effective process. In this paper, development of magnesium alloy strips prepared by single and twin roll casting has been summarized. Existing problems have been discussed and its development trends pointed out. Magnesium alloy strips prepared by single roll casting are suitable for Mg-based functional materials but not for structural materials because of low quality or high cost. Horizontal twin roll casting of magnesium alloy, based on aluminium alloy thin strip casting, has been industrialized in Australia and is close to industrialization in China. Vertical twin roll casting of magnesium alloy, based on steel thin strip casting, can reach a speed of more than 30 m/min and higher productivity, but the process stability is lower and its research and development is just beginning. Horizontal twin roll casting should be developed for the thicker cast strip, more than 4 mm thick, while vertical twin roll casting for the thinner, less than 4 mm...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{vorticity}} in {{the wake}} of an inclined stationary circular cylinder was measured simultaneously using a <b>multi-hot</b> wire vorticity probe over a streamwise range of x/d = 10 - 40. The study aimed to examine the dependence of the wake characteristics on cylinder inclination angle α (= 0 °- 45 °). The validity of the independence principle (IP) for vortex shedding was also examined. It was found that the spanwise mean velocity W which represents the three-dimensionality of the wake flow, increases monotonically with α. The root-mean-square (rms) values of the streamwise (u) and spanwise (w) velocities and the three vorticity components decrease significantly with the increase of α, whereas the transverse velocity (v) does not follow the same trend. The vortex shedding frequency decreases with the increase of α. The Strouhal number (StN), obtained by using the velocity component normal to the cylinder axis, remains approximately a constant within the experimental uncertainty (± 8 %) when α is smaller than about 40 °. The autocorrelation coefficients ρu and ρv of the u and v velocity signals show apparent periodicity for all inclination angles. With increasing α, ρu and ρv decrease and approach zero quickly. In contrast, the autocorrelation coefficient ρw of w increases with α in the near wake, implying an enhanced three-dimensionality of the wake. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
