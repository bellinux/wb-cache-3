5000|$|The three {{principles}} of naïve dialecticism are change, contradiction, and holism, and they operate together. If {{the world is}} in constant flux, as explained by the principle of change, then there <b>must</b> be <b>acceptance</b> of contradiction because one phenomenon will inevitably become something else. The fact that understanding phenomena relies on acceptance of contradiction within and between phenomena suggests {{that the only way to}} understand it is to look at it holistically ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{should be}} Communicated to the offeror. To {{conclude}} a contract between parties, the <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be communicated in some prescribed form. A mere mental determination {{on the part of}} offeree to accept an offer does not amount to valid acceptance.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{held that}} {{to accept an}} offer, a party <b>must</b> {{communicate}} their <b>acceptance</b> of the offer within a reasonable period of time. Here it was held that a period of 12 months was not a reasonable {{period of time to}} let lapse.|$|R

6000|$|Wanhope observed, musingly: [...] "I suppose he's {{quite right}} about the reciprocality of the offer, as we call it. There's probably, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, a perfect {{understanding}} before there's an explanation. In many cases the offer and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> really be tacit." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>{{acceptance}}</b> <b>must</b> be communicated. Theisger LJ said in Household Fire and Carriage that [...] "an acceptance {{which remains}} in the breast of the acceptor without being actually and by legal implication communicated to the offeror, is no binding acceptance".

50|$|A coup {{utilizes}} political {{resources to}} gain support within the existing state and neutralize or immobilize {{those who are}} capable of rallying against the coup. A successful coup occurs rapidly and after taking over the government, stabilizes the situation by controlling communications and mobility. Furthermore, a new government <b>must</b> gain <b>acceptance</b> from the public and military and administrative structures, by reducing the sense of insecurity. Ultimately, the new government will seek legitimacy in the eyes of its own people as well as seek foreign recognition. The coup d'état can be led by national forces or involve foreign influence, similar to foreign liberation or infiltration.|$|R
50|$|In {{assessing}} the cogency {{of such a}} justification, the court considered that a starting point <b>must</b> be an <b>acceptance</b> that the administration of justice {{and the maintenance of}} social peace and order is a fundamental public interest. This dictated that, as a matter of public policy, some information (such as the identity of informers) should be subject to privilege and not be disclosed.|$|R
5000|$|Mutual assent is {{also known}} as {{ratification}} and meeting of the minds is typically established through the process of offer and acceptance. However, contracts can also be implied in fact, as discussed below. At common law, the terms of a purported <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be the [...] "mirror image" [...] of the terms of the offer. Any variation thereof constitutes a counteroffer.|$|R
5000|$|As <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be communicated, the offeror cannot {{include an}} Acceptance by Silence clause. This was affirmed in Felthouse v Bindley, here an uncle {{made an offer}} to buy his nephews horse, saying that if he didn't hear {{anything}} else he would [...] "consider the horse mine". This did not stand up in court, and it was decided there could not be acceptance by silence.|$|R
5000|$|Adams v Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681, is an English {{contract}} case {{regarded as}} the first case towards {{the establishment of the}} [...] "postal rule" [...] for acceptance of an offer. Ordinarily, any form of <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be communicated expressly to an offeror; however, it was found that where a letter of acceptance is posted, an offer is accepted [...] "in course of post".|$|R

"Now {{that the}} new art {{movement}} has {{found its way to}} a department store," [...] writes Aaron Sheon, [...] "there ought to be no further doubt of its establishment as part of our American daily life, and its ultimate <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be considered only as a question of time". Cubism, far from institutionalized, had become accepted into a wider market, illustrating the reliance of early 20th-century art on massive commercial venues.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the offer}} {{specifies}} {{a method of}} acceptance (such as by post or fax), <b>acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be by a method that is no less effective from the offeror's point of view than the method specified. The exact method prescribed {{may have to be}} used in some cases but probably only where the offeror has used very explicit words such as [...] "by registered post, and by that method only".|$|R
50|$|The {{court ruled}} that Felthouse did not have {{ownership}} of the horse as there was no acceptance of the contract. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>must</b> be communicated clearly and cannot be imposed due to silence {{of one of the}} parties. The uncle had no right to impose a sale through silence whereby the contract would only fail by repudiation. Though the nephew expressed interest in completing the sale there was no communication of that intention.|$|R
40|$|A novel task, using a {{continuous}} spatial layout, {{was created to}} investigate {{the degree to which}} (in centimeters) 3 -year-old children's (N = 63), 5 -year-old children's (N = 60), and adults' (N = 60) own privileged knowledge of the location of an object biased their representation of a protagonist's false belief about the object's location. At all ages, participants' knowledge of the object's actual location biased their search estimates, independent of the attentional or memory demands of the task. Children's degree of bias correlated with their performance on a classic change-of-location false belief task, controlling for age. This task is a novel tool for providing a quantitative measurement {{of the degree to which}} self-knowledge can bias estimates of others' beliefs.

The poems in Anything Like Us reflect, in both form and content, many of the conclusions advanced in the introduction.

For volume-reduced service, samples are additionally processed in a closed cell separation system designed to remove the plasma fraction. For the whole blood service, samples are stored without this processing step. In both cases, samples are held for long term, vapor-phase storage in dedicated liquid nitrogen tanks situated on-site and on licensed third party premises.
