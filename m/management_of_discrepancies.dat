30|$|Limb-length {{discrepancies}} and extremity deformities {{are among}} the most common non-traumatic orthopaedic conditions for which children are referred to hospital [1]. New treatment options developed for lower-limb length discrepancies include “guided growth”, hexapod external fixators, lengthening over an intramedullary nail and lengthening then nailing [2, 3, 4, 5]. These techniques have expanded the indications for the surgical <b>management</b> <b>of</b> limb-length <b>discrepancies</b> and decreased the incidence and severity of complications in bone lengthening. Leg lengthening using external fixators has now become an accepted, well-established procedure based on the principles of the Ilizarov method, where distraction osteogenesis encourages the spontaneous consolidation of lengthened and regenerated bone [6, 7].|$|R
40|$|Paradigms {{have started}} to shift in the {{orthodontic}} world since the introduction of mini-implants in the anchorage armamentarium. For example, miniscrews have allowed the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> wider <b>discrepancies</b> than those treatable by conventional biomechanics because force can be applied directly from the bone-borne anchor unit. Therefore, miniscrews not only free orthodontists from anchorage-demanding cases, but they also enable clinicians to have good control over tooth movement in 3 dimensions. This review will illustrate the versatility of skeletal anchorage provided by mini-implants in the correction of malocclusion, focusing on orthodontic or orthopedic movements in the 3 spatial planes. Adjunctive orthodontic treatments in adult periodontal conditions and treatment for impacted teeth {{with the aid of}} miniscrews will also be discussed. © 2008 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityMedication {{discrepancy}} is {{a concept}} often used in discussions about medication safety but has neither been fully explained nor clearly defined in the literature. This paper explores medication discrepancy {{as it relates to}} patient safety and population health in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> medications. Literature review reveals two main aspects <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> in medication management; prescribing issues and patient adherence to regimens. Further development of the concept <b>of</b> medication <b>discrepancy</b> can be beneficial to the theorist, researcher, or clinician. Conceptual clarity about the various aspects <b>of</b> medication <b>discrepancy</b> in the context of patient safety has the potential to enhance quality improvement efforts and patient outcomes to improve population health...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{patients}} are admitted to, and discharged from hospital {{there is a}} high chance <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> and errors occurring during the transfer of patients' medication information. This often causes drug related problems. Correct and fast communication of patients' medication information between community pharmacy and hospital is necessary. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the number, type, and origin <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> within discharge documents and between discharge documents and information in the pharmacy computer system, concerning the medication of patients living independently when they are discharged from hospital. Second, to test which variables {{have an impact on the}} number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found and to study the time spent on the medication reconciliation process. SETTING: One quality-certified community pharmacy in the Netherlands. METHODS: Pharmacists reviewed discharge documents of patients discharged over one year. This information was compared to information available in the pharmacy computer system. Discrepancies were discussed with medical specialists and/or general practitioners. Type and origin <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> were classified. Differences in variables between hospitals were tested using Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Pearson Chi Square test. Poisson regression analysis was performed to test the impact of variables on the number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number, type and origin <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> for all independently living patients discharged from the hospital. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 discharges took place and were analyzed. No differences were found between the two main hospitals, a university hospital and a teaching hospital. In total, 223 discrepancies were documented. Sixty-nine discharges (69. 0 %) required consultation with a patients' medical specialist. A majority <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancies</b> (73. 1 %) have their origin in hospital information. The number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found increased with the number of medicines prescribed at discharge. The community pharmacist spent, on average, 45 min on the medication review after discharge. This included 11 min for counseling the patient. CONCLUSION: Many discrepancies were found between different information sources at patient discharge from hospital. A majority <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancies</b> had their origin in hospital information. The number of medicines after discharge was related to the number <b>of</b> <b>discrepancies</b> found. The medication reconciliation process took an average of 45 minutes per patient...|$|R

40|$|A {{surprising}} violation or validation {{experienced during}} a remembering test induces the perception <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy,</b> causing {{a feeling of}} familiarity (Whittlesea & Williams, 1998; 2000; 2001 a; 2001 b). The experiments in this dissertation investigated whether that perception affects performance when it is experienced in the original encounter with a stimulus. A number of paradigms were used that have been previously {{found to be associated}} with creating the perception <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> In each experiment a portion of the target items were presented in a study phase {{in the context of a}} manipulation thought to induce the perception <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> In a subsequent recognition test, the earlier experience of that perception increased the accuracy of participants 2 ̆ 7 discrimin. ation. However, when the subsequent task required a frequency judgment, that experience caused an illusion of repetition for items presented only once. The paradigm was also applied to and tested with brand names; however a different pattern emerged fi-om that found using regular words. Thus, the perception <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy</b> in an initial encounter may be a valuable aid to later remembering; but can also cause systematic mernory errors under some circumstances. The results extend the boundaries of the discrepancyattribution hypothesis, demonstrating that the perception <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy</b> experienced in the past can affect the accuracy of current processing in more ways than one...|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{we examine}} a novel {{mechanism}} of interorganizational relationship dissolution: incoherence in a partner's behavior. We {{propose that the}} discrepancy between an exchange partner's opportunistic behavior and the focal firm's expectations may create a state of incoherence and uncertainty and that this effect can be damaging to the exchange even when the partner's behavior is better than expected. Using nearly 500 longitudinal, confidential reports of industrial buyers and sellers, we find supportive evidence that (1) the net effect <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancy</b> is initially positive when behavior is better than expected but becomes rapidly negative thereafter, and (2) the net effect <b>of</b> the <b>discrepancy</b> is always negative when behavior is worse than expected. Thus, these effects will generally damage the exchange even as the partner tries to improve the relationship. This gives insight into why exchange relationships that hit a downward spiral can be difficult, if not impossible, to salvage. We also show that the dysfunctional consequences <b>of</b> <b>discrepancy</b> are mitigated through exchange structures such as the magnitude of dependence on an organizational partner, the development phase of the relationship, {{and the presence of}} bilateral idiosyncratic investments. Implications for theory and the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> interorganizational relationships are developed. interorganizational relationship management and performance, belief discrepancy, incoherence, organizational sensemaking, opportunism, dependence, relationship phase, bilateral investments...|$|R
