25|$|The {{first attempt}} at {{trying to find the}} {{covalent}} radius of fluorine was in 1938, by Brockway. Brockway prepared a vapour of F2 molecules by means of the electrolysis of potassium bifluoride (KHF2) in a fluorine generator, which was constructed of <b>Monel</b> <b>metal.</b> Then, the product was passed over potassium fluoride so as to remove any hydrogen fluoride (HF) and to condense the product into a liquid. A sample was collected by evaporating the condensed liquid into a Pyrex flask. Finally, using electron diffraction, it was determined that the bond length between the two fluorine atoms was about 145pm. He therefore assumed that the covalent radius of fluorine was half this value, or 73pm. This value, however, is inaccurate due to the large electronegativity and small radius of fluorine atom.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work investigates {{the use of}} pulsed current for joining two dissimilar <b>metals</b> <b>Monel</b> 400 and AISI 304 using Pulsed Current Gas Tungsten Arc welding using three different filler metals such as ER 309 L, ERNiCu- 7 and ERNiCrFe- 3. Microstructure observations showed the presence of Partially Melted Zone (PMZ) at the heat affected zone (HAZ) of all the weldments. The formation of secondary phases was witnessed at the HAZ of Monel 400 on using ERNiCu- 7 filler. Tensile studies corroborated that the bimetallic combinations employing ERNiCu- 7 offer better tensile properties as compared to ER 309 L and ERNiCrFe- 3 weldments. Parent <b>metal</b> <b>Monel</b> 400 exhibited better corrosion resistance as compared to other zones of the weldments when exposed in the synthetic molten salt environment containing Na 2 SO 4 - 60 % V 2 O 5 environment at 600 °C. A detailed structure - property relationship was made using the combined techniques of optical microscopy and SEM.

50|$|In the 1960s, <b>Monel</b> <b>metal</b> found bulk uses in {{aircraft}} construction, {{especially in}} making the frames and skins of experimental rocket planes, such as the North American X-15, to resist the great heat generated by aerodynamic friction during extremely high speed flight. <b>Monel</b> <b>metal</b> retains its strength at very high temperatures, allowing it to maintain its shape at high atmospheric flight speeds, a trade off against the increased weight of the parts due to Monel's high density.|$|E
50|$|Although {{somewhat}} rare, nickel {{has been}} used for plating architectural details. Nickel is most frequently used for building components in the form of alloys: nickel silver, <b>Monel</b> <b>metal,</b> and stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monel</b> <b>metal</b> is an alloy of {{approximately}} two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. It {{is similar to}} platinum in color. Monel pioneered many of the present uses of stainless steel. The first architectural use of Monel was for roofing the Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal in New York City in 1909. In 1936, the copper roof on the New York City Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street was replaced with a <b>Monel</b> <b>metal</b> roof. Its advantages as a roofing material included its ability to be brazed, welded, or soldered in place to provide a watertight, continuous cover. Monel was popular during the Art Deco periods. During World War II large quantities of nickel and copper were diverted to the war effort, and the supply of Monel was greatly reduced. Following the war, stainless steel and aluminium replaced Monel because of lower production costs.|$|E
50|$|The pilasters of {{the upper}} levels have fluting and capitals of ionic {{composition}} and support a rather large entablature. Art Deco architecture, well known for its geometric patterns and ornamentation is demonstrated in the detailed entablature, with a sculpted architrave, dentils on the cornice, and a <b>monel</b> <b>metal</b> trim along the top. Along the frieze are round ornamental metal pieces placed in a rhythmic order between the pilasters. Each entrance is flanked by a slightly protruding cast stone frame decorated with sculpted square shapes, dentils and bordered by a spiral ribbon-shaped cast stone. The <b>monel</b> <b>metal</b> trim on the window frames represents the art deco style of having natural shapes such as flowers or sunbursts, as influenced from the Egyptian and Mayan styles (New York Architecture). As can be observed, the trim is indeed a very natural organic shape.However these features are only present on the Yonge Street and College Street frontage. The back of the building, facing the park, while still maintaining a rather symmetrical and repetitive fenestration pattern, is sparse on decoration and entrances have been kept rather nondescript.|$|E
50|$|Metals {{used for}} {{architectural}} purposes include lead, for water pipes, roofing, and windows; tin, formed into tinplate; zinc, copper and aluminium, {{in a range}} of applications including roofing and decoration; and iron, which has structural and other uses in the form of cast iron or wrought iron, or made into steel. Metal alloys used in building include bronze (mainly copper and tin); brass (copper and zinc); <b>monel</b> <b>metal</b> and nickel silver, mainly consisting of nickel and copper; and stainless steel, with important components of nickel and chromium.|$|E
50|$|The Union Loop Elevated has remained, however, {{virtually}} and placidly what it {{has been}} since its early days in the late 1890s to the present. Its trackage has been reworked to accommodate changing operational modes. Stations have been added, lengthened, consolidated and eliminated in response to changing riding habits. While no major alterations have been made during its lifetime, minor changes have been made at the stations to improve passenger flow, accessibility, and weather protection. These modifications have added <b>Monel</b> <b>metal</b> and fiberglass to the basic wood and steel construction and have replaced some of the original ornamentation.|$|E

5000|$|Even {{though the}} rest of the complex was never constructed, the new store was {{nonetheless}} a true retail palace, the likes of which had never been seen in Toronto, and was a testament to the retail dominance of the Eaton's chain at that time. Tyndall limestone was used for the imposing exterior. Accentuating the Tyndall limestone was granite and a corrosion-resistant alloy of nickel and copper (Shoemaker, and Smith 22) called <b>monel</b> <b>metal.</b> The <b>monel</b> <b>metal</b> was used copiously on the building as trim and in panels along the window and door frames. In addition to this metal trim, cast stone and carvings acted as detailed decorative elements on the façade (Morawetz 5).Marble was imported from Europe for the interior columns and colonnade. Lady Eaton arranged for two entire rooms to be removed from two manor houses in England and reassembled in the furniture department of the College Street store. The French architect Jacques Carlu (who later designed the Rainbow Room in New York City and the Eaton's Ninth Floor (or the [...] "9ième") in Montreal), was retained to design the interior of the Eaton's Seventh Floor, including the 1300-seat Eaton Auditorium and the elegant Round Room restaurant. Itself an Art Moderne masterpiece, the Eaton's Seventh Floor {{was at the heart of}} Toronto's cultural life for many years. The Auditorium played host to the major performers of its day, including Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, and the National Ballet of Canada. Canada's own Glenn Gould, fond of the Auditorium's excellent acoustics, used the hall for a number of his recordings.|$|E

5000|$|In {{both cases}} {{solution}} {{is affected by}} means of pressure steam in the jacketed portion of the kettle. When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron.

To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh <b>Monel,</b> <b>metal</b> screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.

The age determinations suggest that females produce their first pup at age 5 years, and that bulls attempt to hold territories by age 8 years, but rarely are successful until about age 10 years. During their delayed 'social maturation', bulls may gain experience necessary to maximize reproductive success once territorial. A bull's territorial success ultimately depends on his fighting ability, which {{depends largely on}} {{the presence or absence}} of lower canine teeth. Canines are broken off during fighting; bulls without lower canines rarely defeat an opponent. Females prefer sites on the rookery which provide pools of water, shade, and direct access to the sea. Both sexes use water and shade for cooling. The theoretical 'mean' pupping date on Taumaka is 10 December. The sex ratio at birth is about 1 : 1. Males are heavier than females at birth, and are heavier and larger than females at mean age 55, 140, 235 and 290 days. Pups are weaned at about 300 days. Pup growth rates differed dramatically between 1974 / 75 and 1975 / 76. For example, male pups were about 22 percent heavier at 235 days in 1975 / 76 than in 1974 / 75. Differential growth rates probably are a consequence of food availability to lactating females and differing environmental temperatures between seasons. Mortality to age 50 days is 20 percent. First year mortality may be 50, percent. Starvation may account for 70 percent of all deaths to age 50 days. Other causes of death include suffocation, drowning, trampling and predation. Human disturbance can kill pups indirectly by causing panic on the rookery. Tagging pups with <b>monel</b> <b>metal</b> cattle ear tags may increase mortality. About 1400 pups are born on Taumaka annually. Using this figure for pup production, and incorporating reproductive data from other fur seal species (where none exist for the New Zealand fur seal), the estimated population of pups, females of breeding age and bulls on Taumaka is about 3700. The estimated population size associated with Taumaka, either through birth or by breeding on the rookery, is about 6000 - 6500. Using these estimates, and incorporating population data from the Northern fur seal, the estimated population growth rate on Taumaka is about 2 percent per annum...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Home range, dispersal, homing {{and density}} of Townsend's mole, Scapanus townsendii (Bachman), were studied during 1964 near Tillamook, Oregon. Additional {{information}} {{on the success of}} marking and capture techniques and the response of moles to flooding was gathered. This study was initiated to supply information which might aid in the modification or development of mole control and eradication techniques. Live trapping and capturing {{with the aid of a}} shovel were moderately successful methods of obtaining live moles during the study, but were not satisfactory for detailed studies of local movements. <b>Monel</b> <b>metal</b> bands 19 x 3. 4 x 0. 5 mm., attached to the hind leg just above the heel, proved satisfactory for marking adult and sub-adult live moles. Data on local movements were obtained from 176 live captures involving 116 moles. The mean distance between the widest points of capture for 14 individuals of both sexes captured three or more times each within the home range was 133 feet. Greater range lengths were recorded from poorly-drained pasture areas of lower population density, while shorter range lengths occurred in well-drained soils of higher population density. Recapture records of adult moles indicated that home ranges were fairly stable and discrete. To study the dispersal of juvenile moles from their birthplaces, a total of 180 young from 62 nests were marked by toe clipping and returned to the nest. An estimated maximum of 122 of these young survived and matured to dispersal age. A four month period was allowed for young to scatter, after which an intensive dead trapping program was initiated in an attempt to recapture the marked young. Forty-four (36 percent) of the 122 were recaptured, Ninety percent of the males and 84 percent of the females had travelled less than 1000 feet from their birthplace. Considering both sexes, 87 percent had travelled less than 1000 feet and 61 percent less than 500 feet. The maximum dispersal distance for a female was 2, 808 feet, while that for a male was 2, 369 feet. Results from an analysis of 724 barn owl pellets collected at monthly intervals during 1964 showed a significant number of juvenile moles were taken between May and July. This evidence indicates that some dispersal of juvenile moles takes place on the surface of the ground at night. Homing was successful for 17 of 36 individuals displaced different distances and across different barriers. Nine of 11 moles successfully returned where no physical barrier to movement was present. Seven of 12 individuals returned across a water-filled drainage canal; one of five returned across an elevated major highway; and one of eight returned across a river. Four of the moles returning over open terrain had been displaced by flooding. Homing behavior is believed to partially explain the rapid reinvasion of stream bottom lands after flooding. The density of moles on the study area ranged from 0. 17 to 5. 4 per acre and averaged 2. 2 per acre. Severe flooding was found to result in significant mortality of moles in the Tillamook area. Poor eyesight is believed to be a major factor in the failure of moles to escape flood waters...|$|E
