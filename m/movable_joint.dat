5000|$|Greek for [...] "jointed neck", the arthrodires had <b>movable</b> <b>joint</b> between armor {{surrounding}} {{the head and}} body. The mouth is interesting because as the lower jaw moved down, the head shield moved, allowing for a large opening. Lacking distinct teeth, like all placoderms, they used the sharpened edges of a bony plate as a biting surface. The eye sockets are protected by a bony ring, a feature shared by birds and some ichthyosaurs. Early arthrodires, such as the genus Arctolepis, were well-armoured fishes with flattened bodies. The largest member of this group, Dunkleosteus, was a true superpredator of the latest Devonian period, reaching 1 {{to as much as}} 6 m in length. In contrast, the long-nosed Rolfosteus measured just 15 cm. A common misconception is the arthrodires (along with all other placoderms) were sluggish bottom-dwellers that were outcompeted by more advanced fish. Leading to this misconception is that the arthrodire body plan remained relatively conserved (that is, the majority of arthrodires were bullet- or torpedo-shaped) during the Devonian period, save for increasing in size. However, during their reign, the arthrodires were one of the most diverse and numerically successful, if not the most successful, vertebrate orders of the Devonian, occupying a vast spectrum of roles from apex predator to detritus-nibbling bottom dweller. Despite their success, the arthrodires were one of many groups eliminated by the environmental catastrophes of the Late Devonian extinction, allowing other fish such as sharks to diversify into the vacated ecological niches during the Carboniferous period.|$|E

Recommendations are worked out for assigning the shaft tolerance for different types of restoration with regard to the prescribed service life. The tolerance field shift by 10 - 13 % increases the durability of the joint and the system of the shaft repair dimensions increases it by 7 - 9 %. A rational method is found for restoring the shaft, i. e. working of the shaft to the repair dimension with surface plastic deformation which prolongs the service life by 12 - 17 %. It is proposed to select collars to the shafts of the repair dimension.

Regular physical activity has been promoted as an effective method to prevent functional decline in elders, but there is concern that an increase in physical activity may lead to the development of osteoarthritis in weight-bearing joints. An optimal level of synovial joint use will enhance and maintain articular cartilage structure, composition, and functions, but excessive loading may damage normal cartilage. Articular cartilage which covers the articular ends of bones provides a shock absorber and load-bearing surface in a <b>movable</b> <b>joint.</b> The tissue is composed of cells, chondrocytes, which synthesize a matrix consisting of collagen and proteoglycans. Weight-bearing properties of the cartilage (including resistance to compression and distribution of load) depend mainly upon its proteoglycans. Joint-loading appears to {{have a significant effect on}} proteoglycan synthesis. The effects of moderate aerobic exercise on chondrocyte ultrastructure were studied in the knee joint articular cartilage of young and aged rats (F 1 Hybrids). Synthetic activity of the chondrocytes was quantified by measuring the amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) from electron micrographs using a stereologic point-counting method. The superficial zone of articular cartilage in the young exercised rat (which is the surface layer) exhibited significant increases in volume of cells per tissue volume unit, surface area of RER per unit volume of chondrocyte cytoplasm and cartilage tissue, and volume density of RER. In the intermediate and deep zones of articular cartilage in both young and aged exercised rats, no significant differences in RER were detected. No signs of degeneration were observed in the exercised cartilage. However, in the cartilage of aged rats (sedentary and exercised), typical changes such as decreases in cartilage thickness and the sizes and amounts of proteoglycan matrix granules were observed. The increase in RER activity in the superficial zone of young rats clearly shows that area of articular cartilage is very active in terms of responding to loads and synthesizing proteoglycans. Since no qualitative changes were seen at either the light or electron microscopy levels indicating any osteoarthritic conditions in both young and exercised rats, these observations suggest that moderate aerobic exercise does not cause degenerative joint disease...|$|E
