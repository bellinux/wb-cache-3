25|$|The French {{artillery}} train having arrived, Colonel James Grant {{proposed that}} the castle should be attacked from the classic direction of the town cemetery where the guns would be nearly level with the fortifications. However, Prince Charles was allegedly afraid that the return fire from the castle would wreck the town of Stirling and therefore opted for an alternative that was offered by the Franco-Scottish engineer <b>Mirabelle</b> de Gordon, who had arrived with Lord John Drummond. Mirablle de Gordon stated that an attack from the little Gowan Hill, which lay hard under the north-eastern side of the castle, which would be totally dominated by whatever cannon the besiegers might choose to fire against it. The bedrock at this location however, was only 15 inches below the surface {{making it difficult for}} the besiegers to throw up effective cover, and the ramparts of the castle on this side were {{at the top of a}} near vertical cliff which would make it impossible even for the agile Highlanders to scale. The Prince accepted <b>Mirabelle</b> de Gordon’s advice and in doing so is probably the tactical mistake that can be most firmly pinned on him.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to {{the release}} was [...] "generally ecstatic", {{according}} to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's [...] "aural invention". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine <b>Mirabelle</b> wrote: [...] "Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang {{at the end of}} Revolver." [...] In his review for the NME, Allen Evans said, in response to the lyric's exhortation to [...] "relax and float downstream": [...] "But how can you relax with the electronic, outer-space noises, often sounding like seagulls? … Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural." [...] Peter Jones of Record Mirror commented: [...] "You need some sort of aural microscope to get the message from this. But it's darned compelling listening." [...] Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner said that those who had been confused by the lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love.|$|E
