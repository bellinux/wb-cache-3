50|$|First 19 US {{models were}} made already in spring of 1993, months before when normal <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>change</b> occurs in July/August. These M718 option cars still used {{previous}} model year parts like Cup I wheels {{and do not}} have 1994 model year updates despite using same 1994 VIN sequence.|$|E
50|$|In {{business}} history, the mid-1920s saw Alfred P. Sloan stimulating {{increased demand}} for General Motors products by instituting the annual <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>change</b> and planned obsolescence, a move that changed {{the dynamics of the}} largest industrial enterprise in the world, away from technological innovation and towards satisfying market expectations.|$|E
50|$|The 1934 Ford (the Model 40B) {{was not as}} {{substantial}} a <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>change</b> as {{the previous}} two years had been. Noticeable changes included a flatter grille with a wider surround and fewer bars, straight hood louvers, two handles {{on each side of the}} hood, smaller head lights and cowl lamps, and a reworked logo. The bare metal dash insert was replaced by painted steel.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1991, Toyota facelifted the Celica for the 1992 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> included: ...|$|R
5000|$|The F10 {{facelift}} (also {{known as}} LCI) models began production in July 2013 for the 2014 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> include: ...|$|R
50|$|For the {{subsequent}} two <b>model</b> <b>years,</b> <b>changes</b> {{were limited to}} the addition of new exterior colors (from 9/01 production) and the upgrade to a DVD-based navigation system (from 9/02 production).|$|R
5000|$|One {{episode in}} the history of the {{inherent}} conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace happened in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined Chrysler Airflow, when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car makers thought that aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a [...] "teardrop" [...] shape, which would not be good for unit sales. GM thereafter adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>change,</b> so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, drag coefficient has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from minor grille and {{taillight}} changes, 1973 {{would be}} largely a carryover {{year for the}} Cougar, but it would mark {{the last year of}} the Mustang-based Cougar and the final run of Cougar convertibles; a light blue/white Cougar XR-7 convertible was actually the [...] "last" [...] convertible built by Ford Motor Company (the Mustang convertible was gone upon the '74 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>change</b> to Mustang II and returned for the 1983 models). An automatic transmission and power front disc brakes became standard, though a 4-speed manual transmission was still available as a rarely ordered option. Many changes were scheduled for the 1973 models. Power figures continued to change, as new federal/EPA regulations began their stranglehold on the V8 engines. The new figures continued to fluctuate, but engine options remained unchanged from 1972. The standard engine continued to be the [...] 351 Cleveland two-barrel V8. Optional was the [...] 351 Cobra Jet V8. The following years changed to the Thunderbird/Torino chassis.|$|E
40|$|Product {{documentation}} {{for manufacturing}} {{is subject to}} temporal change: Exchange of parts by successor models, shift from in-house production to external procurement, or assembly line reconfiguration {{are just a few}} examples. In this paper we show how DaimlerChrysler AG manages configuration for manufacturing of their Mercedes lines. Furthermore, we identify typical situations of change, their representation on the product documentation level, and how to keep the documentation consistent over time. We then develop two verification methods for computing the induced change at the parts level. Finally, we show how our methods can be applied to handle <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>change</b> and production relocation. ...|$|E
50|$|The 1991 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>changes</b> to the 2.3 L I4 engines {{included}} {{an increase in}} horsepower (from 88 to 105) due to a revised cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder.|$|R
50|$|For 2014 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> minor <b>changes</b> {{were made}} to {{standard}} equipment, and AMG Sports package renamed to AMG Line.|$|R
50|$|The ninth-generation Accord {{received}} a refresh for the 2016 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> to outer appearance include new front fascia, grill, head lights, rear lights, and alloy wheel designs. Hybrid Accord returned for the 2017 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> with revised running gear that has combined output of 214 hp (160 kW), up from 196 hp (146 kW) of the 2014 & 2015 <b>model</b> <b>years</b> version. The Plug-in Hybrid Accord {{did not make}} a return, instead replaced by the 2017 Honda Clarity PHEV.|$|R
30|$|Subsequently, {{using the}} index {{decomposition}} analysis (IDA) method (Sun [1998]; Ang [2004]; Ang et al. [2003, 2009]; Hoekstra and van den Bergh [2003]), changes in gasoline consumption over time were decomposed into five factors: {{change in the}} state of ownership by vehicle type and by <b>model</b> (<b>year),</b> <b>change</b> in the number of new cars being registered, change in the market share of new cars, change in fuel consumption by vehicle type, and change in the annual average travel distance by vehicle type. Although there is a variety of IDA methods, we employed the Shapley/Sun IDA method in the spirit of Sun ([1998]). In this article, following Ang et al. ([2009]), we formulated the Shapley/Sun IDA method equivalent to the Shapley decomposition method proposed by Shapley ([1953]). 1 The decomposition results of the study will facilitate a quantitative assessment {{of the extent to which}} the recent expansion of light vehicles and hybrid cars in the market is contributing to a reduction in gasoline consumption.|$|E
50|$|The Touring Sedan {{carried a}} base price {{of just over}} $24,000 USD (approximately $ in current dollars) in 1987. Given the car's late {{introduction}} in the 1987 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> <b>changes</b> for 1988 were relatively minor. For 1989, the model line was updated with 16 inch wheels, minor grille changes and steering wheel controls for climate and stereo systems were made standard. A new optional CD-player was also added.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 for the 2006 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> <b>changes</b> in SAE {{engine testing}} {{procedures}} {{resulted in a}} slight drop {{in the amount of}} stated power for the V8 to , and Lexus Link telematics was offered in North America. For 2007, the GX 470 was largely unchanged, with upgrades for cabin electronics including a new generation navigation system, auxiliary input jack for devices like an iPod, DVD video playback when parked, and larger optional rear entertainment video screen.|$|R
50|$|The 2013 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>changes</b> include Bluetooth and {{satellite}} radio standard on all models. The Platinum model trim {{will offer a}} new Platinum reserve package. A new navigation system that has a larger hard disk drive (40 GB), is NavWeather capable, has Zagat Survey, {{has the ability to}} stream audio from Bluetooth and a USB port. The Nissan DVD Entertainment System now uses screens mounted {{in the back of the}} front head restraints replacing the previous single-screen system.|$|R
50|$|In late 1967, {{sufficient}} {{changes were}} introduced for the factory {{to define a}} Mark II model for the 1968 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> included synchromesh on all four gears with revised ratios, an optional Borg-Warner automatic gearbox (except in the US), a new rear axle, and an alternator {{in place of the}} dynamo with a change to a negative earth system. To accommodate the new gearboxes there were significant changes to the sheet metal in the floorpan, and a new flat-topped transmission tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>changes</b> for non-STs are; SE models gain {{standard}} SYNC and alloy wheels, the SEL trim is discontinued {{in favor}} of an [...] "SE Appearance package" [...] that includes most of the SEL features but with standard trim choices limited to black leather, while Titanium models also pick up standard leather upholstery. All now come standard with the 5-speed manual leaving the SFE pack as the last remaining automatic-only Focus (apart from the direct-drive electric), and color choices are rearranged.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2017 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> minor {{upgraded}} <b>changes</b> {{were made}} to the Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV: ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2007, the {{facelift}} (LCI) {{was introduced}} for the 2008 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> The major <b>changes</b> are: ...|$|R
50|$|The 9-3 {{received}} some revisions in 2011 for the 2012 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> {{were in the}} engine range with an overall reduction in diesel and petrol engine fuel consumption of 12% and 7% respectively. An entry-level 163 hp, 2.0-litre gasoline / BioPower engine was added for 9-3 saloon, estate, and 9-3X models with Saab XWD. Other changes included rear badging in line with all new Saab 9-5 saloon, 'ice block' style headlights, New bumper design, titanium metallic effect trim around instrument panel, gearshift, doors and glove box. Aero gets graphite fiber effect. Contrast stitching on leather upholstery.|$|R
50|$|Starting in April 2009 the Wilmington, DE. {{plant was}} {{business}} as usual and pre-production builds began for the 2010 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> Between April 21, 2009 and May 28, 2009 thirty 2010 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> VIN-coded cars were built on the Kappa platform. Of those, were 12 Pontiac Solstice Coupes and 8 Pontiac Solstice roadsters. Of the other remaining, 8 were Saturn SKYs and 2 were Opel GTs. They were then used as GM company vehicles to be evaluated and also as special event display vehicles. These vehicles were built to the 2010 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> specs with 2010 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>changes</b> and had legal 2010 VIN numbers. Following the end of use term within the GM fleet, the vehicles were sent to auction. After these 30 2010 models, more 2009-spec Solstices were produced and were the last ones made at the plant.|$|R
5000|$|For 2009, 2.4 L four-cylinder engines {{were added}} to the coupe lineup. GM revised the G6 in the middle of 2009, {{creating}} a [...] "2009.5" [...] <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> consisted of a revised front and rear fascia as well as a revision of the dashboard, most notably adding an updated radio with Bluetooth capability. Coupes and convertibles ceased production {{at the end of the}} 2009 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> making examples with the 2009.5 changes fairly rare. Subsequent to this model's introduction, General Motors entered bankruptcy, and announced that the G6 sedan would be discontinued in 2010. Most other Pontiac models had been discontinued, but the G6 was in high-demand for fleet vehicle orders, facilitating production to continue while the brand was wound down.|$|R
25|$|For the 1990 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> <b>changes</b> {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. Lower dash panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed.|$|R
500|$|Designed {{through early}} 1996, in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was {{introduced}} for the 1998 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> were a five-speed automatic transmission, increased engine output to , with {{variable valve timing}} (VVT-i), and an added [...] of torque. Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result. The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling. Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and updated wheels; a rear window diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast. The cabin received upgrades, including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass, while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{a unique}} dataset of monthly new vehicle sales by {{detailed}} model from 1978 to 2007, and implements a new identification strategy {{to estimate the}} effect of the price of gasoline on individual vehicle model sales. We control for unobserved vehicle and consumer characteristics by using within <b>model</b> <b>year</b> <b>changes</b> in the price of gasoline and sales. We find a significant sales response, suggesting that the gasoline price increase from 2002 to 2007 explains nearly half of the decline in market share of US manufacturers. On the other hand, an increase in the gasoline tax would only modestly raise average fuel economy. (JEL H 25, L 11, L 62, L 71) ...|$|R

Among changes to the SKY for the 2010 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> were the addition of remote start on automatic equipped cars, option package changes and additions, and three new colors. Those colors were Kinetic Blue, Opus Green, and Dark Labyrinth Metallic. No 2010s were built in Opus Green.|$|R
25|$|For the 2014 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> <b>changes</b> to GS 350 {{includes}} eight-speed {{automatic transmission}} with steering for rear-wheel drive (RWD) model, introduction of F SPORT package (optional Lexus Dynamic Handling system with dynamic rear steering (DRS), electric power steering, variable gear ratio steering (VGRS)), integrated Siri Eyes Free mode from Apple (compatible with iPhone 4S and newer), flush mounted sensors for available intuitive park assist, full color display {{added to the}} optional head-up display, available blind spot monitor adds rear cross traffic alert and power-folding mirrors, Luxury Package changes (LED foglamps, Superchrome finish for 18-inch wheels, and the rear armrest control panel display adds display option to view radio station and song title information), optional power trunk opener, Lexus Night View system discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{an interim}} {{facelift}} {{of an old}} model, changes were few and minor. For 2009, the SEL trim for sedans was added and the chrome-plastic fake grilles on the front fenders were deleted from all models. Also, Coupes equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, but not a Duratec 20E PZEV engine, received a horsepower increase to , compared to the [...] found in the sedan. A standard rear seat dome light was added for the 2010 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> <b>Changes</b> for the short 2011 model run were limited. The coupes were discontinued {{in preparation for the}} new (2012 MY) 4-door hatchback or sedan, set to arrive in the spring of 2011. Production of the sedan ended in the beginning of December 2010.|$|R
50|$|For the 2013 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> {{the only}} <b>changes</b> {{made to the}} Navigator were the {{addition}} of new color trims: Kodiak Brown Metallic Tri-Coat, Midnight Sapphire Metallic, and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat.|$|R
50|$|The Silhouette {{remained}} in production until the 2004 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> with minimal <b>changes.</b> The Oldsmobile division of General Motors {{was shut down}} and no Oldsmobiles were produced after the 2004 <b>model</b> <b>year.</b> The final Oldsmobile Silhouette rolled {{off the assembly line}} on March 31, 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The 1977 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> {{introduced}} a [...] "Sports Appearance Group" [...] for the Ghia model that was color matched to either black or tan paint, {{as well as}} several minor styling changes and expanded color options for the Cobra II. Also new was a T-top option for the fastback featuring twin removable tinted glass panels. Midway through the 1977 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> <b>changes</b> for the 1978 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> were pulled ahead to sell early. It is most notable on the Cobra II models where the hood scoop was turned around to seem more aerodynamic and the graphics were revised. For the decals, the dual stripes running the length of the car were replaced with a single stripe and {{on the side of the}} car the snake and [...] "COBRA II" [...] decal were replaced with a large stripe down the center with large [...] "COBRA" [...] lettering in the middle. Louvers were added to the hatch and the side panel louvers only came in black. All the window and glass moldings were painted black as well.|$|R
25|$|Nissan {{added more}} battery {{capacity}} which increased {{the range of}} the car on a full charge. A larger 30kWh battery is on the SL and SV trims, and the S trim initially kept the smaller 24kWh battery found in earlier Leafs. However, midway through the 2016 <b>model</b> <b>year,</b> Nissan <b>changed</b> the battery in the base Leaf S model from 24 kWh to 30 kWh.|$|R
50|$|The 1952 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> {{included}} minor <b>changes</b> to medallions, hood ornament, and script nameplates, {{but after}} the midyear an optional electric overdrive unit (for speeds over 25 mph) was added for the manual transmission (no automatic transmission was available).|$|R
2500|$|The 1954 <b>model</b> <b>year</b> brought major <b>changes.</b> The [...] {{wheelbase}} {{model was}} replaced by an [...] wheelbase model, and a [...] "Pick Up" [...] version was introduced. The extra wheelbase was added behind the cab area to provide additional load space.|$|R
