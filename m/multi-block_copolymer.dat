40|$|International audienceEthyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising bio-fuels in Europe. During its industrial synthesis, ethanol forms an azeotropic mixture with ETBE, which cannot be separated by simple distillation. We have formerly reported several selective linear <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymer</b> membranes for this separation by pervaporation. These multi-block copolymers offered good film forming ability and processability but their transport properties were limited by the permeability/selectivity trade-off. In this work, a new grafting strategy of multi-block copolymers is investigated, aiming at increasing membrane permeability strongly while maintaining a very high selectivity for ETBE purification. The grafted multi-block copolymers were obtained by a synthesis scheme involving step-growth polymerization, polymer functionalization and grafting by "click" chemistry. The membrane properties are discussed in terms of structure-morphology-property relationships for the sorption and pervaporation of the targeted mixture. By hindering the diffusion of the bulky ETBE molecules and ensuring high permeability for ethanol molecules, the particular morphology of the grafted <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymer</b> membranes led to outstanding membrane separation performance for ETBE purification...|$|E

40|$|Transcription {{factories}} are nuclear domains where gene transcription takes place although the molecular {{basis for their}} formation and maintenance are unknown. In this study, we explored how the properties of chromatin as a polymer {{may contribute to the}} structure of transcription factories.

Single fibre analysis showed that this modification spans the entire body of the gene. Furthermore, H 4 K 16 ac genes cluster in regions up to 500 Kb alternating active and inactive chromatin.

On the one hand, the increase in drug payload from 10 to 30 per cent for EL 14 NPs showed no difference in particle size, however the entrapment efficiency tends to decrease from 50 to 43 per cent; on the other hand, the more hydrophobic PLGA showed an increasing trend in entrapment efficiency from 20 to 62 per cent with increasing particle size. Over 90 per cent of CsA was released in vitro from both the nanoparticulates; however, the release was much slower in the case of more hydrophobic PLGA.

In the present work, we will try to cover topic of stimuli-responsive block copolymers and their interactions with different types of surfactants. Understanding of polymer/surfactant interactions can be a crucial step for future modeling of drug/polymer or protein(DNA) /surfactant interactions. There is a great interest in the investigation of polymer-surfactant interactions. However, while the homopolymer-surfactant interactions are characterized well enough, the same interactions for block copolymers are poorly described.

40|$|Segmented {{copolymers}} with short, glassy or crystalline hard segments and long, amorphous soft segments (<b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers)</b> are thermoplastic elastomers (TPE’s). The hard segments form physical crosslinks for the amorphous (rubbery) soft segments. As a result, {{this type}} of materials combines elastomeric behavior with melt processability. Typical examples are the copolyetheresters based on poly(butylene terephthalate) and poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PBT-PTMO, TPE-E) and the thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPE-U). The design and synthesis of copolyetheresteramides with uniform crystallizable bisesterdiamides as the hard segment is a new development. Bisesterdiamides of uniform length crystallize over their full length, resulting in fast and nearly complete crystallization. Consequently, the phase separation is good, leading to a polymer with a low glass transition temperature, a high melting temperature and a temperature independent rubbery plateau.

The analysis of the mass transport of a highly permeable polymer {{is complicated by the}} presence of stagnant boundary layers at feed and permeate side. Such resistances are generally specific to the permeation cell used and can be extracted from the measurement of the overall resistance of polymeric films having different thickness. Water vapor permeabilities of ethyl cellulose and polysulfone films are determined and corrected for the resistance in the stagnant boundary layer and measured values correspond to those in literature. Permeability values of even higher permeable and more selective poly(ethylene oxide) poly(butylene terephthalate) <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymer</b> (PEO-PBT) are presented to illustrate the contribution of the stagnant boundary layer at various process conditions. The mixed gas nitrogen permeability remains constant with an increase of water vapor activity on the feed side of the membrane, but increases significantly when the sweep gas is humidified. The water vapor permeability shows a strong dependence on the feed pressure. An increase of the feed pressure results in a larger resistance of the stagnant feed boundary layer, thereby lowering the total water vapor flux. The mixed gas nitrogen permeability decreases slightly with an increase of pressure most likely due to the compaction of the material...|$|E

The cascade reaction {{that leads to the}} alkyl cinnamates occurs through two oxidation steps: the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde, followed by oxidation of the hemiacetal that results from the base-catalysed reaction of cinnamaldehyde with an aliphatic alcohol. The rate constants for the two steps were evaluated in the temperature range 10 – 45 [*]°C. The cinnamyl alcohol oxidation is faster than the oxidative esterification of cinnamaldehyde with methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol or 1 -octanol. The rate constants of the latter reaction are pseudo-zero order with respect to the aliphatic alcohol and decrease as the bulkiness of the alcohol is increased. The activation energy (Ea) for the two oxidation steps was calculated for esterification of cinnamyl alcohol with 1 -butanol (Ea= 57. 8 ± 11. 5 and 62. 7 ± 16. 7  kJ[*]mol− 1 for the first and second step, respectively). The oxidative esterification of cinnamyl alcohol with 2 -phenylethanol follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to 2 -phenylethanol and is faster than observed for other alcohols because of fast diffusion of the aromatic alcohol in the crystalline phase of the support.

The length of the mid-soft segment was varied from 1000 to 20, 000 and thereby the concentration of the hard end segment changed from 22 to 3 wt. %. The molecular weight of the tri-block copolymers was determined by NMR and inherent viscosity measurements. The crystallinity of the hard segment was studied by IR and DSC measurements. Temperature modulated IR was carried out to explore the change in crystallinity with temperature. The morphology was investigated by AFM analysis and the thermo-mechanical properties by DMA, whereas the melt rheological behaviour was analyzed by a plate–plate method.

Also the modulus at room temperature was relatively high, particularly at low contents of hard end segment. The melt rheological behaviour of a low molecular weight tri-block copolymer revealed a low melt viscosity at high shear rates, and a high viscosity at low shear rates.

40|$|Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) plays a {{key role}} in the {{development}} of fibrotic processes in several tissues. Accordingly, the PDGF receptor is abundantly present in these fibrotic tissues. Specific targeting to this receptor is established for a series of compounds in different animal models, all sharing the same targeting moiety, i. e. the cyclic peptide pPB. One of those compounds is pPB-HSA, which might function as carrier vehicle that binds to the PDGFβ-receptor without eliciting an intracellular response itself. Aims When formulated as a solution for parenteral administration, targeting of fibrosis with pPB-HSA would involve long-term or even lifelong daily injections, which may jeopardize patient compliance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a microsphere formulation for the sustained release of pPB-HSA and assess the delivery and targeting of the intact protein construct in vivo. Methods pPB-HSA was encapsulated in biodegradable polymeric microspheres using a water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsification process and blends of two semi-crystalline <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers</b> composed of blocks of poly (-caprolactone) – polyethylene glycol – poly (-caprolactone) and poly (L-lactide). The delivery and targeting of the protein construct was evaluated in vivo using a mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidney fibrosis model. Results and conclusions By varying the ratio of the two <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers,</b> the release of the model protein HSA from the microspheres could be tailored from 7 days to 2 months without burst release. The microsphere formulation with a 50 : 50 blend ratio of the polymers, showing first order sustained release for 14 days, was selected for further optimization. Optimization of microencapsulation process parameters resulted in an encapsulation efficiency of 83 % and an in vitro release of > 90 % after 14 days for the final pPB-HSA formulation. The median particle size of these microspheres was 25 m, which enables injection with a 21 G needle. All mice were sacrificed 7 days after ureteral obstruction and microsphere administration. The obstructed kidneys developed fibrosis and showed increased PDGFβ-receptor expression. The plasma concentration of pPB-HSA in the pPB-HSA treated mice (n= 3) was 15 ± 4 ng/mL. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis showed the presence of pPB-HSA in the fibrotic kidney of these mice, while the sham operated kidney was negative for pPB-HSA. In conclusion, the pPB-HSA construct was successfully formulated in polymeric microspheres produced by a W/O/W method, which showed a first order release profile in vitro. Furthermore, pPB-HSA was released from these microspheres in vivo. In addition, pPB-HSA was specifically localized in fibrotic tissue, where the target receptor, the PDGF receptor, is abundantly present.

It {{was found}} that the interfacial adhesion was enhanced, the size of the dispersed phase was reduced and PES and PC formed an interlocking structure with the copolymer, which suggest the addition of the compatibizer may improved the miscibility between PES and PC, and result in the improvement of the mechanical properties of the blends. The compatibility behavior of PES with PC was examined using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and SAXS...|$|R
40|$|Polyether and {{especially}} poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) based segmented block copolymers {{are very well}} known for their high CO 2 permeability combined with a high CO 2 /light gas selectivity, but most (commercially) available block copolymers have incomplete phase separation between the soft and hard blocks in the polymer leading to reduced performance. Here we present a polyether based segmented block copolymer system with improved phase separation behavior and gas separation performance using poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and/or poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) as a soft segment and short monodisperse di-amide (TΦT) as a hard segment. In this work we tune the mass transport properties of such <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers</b> for CO 2 capture by systematically investigating {{the effect of the}} type and length of soft segment in the block copolymer at constant short hard segment. The effect of (1) the length of the PEO soft segment, (2) the type of soft segment (PPO vs. PEO) and (3) the use of a mixture of these two different types of soft segment as a method to tune the gas separation performance and its relation with the thermal–mechanical properties is investigated. The use of such a polyether based segmented block copolymer system as presented here offers a very versatile tool to tailor mass transfer and separation properties of membranes for gas and vapor separation...|$|R
40|$|Solid polymer {{electrolytes}} are a {{key component}} in fuel cell as ion conducting barrier between the two electrochemical reactive electrodes and their conductivity significantly determines {{the performance of the}} cells. The conductivity of the electrolyte membranes is typically based on a nanoscale phase separation that results in an ionic conductive network and a stabilizing matrix. In sulfonated ionomers the sulfonic acid groups are solvated and a hydrophilic proton conducting aqueous ionic phase is formed in a self-assembling process upon solidification of the membrane. The hydrophobic polymer back-bones which may be perfluorinated as in case of Nafion-type molecules or aromatic as in case of <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers</b> provide mechanical stabilization. Consequently, the membrane properties at or close to the surface may differ from the bulk of the membrane and its structure and conductivity are crucial as interface between membrane and electrode/catalyst. Different types of sulfonated membranes, perfluorinated Nafion® (long-side chain molecules) and Aquivion® (short side chain molecules) membranes, and aromatic multiblock copolymer membrane named JST (JSR Corp., Japan) have been investigated. Beside the investigation of surfaces freshly cut cross section from Nafion and Aquivion samples have been examined. For analysis material-sensitive and conducting atomic force microscopy was used to map local adhesion forces, stiffness, deformation, conductivity and surface potential with nanoscale resolution. The following issues will be addressed: 1. Change of the conductivity upon current flow. 2. Size and distribution of conductive area at the surface for various membranes. 3. Existence and thickness of a surface layer for different membranes. 4. Difference in membranes structure close to the surface. 5. Ionic structure of the bulk for Nafion® and Aquivion®...|$|R
40|$|In the project, {{our purpose}} is the {{synthesis}} of segmented block copolymers using novel selectively reacting bi-functional coupling agents which have recently been developed by Jakisch at al. Both couplers have one oxazoline group that reacts with carboxylic groups and one oxazinone group that reacts with hydroxyl or amino groups. It was intended to synthesize segmented block copolymers by combination of amino or hydroxyl terminated pre-polymers and carboxylic terminated chain extenders using the above mentioned coupling agents. Several prepolymers were selected such as hydroxyl terminated liquid polybutadiene (PBD-OH), hydroxyl terminated liquid natural rubber (LNR) and amino terminated liquid polybutadiene-b-acrylonitrile (PBAN) and poly(propylene glycol) -bis(2 -aminopropylether) (PPO). They were selected as soft polymer segments in the segmented block copolymers aimed for. Additionally, various di-carboxylic acids were chosen as chain extenders. The resulting block copolymers are phase separated materials with a crystalline hard phase. This was demonstrated by two glass transition temperatures corresponding to the soft and hard segments and various melting regions of the hard chain extenders. For these new materials, the controlled phase separation morphology in nano-size was evidenced by TEM. A hard domain size of about 2 - 5 nm surrounded by a soft matrix was observed on the micro-photographs. This {{is consistent with the}} low hard segment content and the segment alternation (A-B) n in <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers.</b> With respect to the mechanical properties, a relationship between tensile strength and the average molar mass of the block copolymers was found out. The samples behave as rubber-like thermoplastic materials. The tensile properties depend on the degree of polymerization and the polymer distribution. The reinforcement ability of the hard domains in a physical network was achieved as expected. As a consequence, the obtained final products have mechanical properties like a typical elastomeric material...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} mass {{transport}} properties for water vapor and nitrogen {{for a series}} of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers</b> via: (a) the permeation of a water vapor/N 2 mixture (b) the sorption of water vapor, (c) the diffusion of water vapor, (d) Zimm and Lundberg cluster analysis, and (e) the state of water in these polymers by FTIR-ATR analysis. The studied block copolymers consist of a PEO segment length of 1000 g/mol containing various amounts of PBT. The water vapor permeability depends strongly on the polymeric structure and increases with the amount of PEO due to a higher solubility and diffusivity. The selectivity of water vapor/N 2 increases with an increase of the amount of PBT in the block copolymer due to a relatively higher water vapor permeability compared to N 2. This stems from an easier permeation of the smaller water molecule through the mixed PEO¿PBT interphase. Although the average diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing feed water activity, the mobility of water vapor increases significantly with an increase of the amount of water vapor sorbed in the polymer. This is related to the plasticization of the PEO phase in the block copolymer. The increase of the mobility with the amount of water vapor sorbed in the material is lower for block copolymers containing larger amounts of PBT, suggesting a restriction of the swelling of the PEO by the PBT phase. Water starts to cluster at higher concentrations of water in the polymer, as revealed by a Zimm and Lundberg cluster analysis of the sorption isotherm and by FTIR-ATR. The latter technique shows that the interactions between water and the polymer become weaker as the amount of water in the block copolymer increases. This observation suggests that the decrease in interaction energy between water and the polymer must be compensated by an entropy gain, because the solubility of water vapor increases with an increase of activity...|$|R
40|$|The strategy, termed living coordinative chain-transfer {{polymerization}} (LCCTP), {{has been}} explored {{to boost the}} efficiency and versatility of polyolefin synthesis by coupling a reversible chain-transfer process with living coordination polymerization. LCCTP strategy not only overcomes the "one-chain-per-metal" limit on polymerization yield, but also provides opportunities to flourish the architectural, compositional and functional flexibility of polyolefin-based materials. A new strategy, named ternary living coordinative chain-transfer polymerization (t-LCCTP), extends the LCCTP methodology through employing the rapid and reversible chain-transfer process under living conditions between an active transition-metal propagating species, a primary surrogate trialkyaluminum, and a catalytic amount of diethylzinc as a secondary surrogate and chain-transfer mediator. This strategy provides a cost-effective, scalable process {{for the production of}} precision hydrocarbons, such as the low-molecular-weight oligomers from propene and alpha-olefins under near-ambient conditions. Having the advantage of using trialkyaluminum and diethylzinc as surrogate chain-growth sites, block and end-group functionalized polyolefin-based materials have been synthesized directly through chemical reactions of the Al-C/Zn-C bonds. Rapid and reversible chain-transfer between "tight" and "loose" ion pairs has been used to modulate the relative reactivities of ethene and 1 -hexene or cyclopentene in a programmed fashion for LCCTP. Thus, different grades of a monodisperse polyolefin copolymer, such as the poly(ethene-co- 1 -hexene), have been obtained with a single cationic transition-metal catalyst. Through employing long chain alpha-olefins as co-monomers, a novel class of polyethene-based waxes has been synthesized with precisely tunable side-chain crystalline sizes. The discovery of a fundamentally novel Group 4 transition-metal binuclear catalyst has achieved the highly challenging goal of making ethene/propene (E/P) <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers</b> through steric-control over the "regional" and "local" hindrance around the binuclear catalyst molecule. Structural, thermal, surface morphological and mechanical characterizations of these E/P blocky materials unambiguously reveal their blocky nature and unique physical properties regarding to the traditional E/P random copolymers. Finally, LCCTP has been successfully coupled with this binuclear catalyst to provide a variety of polyethene-based blocky copolymers under chain-transfer conditions...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{are used}} to study the equilibrium properties and collapse dynamics of a heteropolymer {{in the presence of}} an explicit solvent in two dimensions. The system consists of a single copolymer chain composed of hydrophobic (H) and hydrophilic (P) monomers, immersed in a Lennard-Jones solvent. We consider HP chains of varying hydrophobic number fraction n(H), defined as the ratio of the number of H monomers to the total number of monomers. We also consider homopolymer chains with a uniform variable degree of hydrophobicity lambda, which describes the hydrophobic-solvent interaction, and which ranges from hydrophilic (lambda= 0) to hydrophobic (lambda= 1). We investigate the effects of varying n(H) and lambda, the HP sequencing, and the solvent density on the equilibrium and collapse properties of the chain. For sufficiently high n(H), we observe a collapse transition for random copolymers from a stretched coil to a liquidlike globule upon a decrease in temperature; the transition temperature decreases with increasing n(H). The transition can also be induced at a fixed (and sufficiently low) temperature by varying n(H) for random copolymers or lambda for homopolymers. We find that polymer size varies inversely with solvent density. The rate of polymer collapse is found to strongly vary inversely with increasing n(H) and lambda for copolymers and homopolymers, respectively. Further, the collapse rates for these two cases are very close for n(H) =lambda, except at lower values (n(H) =lambda approximate to 0. 5), where the homopolymers collapse more rapidly. At moderate densities (rho= 0. 5 - 0. 7, in LJ reduced units), we find that random copolymers collapse more rapidly at low density and that this difference tends to increase with decreasing n(H). At fixed solvent density and n(H) we find the collapse rate differs little for random <b>copolymers,</b> and <b>multi-block</b> <b>copolymers</b> with equal n(H). Finally, the simulations suggest that copolymers tend to collapse by a uniform thickening rather than by first forming locally collapsed clusters which aggregate at longer time. The exception to this appears to be block-copolymers comprised of sufficiently long alternating H and P blocks. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S 0021 - 9606 (00) 51027 - 7]...|$|R
