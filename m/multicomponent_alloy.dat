40|$|A <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloy</b> (Al 0. 5 -Fe 2 -CO-Ni-Cr-Mo-Si) {{cladding}} was fabricated on a {{low-carbon steel}} substrate by the GTAW process using a <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloy</b> filler. The resulting cladding layer was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FE-SEM), X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed {{the presence of an}} FeMoSi phase and a BCC phase in the dendritic and interdendritic regions, respectively. The wear resistance of the cladding layer was four times that of the substrate. The improvement of wear resistance of the cladding layer could be attributed to the high hardness of the dendritic FeMoSi phase and nanoscale precipitation in the interdendritic region. The covalent-dominant strong atomic bonds in FeMoSi enhanced the hardness and wear resistance of the cladding layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The problem of analytically describing both collective and tracer diffusion kinetics is also addressed for the random <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloy</b> by application of a combination of the Manning theory and Holdsworth and Elliott theory. It is found that the overall results from the combined theory agree reasonably well with Monte Carlo results. This combined approach is much more accurate than Mannings approach itself and much more manageable than the almost exact, but unfortunately difficult to use, self-consistent theory of Moleko, Allnatt and Allnatt.

Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe 20 Cr 20 Mn 20 Ni 20 Co 20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloys</b> exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V.

The diffusion in the liquid and solid phases, the growth kinetics of the solidifying microstructures and the velocity of the solid/liquid and solid/solid phase interfaces are considered in the model. Equilibrium between phases is taken into account and computed using dedicated thermodynamic software. The thermodynamic properties and their evolutions during solidification are directly retrieved from a database. Illustration {{is provided by the}} solidification of a Fe-C-Cr alloy. The occurrence of the recalescence due to the growth of the microstructure and the progress of solidification are predicted. The solidification behavior near to recalescence is evaluated.

40|$|International audienceSegregation {{is a key}} {{phenomenon}} {{responsible for}} altering alloys' properties during solidi-fication. The factors that lead to solute partitioning at {{the scale of the}} solidified parts are related to movements of liquid and solid phases. However, when considering a reduced gravitational field, convection forces become less significant compared to other factors. Consequently, predicting segregation in this context requires considering other prevailing driving forces, namely solidification shrinkage that arises from the density difference be-tween the liquid and solid phases. We propose a numerical model that accounts for energy conservation via a thermodynamic database, together with fluid momentum conserva-tion and species conservation to predict segregation driven by solidification shrinkage in a <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloy.</b> We apply it on a specific steel grade for which reduced-gravity experiments were performed via parabolic flights...|$|E
40|$|Multiscale {{computational}} {{materials science}} {{has reached a}} stage where many complicated phenomena or properties that are of great importance to manufacturing can be predicted or explained. The word âab initio studyâ becomes commonplace as the development of density functional theory has enabled the predictions to be independent of experimental data or empirical parameters. For some crucial phenomena, e. g., precipitation processes in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloys,</b> however, challenges exist due to the requirement of an accurate and efficient description of both energetics and kinetics of a complex system. In the present thesis, a systematic methodology has been established for predicting the morphology and realistic formation kinetics of precipitates in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>alloys.</b> Aluminum alloys are chosen as prototype applications of the present methodology, because of the well-known strengthening mechanismâage or precipitation hardening which is a typical and important precipitation process utilized in industrial materials.
