40|$|The main {{objective}} in a chemical plant {{is to improve}} profit while assuring products meet required specifications and satisfy environmental and operational constraints. A sub-objective that directly affects profit ({{main objective}}) {{is to improve the}} control performance of key economic variables in the plant, such as production rate and quality. An optimal control-based approach is proposed to determine a set of measurements and <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> (dominant variables) and to structure them to improve plant profitability. This approach is model-based, and it uses optimal control theory to find the dominant variables that affect economic variables in the plant. First, the measurements and <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> that affect product flow and quality are identified. Then, a decentralized control structure is designed to pair these measurements with the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables.</b> Finally, a model predictive control (MPC) is built on top of the resulting control structure. This is done to manipulate the set point of these loops in order to change the production rate and product quality. Another sub-objective that affects the profit in the plant is to improve the control of inerts. In general, the inventory of the inerts is controlled using a purge. A ne...|$|R
40|$|This work aims {{to study}} the {{behavior}} of fluid mixtures in the dividing wall column, particularly from a controllability point of view. It covers the aspects of design, modeling, and control. A ternary mixture of benzene, toluene, and o-xylene (BTX) is selected as a case study. A controllability analysis for determining and screening the candidate control combinations of the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> is carried out {{with the aid of}} a linearized model using the concept of relative gain array (RGA). The <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> are the reflux (L), the distillate (D), the side stream (S), the bottom (B) and the boilup (V). Based on RGA criterion, two of the candidate combinations are selected to control the column due to the low interaction between control loops. These combinations are DV/SLB and LB/DVS. In each combination the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> are used to control the top level, the bottom level, the top composition, the middle composition and the bottom composition respectively.

40|$|Output {{constraints}} usually {{occur when}} the number of <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> is smaller than the number of output variables.

The respect of the constraints for these outputs has priority over the other outputs with set points.

50|$|A {{major threat}} to the {{validity}} of causal inferences is confounding: Changes in the dependent variable may rather {{be attributed to the}} existence or variations in the degree of a third variable which is related to the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variable.</b> Where spurious relationships cannot be ruled out, rival hypotheses to the original causal inference hypothesis of the researcher may be developed.|$|E

40|$|Optimization of {{the steady}} state {{economic}} efficiency of an industrial {{process is a}} specific task because the decision variables of the optimization (setpoints of the control system) affect the process through the control strategy. Thus, the effects of saturation of a control system {{must be taken into}} account when the gradient of the objective function is estimated and the necessary optimality conditions are checked. In particular, because the optimality conditions cannot be checked directly in the presence of active constraints on the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables,</b> approximations of the steady state values of the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> as functions of the setpoints (static plant model) are needed in order to be able to evaluate the optimality conditions. In this paper an iterative method for optimization of the plant profit rate is proposed avoiding the control saturation and is applied to the Pulp Mill benchmark model optimization. Three different static models describing the steady state values of the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> are constructed and used in the optimization. The results of the optimization are presented and compared against the straightforward single-step optimization of the plant economic efficiency. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In any {{processes}} industry, {{the main}} and primary variable and processes {{that needs to}} be controlled are temperature, level, pressure and flow. This project deals with control and analysis of the first three. Before beginning with any kind of analysis of a system, it needs to be mathematically modelled. Laplace transfer and linearization forms the two most important part of this modelling which is carried out in each and every system considered in this project work. Also higher-order systems can be distinguished {{on the basis of their}} non-interacting or interacting nature. In level process, firstly, a single-tank system is considered where the objective is to maintain the process liquid at a desired level or change it at a pre-determined rate by controlling the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables,</b> firstly one at a time and then all of them being controlled simultaneously at the same time. This is a non-interacting system. Next, a two-tank system is analysed where the objective is two maintain the process liquid in the second tank by controlling the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> which affect the first tank. Here two types of system are considered; interacting and non-interacting. Following this a three-tank, non-interacting system is modelled where the level of the third tank is maintained by <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> affecting the first tank. The responses curves of these systems to various forcing functions such as step, sinusoidal and ramp are generated analysed. In thermal process, the work begins with modelling an adiabatic process followed by a non-adiabatic process. The dynamics of the process is understood by analysing the feature of the solution. The control objective is to maintain the process fluid temperature at the desired value by controlling the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> (such as inlet flow, coolant temperature etc.).

You now know two different ways of analyzing data using two different graphs, either Cartesian or log-log. It will be up to you to decide which to use. Remember: contrastive features, range of variation, and distribution in larger contexts are all necessary to be able to understand something. In physics language that means explore as wide a range of the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> as seems reasonable. In fact, every physical system is linear if you take a narrow range of values. Thus, to insure that your analysis is appropriate, be sure you double or triple, etc. the values you select for your <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R

50|$|In real systems, {{there are}} {{practical}} {{limits to the}} range of the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variable</b> (MV). For example, a heater can be off or fully on, or a valve can be closed or fully open. Adjustments to the gain simultaneously alter the range of error values over which the MV is between these limits. The width of this range, in units of the error variable and therefore of the PV, is called the proportional band (PB). While the gain is useful in mathematical treatments, the proportional band is often used in practical situations. They both refer to the same thing, but the PB has an inverse relationship to gain - higher gains result in narrower PBs, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} feedback control is cruise control on an automobile. Here speed is the measured variable. The operator (driver) adjusts the desired speed set point (e.g. 100 km/hr) and the controller monitors the speed sensor and compares {{the measured speed}} to the set point. Any deviations, such as changes in grade, drag, wind speed or even using a different grade of fuel (for example an ethanol blend) are corrected by the controller making a compensating adjustment to the fuel valve open position, which is the <b>manipulated</b> <b>variable.</b> The controller makes adjustments having information only about the error (magnitude, rate of change or cumulative error) although adjustments known as tuning are used to achieve stable control. The operation of such controllers {{is the subject of}} control theory.|$|E

The applied strategy in this paper is based on nonlinear model predictive control approach. First of all, an appropriate control-oriented model which was accurate enough and simple was derived. Towards utilization of this controller in real-time, the problem was solved off-line for a vast area of reference signals and initial conditions and stored the computed <b>manipulated</b> <b>variables</b> inside look-up tables.
