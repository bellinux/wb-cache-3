40|$|Remote sensing and {{geographical}} information science (GIS) have advanced considerably in recent years. However, {{the potential of}} remote sensing and GIS within the environmental sciences is limited by uncertainty, especially {{in connection with the}} data sets and methods used. In many studies, the issue of uncertainty has been incompletely addressed. The situation has arisen in part from a lack of appreciation of uncertainty and the problems it can cause {{as well as of the}} techniques that may be used to accommodate it. This book provides general overviews on uncertainty in remote sensing and GIS that illustrate the range of uncertainties that may occur, in addition to describing the means of measuring uncertainty and the impacts of uncertainty on analyses and interpretations made. Uncertainty in Remote Sensing and GIS provides readers with comprehensive coverage of this largely undocumented subject: * Relevant to a broad variety of disciplines including geography, environmental science, electrical engineering and statistics * Covers range of material from base overviews to specific applications * Focuses on issues connected with uncertainty at various points along typical data analysis chains used in remote sensing and GIS Written by an international team of researchers drawn from a variety of disciplines, Uncertainty in Remote Sensing and GIS provides focussed discussions on topics of considerable importance to a broad research and user community. The book is invaluable reading for researchers, advanced students and practitioners who want to understand the nature of uncertainty in remote sensing and GIS, its limitations and methods of accommodating it.

40|$|Double-crested {{cormorants}} (Phalacro-corax auritus) are {{a common}} migrant in Arkansas {{in the fall and}} spring. In most years, many linger until freeze-up prior to moving south. In south Arkansas, they may overwinter if climactic conditions are not too severe. Although they were formally year-round residents, there are no current reports of substantial breeding flocks in the state. According to band returns, most cormorants found in Arkansas come from North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Saskatchewan, or Manitoba (James and Neal 1986). Previous investigations by Bivings et al.

40|$|The University of Southampton Multi-Biometric Tunnel {{is a high}} {{performance}} data-capture and recognition system; designed with airports and other busy public areas in mind. It is able to acquire a variety of non-contact biometrics in a non-intrusive manner, requiring minimal subject cooperation. The system uses twelve cameras to record gait and perform three-dimensional reconstruction; the use of volumetric data avoids the problems caused by viewpoint dependence - a serious problem for many gait analysis approaches. The early prototype by Middleton et al. {{was used as the}} basis for creating a new and improved system, designed for the collection of a new large dataset, containing gait, face and ear. Extensive modifications were made, including new software for managing the data collection experiment and processing the dataset. Rigorous procedures were implemented to protect the privacy of participants and ensure consistency between capture sessions. Collection of the new multi-biometric dataset spanned almost one year; resulting in over 200 subjects and 2000 samples. Experiments performed on the newly collected dataset resulted in excellent recognition performance, with all samples correctly classified and a 1. 58 % equal error rate; the matching of subjects against previous samples was also found to be reasonably accurate. The fusion of gait with a simple facial analysis technique found the addition of gait to be beneficial [...] especially at a distance. Further experiments investigated the effect of static and dynamic features, camera misalignment, average silhouette resolution, camera layout, and the matching of outdoor video footage against data from the Biometric Tunnel. The results in this thesis prove significant due to the unprecedented size of the new dataset and the excellent recognition performance achieved; providing a significant body of evidence to support the argument that an individual's gait is unique.
