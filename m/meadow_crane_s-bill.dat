50|$|<b>Crane</b> <b>Meadows</b> National Wildlife Refuge was {{established}} in 1992 to preserve a large, natural wetland complex. The refuge is located in central Minnesota and serves as an important stop for many species of migrating birds. Located within a large watershed that includes Rice, Skunk and Mud Lakes, Platte and Skunk Rivers, Rice and Buckman Creeks, and sedge meadow wetlands, it harbors {{one of the largest}} nesting populations of greater sandhill cranes in Minnesota. Habitats include native tallgrass prairie, oak savanna, and wetlands with stands of wild rice. With a total authorized acquisition boundary of 13540 acre encompassing this important wetland complex and adjacent uplands, <b>Crane</b> <b>Meadows</b> National Wildlife Refuge presently exists as scattered parcels totaling about 2000 acre.

40|$|Mormon Island <b>Crane</b> <b>Meadows</b> (MICM) was {{purchased}} in December 1979 through a cooperative effort of The Nature Conservancy and The Platte River Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust. This 2, 000 acre preserve provides excellent habitat for spring staging migratory water birds and numerous species of other wildlife, In {{order to determine}} sound management practices for the area {{it was necessary to}} conduct an intensive inventory of the flora and fauna occurring there. This checklist represents the results of the bird inventory. Notes on the occurrence of avifauna observed on MICM were recorded from 24 March 1980 to 28 July 1981. Atotal of 178 species of birds (see Table 1) was observed, which represents nearly 44 % of the 405 species recorded in Nebraska (Johnsgard 1980). This deversity is surprising considering the size of the area and the relatively uniform habitat. Sixty-two species are considered either known or probable breeders, which is nearly 31 % of the 201 species breeding in Nebraska (Johnsgard 1980). Two species on the federal endangered species list were encountered, the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), as well as one on the state threatened list, the Least Tern (Sterna albifrons) ...|$|R

40|$|On 31 August 1983 {{at about}} 1200 h COT, the junior author {{discovered}} a Black-shouldered Kite (Elanus caeruleus) on Mormon Island <b>Crane</b> <b>Meadows,</b> Hall County, Nebraska, perched in a plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides). The senior author visited the site at 1800 h COT and observed the {{bird in the}} same tree, with a 25 x spotting scope. It was perched on a dead limb and was carefully observed for 15 min. The next day, 1 September, we visited the area at 1200 hand observed the Kite. We carefully noted plumage and soft parts coloration as follows: eye - reddish brown; cere - greenish yellow; bill - bluish black; tarsus - yellow; cap - streaked with brown and white feathers gradually blending into a pearl gray neck and back; tail - mostly white with a faint, partial terminal band; breast - nearly all white except for remnants of a brownish streaked bib and sparse brownish fleckings on the breast; wings - grayish white except for black coverts; underside in flight - nearly all white except for black wrist markings. Based on these markings we believe it was an immature bird which had nearly completely molted into adult plumage. We flushed the bird and it circled curiously overhead, displaying its coloration. This bird was observed on 22 occasions from 31 August to 8 October. It perched regularly in the cottonwood or one of two nearby boxelders (Acer negundo) ...|$|R

40|$|When Craig Faanes, Grand Island, {{went to the}} Mormon Island <b>Crane</b> <b>Meadows</b> 16 April 1987 {{to watch}} Sandhill Cranes at night he saw a bird that he first took for a Whimbrel. He was {{familiar}} with Whimbrels on both coasts, but the more he studied the bird the more {{he was convinced that}} the bird was an Eskimo Curlew. After he had gone to the natural history museum at UNL and studied a stuffed Eskimo Curlew be was convinced that that was what he had seen. After the date of this sighting Eskimo Curlews were reported from 2 ̆ 2 the Sabine and Aransas wildlife refuges in Texas 2 ̆ 2. (Probably the first reference is to Sabine NWR, Hackberry, Louisiana, near the Texas line. Aransas NWR, near Corpus Christi, is the winter home of the major flock of Whooping Cranes. [...] Ed.) The information above was condensed, by permission from the 1 November 1987 issue of the Omaha World-Herald.

40|$|DIXON COUNTY. In mid-March 1981 {{there were}} {{thousands}} of Snow Geese on the Missouri near Ponca, also Canadas, and we saw 6 White-fronteds up close in a plowed field. We also saw lots of ducks: Pintails, Ring-necks, Redheads, Mallards, and others. We saw Field Sparrows, and in town White-breasted Nuthatches, Robins, and Starlings were everywhere. -Iola Pennington, Wauneta, NE 69045 GREATER PRAIRIE CHICKEN. On 12 December 1980 I flushed a Greater Prairie Chicken. I could clearly see the black band across the tail, indicating a male. A short time afterwards I was visiting at my brother 2 ̆ 7 s place, and they said that they had seen a flock of 13 fly across the road in their area. My observation was in Franklin Co.; theirs in Adams Co. -Harold Turner, Nichol Hotel, Minden, NE 68959 RUDDY TURNSTONES. On 14 May 1981 Mia Hay and I observed 3 Ruddy Turnstones on a sandbar in the south channel of the Platte River, at Mormon Island <b>Crane</b> <b>Meadows,</b> south of Grand Island in Hali Co. This was about 7 : 30 PM. The birds were all in breeding plumage, and they allowed us to get to about 40 yards of them before flying. We watched them for several minutes before we flushed them. I am familiar with them from the Great Lakes and the Massachusetts coast. -Gary Lingle, 619 W. 12 th, Grand Island, NE 68801 LITTLE BLUE HERON. I saw a Little Blue Heron about 11 : 30 AM 23 May 1981, on the Platte River in Buffalo Co., west of the bridge on the Hike-Bike Trail.

On 19 October 1981 two Whooping Cranes in adult plumage were sighted in Sherman County, on the Middle Loup River 3 miles east of Rockville. On 27 October two birds in adult plumage were sighted in Buffalo County, on the South Loup River 7 miles west and. 5 mile north of Pleasanton. Both of these sightings were verified by state or federal wildlife biologists or conservation officers. The following records of a radio-tagged chick and its parents were made by following them in an airplane on their southward migration from Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. They spent the night of 21 October in northeast Montana, west of Medicine Creek National Wildlife Refuge. The next day (22 October) They flew nonstop kJ Gordon Creek, in Cherry County 4. 5 miles south and 2. 5 miles west of Merritt Reservoir. On 23 October they flew to the Wood River, in Custer County 1 mile northwest of Oconto, and the following morning they flew to near Rush Center, Kansas. -Ross Lock, Game and Parks Commission, P. O.
