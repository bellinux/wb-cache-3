5|$|During {{development}} of the Seattle <b>Monorail</b> Project in the early 2000s, an elevated <b>monorail</b> station at Madison Street on 2nd Avenue was proposed in the plaza of the Federal Reserve Bank Building but was ultimately not built.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over {{almost the entire}} town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is frustrated with the town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the <b>monorail</b> is unsafe and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he attend Lanley's institute of <b>monorail</b> conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the <b>monorail</b> conductor.|$|E
5|$|After {{being caught}} by the Environmental Protection Agency dumping nuclear waste in the city park, Mr. Burns is fined $3 million. A town meeting is held so that the {{citizens}} can decide how to spend the money. Marge suggests that the city {{use the money to}} fix Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town is about to vote in favor when someone new to town, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley, suggests that Springfield construct a city <b>monorail.</b> After being swayed by a song, the now enthused townspeople decide to build the <b>monorail.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several {{accidents}} and injuries have {{occurred on the}} <b>monorails</b> since Walt Disney World opened, with one death. On July 5, 2009, a driver was pronounced dead in transit from the site after two <b>monorails</b> (Pink and Purple), collided. It was the first, and only, fatal accident in the <b>monorail's</b> history.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920-1930s {{theoretical}} and practical works on <b>monorails</b> were conducted by Vyacheslav Petrovich Tikhostsky and his colleagues. Several experimental <b>monorails</b> were built: Sipyaginskaya, Solotchinskaya, Lyskovskaya and Redkinskaya.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>monorails</b> {{depend on}} a large solid beam as the vehicles' running surface. There {{are a number of}} {{competing}} designs divided into two broad classes, straddle-beam and suspended <b>monorails.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the maiden}} voyage of the Springfield <b>monorail,</b> Lanley {{arranges}} for a well-attended opening ceremony, which will divert the town's attention while he escapes {{on a plane}} to Tahiti. The whole town turns out, and Leonard Nimoy is the guest of honor. The <b>monorail</b> departs just before Marge and Cobb arrive. Although it runs normally at the start, the controls soon malfunction and immediately begins to over-speed around the track, leaving Homer, Bart, and the passengers in danger, as the monorail's electricity cannot be shut off due to it being solar powered.|$|E
5|$|For Batman Begins, Nolan {{preferred}} traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale {{models were}} used to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple. There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, {{and some of the}} exterior <b>monorail</b> shots. The climactic <b>monorail</b> sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.|$|E
5|$|Like the Island in , Nuka-World {{is outside}} the Commonwealth. The player can access Nuka-World by riding a <b>monorail</b> called the Nuka-Express.|$|E
50|$|Slope {{cars are}} small {{automated}} <b>monorails</b> {{found in the}} various parts of Japan. Unlike the <b>monorails</b> above, slope cars are not legally considered as railways. Similar concepts include Raxcars and Monoriders.|$|R
5000|$|Russian <b>monorails</b> [...] {{date back}} to the 19th century. Russia was a pioneer in the design and {{construction}} of <b>monorails,</b> from early horse-drawn models to later electrical and magnetic levitation systems.|$|R
50|$|Current <b>monorails</b> {{are capable}} of more {{efficient}} switching than in the past. With suspended <b>monorails,</b> switching may be accomplished by moving flanges inside the beamway to shift trains to one line or another.|$|R
5|$|Previously, {{there had}} been plans to extend the <b>monorail</b> system which connects many of the major area hotels and the Las Vegas Convention Center to the airport. In December 2006, Clark County {{approved}} plans for the extension, although funding was not specified. In its presentation to the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee in early 2016, Las Vegas <b>Monorail</b> expressed its continued interest in the extension. However, the project is largely no longer under consideration due to its high cost.|$|E
5|$|Ra's loads the {{microwave}} emitter onto Gotham's <b>monorail</b> system, intending {{to release the}} drug as the train travels toward the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the <b>monorail</b> and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy {{a section of the}} track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Still annoyed {{about the}} town's lack of {{understanding}} of the <b>monorail,</b> Marge visits Lanley to question his motives, and discovers a notebook containing drawings which reveal Lanley’s intention to run off with bags of money skimmed from the <b>monorail</b> project while everyone else falls victim to his faulty train. Marge immediately drives to North Haverbrook, which Lanley mentioned was a previous purchaser of one of his monorails. She discovers that the town is in ruins. While exploring, Marge meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed Lanley's North Haverbrook <b>monorail.</b> Cobb explains that Lanley embezzled construction funds through shoddy workmanship and materials, and that the entire project was a scam. Realizing Marge believes him, he offers his assistance in helping to prevent the same fate from happening to Springfield.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monorails</b> were {{developed}} to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. <b>Monorails</b> represent a relatively {{small part of the}} overall railway field.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, {{these lines}} are not <b>monorails,</b> though they {{resemble}} one at first glance. The rail {{in the center}} of the track serve only to guide the train, not support it, so they don't qualify as <b>monorails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traversers {{are used}} on <b>monorails</b> and maglevs.|$|R
5|$|As planned, the {{exposition}} {{left behind}} a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle's economic and cultural life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space Needle and Alweg <b>monorail,</b> as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E
5|$|Buckinghamshire County Council's architect, Fred Pooley, {{had spent}} {{considerable}} {{time in the}} early sixties developing ideas for a new town in the Bletchley and Wolverton area. He developed a futuristic proposal based on a <b>monorail</b> linking a series of individual townships to a major town centre. The county council published the proposals in 1966, {{but it was too}} late to influence the government.|$|E
5|$|Clare Winger {{was born}} on January 18, 1891, in Freeport, Illinois and later {{attended}} Smith College in Massachusetts. In 1912 she married Frank Clyde Harris. Her husband was an architect and engineer who served in World War I and was chief engineer with the Loudon Machinery Company in Iowa {{and one of the}} organizers of the American <b>Monorail</b> Company of Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5000|$|Innovia <b>Monorails</b> are all fully {{automated}} {{and use a}} variety of train control technologies. However, the Riyadh and São Paulo <b>monorails</b> are both equipped with CITYFLO 650 communications-based train control. Driverless operation offers many advantages including improved safety, high reliability, shorter headways between trains and lower maintenance costs.|$|R

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1961, Butlin began work on his camp in Minehead. The site {{opened to the public}} on 26 May 1962 having cost £2 million to construct. Over the next decade several attractions were added to the site; a {{miniature}} railway was added in 1964, chairlifts in 1965, and a <b>monorail</b> in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the journey}} resumes, the train moves across an {{overpass}} and passes by the façade of the It's a Small World water-based dark ride attraction before reaching a fuel pump {{disguised as a}} boulder, where the train stops if the locomotive needs to be refueled. From this point, the train cuts across an access road and goes underneath the track of the Disneyland <b>Monorail</b> before stopping at Tomorrowland Station in the Tomorrowland section.|$|E
5|$|A montage shows {{visitors}} on {{the rides}} at Walt Disney World Resort {{and the many}} visuals and animatronics that accompany the rides. It ends with a man losing his head while riding Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. On {{the last day of}} a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call on the balcony of the Contemporary Resort Hotel with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the <b>monorail</b> to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.|$|E

5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center <b>Monorail,</b> a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of urban public transport schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of <b>monorail</b> systems and metro-style systems.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy was not {{originally}} {{considered for}} the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the <b>monorail,</b> as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down. Instead, George Takei was asked to guest star as he had appeared on the show once before. After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying {{he did not want}} to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority). As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted.|$|E
50|$|Unlike some trams {{and light}} rail systems, modern <b>monorails</b> are always {{separated}} from other traffic and pedestrians. They are both guided and supported via {{interaction with the}} same single beam, in contrast to other guided systems like rubber-tyred metros, the Sapporo Municipal Subway; or guided buses or trams, such as Translohr. <b>Monorails</b> do not use pantographs.|$|R
