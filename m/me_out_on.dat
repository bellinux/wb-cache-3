[...] He also attributes his mother's idols – Simon & Garfunkel, Fleetwood Mac, and The Beatles – to shaping his musical style, calling them [...] "a {{huge part of}} my upbringing".

500|$|Much of {{the initial}} {{coverage}} of the event highlighted {{the difference between the}} reaction to Bush and Bridges (very positive) and that for Colbert (far more muted).

2500|$|On the {{day after}} the wedding, Rev. Charles Smith, District Superintendent of the Northern California District of the Church of the Nazarene, {{contacted}} Norris and advised him that he had no right under Nazarene polity to conduct the wedding of a person who had divorced unless adultery was the grounds, and that he would [...] "unfrock him for marrying a person divorced on grounds outside those recognized by the church". Norris was confident he would be exonerated after Nazarene authorities investigated the situation. On Monday, January 28, 1929, Norris met with Wedge in the bridal suite on the seventh floor of the Hotel Oakland, and quarreled about the wedding. Norris initially refused to file the paperwork for the wedding, as he claimed Wedge had lied to him about the marital status of Holloway, creating the impression that she was a widow. After Wedge threatened to file a mandamus suit against him, Norris filed the paperwork at the hall of records. Wedge indicated that: [...] "To save his own ecclesiastical hide, Norris would like to get <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a limb and then saw the limb off". Wedge insisted that even if the church did not recognize the legality of his wedding, that [...] "we are married in the eyes of God and that is enough to satisfy me". Wedge also indicated that while he expected never to be given a pastorate again, that {{he had no intention of}} resigning from the church: [...] "They may keep me from preaching, but they won't kick me out of the church". Wedge planned to train and manage his son, who was a promising amateur boxer, but on January 30, 1929, Hugh informed his father that he had decided not to sign a contract with him, and to remain in high school and then work in a foundry. After this argument with his son, Wedge indicated that he lost control and contemplated throwing himself out of his hotel window to spare his bride anymore humiliation.|$|E
