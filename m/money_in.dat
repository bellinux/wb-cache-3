5|$|On July 18, at the <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> the Bank pay-per-view, The Miz won a <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> the Bank ladder {{match to}} win a {{contract}} for a WWE Championship match that he could utilize at any time {{over the next year}} and became the first performer to win <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> the Bank while being a champion and the second, after Rob Van Dam, to hold a <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> the Bank contract and a title at the same time. Over the next few weeks, The Miz attempted to cash in his <b>Money</b> <b>in</b> the Bank contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E
