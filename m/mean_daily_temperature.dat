Opuntia ficus-indica is similar to CAM species which are not salt-tolerant in their root zone where growth may cease under high salt concentration.

25|$|Malaita's {{climate is}} {{extremely}} wet. It {{is located in}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone ("Doldrums"), with its fickle weather patterns. The sun is at zenith over Malaita, and thus the effect is most pronounced, in November and February. Trade winds come during the southern hemisphere's winter, and from about April to August they blow from the southeast fairly steadily. During the summer, fringes of monsoon blow over the island. Because of the surrounding sea, air temperatures are fairly consistent, with a difference between daily highs and lows averaging to 13.6°F However, across the year, the difference is much less; the <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> <b>temperature</b> in the warmest month is only 3.4°F warmer than that of the coolest. Rainfall is heavy and there is constant high humidity. The most common daily pattern follows an adiabatic process, with a calm, clear morning, followed by a breeze blowing in from higher pressures over the sea, culminating in a cloudy and drizzly afternoon. At night, the weather pattern reverses, and drizzle and heavy dew dissipate the cloud cover for the morning. Tropical cyclones are the only violent weather, but they can be destructive.|$|E

Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon.

40|$|In North America (NA), {{trends in}} summer surface air {{temperatures}} vary on decadal time scales, and some regions have temperature trends that exhibit {{a lack of}} warming in 1982 - 2009. From a surface energy balance perspective, the summer <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> maximum <b>temperature</b> change can be affected by changes in solar heating {{that are associated with}} cloud cover change and changes in surface evaporative cooling caused by different precipitation and land surface wetness, but little is known about regional cloud cover and precipitation feedbacks to decadal temperature trends.

Results show that summer <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> maximum <b>temperature</b> variance is largely explained by changes in cloud cover and precipitation.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{timing of}} plant development is regulated by environmental cues. Flowering time {{is influenced by}} the temperature and photoperiod experienced during vegetative growth, while germination timing is affected by temperatures during seed maturation and after dispersal. The timing of each developmental transition also determines seasonal conditions experienced during subsequent life stages, however the significance and stability of these interactions are not well understood. This work aimed to further an understanding of the environmental regulation of plant phenology by creating a multi-stage life history model based on Arabidopsis thaliana. Laboratory and field studies were used to inform predictive models of seed development and seed dormancy. The time required to complete seed development was mainly affected by temperature, and was therefore sensitive to seasonal flowering time. <b>Mean</b> <b>daily</b> <b>temperatures</b> at the end of seed maturation had the greatest influence on rates of primary dormancy loss, and post-dispersal temperatures determined rates of secondary dormancy induction. Germination probabilities were predicted by modelling frequencies of primary and secondary dormancy within the seed population. This revealed an abrupt switch from low to high germination when <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> <b>temperatures</b> exceeded 14 °C. Thermoinhibition was also predicted at high temperatures due to rapid secondary dormancy induction. Combining models with a previously described model of flowering time provided a framework for investigating the effects of perturbations on entire life history phenology. Seed set timing in spring and winter annuals was consistently predicted to coincide with <b>mean</b> <b>daily</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 14 °C in locations across Northern Europe, resulting in the production of both dormant and non-dormant offspring. Phenotypic plasticity at each growth phase also served to buffer against modest perturbations in germination date, flowering date, and climate in order to maintain these specific dispersal conditions. This result was interpreted as evidence for a robust bet-hedging germination strategy...|$|R
