40|$|Processor emulators {{are widely}} used to provide {{isolation}} and instrumentation of binary software. However they have proved difficult to implement correctly: processor specifications have many corner cases that are not exercised by common workloads. It is untenable to base other system security properties on the correctness of emulators that have received only ad-hoc testing. To obtain emulators that are worthy of the required trust, we propose a technique to explore a high-fidelity emulator with symbolic execution, and then lift those test cases to test a lower-fidelity emulator. The high-fidelity emulator serves {{as a proxy for}} the hardware specification, but we can also further validate by running the tests on real hardware. We implement our approach and apply it to generate about 610, 000 test cases; for about 95 % of the instructions we achieve complete path coverage. The tests reveal thousands of individual differences; we analyze those differences to shed light on a number of root causes, such as atomicity violations and <b>missing</b> <b>security</b> <b>features.</b> D. 2. 5 [Testing and Debug-Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E
40|$|In our thesis we {{examined}} {{a database of}} boats, their drives and their owners. The data stored in the database is of inferior quality due to flawed design and <b>missing</b> <b>security</b> <b>features.</b> Field types are inconsistent, they lack keys and sometimes even important information. Such system is adequate for its primary use but is not suited for our application and may cause problems in interconnectivity of data with other databases. So the main objective of the thesis is to design an application that {{would allow us to}} successfully browse through the data despite all the flaws. The data would then be presented on screen, exported to the Excel program or printed if needed. We would also like to connect the data with other databases, such as the database of postcodes. That would enable us to search also by the post name instead of only by postcodes. The presented data would also be enriched with more information. In order to enforce the boat tax law (Uradni list RS št. 117 / 2006) the tax office requires a database of boats and their owners. The data needed to calculate the lawfully prescribed taxes are required to identify the owner or owners of the boat and the boat itself as well as to define the boat's properties together with the type of the drive and power output. This requires a thorough maintenance of the database and its ability to connect with other relevant data sources. We want to standardize the data output to enable easy exchange of information with other European Union member states...|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000 Bender {{asked to be}} {{relieved}} of his duties as a full-time reporter {{in order to have}} more time for writing a non-fiction book about the arcane international high security printing industry that prints our banknotes, passports, and credit cards. However, he remained affiliated with FAZ as a reporter for specialized topics. In view of the upcoming common European currency, Bender as early as 1996 had started collecting material for a book on this subject even though frequent travelling for his newspaper made this additional task very difficult. As one result of this research, Bender in 2000, broke in FAZ the story of the misprint of more than 300 million pieces of 100-euro banknotes by Germany's high security printer Giesecke & Devrient. Bender's story went around the world, forcing the Munich-based company to recall the affected banknotes from the European Central Bank, and adding the <b>missing</b> <b>security</b> <b>feature</b> at an estimated additional cost of 15 million euro. Later it was Bender, who with several pieces published by FAZ, for the first time publicly denounced the shocking events surrounding the privatization of Bundesdruckerei, Berlin. This highly reputed German state banknote printer, because of the greed and incompetence of the people involved in the privatization process, was brought to the brink of collapse. It {{was one of the biggest}} economic scandals in post-war Germany.|$|R
