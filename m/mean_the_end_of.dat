5|$|The post-expansion {{financial}} crisis would eventually elicit {{a response from}} the NFL. By the end of 1996, speculation was rampant that if the NFL placed a franchise in Toronto, it would <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the CFL. Instead, {{in exchange for a}} new player agreement between the leagues, the NFL provided the CFL franchises with marketing assistance and a $3 million loan in 1997.|$|E
5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet demands would <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Finnish neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When {{the chairman of the}} Finnish Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the Finnish government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the world should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E

5|$|Henry Ward Beecher became {{involved}} in many social issues of his day, most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated {{the breakup of the}} Union if it would also <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> slavery. A personal turning point for Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their father had been offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two thousand dollars to secure the girls' freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.|$|E
5|$|In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart {{were on a}} {{fundraising}} trip to Berlin, a mutiny {{broke out}} within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin {{on the condition that}} he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP: Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party. In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, replacing Drexler, by a vote of 533to1.|$|E

Both Brazil and Argentina remained deeply involved in Paraguay {{as a result of}} their connections with Paraguay's rival political forces. The political rivalry between future Liberals and Colorados started already in 1869 before the war was over, when the terms Azules (Blues) and Colorados (Reds) first appeared.|$|E

The next day the 58th Inf. lost an officer and three more men when a powder plant blew up in Munchshaf. Sabotage was suspected. It is believed that these were the last official wartime casualties of the division.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, Boltzmann's science was being {{threatened}} by another philosophical objection. Some physicists, including Mach's student, Gustav Jaumann, interpreted Hertz to mean that all electromagnetic behavior is continuous, as if there were no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical behavior were ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it could <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|Awakening can <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> sleep, {{or simply}} a moment to survey the {{environment}} and readjust body position before falling back asleep. Sleepers typically awaken soon {{after the end of}} a REM phase or sometimes in the middle of REM. Internal circadian indicators, along with successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about awakening {{and the end of the}} sleep episode. Awakening involves heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.|$|E
25|$|Though he knew {{repealing}} the laws would <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his ministry, Peel {{decided to do}} so. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine {{as an excuse to}} repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel were convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.|$|E
25|$|Toftoy {{retired from}} the Army due to health reasons in 1960 and moved to Treasure Island, Florida, where he had a private boat landing {{and access to the}} Gulf of Mexico for indulging in his passion for fishing. Retirement, however, did not <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Toftoy's {{contributions}} to the field in which he had been so dominant a figure. Among other activities, he was retained as a consultant by the Northrop Corporation and by the Brown Engineering Company. Involvement in civic affairs, which had been so meaningful at Huntsville, Alabama, continued after his retirement, and was climaxed when he was elected President of the Isle of Capri Civic Association in 1962.|$|E

However, Curly's health continued to deteriorate, and it became clear that he could not return. Director Jules White had turned to comedian Buddy Hackett as a replacement, but Hackett declined, and Shemp resumed being a Stooge. Curly remained ill until his death of a cerebral hemorrhage from additional strokes on January 18, 1952.|$|E
25|$|Theorems {{establishing}} {{the uniqueness of}} the loop representation as defined by Ashtekar et al. (i.e. a certain concrete realization of a Hilbert space and associated operators reproducing the correct loop algebra – the realization that everybody was using) have been given by two groups (Lewandowski, Okolow, Sahlmann and Thiemann; and Christian Fleischhack). Before this result was established it was not known whether there could be other examples of Hilbert spaces with operators invoking the same loop algebra, other realizations, not equivalent to the one that had been used so far. These uniqueness theorems imply no others exist and so if LQG does not have the correct semiclassical limit then this would <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the loop representation of quantum gravity altogether.|$|E
25|$|After {{celebrating the}} birth of his son, the first child with Morgan Beck, Miller {{announced}} in October, that he would skip another season with the intention {{to spend more time with}} his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this might <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his skiing career, Miller denied it in December stating that although he would never do the full circuit again, there's a likelihood that he'd return to racing occasionally. He terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction to not compete with other skis than HEAD in the World Cup circuit or World Alpine Ski Championships. He was then able to sign a deal with US-based ski manufacturer Bomber Ski, which also made Miller the brand's part owner.|$|E
