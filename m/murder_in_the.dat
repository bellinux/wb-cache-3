5|$|Burnt Norton is {{the first}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. He created it while working on his play <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral and it was first {{published}} in his Collected Poems 1909–1935 (1936). The poem's title refers to a Cotswolds manor house Eliot visited. The manor's garden served as an important image within the poem. Structurally, the poem is based on Eliot's The Waste Land with passages of the poem related to those excised from <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept and}} origin of Burnt Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea {{of time and the}} concept that only the present moment really matters because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{initially}} {{aspired to}} be a professional footballer, but spondylolysis forced him out of the sport. After joining the National Youth Theatre and studying Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia, he became an actor in 2003, performing in plays like <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral, Fresh Kills, The History Boys, and On the Shore of the Wide World in London theatres.

5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E
5|$|Four Quartets {{is a set}} of four poems {{written by}} T. S. Eliot that were {{published}} individually over a six-year period. The first poem, Burnt Norton, was written and published with a collection of his early works following the production of Eliot's play <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral. After a few years, Eliot composed the other three poems, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and Little Gidding, which were written during World War II and the air-raids on Great Britain. The poems were not collected until Eliot's New York publisher printed them together in 1943. They were first published as a series in Great Britain in 1941 to 1942 towards the end of Eliot's poetic career.|$|E
50|$|According to Lam, {{the script}} of Evangeline was {{motivated}} by reactions to <b>the</b> Pickton <b>murders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vancouver area, and the Highway of Tears <b>murders</b> <b>in</b> northern British Columbia.|$|R

5|$|Henry II {{appears as}} a {{character}} in several modern plays and films. He is a central character in James Goldman's 1966 play The Lion in Winter, set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king although, as Goldman acknowledges, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional. The Lion in Winter {{has proved to be}} an enduring representation of Henry, being turned into an Academy-Award-winning film and remade in 2003 for television. Henry also appears in the play Becket by Jean Anouilh, filmed in 1964; once again, however, the character of the King is deliberately fictitious, driven by the need for drama between Henry and Becket in the play. The Becket controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and Becket form the basis both {{for a discussion of the}} more superficial events of Becket's death, and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. They {{asked if he was}} gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with <b>murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The <b>Murder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E
50|$|As an {{assistant}} director, {{he worked on}} Tod BrowningsDracula (1931) and Robert Floreys <b>Murders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rue Morgue (1932).|$|R
