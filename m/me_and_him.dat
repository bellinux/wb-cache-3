500|$|On 16 February 2010, Oasis won {{the award}} for Best Brit Album of the Last 30 Years at the 2010 Brit Awards. Liam Gallagher {{collected}} the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not his brother, Noel. Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being about me and Noel, {{the last couple of}} months has pretty much been all about <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>him</b> so I thought it was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I thought it was a nice gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual."

500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>Him.</b> The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>him,</b> our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E

We was trying to go to the radio and not do the typical R {{featured}} record. I was trying to be more creative and find somebody who can do melody as well as rap on the record. Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature. That's why I call this a duet as opposed to a feature".|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with Vibe, record producer Boi-1da confirmed working significantly {{on the album}} saying, [...] "It’s new-age with that old Mobb twist to it. I was {{a big fan of}} Mobb Deep and Havoc's production, so I just reached out and <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>him</b> have been producing records together, sending stuff back and forth. I can say that I have some records on the new Mobb Deep album that me and Havoc did together. It’s something I knocked off my bucket list." [...] During an {{interview with}} XXL and Prodigy later that month, he stated that Havoc, The Alchemist, Illmind and Boi-1da would provide production on the album. He also elaborated on the unreleased material saying that it would contain never before heard skits and verses by Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Nas, N.O.R.E. and Mobb Deep. Prodigy then confirmed in March 2014, that the album would feature rappers Bun B and Juicy J on a song called [...] "Legendary". The track listing revealed guest appearances on the album from French Montana, The LOX, Bun B, Juicy J, Mack Wilds, Big Noyd, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg.|$|E

Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>him</b> and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E
2500|$|Zombie was {{responsible}} for writing all of the album's songs, while he initially worked with Nine Inch Nails member Charlie Clouser to produce the album. Zombie and Clouser opted for a more [...] "electronic" [...] sound for the record, using various music software while working on the project. Clouser claimed [...] "It was <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>him</b> with a computer, {{trying to figure out}} a direction we wanted to go in. We had {{a pretty good idea of}} the kind of elements that would be included and an overall concept of the segues between songs and the musical interludes. We even started coming up with the core riffs for the album." [...] Early into the process of recording the album, Clouser became unable to work on the album due to other obligations; however, he recommended that Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey for the remainder of the album. Humphrey had previously worked with artists such as Metallica prior to producing the album. Due to his departure, the only song on the album produced by Clouser is [...] "Superbeast". Zombie stated that making the album was [...] "weird", and he didn't believe it would do well, as [...] "most debut solo records don't." ...|$|E
