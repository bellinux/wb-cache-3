5|$|Khaba's name {{appears on}} nine {{polished}} stone bowls, variously made of <b>magnesite,</b> travertine, and diorite, which {{were found at}} the archaeological locales of Zawyet el'Aryan, Abusir, and Naga-ed-Deir. The bowls were found mostly intact; they show only the king's serekh name on their polished surfaces. As was conventional {{at the time they}} were made, they contain no additional inscriptions for context.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is {{en route}} to the Berengarius system, one of the {{proposed}} locations for a Starfleet starbase, when it is approached by an Orion Syndicate vessel. Captain Archer is invited to visit the Orion ship by its captain, Harrad-Sar. During the visit, Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three Orion dancers, Navaar, D'Nesh, and Maras. Archer negotiates with Harrad-Sar and they agree to a joint <b>magnesite</b> mining operation, and the three slaves are given to him. They return to Enterprise with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough Ironworks. Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three coke fired haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the Bessemer process for making steel, in the case when the ore is rich in phosphorus, and an alkaline rock (dolomite, limestone or <b>magnesite)</b> is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|E
5|$|Widgiemoolthalite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral. It is found overlaying nickel sulfide that has undergone weathering, often in hollow spaces on gaspéite surfaces, and often exhibiting fibrous and rarely massive crystal habits. Other minerals associated with widgiemoolthalite include annabergite, carrboydite, dolomite, glaukosphaerite, hydrohonessite, kambaldaite, <b>magnesite,</b> nepouite, nullaginite, olivenite, otwayite, paratacamite, pecoraite, reevesite, retgersite, and takovite. Two additional unnamed minerals were also reported as associated secondary minerals from the 132 North site, the only locality at which widgiemoolthalite has been found. The 132 North waste pile from which widgiemoolthalite was first recovered {{is no longer}} in existence, making it a rare mineral. In support of the designation of an Anthropocene epoch, the existence and provenance of widgiemoolthalite, along with 207 other mineral species, have been cited as evidence of uniquely human action upon global stratigraphy.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{carbonate}} is ordinarily {{obtained by}} mining the mineral <b>magnesite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anshan is rich {{in other}} mineral wealth too. The {{southern}} and south eastern areas of Anshan are rich in <b>magnesite.</b> Reserves of <b>magnesite</b> here are equivalent to {{a quarter of all}} worldwide reserves. Anshan also has the world's largest reserve of talcum, accounting for fully one third of the entire world supply. The Xiuyan area of Anshan is known for the production of the precious stone, Jade. The largest single jade stone ever found came from Xiuyan, now carved into the form of a Buddha, it is a major tourist attraction in the area.|$|E
25|$|One {{proposed}} {{reaction is}} that of the olivine-rich rock dunite, or its hydrated equivalent serpentinite with carbon dioxide to form the carbonate mineral <b>magnesite,</b> plus silica and iron oxide (magnetite).|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s it {{was also}} {{relatively}} common for <b>magnesite,</b> a chloride rich carbonate mineral, {{to be used as}} a floor-topping material. This was done principally as a levelling and sound attenuating layer. However it is now known that when these materials come into contact with moisture they produce a weak solution of hydrochloric acid due to the presence of chlorides in the <b>magnesite.</b> Over a period of time (typically decades) the solution causes corrosion of the embedded steel rebars. This was most commonly found in wet areas or areas repeatedly exposed to moisture.|$|E
25|$|Anshan has a {{population}} of 3.65 million at the 2010 census. Anshan holds one third of the worlds supply of talcum Anshan holds a quarter of the worlds reserves of <b>magnesite</b> Anshan also produced the largest ever jade stone, now a local tourist attraction carved as a Buddha.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{magnesium}} carbonate forms are the anhydrous salt called <b>magnesite</b> (MgCO3) and the di, tri, and pentahydrates known as barringtonite (MgCO3·2 H2O), nesquehonite (MgCO3·3 H2O), and lansfordite (MgCO3·5 H2O), respectively. Some basic forms such as artinite (MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·3 H2O), hydromagnesite (4 MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·4 H2O), and dypingite (4 MgCO3· Mg(OH)2·5 H2O) also occur as minerals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnesite</b> {{consists}} of white trigonal crystals. The anhydrous salt is practically insoluble in water, acetone, and ammonia. All forms of magnesium carbonate react in acids. Magnesium carbonate crystallizes in the calcite structure where in Mg2+ {{is surrounded by}} six oxygen atoms. The dihydrate one has a triclinic structure, while the trihydrate has a monoclinic structure.|$|E
25|$|The factor {{controlling}} the mineral assemblage is the partial pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} within the metamorphic fluid, called the XCO2. If XCO2 is above 0.5, the metamorphic reactions favor formation of talc, <b>magnesite</b> (magnesium carbonate), and tremolite amphibole. These are classed as talc-carbonation reactions. Below XCO2 of 0.5, metamorphic reactions {{in the presence of}} water favor production of serpentinite.|$|E
25|$|The second finding, {{discovered}} in 2007, is a polished stone bowl made of <b>magnesite,</b> found at South-Abusir in the mastaba tomb AS-54, {{belonging to a}} high official, whose name is yet unknown to archaeologists. The stone vessel inscription mentions Huni's name without a cartouche, but with the Njswt-Bity title. The orthography of the hieroglyphs that form Huni's name makes a reading as Njswt-Hw or Hw-en-Niswt plausible.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{resources}} include lead, copper, chromium, and zinc, {{the reserves}} {{of which are}} almost exhausted. There is {{a considerable amount of}} lignite, however because its ash and sulfur ratios are high, it suitable only for industrial use. <b>Magnesite,</b> fire clay, gypsum, manganese, diatomite, marble, rock salt and perlite are also present. The few natural geothermal resources, except one, are not suitable for economic investments, and they are used as natural springs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{destructive}} tests may, however, be necessary; for example, {{the application}} of diluted hydrochloric acid will cause the carbonates odontolite and <b>magnesite</b> to effervesce and howlite to turn green, while a heated probe may give rise to the pungent smell so indicative of plastic. Differences in specific gravity, refractive index, light absorption (as evident in a material's absorption spectrum), and other physical and optical properties are also considered as means of separation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are thus}} two main classes of {{metamorphic}} komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form {{a series of}} rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, <b>magnesite</b> or dolomite and tremolite. Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, brucite. Traces of talc, tremolite and dolomite may be present, as it is very rare that no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, anthophyllite, enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates.|$|E
25|$|Records {{show that}} Empire Celia spent the {{remainder}} of the war years serving in the Arctic Convoys. She was a member of Convoy JW54A, which departed Loch Ewe on 15 November 1943 and arrived at the Kola Inlet, Soviet Union on 24 November. She returned to the United Kingdom as a member of Convoy RA 55A, which departed the Kola Inlet on 22 December and arrived at Liverpool on 1 January 1944. She was carrying a cargo of <b>magnesite</b> and pit props.|$|E
25|$|The {{major areas}} of {{production}} in 2004 were coal (nearly 2billiontons), iron ore (310milliontons), crude petroleum (175milliontons), natural gas (41million cubic meters), antimony ore (110,000tons), tin concentrates (110,000 tons), nickel ore (64,000tons), tungsten concentrates (67,000tons), unrefined salt (37milliontons), vanadium (40,000tons), and molybdenum ore (29,000tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were bauxite, gypsum, barite, <b>magnesite,</b> talc and related minerals, manganese ore, fluorspar, and zinc. In addition, China produced 2,450tons {{of silver and}} 215tons of gold in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.|$|E
25|$|Sited on {{the edge}} of the Liao River plains, Anshan has wide flat lands in the west and central regions that develop into hilly and the mountainous terrain on the eastern fringes. The area is rich in mineral wealth {{including}} iron ore, coal, <b>magnesite,</b> talcum and jade. The plains of western Anshan are good for agriculture. The large flat fields make it ideal for modern agricultural methods. In total, Anshan contains 24480 hectares of arable land accounting for 26.4% of the total land area. One agricultural product that Anshan has become well known for is the production of Nangua Pears.|$|E
25|$|Crucibles {{began using}} very large flake graphite, and carbon-magnesite brick {{requiring}} {{not quite so}} large flake graphite; for these and others there is now much more flexibility in size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon <b>magnesite</b> bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.|$|E
25|$|Noguchi {{returned}} to New York in 1937. He again {{began to turn}} out portrait busts, and after various proposals was selected for two sculptures. The first of these, a fountain built of automobile parts for the Ford Motor Company's exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair, was thought of poorly by critics and Noguchi alike but nevertheless introduced him to fountain-construction and <b>magnesite.</b> Conversely, his second sculpture, a nine-ton stainless steel bas-relief entitled News, was unveiled over {{the entrance to the}} Associated Press building at the Rockefeller Center in April 1940 to much praise. Following further rejections of his playground designs, Noguchi left on a cross-country road trip with Arshile Gorky and Gorky's fiancée in July 1941, eventually separating from them to go to Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|Miroslav Bárta instead proposes mastaba AS-54 in South-Abusir as {{the most}} {{possible}} burial site. This is promoted by the finding of a polished <b>magnesite</b> bowl, which shows the niswt-bity title of Huni. The mastaba itself was once pretty large and contained large niches and chapels. It also contained a quite large amount of polished dishes, vases and urnes. Contradictorily, nearly all the vessels are undecorated, no ink inscription or carving {{were found on the}} objects. Thus, the name of the true owner is yet unknown. Only one vessel clearly shows Huni's name while a few other might show small traces. Bárta thus sees two possibilities for the owner of the mastaba: it was either a very high ranked official, such as a prince of Huni's time, or king Huni himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} for baskets were sedge root, willow shoots and roots, bulrush or blackroot, redbud shoots, sometimes bracken fern {{and a variety}} of colorful bird feathers, abalone and other types of shells, <b>magnesite</b> beads and sometimes glass beads. Redbud shoots, used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in October. Good redbud is hard to obtain around Ukiah, so it is usually found at Clear Lake. All these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants. They were, after all, living things that were giving themselves for something useful and beautiful. In order to preserve the soil and creek banks, sedge gathering was done with care. The commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found. Dyeing of the bulrush root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts, rusty metal and ashes in water.|$|E
500|$|The {{high heat}} {{resistivity}} and {{high melting point}} makes chromite and chromium(III) oxide a material for high temperature refractory applications, like blast furnaces, cement kilns, molds for the firing of bricks and as foundry sands for the casting of metals. In these applications, the refractory materials are made from mixtures of chromite and <b>magnesite.</b> The use is declining because of the environmental regulations due {{to the possibility of}} the formation of chromium(VI).|$|E
500|$|When {{the uranium}} ore {{is rich in}} such {{minerals}} as dolomite, <b>magnesite,</b> etc., those minerals consume much acid. In this case, the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction. Its main component is an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate, which converts uranium into a complex 4−, which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions. The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low corrosivity (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure: ...|$|E
500|$|Across the park, {{different}} ages of exposed rocks are seen. Stoneyfell quartzite, composed mostly of quartzite with sandstone and some siltstone, is the youngest. Woolshed flat shale is older and {{is composed of}} siltstone, dolomite and some sandstone. The oldest regular exposure is Montacute dolomite, which is a blue-grey dolomite with <b>magnesite,</b> siltstone and sandstone. Quarries {{in the south of}} the park have been mined for Stoneyfell Quartzite. This type of quartzite is a clean, white, feldsparthic quartzite with interbedded thin siltstone layers up to [...] thick occurring at gaps of [...] Ripple marks in this rock clearly indicate its shallow water origin. Next to Newman's Nursery is a quarry with grey to blue silicaceous dolomite used for road material. It contains traces of pyrite and is overlain by phyllite. Tea Tree Gully freestone, as found in the largest quarry in the park, is a feldsparthic sandstone bedded with quartzite. Decay of the feldspar has enabled it to be cut and dressed as a quality building stone. The Tea Tree Gully iron (or silver) mine lies in an iron-rich fault zone. The ore body is ironstone, 150m long, 50m wide and 30m thick (490ft by 160ft by 100ft). It is primarily limonite, detrital quartz and silica. It is thought to have been chemically deposited during the Paleogene and Neogene periods, 2mya to 66mya.|$|E
2500|$|Chromite, talc, <b>magnesite,</b> {{copper and}} slate were also mined at Gundagai.|$|E

2500|$|Vast {{deposits}} of dolomite {{are present in}} the geological record, but the mineral is relatively rare in modern environments. Reproducible, inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite and <b>magnesite</b> were published {{for the first time in}} 1999. Those laboratory experiments showed how the initial precipitation of a metastable [...] "precursor" [...] (such as magnesium calcite) will change gradually into more and more of the stable phase (such as dolomite or <b>magnesite)</b> during periodical intervals of dissolution and re-precipitation. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible geochemical reaction has been coined [...] "breaking Ostwald's step rule".|$|E

2500|$|The {{primary use}} of {{magnesium}} carbonate is {{the production of}} magnesium oxide by calcining. <b>Magnesite</b> and dolomite minerals are used to produce refractory bricks. [...] MgCO3 is also used in flooring, fireproofing, fire extinguishing compositions, cosmetics, dusting powder, and toothpaste. [...] Other applications are as filler material, smoke suppressant in plastics, a reinforcing agent in neoprene rubber, a drying agent, a laxative to loosen the bowels, and color retention in foods. In addition, high purity magnesium carbonate is used as antacid and as an additive in table salt to keep it free flowing.|$|E
2500|$|In this process, [...] is exothermically [...] {{reacted with}} {{available}} metal oxides, {{which in turn}} produces stable carbonates (e.g. calcite, <b>magnesite).</b> This process occurs naturally over many years and is responsible for {{a great amount of}} surface limestone. [...] The idea of using olivine has been promoted by the geochemist Prof. Schuiling. The reaction rate can be made faster, for example, with a catalyst or by reacting at higher temperatures and/or pressures, or by pre-treatment of the minerals, although this method can require additional energy. The IPCC estimates that a power plant equipped with CCS using mineral storage will need 60–180% more energy than a power plant without CCS.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{imitation}} of turquoise encountered today is dyed howlite and <b>magnesite,</b> both white {{in their natural}} states, and the former also having natural (and convincing) black veining {{similar to that of}} turquoise. Dyed chalcedony, jasper, and marble is less common, and much less convincing. Other natural materials occasionally confused with or used in lieu of turquoise include: variscite and [...] faustite; chrysocolla (especially when impregnating quartz); lazulite; smithsonite; hemimorphite; wardite; and a fossil bone or tooth called odontolite or [...] "bone turquoise", coloured blue naturally by the mineral vivianite. While rarely encountered today, odontolite was once mined in large quantities—specifically for its use as a substitute for turquoise—in southern France.|$|E
2500|$|The name Pomo {{derives from}} a {{conflation}} of the Pomo words [...] and [...] It originally meant [...] "those who live at red earth hole" [...] and {{was once the}} name of a village in southern Potter Valley near the present-day community of Pomo. [...] It may have referred to local deposits of the red mineral <b>magnesite,</b> used for red beads, or to the reddish earth and clay, such as hematite, mined in the area. In the Northern Pomo dialect, -pomo or -poma was used as a suffix after the names of places, to mean a subgroup of people of the place. By the year 1877 (possibly beginning with Powers), the use of Pomo had been extended in English to mean the entire people known today as the Pomo. The Pomo had 20 chiefs at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Bauxite ore is {{the main}} source for aluminium. Bauxite is a variety of {{laterite}} (residual sedimentary rock), so it has no precise chemical formula. It is composed mainly of hydrated alumina minerals such as gibbsite [...] in newer tropical deposits; in older subtropical, temperate deposits the major minerals are boehmite [...] and some diaspore [...] The average chemical composition of bauxite, by weight, is 45 to 60% Al2O3 and 20 to 30% Fe2O3. The remaining weight consists of silicas (quartz, chalcedony and kaolinite), carbonates (calcite, <b>magnesite</b> and dolomite), titanium dioxide and water. Bauxites of economical interest must be low in kaolinite. Formation of lateritic bauxites occurs worldwide in the 145- to 2-million-year-old Cretaceous and Tertiary coastal plains. The bauxites form elongate belts, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, parallel to Lower Tertiary shorelines in India and South America; their distribution {{is not related to}} a particular mineralogical composition of the parent rock. Many high-level bauxites are formed in coastal plains which were subsequently uplifted to their present altitude.|$|E
