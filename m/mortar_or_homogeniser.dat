40|$|Stabilising {{admixtures}} {{are commonly}} used additives in repair mortars and grouts. Beyond this, such type of admixture is increasingly used in concrete and other cementitious materials. In particular when fresh <b>mortar</b> <b>or</b> concrete properties have to be adjusted reliably, stabilising agents can be beneficially used to improve workability and robustness of the mixture. The mode of operation of these admixtures varies, rather affecting either the liquid phase or the solid particles in the dispersion, both causing strong interactions with the <b>mortar</b> <b>or</b> concrete system, and significant changes in their rheological behaviour. Furthermore, these are strongly affected by the environmental temperature during the casting process. In the paper the effect of temperature {{on the performance of}} stabilising agents in cementitious systems is presented and how performance changes affect fresh and hardening <b>mortar</b> <b>or</b> concrete properties. Particular attention is placed on interactions between stabilising agents and superplasticizers. Results are discussed with special focus on self-compacting concret...|$|R

Despite similar appearances, [...] "calthemites" [...] (created outside the cave environment) are not considered to be [...] "speleothems" [...] (created inside the cave environment), and vica versa, as per their definitions.|$|R

50|$|Historically masonry was {{constructed}} with no <b>mortar</b> <b>or</b> with lime <b>mortar.</b> In modern times cement based mortars are used.

40|$|Previously,a hard core/soft shell {{computer}} model {{was developed to}} simulate the overlap and percolation of the interracial transition zones surrounding each aggregate in a <b>mortar</b> <b>or</b> concrete. The aggregate particles were modelled aa spheres with a size distribution representativeof a real <b>mortar</b> <b>or</b> concrete specimen. Here, the model has been extended to investigate the effects of aggregate shape on interracial transition zone percolation, by modelling the aggregates = hard ellipsoids, which gives a dynamic range of shapes from platesto spheres, to fibers. For high performance concretes, the interracial transition zone thicknesswill generally be reduced, which will also affect their percolation properties.
