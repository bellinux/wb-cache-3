However, it has long been discovered that these magnetic loops are intrusive. expensive to install, and costly to maintain. Aside from being not very reliable, they are incapable of detecting the differences between cars, trucks, and motorcycles.

While branching into new areas and creating new themes over the past years, the principal goals remain the spin and magnetic control of the electrical properties— essentially the I-V characteristics—and vice versa.

40|$|Smart {{cards are}} widely used in {{different}} areas of modern life including identification, banking, and transportation cards. Some types of cards are able to store data and process information as well. A number of them can run cryptographic algorithms to enhance the security of their transactions and it is usually believed that the information and values stored in them are completely safe. However, this is generally not the case due {{to the threat of}} the side channel. Side channel analysis is the process of obtaining additional information from the internal activity of a physical device beyond that allowed by its specifications. There exist different techniques to attempt to obtain information from a cryptosystem using other ways than the normally permitted. This thesis presents a series of experiments intended to study the side channel from a particular type of smart card, known as Java Cards. This investigation uses the well known technique, Correlation Analysis, and a new type of side channel attack called fast correlation in the frequency domain to study the side channel of Java Cards. This research presents a giant <b>magnetoresistor</b> (GMR) probe and for the first time, this type of sensor is used to investigate the side channel. A novel setup designed for studying the side channel of smart cards is described and two metrics used to evaluate the analysis results are presented. After testing the GMR probe and methodology on electronic devices executing the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), such as 8 bit microcontrollers and 128 bit AES implementations on FPGAs, these techniques were applied to analyse two different models of Java Cards working in the contactless mode.

40|$|Ultra-thin alumina barrier {{magnetic}} tunnel junctions (MTJs) were examined. Such thin barriers can be imperfect {{and have}} pinholes. Examination of bias and temperature {{dependence of the}} MTJs supports a model of two resistors in parallel: one a tunnel <b>magnetoresistor,</b> the other an Ohmic resistor. Moreover, {{the results indicate that}} in addition to the tunneling conductance, hopping conductance through the barrier is present. It was found that even in the presence of pinholes, the dynamic conductance exhibits a parabolic dependence on the applied voltage as well as an insulating-like resistance dependence on temperature. These results suggest commonly used criteria for judging the presence of pinholes in tunnel junction barriers is insufficient and unreliable.;The presence of pinholes in the ultra-thin barrier is of major concern, as is the reliability of the barrier layer under stress. Two types of breakdown mechanisms are observed in ultra-thin barrier MTJs. It was found that the breakdown mechanism is an indicator of the barrier quality. Junctions showing an abrupt change in resistance at the breaking point have relatively large breakdown voltage (VB 3 ̆e 0. 6 V) and fail due to intrinsic breakdown of a well-formed oxide that follows the E model of dielectric breakdown. On the other hand, the breakdown of junctions showing a gradual decrease in resistance at the breaking point occur at a much lower voltage (VB 0. 3 [...] 0. 4 V), which is related to the presence of pinholes in the barrier. Current concentrated at the pinhole after breakdown generates a strong, circular magnetic field, which curls the local magnetization in the free-layer around the pinhole. This makes the free-layer reversal very sensitive to the location of the breakdown point in the junction area. Thus, the presence of pinholes can have strong implications on the parametric margins of the ultra-thin barrier MTJ for read sensor applications. It is proposed to include a statistical analysis of breakdown mechanisms to determine the presence of pinholes in ultra-thin barrier MTJs...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{calibration}} and error correction of the AMR yokeless current transducer consisting of a circular array of eight anisotropic <b>magnetoresistors</b> (AMR) with one feedback compensation loop.

It {{is well known that}} AMR sensors from the same batch have 2 % spread of the sensitivity; we found that the variation of the factor of the internal compensation coil is the same. We developed a novel calibration process using the readings of individual residual uncompensated voltages of the AMRs. The position of the current inside the measurement hole is estimated from the individual voltages considering the influence of external DC magnetic field such as the Earth’s field. During the calibration phase, the sensor outputs are measured for several positions of the current conductor inside the measuring hole. As a result of calibration the lookup table of error corrections is calculated and stored in the memory, and then these values are used for the correction during the measurement of the unknown current.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} {{aspects of a}} {{framework}} for the multi-scale modelling of charge transport in several organic semiconductors relevant for technological application. In the first chapter, we build a coarse-grained model for fullerene multi-adducts which clearly distinguishes between the influence of energetic and structural disorder. The model reveals that charge transport in fullerene multi-adducts is limited by energetic disorder due to different isomers. Solar cells containing single isomers of higher fullerene adducts are expected to achieve higher power conversion efficiencies. Secondly, we create a multi-scale model to investigate the effect of beta-phase conformers on hole transport in poly(9, 9) dicotylfluorene. A combination of quantum-chemical calculations and charge transport simulation confirms that beta-phase conformers act as traps and, when torsional disorder of the polymer backbone is included, can explain the experimentally observed mobility reduction due to beta-phase. In the third project, grain boundaries in tri-isopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) pentacene are characterised. On the basis of two-grain structures with varied mutual orientation generated with atomistic molecular dynamics, we compute energy landscapes and electronic coupling elements. We find {{that the effect of}} the grain boundary is relatively weak for long interfaces, but that small contact areas between grains may impede charge transport more strongly due to highly non-uniform energy barrier heights. The final chapter focuses on one-dimensional organic <b>magnetoresistors</b> with alternating acceptor, spacer and donor units. Combining quantum-chemical calculations and kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations allow us to define design rules for high magnetoresistance, among which minimising the offset between HOMO and LUMO energy levels is the most challenging one.

Notably, a recent paper on InAs/InSb heterostructures grown on InAs(111) B substrates by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy [2] showed controlled growth direction, and perfect zincblende (ZB) crystal structure, free of defects. We shall report our results on the growth of InAs-InSb nanowire heterostructures (NWs). Chemical beam epitaxy technique was employed for Au-assisted growth on InAs(111) B substrates in a Riber Compact- 21 system. The NWs are composed of two sections of different diameter; the lower one (InAs, as confirmed by EDXS) has a smaller diameter, while the upper one (InSb) has a larger diameter, comparable with the catalyst particle diameter. The structure and the crystalline quality of the NWs were investigated by TEM. A typical HRTEM image of the InAs/InSb interfacial region viewed along InSb zone axis is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The associated fast Fourier transform, shown in Fig. 1 (b) indicates that the InAs base (blue spots) grows with wurtzite (WZ) structure with the c axis along the NW growth direction, whereas the InSb segment on top (red spots) crystallizes in the ZB phase with the direction aligned to the NW axis. TEM analysis of the interfacial region (see Fig. 1 (c)) highlights the abruptness of the interface and the good crystalline quality of the NWs in the near-interface region. Furthermore, we have performed post-growth studies investigating the NW tip composition following different cool-down protocol after InSb growth.

Giant <b>magnetoresistors</b> (GMRs) are the magnetic sensors that are used in the read-heads of computer hard drives, and are small, microfabricated devices that display a measurable change in resistance in response to an external magnetic field;The research described in this dissertation focuses on the creation of a small, low-cost, sensitive, and high-speed readout method {{for the detection of}} magnetically-labeled bioanalytes. Several methods were examined, including the direct modification of the GMR sensor surface to be a bioactive address for the capture of magnetically-labeled alpha-mouse IgG through an immunosorbent assay. The GMR sensor was coated with gold, which was further modified with mouse IgG through a succinimidyl-terminated thiolate monolayer. The GMR sensors were found to respond linearly to the presence of the magnetically-labeled alpha-mouse IgG;Further explorations of the use of the GMR sensor moved the assay from directly on the sensor surface to a sample stick consisting of 200 x 200 microm alternating nickel reference and gold addresses. The sample stick was then scanned over the GMR sensor in a 2 ̆ 2 credit-card reader 2 ̆ 2 fashion. The nickel reference addresses served as a reference-normalizing tool, and compensated for any variation in sensor to sample separation distance. This detection methodology was verified with the detection of streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (MPs) captured on biotinylated gold addressees. The reference-normalized GMR response varied linearly with MP surface concentration;The utilization of the sample stick for the detection of rabbit IgG in a sandwich assay format was also described. Goat alpha-rabbit IgG capture antibody was bound to the gold addresses through reaction with a succinimidyl-terminated monolayer. After capture of the rabbit IgG and further labeling with biotinylated goat alpha-rabbit IgG, the sample sticks were exposed to streptavidin-coated MPs. Issues related to the small size of the gold addresses, assessments of GMR detection capabilities, and potential applications are described. Finally, the simultaneous detection of three IgG proteins was demonstrated by using the same sandwich assay tactics and modifying each gold address with an individual capture antibody...|$|R
