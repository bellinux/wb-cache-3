If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is." [...] He added that, [...] "I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being {{able to take care of}} your health." [...] He said that he would instead devote the remainder of his mayoralty trying to overcome the hostile relations he had with many of the city's minority groups.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{and writers}} were {{critical}} of {{the manner in which}} Patrick Hemingway edited the work. Paul Gray [...] titled his review of the book [...] "Where's Papa?", answering with the opening sentence, [...] "He's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work", pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway's editing of the manuscript. Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been [...] "outraged by his sons' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication" [...] and was outraged that [...] "Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers, Jack and Gregory, share his belief that 'this job was worth doing'". [...] Burwell also wonders [...] whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published, pointing to [...] his statement, [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better to wait until I'm dead to publish it", although she concedes that works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Kafka were unfinished and published posthumously. During the final two decades of his life, Hemingway had published two novels but since his death, works continue to be published. Writing in The New Yorker in 1998, Joan Didion was extremely {{critical of the}} Hemingway family and estate for [...] commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy. [...] "The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in his or her work is to make it", she wrote, adding that True at First Light should not have been [...] "molded" [...] and published.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, {{the turmoil}} that Sue {{had been through}} had led Ratcliff to {{consider}} quitting the serial prematurely. In 1987 she told the magazine Woman's Own, [...] "'s been such an unhappy woman since Hassan died. And {{it was beginning to}} rub off on me. I'd go to work, six days a week, be stuck in that grim little cafe and be permanently miserable. I got to the stage when I started to ask myself if I really wanted to spend all my working life playing a misery." [...] However, according to Ratcliff, the scriptwriters decision to make Sue pregnant changed her mind about leaving. She said, [...] "Now Sue is pregnant and happy I feel differently about the role. So <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fun to stick around for a couple more years - if I'm wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 26, 1976, Gacy {{employed}} an 18-year-old named David Cram. On August 21, Cram {{moved into}} his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was inebriated. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then {{informed him that}} he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the Army, kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: [...] "Dave, you really don't know who I am. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good if you give me what I want." [...] Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom. After this incident, Cram moved out of Gacy's home and subsequently left PDM Contractors, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years. Shortly after Cram had vacated Gacy's residence, another employee of PDM Contractors, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved into Gacy's house.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Trust {{establishment}} {{seems to}} be the most difficult problem in mobility and multi-homing management. Many protocol proposals assume the presence of some security infrastructure (e. g. a Public-Key Infrastructure). However, building such a global infrastructure has not taken place, <b>maybe</b> because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too expensive and difficult to deploy. In this paper, we introduce a security context establishment procedure that utilizes reverse hash chains, and does not require pre-existing security information. The procedure is known to be vulnerable to an active Man-in-the-Middle attack in the first message exchange, however, the procedure is efficient, and does not have inherent scalability problems. Key words: security, mobility management, multi-homing management, and trust establishment 1...|$|R

She was also less talented than Olga, but worked harder and was more dedicated to seeing projects through to completion than her elder sister.

[...] Others felt Tatiana's artistic talents were better expressed in handiwork and in her talent for choosing attractive fashions and creating elegant hair styles. Her mother's friend Anna Vyrubova later wrote that Tatiana had a great talent for making clothing, embroidery and crochet and that she dressed her mother's long hair {{as well as any}} professional hair stylist.|$|R

[...] "I wasn't embarrassed because we all learned something from it.

[...] Tony Langkilde also defended the goalkeeper, saying that he [...] "kept the score down with a magnificent display".

And since life seldom moves along on a plane, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> expecting too much for this particular film to maintain a perfect level. But the ups and downs and the fancy curves which the story takes in discussing the problem of war marriages neither makes for an arresting entertainment nor does it help to clarify a question that is of vital importance right now to a good many young people. Apparently both Mark Sandrich, the producer-director, and Allan Scott, the author, weren't quite sure either just how the subject should be treated, for they tackle it, by turns, in dead seriousness and with broad comic strokes." ...|$|R

It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother reminds Jessica of {{when she was little}} and had been given the lead in the school play, but after the first rehearsal, Jessica had deemed her co-star not to be up to the task. She quit the play because she thought the play wouldn't be [...] "the best ever." [...] Her mother says that she worries about Jessica having this attitude towards life, and that sometimes she thinks back to that night and thinks that if Jessica went on, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't have been the best, but it might have been pretty good - and who knows, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> the best ever.

I saw in a flash that there was only one way by which I could be of use to you. The coachman was leaning round with his head turned to see what was going on behind him.

By this time, {{each member}} of the group {{increasingly}} began taking time off from SNL: Taccone for television work, Schaffer for directorial efforts (The Watch), and Samberg with leading film roles. The trio found it increasingly difficult to get together and work, as they all lived in different cities. In an interview with Splitsider the following year, they mentioned that different responsibilities and work in other fields strengthened their work as a unit: [...] "I think if we just did this Lonely Island all the time, then <b>it</b> <b>maybe</b> we <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in trouble, but going off and doing other things reminds us it's more fun to work with your friends," [...] said Schaffer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As all are {{recognizable}} {{from the}} expressions of engine vehicle producers foreseeing the mileage of their items pretty nearly, {{that are working}} on Spark Ignition, Compressed Ignition motors under obliged circumstances mileage on interstate and so forth., the engine vehicles shows the measure of fuel in the fuel tank by method for some sign like bars going through the E (void) and F (full) pointers. The producer gives the detail that every bar maps to the relating liters of fuel give or take. In actuality {{each one of us}} may have encountered the issue with dishonorable estimations of the present fuel level in the tank with the current bars representation framework. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> testing push to demonstrate the data with respect to mileage numerically on computerized presentation. This work goes for defeating the disadvantages of this current framework by giving clear data to the client about the precise evidence of fuel level digitally in liters and further separation to go with the accessible fuel. Since the fuel tank blasts have been seen over the world, the consideration ought to be taken from the assembling organizations for security of travelers. To attain the prerequisite the fuel tank configuration is changed such that the part is made for the fuel tank. Thus the development of high pressure because of expanding temperature is avoided to the greatest extent. As and when the fuel level tumbles down to certain limit, the caution will be created to the proprietor. At certain time if there happens sudden fall of fuel level,the alarm is created to indicate fuel robbery...|$|R
