A moment before all was dullness, but a PAS further has placed us on {{the summit of the}} Furka; and exactly in front of us, at a HOPOW of only fifteen miles, this magnificent mountain lifts its snow-wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky.

40|$|Image {{degradation}} {{caused by}} respiratory motion {{is an issue}} of concern in clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Compensation for respiratory motion requires an accurate motion sensor or a complicated data driven method. This thesis describes two new methods for respiratory motion gating and correction that relies upon information from the list mode data stream. The methods are based on a proposed hypothesis that geometric sensitivity varies along the z axis of a 3 D PET scanner and can be used to compensate for respiratory motion. This hypothesis was developed into two directions: Geometric Sensitivity Gating (GSG) for respiratory motion gating and Geometric Sensitivity Correction (GSC) for respiratory motion correction. To test the proposed hypothesis, two steps have been undertaken in this thesis: simulation and clinical validation. Simulations were implemented by the use of Geant 4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) and NURBs-Based Cardiac Torso (NCAT) software packages to simulate the Phillips Allegro/Gemini PET Scanner and respiratory motion respectively. Patient data with both tumour and non-tumour cases were collected and clinical validation was performed on it. All data was collected in list-mode data format, which can be sorted into a sequence of frames. Then the proposed specific hypothesises GSG and GSC was applied to the <b>sorted</b> <b>frames</b> respectively. Simulation validations consist of geometric phantom and voxelised phantom validation. The geometric validation was implemented using a cylindrical phantom with a known sinusoidal oscillation. This oscillation was used as a representation of simple respiratory motion. When GSG and GSC were applied to the sorted list-mode data, they were shown to be able to gate and correct for the motion. For a more realistic simulation of respiratory motion, voxelised phantoms generated by NCAT were imported into GATE and employed to validate GSG and GSC, and gave encouraging indications for the application of respiratory motion gating and correction. Finally, when applied to the clinical patient data, it was demonstrated that the image degradation caused by respiratory motion were significantly reduced using GSG and GSC. Additional benefits of these two methods include: &bull; No additional hardware device is required; &bull; They only use list-mode data and are non-invasive; &bull; There is no acquisition burden; &bull; There is no additional patient preparation required; &bull; There is no additional time required for clinical setup; This thesis demonstrates the proposed hypothesis of using the geometric sensitivity properties of a 3 D PET scanner for respiratory motion compensation and proves this hypothesis using results from simulated and clinical studies...|$|R

Our novel technique solves the problem of fusing all sources, asynchronously captured from multiple heterogeneous mobile devices around a dynamic scene at a real word location. To this end all captured input is broken down into a massive unordered <b>frame</b> set, <b>sorting</b> the <b>frames</b> along a common time axis, and finally discretizing the ordered frame set into a time-sequence of frame subsets, each subject to photogrammetric 3 D reconstruction.

In addition, Gershuni begins to include in his works symbols of alienation and exile - “Yitzhak” (Isaac) becomes “Yitzhakeleh” and swastikas begin to appear.

40|$|In {{the last}} two years the region around Christchurch was {{subjected}} to several seismic events and aftershocks that damaged buildings and infrastructures. Among them there were also historically relevant heritage structures such as the Triumphal Arch, which stands on the Bridge of Remembrance in the Christchurch CBD. The structure, built in 1924, consists of a central major arch and two lateral minor arches made of lightly reinforced concrete and architectural stone. Although the Triumphal Arch did not suffer damage after 4 th September 2010 event, it required strengthening works after the 22 February 2011 earthquake. In this paper, the authors present different solutions to assess the seismic performance of for Triumphal Arch which incorporates rocking concepts. Three retrofit designs are herein shown: a pure-rocking mechanism of the arches’ columns designed by SCIRT and two dissipative rocking concepts developed by the authors. The dissipative rocking solutions are based on the hybrid PRESSS technology and one aims to create a <b>sort</b> of <b>frame</b> system while the second one a coupling rocking wall system. The former uses axial external elasto-plastic dissipaters while the latter steel U-shaped flexural plates. Numerical lumped plasticity models are developed and, by using RUAUMOKO 3 D, time-history analyses are carried out as validation of the three design concepts. The three solutions are subjected to a set of ground motions which includes the Christchurch sequence. The results prove that the dissipative rocking solution reduces the displacements of the structure without inducing higher loads on foundations and limits post-earthquake damage to the replacement of the dissipaters. Accordingly it is a robust technology for seismic retrofit of heritage structures...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{with the}} scope of {{minimizing}} structural damage, several dampers were developed [1 - 2] and new replaceable hybrid composite steel devices [3] have been recently proposed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose and investigate a new replaceable hysteretic damper having a basic form of the art of building, minimally architecturally invasive, consisting of two or more dissipative steel columns directly connected to two consecutive floors linked to each other with X-shaped low/mild steel plates. The proposed Dissipative Column (DC) models are shown in Fig. 1 for two different end cases (models A, B). The elements can be considered as a <b>sort</b> of <b>framed</b> bi-pendulum, connected in parallel to the primary structure, able to react to the story drift D with a lateral force QD adding stiffness, strength and damping. The design concept of the DC element aims to obtain a lever mechanism by which a small inter-storey drift provides an amplified vertical drift in the Xplate ends reacting with shear forces, (Fig. 1 c)). X-shaped steel plates made of mild or Low Yielding Strength (LYS) steel [4] are also used as shear links between coupled elements. The top ends of two models are linked to upper floor through slotted bolted connections to allow vertical displacements. By yielding a large volume of steel, the shear devices dissipate substantial input energy under earthquake or strong wind also increasing damping in the entire system. The great advantages of DC elements, if compared with classical dissipative brace, are the reduced architectural invasiveness so that they are able to be integrated in any building, the ease of installation everywhere, their replacement after earthquakes and the stable behavior in cyclic reversal deformation. Axial forces should be designed in ordered to be transferred locally to a proper structural element...|$|R

The experiment was conducted with a randomized block design where ionophore treatment was the main effect and pens were blocks. The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine whether alternating two popularly used ionophores in feedlot diets affects average daily gain, efficiency of growth, total volatile fatty acid production, acetate to propionate ratio and/or carcass traits of young bulls. Bullocks were harvested by pen when the average fat thickness for a pen was estimated to be 0. 6 cm. Days on feed averaged 126 days for all bullocks and were the same for each treatment group. No differences were detected (P< 0. 05) in average daily gain, dry matter feed to gain ratio, cost of gain, total volatile fatty acid production or acetate to propionate ratio. No treatment effects were found for carcass maturity scores, ribeye area, percentage of kidney, pelvic and heart fat or carcass weight. Fat thickness, marbling score and quality grade were slightly higher and USDA sex class was lower (P< 0. 05) for bullocks continuously fed lasalocid than for those fed lasalocid and monensin on alternating days.
