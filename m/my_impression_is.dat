500|$|The {{relative}} importance given {{to each of}} these three strategies has varied over time and between different contexts. The general impression in the current Churches of Christ is that the group's hermeneutics are entirely based on the command, example, inference approach. [...] In practice, interpretation has been deductive, and heavily influenced by the group's central commitment to ecclesiology and soteriology. [...] Inductive reasoning has been used as well, as when all of the conversion accounts from the book of Acts are collated and analyzed to determine the steps necessary for salvation. [...] One student of the movement summarized the traditional approach this way: [...] "In most of their theologizing, however, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that spokespersons in the Churches of Christ reason from Scripture in a deductive manner, arguing from one premise or hypothesis to another so as to arrive at a conclusion. In this regard the approach is much like that of science which, in practice moves deductively from one hypothesis to another, rather than in a Baconian inductive manner." [...] In recent years, changes in the degree of emphasis placed on ecclesiology and soteriology has spurred a reexamination of the traditional hermeneutics among some associated with the Churches of Christ.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E
2500|$|To {{investigate}} the sinking and failed rescue operation, the Navy convened {{a court of}} inquiry presided over by Rear Admiral Richard H. Jackson. Under questioning, Brumby appeared to be technically uninformed {{about the details of}} the rescue operation: [...] "I just can't be positive about such things. I just can't remember. Ask the technical people. ... I am not familiar with the details of the construction of submarines, but those who were there thought the steps being taken were the proper ones. ... Well, I don't really know. I can't answer that question. <b>My</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> the divers did all they could do. As to details I can't tell you. You'll have to ask the technical men." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{describes}} it, {{near the}} Big Falls, about one {{hundred yards from}} the top of the mountain at Loup Creek, [...] "When I first saw it, fifty-eight years ago, it was in a much better state of preservation than it now is. At that time a large portion of it was standing fully six or seven feet high, and was well built. Its thickness was about two feet at the base, and slightly tapered towards the top. There were a number of gates, or openings, in the wall, that are quite perceptible even at this time. They were, however, very plainly perceivable a half century ago. From the number of stones promiscuously scattered in the vicinity of the wall, <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that it was originally greater than seven or even eight feet in height." [...] This wall was nearly three and a half miles long. Some have surmised it was nearly 10 miles long in total, having short branching elements also connected. Parts of these walls were damaged during the 20th century.|$|E

6000|$|Sometimes I become {{afraid of}} my own generalizations upon the massed misery of this Ghetto life, and feel that <b>my</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> exaggerated, that I am {{too close to the}} picture and lack perspective.

6000|$|It was Mr. Pike to the rescue. I {{understand}} now the Western hyperbole of [...] "hitting the high places." [...] The mate {{did not seem}} {{in contact with the}} deck. <b>My</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> that he soared through the air to me, landing beside me, and, in the instant of landing, kicking out with one of those big feet of his. Bill Quigley was kicked clear away from me, and the next moment he was flying overboard. It was a clean throw. He never touched the rail.|$|R
6000|$|My {{sister and}} I {{had agreed to}} keep the {{haunting}} strictly to ourselves, and <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was,</b> and still is, that I had not left Ikey, when he helped to unload the cart, alone with the women, or any one of them, for one minute. Nevertheless, as I say, the Odd Girl had [...] "seen Eyes" [...] (no other explanation could ever be drawn from her), before nine, and by ten o'clock had had as much vinegar applied to her as would pickle a handsome salmon.|$|R

60|$|<b>My</b> own <b>impression</b> <b>is,</b> {{that the}} best model {{for all kinds of}} {{training}} in physical science is that afforded by the method of teaching anatomy, in use in the medical schools. This method consists of three elements-- lectures, demonstrations, and examinations.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not. There are six {{different}} points to which I forward letters, in rotation, both those {{from you and}} from others on various matters of business, and these points are widely scattered. <b>My</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that Colonel Weatherby is in none of these places and that the letters are again forwarded to him to--wherever he may be." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} shock inflicted on me {{completely}} suspended my thinking and feeling power. I certainly {{could not have}} known what I was about when Betteredge joined me--for I have it on his authority that I laughed, when he asked what was the matter, and putting the nightgown into his hands, told him to read the riddle for himself.|$|E
60|$|Laden with {{a myriad}} {{impressions}} of Indians, mountaineers and miners, I {{returned to my}} home as a bee to its hive, and there, during October, in my quiet chamber worked fast and fervently to transform my rough notes into fiction. Making no attempt to depict the West as some one else had seen it, or might thereafter see it, I wrote of it precisely as it appeared to me, verifying every experience, for, although I had not lingered long in any one place--a few weeks at most--I had observed closely and <b>my</b> <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> clearly and deeply graved.|$|R

60|$|The Duke of Argyle {{said that}} Chevalier Bunsen had been {{speaking}} to him {{in relation to a}} college for colored people at Antigua, and inquired my views respecting the emigration of colored people from America to the West India islands. I told him <b>my</b> <b>impression</b> <b>was,</b> that Canada would be a much better place to develop the energies of the race. First, on account of its cold and bracing climate; second, because, having never been a slave state, the white population there are more thrifty and industrious, and of course the influence of such a community was better adapted to form thrift arid industry in the negro.|$|R
