5|$|Microbial {{communities}} play a {{key role}} in preserving human health, but their composition and the mechanism by which they do so remains mysterious. Metagenomic sequencing is being used to characterize the microbial communities from 15-18 body sites from at least 250 individuals. This is part of the Human <b>Microbiome</b> initiative with primary goals to determine if there is a core human <b>microbiome,</b> to understand the changes in the human <b>microbiome</b> that can be correlated with human health, and to develop new technological and bioinformatics tools to support these goals.|$|E
5|$|The data {{generated}} by metagenomics experiments are both enormous and inherently noisy, containing fragmented data representing {{as many as}} 10,000 species. The sequencing of the cow rumen metagenome generated 279 gigabases, or 279 billion base pairs of nucleotide sequence data, while the human gut <b>microbiome</b> gene catalog identified 3.3 million genes assembled from 567.7 gigabases of sequence data. Collecting, curating, and extracting useful biological information from datasets of this size represent significant computational challenges for researchers.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic <b>microbiome</b> plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E

Oral <b>microbiomes</b> influence and can be influenced by individual internal environment, which enlighten us to find correlations between endocrine system diseases and oral <b>microbiomes.</b> Diabetes, adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and obesity have been proved to be associated with oral <b>microbiomes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Primate {{gastrointestinal}} microbial {{communities are}} becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to comparative medicine and conservation, but the factors that structure primate “microbiomes ” remain controversial. This study examined a community of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to assess {{the relative importance of}} host species and location in structuring gastrointestinal <b>microbiomes.</b> Fecal samples were collected from primates in intact forest and from primates in highly disturbed forest fragments. People and livestock living nearby were also included, as was a geographically distant population of related red colobus in Kenya. A culture‐free microbial community fingerprinting technique was used to analyze fecal <b>microbiomes</b> from 124 individual red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus), 100 individual black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus guereza), 111 individual red‐tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), 578 human volunteers, and 364 domestic animals, including cattle (Bos indicus and B. indicusB. taurus crosses), goats (Caprus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pigs (Sus scrofa). <b>Microbiomes</b> sorted strongly by host species, and forest fragmentation did not alter this pattern. <b>Microbiomes</b> of Kenyan red colobus sorted distinctly from <b>microbiomes</b> of Ugandan red colobus, but <b>microbiomes</b> from these two red colobus populations clustered more closely with each other than with any other species. <b>Microbiomes</b> from red colobus and black‐and‐white colobu...|$|R

40|$|Coral reefs provide {{habitat for}} {{an array of}} marine {{invertebrates}} that host symbiotic <b>microbiomes.</b> Photosynthetic symbionts including Symbiodinium dinoflagellates and diatoms potentially influence the diversity of their host-associated <b>microbiomes</b> by releasing carbon-containing photosynthates and other organic compounds that fuel microbial metabolism. Here we used 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon pyrosequencing to characterise the <b>microbiomes</b> of 11 common Great Barrier Reef marine invertebrate species that host photosynthetic symbionts and five taxa {{in which they are}} absent. The presence of photosynthetic symbionts influenced the composition but not the species richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity of invertebrate-associated <b>microbiomes.</b> Invertebrates without photosynthetic symbionts were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, whereas those hosting photosynthetic symbionts were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria. Interestingly, many microbial species from photosymbiont-bearing invertebrates, including Oceanospirillales spp., Alteromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp., Halomonas spp., are implicated in the metabolism of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). DMSP is produced in high concentrations by photosynthetic dinoflagellates and is involved in climate regulation by facilitating cloud formation. <b>Microbiomes</b> correlated with host taxa and replicate individuals from most sampled species grouped in distance-based redundancy analysis of retrieved 16 S rRNA gene sequences. This study highlights the complex nature of invertebrate holobionts and confirms the importance of photosynthetic symbionts in structuring marine invertebrate bacterial communities...|$|R
25|$|Humans are {{typically}} host {{to a hundred}} trillion micro-organisms in ten thousand species in the human <b>microbiome</b> which can't be removed while preserving {{the life of the}} human.

In particular, adequate containment {{in the event of a}} hard landing is a major challenge.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{consumption}} of dairy foods containing lactose can promote a colonic bacteria adaptation, enhancing a favorable <b>microbiome,</b> which allows people with primary lactase deficiency to diminish their intolerance and to consume more dairy foods. The way to induce tolerance {{is based on}} progressive exposure, consuming smaller amounts frequently, distributed throughout the day. Lactose intolerance can also be managed by ingesting live yogurt cultures containing lactobacilli {{that are able to}} digest the lactose in other dairy products. This may explain why many South Asians, though genetically lactose intolerant, are able to consume large quantities of milk without many symptoms of lactose intolerance, since consuming live yogurt cultures is very common among the South Asian population.|$|E
25|$|The Yamal baby mammoth Lyuba, {{found in}} 2007 in the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia, {{suggests}} that baby mammoths, as do modern baby elephants, ate the dung of adult animals. The {{evidence to show}} {{this is that the}} dentition (teeth) of the baby mammoth had not yet fully developed to chew grass. Furthermore, there was an abundance of ascospores of coprophilous fungi from the pollen spectrum of the baby's mother. Coprophilous fungi are fungi that grow on animal dung and disperse spores in nearby vegetation, which the baby mammoth would then consume. Spores might have gotten into its stomach while grazing for the first few times. Coprophagy may be an adaptation, serving to populate the infant's gut with the needed <b>microbiome</b> for digestion.|$|E
40|$|Significance: Bacterial {{burden is}} {{believed}} to {{play a significant role}} in impaired wound healing of chronic wounds and the development of infection-related complications. The standard of care in the clinic relies upon cultivation-dependent methods to identify microorganisms. These assays are biased toward microorganisms that thrive in isolation under laboratory conditions. Recent Advances: Significant advances in genomic technologies have enabled less-biased, culture-independent approaches to characterize microbial communities, or <b>microbiomes.</b> The aggregate sequencing and analysis of 16 S ribosomal RNA genes has demonstrated that cultures under-represent true microbial diversity and load. Critical Issues: Despite recent advances that enable culture-independent analyses of <b>microbiomes,</b> those organisms that are important in impaired healing remain ambiguous. Inconsistent findings across various studies highlight the need to characterize <b>microbiomes</b> of chronic wounds with homogenous etiology to determine differences in <b>microbiomes</b> that may be driven by the wound environment and that may affect wound outcomes. Rigorous analyses of wound <b>microbiomes</b> in light of the three dimensions of bioburden (microbial diversity, microbial load, and pathogenic organisms), clinical metadata, and wound outcomes will be a significant step forward in our quest to understand the role of microorganisms in impaired healing. Future Directions: Longitudinal studies employing serial sampling are needed to appreciate the role of the dynamic microbial community in chronic wound healing. The value of clinical metadata needs to be examined as potential biomarkers of problematic microbiota and wound outcomes. Lastly, better characterization and understanding of wound <b>microbiomes</b> will open avenues for improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the nonhealing wound...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of mixed}} {{microbial}} communities (<b>microbiomes)</b> for biotechnological applications has steadily {{increased over the}} past decades. However, these <b>microbiomes</b> are not readily available from public culture collections, hampering their potential for widespread use. The main reason for this lack of availability {{is the lack of}} an effective cryopreservation protocol. Due to this critical need, we evaluated the functionality as well as the community structure of three different types of <b>microbiomes</b> before and after cryopreservation with two cryoprotective agents (CPA). <b>Microbiomes</b> were selected based upon relevance towards applications: (1) a methanotrophic co-culture (MOB), with potential for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, environmental pollutants removal and bioplastics production; (2) an oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) biofilm, with enhanced economic and ecological benefits for wastewater treatment, and (3) fecal material from a human donor, with potential applications for fecal transplants and pre/probiotics research. After three months of cryopreservation at - 80 °C, we found that metabolic activity, in terms of the specific activity recovery of MOB, aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) and anaerobic AOB (AnAOB, anammox) in the OLAND mixed culture, resumes sooner when one of our selected CPA [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMSO plus trehalose and tryptic soy broth (DMSO+TT) ] was added. However, the activity of the fecal community was not influenced by the CPA addition, although the preservation of the community structure (as determined by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing) was enhanced by addition of CPA. In summary, we have evaluated a cryopreservation protocol that succeeded in preserving both community structure and functionality of value-added <b>microbiomes.</b> This will allow individual laboratories and culture collections to boost the use of <b>microbiomes</b> in biotechnological applications...|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} {{interaction between}} diet and the intestinal <b>microbiome</b> brings into play additional metabolic factors that aggravate atherosclerosis beyond dietary cholesterol.

Trimethylamine is oxidized in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which causes atherosclerosis in animal models. Patients in the top quartile of TMAO had a 2.5-fold increase in the 3-year risk of stroke, death, or myocardial infarction.|$|E

25|$|In chickens, {{a limited}} number of studies have {{investigated}} the specific effect of diet on the fatty acid composition of preen oil in meat chickens. The preen oil of meat chickens is dominated by saturated fatty acids, which make up to 97% of the total fatty acids, with 13 different medium to long chain saturated fatty acids (C8:0 to C22:0) detected. The preen oil contained several odd-chain fatty acids, which suggests they may be derived from lipolysis by the uropygial gland and/or its <b>microbiome.</b> Diet and gender had small but significant effects on levels of specific saturated fatty acid in the preen oil. The fatty acid composition of the preen oil did not reflect the more diverse fatty acid compositions of the diet or whole blood. Therefore, this clearly indicate that measuring the fatty acid profile of preen oil is not a suitable alternative approach for predicting the fatty acid composition of the blood of meat chickens.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{microbes}} {{inhabit the}} human intestine, {{many of which}} are uncharacterized or uncultivable. They form a complex microbial community that deeply affects human physiology. To identify the genomic features common to all human gut <b>microbiomes</b> as well as those variable among them, we performed a large-scale comparative metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from 13 healthy individuals of various ages, including unweaned infants. We found that, while the gut microbiota from unweaned infants were simple and showed a high inter-individual variation in taxonomic and gene composition, those from adults and weaned children were more complex but showed a high functional uniformity regardless of age or sex. In searching for the genes over-represented in gut <b>microbiomes,</b> we identified 237 gene families commonly enriched in adult-type and 136 families in infant-type <b>microbiomes,</b> with a small overlap. An analysis of their predicted functions revealed various strategies employed by each type of microbiota to adapt to its intestinal environment, suggesting that these gene sets encode the core functions of adult and infant-type gut microbiota. By analysing the orphan genes, 647 new gene families were identified to be exclusively present in human intestinal <b>microbiomes.</b> In addition, we discovered a conjugative transposon family explosively amplified in human gut <b>microbiomes,</b> which strongly suggests that the intestine is a ‘hot spot’ for horizontal gene transfer between microbes...|$|R

40|$|Termites are xylophages, {{being able}} to digest {{a wide variety of}} {{lignocellulosic}} biomass including wood with high lignin content. This ability to feed on recalcitrant plant material is the result of complex symbiotic relationships, which involve termite-specific gut <b>microbiomes.</b> Therefore, these represent a potential source of microorganisms for the bioconversion of lignocellulose in bioprocesses targeting the production of carboxylates. In this study, gut <b>microbiomes</b> of four termite species were studied for their capacity to degrade wheat straw and produce carboxylates in controlled bioreactors. All of the gut <b>microbiomes</b> successfully degraded lignocellulose and up to 45 % w/w of wheat straw degradation was observed, with the Nasutitermes ephratae gut-microbiome displaying the highest levels of wheat straw degradation, carboxylate production and enzymatic activity. Comparing the 16 S rRNA gene diversity of the initial gut inocula to the bacterial communities in lignocellulose degradation bioreactors revealed important changes in community diversity. In particular, taxa such as Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres that were highly abundant in the initial gut inocula were replaced by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria at the end of incubation in wheat straw bioreactors. Overall, this study demonstrates that termite-gut <b>microbiomes</b> constitute a reservoir of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria that can be harnessed in artificial conditions for biomass conversion processes that lead to the production of useful molecules...|$|R

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) or Raman spectroscopy both generate fingerprint spectra of biological material and such spectra can readily be subsequently classed according to biochemical changes in the microbiota, such as emergence of antibiotic resistance.
