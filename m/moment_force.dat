50|$|Vasa sank {{because it}} had very little initial stability, which {{can be thought of}} as {{resistance}} to heeling over under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The centre of gravity is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship heel over, and there is not enough righting <b>moment,</b> <b>force</b> trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5½ inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.|$|E

In the blast phenomena, loss of life and injuries to occupants can result from the structural collapse. Therefore it were necessary to do {{an analysis of the}} effect under blast load on the building with the aim of this research was to analyze the condition of the frame on a structure based on analysis of internal forces and structural response due to blast load. The building structure model was a steel frame structure of 5 story with a typical floor to floor height of 4 m. Variations of explosive weights of 500 kg and 1. 000 kg of TNT were applied to a building structure model have converted into a static load at distance 25 m of blast source. To define the blast load on the structure, ATBLAST software will be used, and to determine blast load parameters need to be calculated with Pythagoras Theorem based on TM 5 - 1300 - 1990. Analysis was performed with Finite Element Method (FEM) software with linier static method will be used, the results of analysis were axial and <b>moment</b> <b>force.</b> The axial force was 621, 28 kN, <b>moment</b> <b>force</b> weakness axis direction was - 665, 93 kN-m and <b>moment</b> <b>force</b> strong axis direction was 0, 48 kN-m.

40|$|Summary. Rectangular {{stainless}} steel and nickel titanium wires {{of the same}} cross section were submitted to stepwise twisting to increasing values of torsion. The resulting <b>moment</b> (<b>force)</b> and permanent angulation (torque) were recorded. Wires of various cross sectional dimensions were tested, and for Nitinol wires the effect of length was investigated. Stainless steel wire was five times stiffer than Nitinol wire of equivalent cross section. The elastic range, with respect to permanent angulation (torque), was approximately double that of {{stainless steel}}. Due to its lower modulus of elasticity, Nitinol wire shows a large elastic working range. Provided that a minimum length of 3 mm is used, adequate torque can be applied for clinical use. Nitinol wire allows the application of gentle continuous forces over a long period. Orthodontic wires should possess {{a high degree of}} elastic behaviour and should be easy to shape without risk of breakage.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Increased joint load on {{the medial}} {{compartment}} of the knee during gait is a mechanical factor responsible for pain and progression of medial knee osteoarthritis. The knee external adductor moment of force is a kinetic parameter that correlates with the joint load in the medial compartment. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to conduct a narrative review of the biomechanics strategies during gait of individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis that reduce external adductor moment of force of the knee. Methods: The review of the literature was conducted in the databases MEDLINE, PUBMED and PEDro and included articles published between 2000 and 2011. It was selected transversal, theoretical, correlational and longitudinal studies as well as controlled clinical trials. Results: Decreased gait velocity, increased external rotation of the foot, increased internal abductor <b>moment</b> <b>force</b> of the hip and lateral trunk inclination to the side of the support limb are compensatory strategies used to reduce the external adductor moment of force of the knee during gait of individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis. The lateral trunk inclination may be beneficial in a short term, however it decreases the activity of the abductors muscles of the hip during the support phase of the gait favoring compensation that could result in the progression of medial knee osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Strengthening of the abductors muscles of the hip reduces pain, improves the function and prevents compensations that in a long term could possibly accelerate the progression of the medial knee osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Fluid {{structure}} {{response of}} vertical axis tidal turbine blades using NACA 0012 and periodic inflow equivalence model is predicted in this work. The response is investigated numerically {{by developing a}} 2 D CFD model at high Reynolds number (3. 07 x 106). The periodic inflow equivalence model is conducted by modelling {{the rotation of the}} turbine as time dependent unsteady incoming fluid velocity and angle of attack variation entering the 2 D CFD domain. The blade response is modeled by a vibrational system with spring damper components which are attached at the blade fluid dynamic center point. The aim {{of this study is to}} predict a resonant condition or a lock-in frequency induced by wake generation at a vertical axis turbine blade during the turbine operation. The model is generated using a dynamic mesh construction in OpenFOAM 2. 2 and the mesh is refined using snappyHexMesh utility. The mesh has seven added boundary layers around the blade surface and simulated using k-ω SST turbulence model. Drag, lift and <b>moment</b> <b>force</b> coefficient are observed during 12 seconds which is equal to 3. 3 revolutions and extracted using Fast Fourier Transform method to obtain its predominant frequency. The predominant frequency determines the dynamic condition of the blade and is used for predicting a resonance based on the turbine’s natural frequency. The result shows that the vertical axis tidal turbine which is manufactured from a composite with material pitch stiffness of 200 Nm/radians, heave stiffness of 1000 N/s, and operates at tidal velocity of 0. 656 m/s is found to experience a resonance or lock-in phenomena induced by wake generation in the pitch mode response...|$|E

40|$|The {{departure}} {{point of this}} article is that however one conceives the practice of American Studies one has to recognize that it is a disciplinary practice. In accordance with this contention the author proceeds to discuss the notion of the discipline as such before he goes on to ask and answer the question: “How do American Studies constitute themselves?” The author argues that American Studies, like other disciplines, constituted itself by objectifying an exceptional polity. The crux of his argument is that this self-constitution was founded on an act of erasure, whereby the evidence of capitalism was elided from the research agenda of the discipline. Contending that this erasure is paradoxical considering that American Studies has as its object the exemplary capitalist nation, the author proceeds to delineate the reasons for this erasure. He goes on to contend that American Studies was complicit with the capitalist system of production and that one can speak of it as being a part of an ideological apparatus. However, he proceeds by showing that the discipline of American Studies has always had to address the evidence of its object, namely the historical transformations in the United States, which have forced the discipline, at different points of the historical continuum, to revise its protocols and research agenda. In {{the last part of the}} article the author maintains that the unfolding economic crisis sets the ground for one such transformation and that the “command of money,” which has been revealed by the crisis, beckons us to undertake a new interdisciplinary networking, this time with economics. In the conclusion of the paper the author argues that the challenges of the present <b>moment</b> <b>force</b> the discipline to attend to postdisciplinary developments which have been proposed as ways with which to address the intractability of the present mutation of capitalism.

40|$|Several cadaveric and in vivo biomechanical {{studies have}} looked at the effects that {{ligament}} injuries of the ankle joint complex have on the stability of the ankle joint and susceptibility to chronic degeneration of articular surfaces, but the re have been very few studies that use computer simulation and the finite element method to evaluate how a n ankle ligament injury affects stability, joint pressure, and potential subsequent failure points. Evidence shows that ankle instability is associated with excessive rotation of the talus in transverse plane, which contributes to articular surface degeneration. It has been documented that after disruption of the anterior talofibular ligament that additional load is placed on the posterior tibiotalar ligament, which leads to further rotational instability. Disruption of the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament creates a more complex instability that leads to chronic joint instability of both the talocrural and subtalar joints. A 3 D model of the ankle joint was created using CT image data of a cadaver lower limb. A tetrahedral mesh was created and the bone modulus was assume d uniform. Tendons were represented by simple truss elements and surface to surface contact regions were established to facilitate joint motion. The tibia was fixed and internal rotation in the transverse plane was applied to the foot in the neutral position by means of a 5000 N-mm <b>moment.</b> <b>Force</b> displacement data was compared to experimental data collected using an MTS test frame on a cadaver specimen, and previously published data from an arthrometer study. The anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) was then removed and compared to MTS and arthrometer load and displacement data. Joint pressures were calculated from the finite element model to evaluate potential lesion spots as well as ligament forces in the deep posterior tibiotalar ligament (DPTTL). Results show a correlation in the change in magnitude from intact to ATFL cut states in the FEA model to the in vitro testing methods. The model predicts a medial shift in contact pressures under internal rotation which {{has been shown to be}} a potential location for lesions in ankles with lateral instability. The model also predicts that the DPTTL carries a majority of the resistant forces in the ligaments in internal rotation when the ATFL has been compromised...|$|E
