5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} before the 2008 season about where Bonds might play. However, no one signed {{him during the}} 2008 or 2009 seasons. If he had returned to Major League Baseball, Bonds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones: needing just 65 hits to reach 3,000, 4 runs batted in to reach 2,000, and 38 home runs to reach 800. He would have needed 69 more runs scored to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> Rickey Henderson as the all-time runs champion, and 37 extra base hits to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> Hank Aaron as the all-time extra base hits champion.|$|E
5|$|The fourth- and second-to-last {{riders to}} leave the starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, put up the best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three {{intermediate}} time checks, and 20 seconds better at the line for the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> him in the general classification. Di Luca finished sixth on the stage.|$|E
5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually <b>move</b> <b>past</b> the Grand Canyon area.|$|E

5|$|It {{was planned}} that the 2nd Infantry Brigade would <b>move</b> <b>past</b> 1st Infantry Brigade once Grévillers was {{captured}} {{but it was}} forced into action early, when its commander, Brigadier General Robert Young, seeing that the 37th Division was struggling to take its objective of Biefvillers, decided to use his brigade to assist. Accordingly, two battalions cleared the village by 10:00 am although casualties were incurred when they were fired upon by some Whippet tanks. The commander {{of one of the}} attacking battalions, along with its padre, intervened and directed the tanks onto Biefvillers. With the village captured, this secured the flank of 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|One lap later, Daniil Kvyat {{suffered}} a heavy impact at the penultimate corner, causing another safety car period. Both Hamilton and Vettel used this to change tyres again, as did Button on lap 45. The safety car {{came back in}} {{at the end of}} lap 46, with the order being: Rosberg, Hamilton, Verstappen, Vettel, Alonso, Pérez, Button and Maldonado. At the restart, Verstappen tried to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> Hamilton but failed and was in turn overtaken by Vettel. On lap 48, Nico Rosberg lost the lead to Hamilton after sliding off track due to wheelspin in his rear tyres. The German later declared that his mistake was caused by a strong gust of wind. Hamilton soon opened up a gap to his teammate, while Jenson Button moved up into sixth ahead of Alonso on lap 50, but lost the position again to Sainz {{before the end of the}} race. His teammate Alonso had been running fifth, but a loss of power from his engine moved him down the order to eventually finish eleventh. In the closing laps, Vettel edged closer to Rosberg in second, but was unable to overtake. This meant that Hamilton, who crossed the line as race winner, also took his third career championship title, with both Vettel and Rosberg now too far behind.|$|E
5|$|The sequel series' {{second season}} reveals that Avatar Aang {{apparently}} treated Tenzin as his favorite child, {{due to his}} son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her. Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.|$|E

5|$|On 15 January 2014, a {{spending}} bill {{passed by the}} House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its ground vehicle modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29-$34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million. The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not <b>move</b> <b>past</b> technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.|$|E

25|$|Zelaya {{made two}} open {{attempts}} {{to return to}} the country, which were rebuffed; he eventually returned clandestinely and sought asylum in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. Negotiations between the coup government and those seeking Zelaya's restitution continued a rocky path; although both sides signed the San José-Tegucigalpa-Guaymuras Accord both had differing interpretations as to the implications for Zelaya's restitution.

25|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{is a tool}} used in {{aerodynamic}} research to {{study the effects of}} air moving past solid objects.

25|$|Banded tunnelweb spiders {{are often}} found on and under rocks and logs, but are {{predominantly}} found in small holes in tree trunks and rocks {{in which they}} build a silk tunnel. It is in these holes that they sit and wait for prey to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> the entrance, quickly striking at {{the opportunity for a}} meal. They are rarely seen outside these holes, and it is rare to see a female roaming about unless it is moving from one hole to another. Males can be seen roaming around when they are searching for a mate.|$|E
25|$|In rotary parlors, {{the cows}} are loaded {{one at a}} time onto the {{platform}} as it rotates.

25|$|Honduran leaders {{refused to}} {{reinstate}} Zelaya before the elections, and {{international support for}} the elections remained scant {{leading up to the}} polls. Many Hondurans sought to <b>move</b> <b>past</b> the crisis with the elections, which had been scheduled previous to Zelaya's ouster. While Zelaya had urged abstention from the vote, initial returns indicated a larger than usual turnout, around 60%, a figure which was subsequently revised downward to 49%. Zelaya also disputed those figures at the time. Some Honduran activists have ended daily protests demanding the reinstatement of Zelaya since he was ousted in a coup, saying they are moving on since Congress had voted to keep Manuel Zelaya out of office.|$|E
