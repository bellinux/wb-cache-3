40|$|Hepatitis C is a blood borne {{liver disease}} caused by {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV). First identified in 1989, {{the disease was}} initially known as “Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis”. The hepatitis C virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family of viruses, and spread primarily through {{direct contact with the}} blood or body fluids of infected individuals. With the increasing use of antibody testing, the recognized prevalence of HCV infection has increased and an estimated 3 % of the world’s population currently infected, equating to 170 million chronic HCV carriers world wide. HCV infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis of the liver; therefore World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes hepatitis C as a global health problem. The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibodies in Khartoum State, and to determine the possible modes of transmission. To achieve the objectives of the study antibody to HCV (anti- HCV) was studied by third generation Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) 201 blood donors, 158 pregnant women, 198 dialysis <b>patients,</b> and 18 <b>multiple</b> <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> According to the result obtained, anti- HCV was present in 0. 4 % among blood donors, and 0 % in pregnant women. It was found in 28 % dialysis patients and 5. 5 % among <b>multiple</b> <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> Thus HCV infection was found predominantly among dialysis patients, and the possible risk factors were blood transfusion, longer duration, and loose application of universal precautions. Also this study concluded that dialysis especially in countries with high prevalence of HCV may be with possible mean of transmission of HCV.

40|$|Introduction. Transfusion Transmitted Infections (TTIs) {{continue}} to be a major risk in transfusions {{in many parts of the}} world. The transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients are particularly at risk of acquiring TTIs. The current study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of TTIs in transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients. Material and Methods. A cross-sectional study of 1253 multitransfused thalassaemia major patients was conducted in five different centres of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Karachi. The study subjects were screened for HIV, HCV, and HBV. The screening was performed at two centres: Department of Pathology, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (SZAB) Medical University, and Blood Transfusion Services, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, from July to December 2015. The confirmatory screening was performed by Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA). Results. Out of the 1253 <b>multiple</b> <b>transfused</b> <b>patients,</b> 317 (25. 3 %) were infected with TTIs. HCV was positive in 273 cases (21. 7 %), HBV in 38 cases (3. 0 %), and HIV in 6 cases (0. 5 %). Conclusion. HCV was the leading TTI in multitransfused thalassaemia major patients in the study. Presence of HIV in thalassaemia patients is a recent disturbing development in Pakistan. Improved regulation of blood banks including use of internationally or nationally evaluated kits will bring down the incidence of TTIs in transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients. More stringent behavioral and serological pretransfusion screening of blood for TTIs must be implemented in blood banks...|$|R

Each individual had received multiple blood transfusions, from 12 to 36 per year. No documentation of prior hepatic infection was available. Serum samples were collected prospectively from the randomly selected subjects and were analyzed for HGV RNA by polymerase chain reaction using primer specific for two {{different regions of the}} HGV genome. Among the 100 individuals examined 21 were positive for HGV RNA. Four patients had evidence of dual infection, both HGV RNA and HCV RNA were isolated from their sera. While in one sample presence of both HGV RNA and HBV DNA was established. Only one child was positive for hepatitis E antibodies. The sera of 10 children were reactive for hepatitis B surface antigen whereas 35 individuals were positive for hepatitis C virus antibody. The ALT levels were variable in HGV infected children. Four out of 16 (25 %) showed peak ALT levels of 218 IU/I, 8 / 16 (50 %) children demonstrated slightly elevated ALT levels whereas 25 % individuals showed normal ALT levels. Alkaline Phosphatase levels were elevated in 90 % of the children and 20 % patients of this series also had higher GGT levels. The observed AP levels were not statistically different among HGV, HGV/HCV or HGV/HBV groups. Even though the ALT levels were deranged in the children with HGV alone but none of the children had demonstrated symptoms of liver disease, their direct and total bilirubin levels were normal and no complain of jaundice was recorded.

Materials and Methods: In this prospective observational study, 45 <b>multiple</b> <b>transfused</b> beta-thalassemia major children between six months and 21 years of age were enrolled and assigned groups according to the treatment regimens suggested. Group A received only blood transfusions, Group B blood transfusions with subcutaneous desferrioxamine, Group C blood transfusions with desferrioxamine and oral deferriprone and Group D blood transfusions with deferriprone. Ocular status {{at the time of}} enrolment was documented. Subjects were observed quarterly for one year for changes in ocular status arising due to the disease process and due to iron chelation therapy. Children with hemoglobinopathies other than beta-thalassemia major, congenital ocular anomalies and anemia due to other causes were excluded.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to compare blood product consumption and clinical results in consecutive, unselected trauma patients during the first 6 months of year 2002, 2004 and 2007. Methods Clinical data, blood product consumption, lowest haemoglobin values on day 1 - 10 after admission, and 30 -day mortality were extracted from in-hospital trauma registry and the blood bank data base. The subpopulation of massively <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> was identified and analysed separately. Results The total number of admitted trauma patients increased by 48 % from 2002 to 2007, but the clinical data remained essentially unchanged. The mean number of erythrocyte units given day 1 - 10 decreased insignificantly from 9. 4 in 2002 to 6. 8 in 2007. New Injury Severity Score (NISS) increased in transfused and massively <b>transfused</b> <b>patients,</b> but not significantly. The number of <b>patients</b> <b>transfused</b> with plasma increased and the mean ratio of erythrocyte to plasma units transfused decreased by about 50 %. The mean haemoglobin value in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> on day 2 after admittance was significantly lower in 2007 than in 2002, while that on day 10 was significantly higher in 2007 than in 2002 and 2004. There was no change of 30 -day survival from 2002 to 2007. Conclusions Significant changes of transfusion practice occurred during the past decade, probably {{as a result of}} increased focus on haemostasis and more precise criteria for transfusion. Despite a lower consumption of erythrocytes in 2007 than in 2002 and 2004, the mean haemoglobin level of <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> was higher on day 10 in 2007.

In 2011, {{in addition to the}} regular ABO/D blood group typing, phenotyping for Rh (C, c, E, e) and Kell antigens was introduced for blood donors and patients undergoing blood transfusion. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of the extended RBC typing and donor/recipient matching on the incidence of RBC alloimmunization. METHODS: A retrospective comparative study was conducted by reviewing RBC request records for about 36, 000 <b>patients</b> <b>transfused</b> with RBC in the period from 2013 to 2015 in comparison to the similar study conducted on 47, 000 <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> in the period from 2005 to 2008. Pre-transfusion serologic testing data were retrieved for analysis. Blood samples with positive antibody screening and positive cross-match were further subjected to antibody identification. All the tests were performed using column agglutination technique (CAT) with ID-cards and reagents from DiaMed in both studies. RESULTS: Irregular RBC alloantibodies were detected in 116 (0. 32 %) out of 36, 000 <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>Multiple</b> transfusions (15. 8 units/patient) were given to 450 patients from which 79 (17. 5 %) had RBC allontibodies. The incidence of RBC alloimmunisation {{in the rest of the}} 35, 550 <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> from which 37 had RBC alloantibodies was 0. 10 %. A total of 117 alloantibodies were identified in 96 out of the 116 patients with irregular RBC antibodies. Their specificity was as fallows: anti-E (25. 6 %), -C (6. 0 %), -c (8. 5 %), -e (0. 85 %), -Cw (5. 1 %), -K (12. 8 %), -Fya (10. 2 %), -Fyb (2. 5 %), -Jka (7. 7 %), -Jkb (2. 5 %), -M (9. 4 %), -S (1. 7 %), -s (0. 85 %), -Lua (1. 7 %), -Leb (3. 4 %) and anti-Leb (0. 85 %). Multiple antibodies were identified in 22 of the <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> out of which 15 (68. 2 %) received multiple transfusions. Anti-E was the most common antibody found in more of the 50 % of the multiple antibody cases. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of RBC alloimmunization in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> decreased from 0. 51 % which was the estimated incidence for the period before the introduction of the extended RBC typing (2005 - 2008) to 0. 32 % (2013 - 2015). This is due to the decreased incidence of RBC alloimmunization in the multiply <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> from 33. 9 % to 17. 5 % respectively. The current frequency of anti-E (25. 6 %) and -K (12. 8 %) antibodies in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> are significantly lower than their previous estimated frequencies of 30. 4 % and 24. 0 % respectively, as well as the overall frequency of RBC antibodies to Rh+Kell antigens which decreased from 72. 4 % to 53. 8 %.

In 130 patients with cervical cancer, seen over a ten-year period at our institution, there was a trend toward earlier recurrence in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients,</b> but this trend did not achieve statistical significance. Death due to cervical cancer recurrence occurred after a median of 12 months in the <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> and a median of 68 months in the non-transfused individuals, which was statistically significant. <b>Transfused</b> <b>patients</b> had, on average, more favorable prognostic factors than those not transfused, such as less advanced clinical stage of disease. Analysis using a proportional hazards risk model failed to demonstrate a significant association between transfusion and time to recurrence when other prognostic factors were considered, but a significant association between transfusion and time to cancer-related death (p < 0. 05) was found. While these results cannot be viewed as conclusive due to the small number and heterogeneity of the patients analyzed, our data support the possibility of an association between transfusion and cervical cancer survival. Further studies are warranted to confirm or refute this relationship...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Repeated {{blood transfusions}} {{can result in}} the {{production}} of alloantibodies against one or more red cell antigens, which complicates subsequent transfusions. Aims: The study was done to find incidence of various red cell alloantibodies; to determine the type of alloantibody; to identify the factors such as frequency of transfusion, splenectomy status, donor ethnicity and gender and their association with the development of antibody in repeatedly <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in Dept. of IHBT, Shree M. P. Shah Medical College, Jamnagar, Gujarat. Blood was taken from the patients of thalassemia major, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, post partum haemorrhage, aplastic anemia, Myelodysplastic syndrome with more than 10 red cell transfusions. The plasma/serum was used for antibody screening and antibody identification test. Three cell antibody screening was performed using antihuman globulin gel cards (ID-Card LISS/Coombs) and three cell panel (ID-DiaCell I,II,III-Asia). Those with positive antibody screening were analyzed further for antibody identification test using eleven cell panel (Set ID-Dia Panel). Results: Antibody screening and identification was done in 2 consecutive set of samples (n = 300) which showed, nine (9) patients (3 %) were alloimmunized. All repeatedly <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> had developed alloantibody before the starting of study period, no patient developed new alloantibody during study period. Conclusions: Alloantibodies should be identified in repeatedly <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> and should be given corresponding antigen negative blood unit which will minimize the antibody mediated destruction of transfused red cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background And Objectives: Alloantibody {{formation}} against {{red blood}} cell (RBC) antigens is a common complication of transfusion therapy. The RBC antigens and their alloantibodies vary among different human populations and ethnic groups, and {{they do have a}} clinical significance for their adverse immunological reactions. The prevalence of RBC alloimmunization is hardly known in Zambia and hence the need to conduct this study whose main aim was to determine the frequency and distribution of RBC alloantibodies at the Blood Transfusion Unit of Ndola Central Hospital. Materials and Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> at Ndola Central Hospital in Zambia were investigated. Demographic characteristics and transfusion histories were recorded. EDTA blood samples were obtained from the hospital blood bank and RBC alloimmunization was demonstrated using immunohaematological tests. Results: The overall prevalence of alloimmunization was 70 (7. 0 %). The majority of these had a single alloantibody 55 (78. 6 %), whereas the remaining 15 (21. 4 %) had multiple antibodies. The anti-E antibody comprised the most common alloantibody 19 (27. 0 %) followed by anti K antibodies. Gender, number of blood units and ABO group A were found to be risk factors of alloimmunization in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> Conclusions: The prevalence of RBC alloimmunization in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> at NCH is high and is mainly associated with the number of donor exposures. Women with multiple pregnancies are especially at risk of alloimmunization. We recommend the introduction of pretransfusion antibody tests in donor and patient’s blood...|$|R
40|$|A blood {{transfusion}} {{is a common}} treatment {{for a range of}} conditions. Over 112 million {{blood transfusion}}s are administered each year worldwide and many patients are thereby exposed to the possible risks associated with the procedure. In this thesis we focus on the critically ill patient, who is both to a great extent exposed to blood transfusion, and by his/her underlying illness, also susceptible to its adverse effects. We aimed to describe the population of the massively <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> and study possible negative effects associated with certain parts of the transfusion therapies. Additionally, we investigated the possibility to identify, through national health registers, the rare, but serious condition transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) which today is considered the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. In the first study we characterized the population of massively <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> in Sweden and Denmark during the last decades. We found a non-negligible incidence of massive transfusion with the dominating indication being major surgery. The overall mortality among massively <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> was high, both expressed as 30 -day- and 5 -year-mortality. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 26. 2 during the first 6 months after transfusion and decreased gradually with time but was still elevated as long as 10 years after the transfusion event. In the second study, we studied the effect of plasma to red blood cell ratio among bleeding trauma patients. With a time-dependent model, and in contrast to previous observational data, we found no difference in outcome between high and low plasma ratio. We suggest that previous research suffered from severe bias and conclude that no strong evidence for using high plasma ratio in trauma patients exists today. Our third study investigated a possible detrimental effect of the storage time of red blood cells. We used three different analytical approaches to assess the association between storage time of red blood cells and mortality in <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> Consistently, throughout all analyses, we found no such association. Our results, which are concordant with recently published randomized controlled trials, indicate the safety of today’s practice to store red blood cells for up to 42 days. The fourth study was performed with the aim to develop and test a statistical method for identifying donors with high risk of causing TRALI in the recipient. The statistical method was based on the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> We constructed a risk score for each donor based on the difference between observed and expected ARDS cases among that donor´s recipients. Through this risk score we selected patients for manual review of medical records. The review resulted in identification of only one definitive TRALI case and we conclude that our statistical method, for the moment, fails to be a way of identifying and further study the condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to assess the rate and appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at the Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka in two six-month periods, at an interval of 5 years, before and after introducing clinical standards for transfusion practice and hemovigilance, and to evaluate the results of applied measures. We studied 315 <b>patients</b> <b>transfused</b> with 1341 doses of FFP in two six-month periods from September to February of 1999 / 2000 and 2004 / 2005. The first period (1999 / 00) of the study was retrospective and 226 <b>patients</b> were <b>transfused</b> with 928 FFP units. The second period (2004 / 05) was prospective and we studied 89 <b>patients</b> <b>transfused</b> with 413 units. In the first period blood bank records were retrospectively reviewed and in the second period all FFP requests, performed coagulation tests and transfusion episodes were prospectively analyzed. The number of inappropriate transfusions decreased from 39. 8 % to 23. 6 %. In most patients (85. 1 %), coagulation tests were made prior to FFP transfusion. The number of <b>patients</b> <b>transfused</b> with one and two FFP doses decreased, while those transfused with three or more doses increased. Most of the appropriately <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> were those with active bleeding due to coagulation factor deficiency and massive transfusions. The least were those requiring reversal of warfarin effect. Our results demonstrated a {{decrease in the number of}} patients treated with FFP in the second period. The introduction of clinical standards of good transfusion practice and hemovigilance showed positive effects. Considering that there was a number of inappropriately <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> continued education of all health personnel engaged in transfusion treatment is evidently necessary...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{dramatic}} impact of hemosiderosis on survival in chronically <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> with hereditary anemia is well known. We evaluated whether patients receiving multiple {{red blood cell}} (RBC) transfusions are adequately screened for hemosiderosis. Methods: We retrospectively assessed hemosiderosis screening and prevalence in adult patients that received over twenty RBC units in the University Medical Centre Utrecht from 2010 till 2015. Hemosiderosis was defined as ferritin ≥ 1000  μg/L. Adequate screening for chronically <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> was defined as any ferritin determined up to 3  months before or any moment after the last transfusion, while for patients that received all transfusions within 3  months (bulk transfusion), ferritin had to be determined after at least twenty transfusions. Results: Of 471 patients, only 38. 6 % was adequately screened and hemosiderosis prevalence was 46. 7 %. Hemosiderosis prevalence was 47 % in the chronic transfusion group and 12 % in the bulk transfusion group. In <b>patients</b> <b>transfused</b> because of hematological malignancy or cardiothoracic surgery, respectively, 74 % and 31 % were adequately screened and hemosiderosis prevalence was 53 % and 13 %, respectively. Conclusion: Hemosiderosis screening in our routine practice is suboptimal. Hemosiderosis is not an exclusive complication of multiple transfusions in the hematology ward. We recommend screening for hemosiderosis in all patients receiving multiple transfusions...|$|R

40|$|Background. In the Balearic Islands, as {{in other}} areas of the Mediterranean basin, there is a {{significant}} proportion of asymptomatic Leishmania (L.) infantum-infected blood donors, who may represent an important threat to transfusion safety. The Balearic Islands blood bank, located in an area endemic for L. infantum, carried out a study of donors and patients to investigate the impact of this infectious disease on blood safety in the region. Materials and methods. Twenty asymptomatic Leishmania-infected blood donors were followed-up between 2008 and 2011 to investigate the evolution of Leishmania infection in asymptomatic carriers. Their blood was periodically tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies by western blot and for Leishmania DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Additionally, the prevalence of L. infantum infection was investigated in a group of 68 multiply <b>transfused</b> <b>patients</b> to ascertain the risk of transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis (TTL) in the region, taking into account regular blood component production practices such as pre-storage leucodepletion and pathogen reduction technology. Results. All 20 donors remained asymptomatic over the study period (2008 - 2011). Most donors had repeatedly positive qPCR results, either persistently or intermittently, but showed no symptoms of Leishmaniasis. Levels of parasitaemia were remarkably low in asymptomatic donors, with values ≤ 1 parasite/mL. Despite multiple transfusions received over 15 years, no <b>transfused</b> <b>patient</b> studied was infected with L. infantum. Discussion. L. infantum-infected donors can remain asymptomatic for at least 3 years. In our region, no cases of TTL were detected, despite an active search in multiply <b>transfused</b> <b>patients.</b> This seems to be related to two independent variables: (i) a low concentration of the parasite in the peripheral blood of asymptomatic carriers and (ii) the application of methods with proven efficacy against TTL, such as leucodepletion and pathogen reduction technology...|$|R
