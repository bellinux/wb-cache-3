5|$|After {{living in}} Colorado for seven months, Gattis {{then moved to}} Dallas with his brother, where they worked as janitors for Datamatics Global Services.

Three months later, he moved to California to find <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> gurus. Gattis also moved to Wyoming, where he worked at Yellowstone National Park.|$|E
5|$|Eric Oey of the University of California, Berkeley, {{writes that}} the novel's mysticism builds into a {{promotion}} of theosophy and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic lives to become <b>more</b> <b>spiritual.</b> Ultimately, he writes, the concept of reincarnation is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of Gadjah Mada University also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} on PBS in Houston with Ernie Manouse, Schuur stated {{that she had}} chronically struggled with her weight. She had a drug and alcohol addiction in the late 1980s, and had attempted suicide in the past. At one point, she was stopped from jumping from a third story window by her brother-in-law. She benefited from twelve-step programs and, as of 2016, had been sober for several decades. Schuur has dedicated songs to the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in her shows. She stated that her life has grown much <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> as she has matured.|$|E
5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may {{have witnessed the}} collapse of Mount Mazama {{and the formation of}} Crater Lake, have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating Crater Lake, called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used Crater Lake in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> powers. The tribe still holds Crater Lake in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E
5|$|The Mar Saba {{letter was}} {{attributed}} to Clement by Morton Smith, but there remains much debate today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph or a modern forgery. If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there wrote a <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of the sixth century was a period of {{political}} disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure. Religious divisions were an important cause of the crisis. Judaism became the dominant religion in Yemen while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf area. In line with broader trends of the ancient world, the region witnessed a decline in the practice of polytheistic cults and a growing interest in a <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> form of religion. While many were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points.|$|E
5|$|After their marriage, Prince Andrew {{continued}} {{his career in}} the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she talked with her aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses. Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as the Athens government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew's resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|Whistler was {{not entirely}} content with the realism the {{painting}} displayed in its original form, a trait he blamed on the influence Courbet had on him at the time. Later, between 1867 and 1872, he reworked it {{to give it a}} <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> expression. Even though Symphony was begun before Whistler first met Rossetti, the Pre-Raphaelite influence is still clear. The painting was an early experiment in white on white, with a woman standing in a white dress in front of a white background. This colour scheme was a subject he would return to later, in two paintings that would be given the titles of Symphony in White, No. 2 (1864) and Symphony in White, No. 3 (1865–67). The panel is long and slender, and the model's pose and the shape of her clothes further emphasise the vertical nature of the painting. The woman is bold, almost confrontational, in her direct gaze at the viewer, and her features are highly individualised. Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E

25|$|Challenges to the {{secularization}} hypothesis led {{to significant}} revisions, {{resulting in the}} religious transformation hypothesis. This perspective holds that general trends towards individualism and social disintegration will produce changes in religion, making religious practice more individualized and spiritually focused. This in turn is expected to produce <b>more</b> <b>spiritual</b> seeking, although not exclusive to religious institutions. Eclecticism, which draws from multiple religious/spiritual systems and New Age movements are also predicted to result.|$|E
