500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the last time I took <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!" [...] She continued, [...] "Taking off <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> is not the easiest thing, but with the magic of the effects, I don't have to do a season 1 and go on a cliff and do it, I'm in control of it." ...|$|E

It was {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever had to do on a shoot. But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> so there's a little fun fact for you. I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to get all that emotion off my chest." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Monster" [...] {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, and composed in the key of C major, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute and Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low note of E3 to the high note of B4. [...] "Monster" [...] has a basic sequence of F–G–Am–Em as its chord progression. Lyrically, [...] "Monster" [...] contains zombie-like metaphors about having one's heart eaten. The song also features references to [...] "Just Dance", Gaga's debut single, with the line [...] "I wanna ‘Just Dance’/ But he took me home instead". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH believed that the lines in the last verse [...] "get a bit gruesome at the end" [...] with the lines saying [...] "He tore <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> right off/ He ate my heart and then he ate my brain." ...|$|E

500|$|Chatwin's {{early years}} were spent moving {{regularly}} {{with his mother}} while his father was at sea. Prior to his birth, Chatwin's parents had lived at Barnt Green, Worcestershire, but Margharita moved to her parents' house in Dronfield, near Sheffield, shortly before giving birth. [...] Mother and son remained there {{for only a few}} weeks. Worried about Nazi bombs, Margharita sought a safer place to stay. She took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war. They would remain in one place until Margharita decided to move, either because of concern for their safety, or because of friction among family members. [...] Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war, [...] "Home, if we had one, was a solid black suitcase called the Rev-Robe, in which there was a corner for <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and my Mickey Mouse gas mask." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2000, {{she held}} a one-hour special show on ABC and {{performed}} [...] "Falsas Esperanzas", it was later recorded in a video release entitled My Reflection. Aguilera also gave a performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards in February, performing [...] "Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti" [...] and [...] "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard magazine called Aguilera's Grammy performance [...] "remarkably mainstream". [...] During her 2003 Justified and Stripped Tour, her first co-headlining tour with Justin Timberlake, she performed a medley of [...] "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] and [...] "Contigo en la Distancia". At {{the end of the}} performance, a male dancer ripped off the skirt she wore, revealing [...] "tiny" [...] denim shorts underneath. Later, she [...] "saucily" [...] replied, [...] "Just because my album name is Stripped, doesn't mean you can take <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> off". She also performed the medley during the tour's extension, The Stripped Tour in late 2003; it was later included in the DVD release Stripped Live in the U.K..|$|E
500|$|Later, Youkilis {{was swept}} up in the team's ritual annual hazing, in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters {{waitress}} outfits, orange satin shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida. [...] "I walked into the locker room, and all <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> were gone", Youkilis said. [...] "There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes." [...] Youkilis was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Month for May, after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a [...]446 OBP as he batted [...]318 with 7 RBIs, and 15 runs in 13 games. Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed, he said: [...] "I'm staying in the best hotel I've ever stayed in, and my paycheck has quadrupled." [...] In mid-July he was sent back down to AAA, however, to make room for Ramiro Mendoza, though he was brought up again {{towards the end of the}} season.|$|E

500|$|Waugh did not query his friend's judgement, {{but took}} his {{manuscript}} to the school's furnaces and unceremoniously burnt it. Immediately afterwards {{he received the}} news that the job with Scott Moncrieff had fallen through. The double blow affected Waugh severely; he wrote in his diary in July: [...] "The phrase 'the end of the tether' besets me with unshakeable persistence". In his biography Waugh writes: [...] "I went down alone to the beach with my thoughts full of death. I took off <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> and began swimming out to sea. Did I really intend to drown myself? That was certainly in my mind". He left a note with his clothes, a quotation from Euripides about the sea washing away all human ills. A short way out, after being stung by jellyfish, he abandoned the attempt, turned round and swam back to the shore. He did not, however, withdraw his resignation from the school, returning instead to London.|$|E
500|$|... "Wet" [...] is an uptempo track, {{containing}} a thumping disco beat, a throbbing bass, and electronic beats. The song {{was written by}} Ester Dean and Traci Hale, and co-written and produced by Norwegian duo StarGate and Sandy Vee. Scherzinger is said to confesses that her body is [...] "aching for a man's touch", stating [...] "This beat is filthy dirty/ I feel it all over me". Described as a [...] "dance-ready club banger" [...] by Idolator, the song chronicles [...] "many sexy ways" [...] Scherzinger gets wet; sweating, a shower, a swim, and drowning. Scherzinger continues the whole [...] "drenched" [...] theme within the songs' chorus: [...] "Well Imma take <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> off/Take a leap and surf through the crowd/Dripping down my neck/Soaking wet, sink or swim or you drown/Let's get a little wet." [...] In the song, Scherzinger sings about running around naked, stating [...] "I feel like whatever I do tonight would be {{the talk of the}} town." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thought that}} it would be a great {{opportunity}} to showcase herself as an artist, as well as expressing the true meaning of her songs. She stated: [...] "I really wanted to do MTV Unplugged, obviously, because it has such a great history of showing off really who the person is... You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a little piece of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Michael Hubbard from musicOMH called [...] "Monster" [...] "a potential single", praising its musical composition, but criticizing the lyrics. Evan Sawdey from PopMatters also criticized the metaphors {{contained in the}} lyrics of the song, but ultimately called it [...] "one surprisingly effective pop cocktail". Ben Patashnik from NME {{felt that it was}} [...] "slightly too disposable". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork saw similarities between Gaga's voice on [...] "Monster" [...] and the work of Kylie Minogue. Brian Linder from IGN felt that the track was lighter compared to the other songs on The Fame Monster, and complimented the line [...] "We French kissed on a subway train / He tore <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> right off / He ate my heart and then he ate my brain", calling it a lyrical gem. He also added that [...] "Monster" [...] was a [...] "dance floor riot". Jaime Gill from Yahoo! felt that [...] "'Monster' is a squirmy little beast that wriggles into your brain slowly and is almost impossible to remove." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard called the song [...] "80s adoring".|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of <b>my</b> <b>clothes</b> are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively.

I felt really violated: they cut up <b>my</b> <b>clothes,</b> stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere.
