5|$|James Nesbitt is {{an actor}} from Northern Ireland whose filmography {{encompasses}} both television and film roles over a 30-year period. Nesbitt's screen career {{began in the}} early 1980s with uncredited roles in episodes of the BBC Play For Today strand, which he had while attached to the Riverside Theatre's youth group. His first credited role came in 1989, as a bit player in the John Ogdon biopic Virtuoso, which was followed by his first feature film role in 1991 in Hear <b>My</b> <b>Song.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear <b>My</b> <b>Song</b> and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{primitive}} southern Negro, as he sang, {{was sure}} to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, {{it was always the}} same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into <b>my</b> <b>song,</b> although its prevailing key was major..., and I carried this device into my melody as well... This was a distinct departure, but as it turned out, it touched the spot.|$|E
25|$|She was a {{prolific}} author, publishing {{a book of}} poems Verse in Prosa in the early 1920s, a novel, Orplid, mein Land in 1937, which appeared in English as Eternal Flight in 1937, and a book of memoirs, Anfang und Aufstieg (1937), which later appeared as On Wings of Song in the U.K. in 1938 and as Midway in <b>My</b> <b>Song</b> in the U.S. in 1938. She also published volumes on the interpretation of song and the interpretation of opera roles. Later books included Five Operas and Richard Strauss, known as Singing with Richard Strauss in the U.K., a second book of poems in 1969, and Eighteen Song Cycles in 1971, consisting of material drawn largely from earlier works.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{he lived with}} fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the {{successful}} star of Soldier Soldier. In his debut feature film, Hear <b>My</b> <b>Song</b> (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A New York Times critic wrote, [...] "the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, [...] "When I did Hear <b>My</b> <b>Song,</b> I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are." [...] His attitude left him {{out of work for}} six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and Between the Lines. In 1993, he appeared in Love Lies Bleeding, an instalment of the BBC anthology series Screenplay and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in Go Now (1995), Jude (1996) and Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). A Guardian journalist wrote that [...] "he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor" [...] in Jude and Sarajevo.|$|E

[...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do you suppose was singled out for that honour?

500|$|A {{misconception}} circulated at {{the time}} that the painting had been inspired by Swinburne's poem. In a letter to a newspaper, Whistler refuted this, while still showing his respect for Swinburne's work; [...] "those lines" [...] he wrote [...] "were only written, in my studio, after the picture was painted. And the writing of them was a rare and graceful tribute from the poet to the painter – a noble recognition of work by the production of a nobler one." [...] Swinburne repaid the compliment: [...] "...whatever merit <b>my</b> <b>song</b> may have, it is not so complete in beauty, in tenderness and significance, in exquisite execution and delicate strength, as Whistler's picture..." ...|$|E

I couldn't believe it." [...] The Beatles' usual producer, George Martin, called the remixes [...] "so uncharacteristic" [...] of the Beatles, while Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, described Spector's embellishments as [...] "revolting … just puke".|$|E

500|$|William James Nesbitt, [...] (born 15 January 1965) is {{an actor}} and {{presenter}} from Northern Ireland. Born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Nesbitt {{grew up in the}} nearby village of Broughshane, before moving to Coleraine, County Londonderry. He wanted to become a teacher like his father, so he began a degree in French at the University of Ulster. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical Up on the Roof (1987, 1989) to the political drama Paddywack (1994). He made his feature film debut playing talent agent Fintan O'Donnell in Hear <b>My</b> <b>Song</b> (1991).|$|E
500|$|After {{listening}} to Chet Baker's {{version of the}} 1931 Ray Henderson/Lew Brown song [...] "The Thrill Is Gone" [...] from the 1954 Pacific Jazz record Chet Baker Sings, Costello became inspired to create similar-sounding music. [...] He noted that the recording's [...] "eeriness" [...] and [...] "haunted" [...] qualities persuaded him to create his own take on it. [...] In a 2015 memoir Costello wrote that Baker's version of the Richie Beirach song Leaving [...] "had provoked <b>my</b> <b>song</b> [...] "Almost Blue" [...] as much as Chet's recording of the Brown and Henderson song [...] "The Thrill is Gone." [...] " [...] Costello wrote the ballad that shared the same name as his previous 1981 studio album, and wrote and recorded it with a [...] "British pop" [...] perspective.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kidzworld, Rihanna explained the lyrical content of the song, saying: [...] "It's just language that we speak in Barbados. It's broken English. Pon is on, de means the, so it's just basically telling the DJ to put <b>my</b> <b>song</b> on the replay." [...] Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic [...] wrote about the song's composition and musical influences, [...] " [...] is driven by booming dancehall-lite beats and a reggae vocal cadence (and title spelling), it's a simple dance-pop song at its core, with standard English-language singing {{as well as a}} can't-miss singalong hook." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone also commented on the song's composition and concurred with Birchmeier's opinions of the song, writing that the song is [...] "a poppy piece of dancehall reggae with slapping, syncopated beats recalling big-band jazz".|$|E

However, Townshend refused permission for director Michael Moore to play the song over the closing credits of Fahrenheit 9/11, as he was suspicious of Moore's journalistic credentials and did not want his work to be associated with a possibly inaccurate film. Townshend later said [...] "nce I had an idea what the film was about, I was 90% certain <b>my</b> <b>song</b> was not right for them." [...] In response Moore accused Townshend of supporting the Iraq War, which Townshend denied.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the live}} {{television}} special featuring additional songs not {{included on the}} album itself, the special in its entirety was released on August 29, 2006 by Rhino Entertainment as a DVD album.
