This study aims {{to evaluate the}} relationship between women’s personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use {{and the risk of}} B-cell NHL. Methods: A 1 : 1 matched population-based case-control study of women conducted in Los Angeles County recruited 986 case-control pairs. Case participants were diagnosed with histologic confirmed primary B-cell NHL between 2004 and 2008. Control participants were individually matched to the index cases by age, gender, race, and neighborhood of residence. Exposure information was obtained by in-person interviews. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of B-cell NHL associated with personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use overall, by race, and by NHL subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders (alcohol status, smoking status, and education levels).; Results: Compared to women who had never used any <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products, those who had ever used personal <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> had a 38 % greater risk for B-cell NHL (OR= 1. 38, 95 %CI= 1. 05 - 1. 31). A younger age at first <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, a longer duration of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use, and a greater number of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> applications were all associated with an elevated risk of B-cell NHL (p-values for trend= 0. 007, 0. 006, 0. 025, respectively).

Methods Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine consecutive patients in 12 dermatology clinics were patch tested with five <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> available from patch test suppliers. Furthermore, 22 frequently used <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> ingredients not available from patch test suppliers were tested in subgroups of approximate to 500 patients each. Results A positive reaction to PPD was found in 4. 5 % of patients, and 2. 8 % reacted to toluene- 2, 5 -diamine (PTD), 1. 8 % to p-aminophenol, 1 % to m-aminophenol, and 0. 1 % to resorcinol; all together, 5. 3 % (n= 156). Dying hair was the most frequently reported cause of the allergy (55. 4 %); so-called temporary henna' tattoos were the cause in 8. 5 % of the cases. p-Methylaminophenol gave a reaction in 20 patients (2. 2 %), 3 of them with clinical relevance, and no co-reaction with the above five well-known <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Conclusions <b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are the prime cause of PPD allergy.

40|$|Hand eczema is a {{well-known}} problem in occupations that involve largely manual work, in combination with long periods of wet exposure and skin contact with chemicals. Hairdressing involves dermal exposure {{to a number of}} skin damaging substances. Hair cosmetic products such as <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> permanent wave solutions and bleaches can cause contact allergy and extensive wet work can cause irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). In this thesis the occurrence of hand eczema was studied in a nation-wide retrospective longitudinal cohort study comprising 7, 203 female hairdressers attending the vocational hairdressing programme during a period of 25 years. A total of 7, 355 women from the general population constituted the control group. A hand rinse method for assessment of dermal exposure to permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> on hairdressers' hands was developed and validated. The validated hand rinse method was used during <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> in hairdressing salons for assessment of the exposure to p-phenylenediamine (PPD), toluene- 2, 5 -diaminesulfate (TDS), m-aminophenol, resorcinol (RES) and 2 -methylresorcinol (MRE). Hand rinse samples were taken before the start of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing,</b> after application of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> to the <b>hair</b> and after cutting newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> The hand rinse samples were analysed with highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) together with extracts from newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> In another study the permeation of PPD, TDS and RES through protective gloves frequently used in hairdressing was investigated. The gloves were made of natural rubber latex, polyvinyl chloride, nitrile rubber and polyethene. The incidence of hand eczema was 23. 8 cases/ 1, 000 person-years for the hairdressers and 9. 6 cases/person years for the controls, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2. 5 (95 % Cl 2. 2 - 2. 8), with an IRR of 3. 1 (95 % Cl 2. 6 - 3. 5) for hairdressers younger than 25 years. The attributable fraction of hand eczema cases from skin atopy was 9. 6 % in hairdressers. A high frequency of hair treatments that involves risk for exposure to skin damaging substances was reported by the hairdressers. The assessment of dermal exposure to permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in the salons showed that after application of <b>hair</b> <b>dye,</b> positive hand rinse samples were found in 26 out of 33 hairdressers. No statistically significant difference in the amount of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds found on the hairdressers' hands was observed between users and non-users of protective gloves. <b>Hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds were found in samples from 23 out of 29 hairdressers after cutting newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> Eleven out of twelve extracts of newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair</b> contained <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds. The exposure loadings of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds found in the hand rinse samples are at a level at which there is a risk of sensitization. None of the tested protective gloves was permeated by the <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds before 30 minutes. In conclusion: the incidence of hand eczema among hairdressers was remarkably high. The hand eczema starts early in life for many individuals. About 10 % of the hand eczema cases would be prevented if no skin atopics entered the trade. The hairdressers are exposed to <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds during application of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> and after cutting of newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> The exposure levels found on hairdressers hand are in the level where there is a risk for sensitisation.

[...] Because of the chemical nature of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> strippers, they are effective on both newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair</b> and older <b>dye.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Hair</b> <b>dye</b> poisoning, with main toxic {{component}} paraphenylene diamine, is {{a medical}} emergency. It is on increasing trend in developing countries due to wide availability and low cost of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> It carries a high mortality and {{does not have any}} specific antidote. Case Report: Twenty three years old patient presented with breathelessness along with difficulty in speaking for one hour after consuming <b>hair</b> <b>dye.</b> He developed cervicofacial edema followed by rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury, classical of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> poisoning. Laboratory investigations revealed blood urea of 100 mg/dl and serum creatinine of 3. 8 mg/dl. The serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were 1230 U/L and urine myoglobin was positive. He was treated conservatively for acute kidney injury and discharged in stable condition. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment of poisoning due to <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> leads to improved prognosis, so widespread awareness is needed about this emerging form of poisoning. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{concentration}} of PPD in <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> formulation varies from 70 to 90 % in stone <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> and 2 – 10 % in branded dyes (Kondle et al., 2012), {{which are used}} for giving black color to hair. Exact concentrations of PPD in different formulations are not known because most <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> formulations are proprietary. PPD is rapidly absorbed into the blood through mucous membranes of the digestive tract after its oral intake (Senthilkumaran & Thirumalaikolundusubramania, 2015).|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{and genetic}} factors {{appear to be}} {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the small and medium sized intrahepatic bile ducts. Environmental factors include exposure to various infectious, xenobiotic and chemical compounds. These exposures may occur occupationally, through water or air contamination, pharmacological administration or by elective exposure, to name a few. <b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are compounds that have been implicated in the development of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and PBC. So far, only epidemiological studies have addressed the role of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in PBC, with limited results. <b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in SLE have been examined, and have recently demonstrated an association, both epidemiologically and immunologically. This follows a series of negative studies, which may not have taken into account several features of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use. This review will examine the literature surrounding <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use and SLE, and compare this to data surrounding PBC. Treating physicians should be prepared for questions surrounding the need to take precautions against repeated <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use and this topic is discussed further. © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>dye</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{cosmetic}} products which are used more widely and frequently to improve an individual’s appearance. Although the genotoxic effects of dye ingredients are widely reported, <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> in its usable form is not reported extensively. In this contribution, we report the possible mode of interaction of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> with DNA which leads to genotoxicity. The effect of dye DNA interaction was studied on the most popular and globally used <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> with Calf Thymus DNA and plasmid DNA. This interaction of dye DNA was studied by spectroscopic analyses and gel electrophoresis. The result had shown positive interaction of dye with DNA. Gel electrophoresis study confirms the binding of dye with DNA which results in linearization and fragmentation of the plasmid DNA. Dye–DNA interaction causes fragmentation and oxidation of DNA in absence of any catalyst, implies high toxicity of commercial <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Thus, it can be deduced from the present studies that <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> in its usable form may lead to its penetration through skin affecting genomic DNA possesses genotoxic property and can be treated as one of the most common mutagen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hair {{coloring}} {{products are}} one of the most important cosmetics for modern people; there are three major types of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> including the temporary, semi-permanent and permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> The selected <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (such as ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate, resorcinol and lawsone) are the important components for hair coloring products. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of these compounds on melanogenesis in B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells. The results proved that <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> resorcinol and lawsone can reduce the production of melanin. The results also confirmed that resorcinol and lawsone inhibit mushroom and cellular tyrosinase activities in vitro. Resorcinol and lawsone can also downregulate the protein levels of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in B 16 -F 10 cells. Thus, we suggest that frequent use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> may have the risk of reducing natural melanin production in hair follicles. Moreover, resorcinol and lawsone may also be used as hypopigmenting agents to food, agricultural and cosmetic industry in the future...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{finding that}} many {{permanent}} and semipermanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are strongly mutagenic {{in a laboratory}} test, together {{with the fact that}} single female hair-dressers had higher than expected death rates from breast-cancer in 1959 - 63, prompted a study into the use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> by patients with breast cancer and by matched controls. There was no difference between the patients and their controls in their use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> There were also {{no significant differences between the}} two groups when the analysis was confinedto women who had used dyes over four years and over nine years before diagnosis. The only significant findings were a higher proportion of past or present smokers among women aged over 50 who used <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> and an association between <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> use and age at first pregnancy. Further epidemiological studies are clearly needed in view of the mutagenicity found in the Ames test, and the fact th & several human carcinogens are also mutagenic according to this test...|$|R
