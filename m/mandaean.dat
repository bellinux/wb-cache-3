25|$|Carsten Colpe (b. 1929) has {{analyzed}} and criticised the Iranian hypothesis of Reitzenstein, showing {{that many of}} his hypotheses are untenable. Nevertheless, Geo Widengren (1907–1996) argued for the origin of (<b>Mandaean)</b> Gnosticism in Mazdean (Zoroastrianism) Zurvanism, in conjunction with ideas from the Aramaic Mesopotamian world.|$|E
25|$|The Iraq <b>Mandaean</b> (and Sabian) community, in the pre 2003 war period, was {{the most}} {{important}} in the world with 30,000–50,000 of the 70,000 total living in the country mainly in the area around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Mandaeans although an ethnic and religious minority, consider themselves Iraqi and have supported the Iraqi nation patriotically, serving in the army during various conflicts. They were considered an economically successful community, and had achieved high levels in Iraqi society, and are held in high regard as silversmiths and goldsmiths.|$|E
25|$|Many of Thévenot's {{maps of the}} Middle East were {{published}} in his Relations de Divers Voyages Curieux (Paris, 1663), a collection of translations of voyages of discovery (such as that of Cosmas Indicopleustes). One of these {{was one of the}} earliest and most detailed depiction of southern Iraq (his nephew Jean de Thévenot later visited this region). Thévenot makes reference to the Mandaeans of the Basra region, and includes a printed page from one of this sect’s holy books, one of the first printed appearances of the <b>Mandaean</b> language in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} Iranian <b>Mandaeans</b> {{is a matter}} of dispute. In 2009, there were an {{estimated}} 5,000 and 10,000 <b>Mandaeans</b> in Iran, according to the Associated Press, while Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian <b>Mandaeans</b> as high as 60,000 in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, most <b>Mandaeans</b> were Iraqi, {{but this}} {{religious}} minority {{fled the country}} {{in the face of this}} violence, and the <b>Mandaeans</b> community in Iraq faces extinction. Out of the over 60,000 <b>Mandaeans</b> in Iraq in the early 1990s, only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there; as of early 2007, over 80% of Iraqi <b>Mandaeans</b> were refugees in Syria and Jordan as a result of the Iraq War.|$|R
50|$|The {{status of}} the <b>Mandaeans</b> became an issue for the Abbasid al-Qahir Billah. To avoid further {{investigation}} by the authorities, the <b>Mandaeans</b> paid a bribe of 50,000 dinars and were left alone. It appears that the <b>Mandaeans</b> were even exempt from paying the Jizya, otherwise imposed upon non-Muslims.|$|R
25|$|The {{movement}} {{spread in}} areas {{controlled by the}} Roman Empire and Arian Goths, and the Persian Empire. It continued to develop in the Mediterranean and Middle East {{before and during the}} 2nd and 3rd centuries, but decline also set in during the Third Century CE, due to a growing aversion from the Catholic Church, and the economic and cultural detoriation of the Roman Empire. Conversion to Islam, and the Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229), greatly reduced the remaining number of Gnostics throughout the Middle Ages, though a few <b>Mandaean</b> communities still exist. Gnostic and pseudo-gnostic ideas became influential in some of the philosophies of various esoteric mystical movements of the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe and North America, including some that explicitly identify themselves as revivals or even continuations of earlier gnostic groups.|$|E
25|$|Assyrian {{exodus from}} Iraq from 2003 until present is often {{described}} as ethnic cleansing. Although Iraqi Christians represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi population, they make up 40% of the refugees now living in nearby countries, according to UNHCR. In the 16th century, Christians constituted half of Iraq's population. In 1987, the last Iraqi census counted 1.4 million Christians. Following the 2003 invasion and the reusltant growth of militant Islamism, Christians' total numbers slumped to about 500,000, of whom 250,000 live in Baghdad. Furthermore, the <b>Mandaean</b> and Yazidi communities are at the risk of elimination due to the ongoing atrocities by Islamic extremists. A 25 May 2007 article notes that in the past 7 months only 69 people from Iraq have been granted refugee status in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} also arises as {{to various}} sects' usage of other works attributed to Thomas and {{their relation to}} this work. The Book of Thomas the Contender, also from Nag Hammadi, is foremost among these, but the extensive Acts of Thomas provides the mythological connections. The short and comparatively straightforward Apocalypse of Thomas has no immediate connection with the synoptic gospels, while the canonical Jude – if the name {{can be taken to}} refer to Judas Thomas Didymus – certainly attests to early intra-Christian conflict. The Infancy Gospel of Thomas, shorn of its mythological connections, is difficult to connect specifically to our gospel, but the Acts of Thomas contains the Hymn of the Pearl whose content is reflected in the Psalms of Thomas found in Manichaean literature. These psalms, which otherwise reveal <b>Mandaean</b> connections, also contain material overlapping the Gospel of Thomas.|$|E
50|$|The Haran Gawaita {{uses the}} name Nasoreans for the <b>Mandaeans</b> {{arriving}} from Jerusalem. Consequently, the <b>Mandaeans</b> have been {{connected with the}} 4th-century Nazarenes described by Epiphanius.|$|R
50|$|Following the First World War, the <b>Mandaeans</b> {{were still}} largely living {{in rural areas}} in the lower parts of British {{protected}} Iraq and Iran. Owing {{to the rise of}} Arab nationalism, <b>Mandaeans</b> were Arabised at an accelerated rate, especially during the 1950s and '60s. The <b>Mandaeans</b> were also forced to abandon their stands on the cutting of hair and forced military service, which are strictly prohibited in Mandaenism.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mandaeans</b> of Iran lived chiefly in Ahvaz, Iranian Khuzestan, {{but have}} moved {{as a result}} of the Iraq-Iran War to other cities such as Tehran, Karaj and Shiraz. The <b>Mandaeans,</b> who were {{traditionally}} considered as People of the Book (members of a protected religion under Islamic rule) lost this status after the Islamic Revolution. Local authorities in Iranian Islamic Republic are known to encourage harassment and persecution of the <b>Mandaeans.</b>|$|R
500|$|Although Mani (216–276 AD), the {{founding}} prophet of Manichaeism, did not proclaim his first religious revelation until 228/229 AD, Bivar asserts {{that his new}} faith contained [...] "elements of <b>Mandaean</b> belief, Iranian cosmogony, and even echoes of Christianity... may {{be regarded as a}} typical reflection of the mixed religious doctrines of the late Arsacid period, which the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sasanians was soon to sweep away." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name of {{the group}} derives from the term Mandā d-Heyyi, which roughly means [...] "Knowledge of Life." [...] Although the exact chronological origins of this {{movement}} are not known, John the Baptist eventually came {{to be a key}} figure in the religion, as an emphasis on baptism is part of their core beliefs. As with Manichaeism, despite certain ties with Christianity, Mandaeans do not believe in Moses, Jesus, or Mohammed. Their beliefs and practices likewise have little overlap with the religions that manifested from those religious figures and the two should not be confused. Significant amounts of original <b>Mandaean</b> Scripture, written in <b>Mandaean</b> Aramaic, survive in the modern era. The primary source text is known as the Genzā Rabbā and has portions identified by some scholars as being copied as early as the 3rd Century AD. There is also the Qolastā, or Canonical Book of Prayer and The Book of John the Baptist (sidra ḏ-iahia).|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of reports of {{attempts}} to forcibly convert religious minorities in Iraq. [...] The Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who follow an ethnoreligious syncretic faith, have been threatened with forced conversion by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, who consider their practices to be Satanism. UN investigators have reported mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam. In Baghdad, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled their homes in 2007 when a local extremist group announced that they had to convert to Islam, pay the jizya or die. In March 2007 the BBC reported that people in the <b>Mandaean</b> ethnic and religious minority in Iraq alleged that they were being targeted by Islamist insurgents, who offered them the choice of conversion or death.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{contact with}} Europeans came {{about in the}} mid-16th century, when Portuguese missionaries {{encountered}} <b>Mandaeans</b> in Southern Iraq and controversially designated them [...] "Christians of St. John". In the next centuries Europeans became more acquainted with the <b>Mandaeans</b> and their religion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mandaeans</b> {{believe in}} {{marriage}} and procreation, {{and in the}} importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They also place a high priority upon family life. Consequently, <b>Mandaeans</b> do not practice celibacy or asceticism. <b>Mandaeans</b> will, however, abstain from strong drink and red meat. While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons, they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.|$|R
50|$|Another Western Aramaic language, Neo-Mandaean, {{is spoken}} by the <b>Mandaeans</b> of Iraq and Iran. They number some 50,000-75,000 people, {{but it is}} {{believed}} the Mandaic language may now be spoken fluently by as few as 6000 people, with other <b>Mandaeans</b> having varying degrees of knowledge.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a small}} <b>Mandaean</b> {{community}} in Sweden, only numbering around 5,000 people. This makes the Swedish <b>Mandaean</b> community {{about the size of}} the <b>Mandaean</b> {{community in}} Iraq, the homeland of the <b>Mandaean</b> people. Several thousand of the Swedish Mandaeans were granted asylum status as refugees from persecution in Iraq and Syria.|$|E
5000|$|Krun (...) or Akrun (...) is the <b>Mandaean</b> {{lord of the}} underworld. According to <b>Mandaean</b> legend, he dwells in {{the lowest}} depths of creation, {{supporting}} {{the entirety of the}} physical world.|$|E
50|$|Mandaeism, as the {{religion}} of the <b>Mandaean</b> people, is based more on a common heritage than on any set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to <b>Mandaean</b> theology does not exist. The corpus of <b>Mandaean</b> literature, though quite large, covers topics such as eschatology, the knowledge of God and the afterlife—in an unsystematic manner. Moreover, it is known only to the priesthood and a few laypeople.|$|E
50|$|According to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees Background Paper on Iran, the <b>Mandaeans</b> are {{regarded}} as Christians, and are included among the country’s three recognized religious minorities. However, <b>Mandaeans</b> regard themselves not as Christians, but as adherents of a religion that predates Christianity in both belief and practice. <b>Mandaeans</b> enjoyed official support as a distinct religion prior to the revolution, but their legal status as a religion since then {{has been the subject}} of debate in the Majles and never has been clarified.|$|R
50|$|There {{are between}} 60,000 and 70,000 <b>Mandaeans</b> {{worldwide}} {{and in the}} Middle East they are found in Iraq and Iran. They reject Jesus and Muhammad and view Christianity and Islam negatively, but revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh and Noah. <b>Mandaeans</b> are an ethnoreligious community, which doesn't allow conversion.|$|R
5000|$|Within the Middle East, {{but outside}} of their community, the <b>Mandaeans</b> are more {{commonly}} known as the [...] (singular: [...] ). The term [...] is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is [...] In Islam, the term [...] "Sabians" [...] (الصابئون [...] ) is used as a blanket term for adherents of a number of religions, including that of the <b>Mandaeans,</b> in reference to the Sabians of the Qur'an. Occasionally, <b>Mandaeans</b> are called [...] "Christians of Saint John", based upon preliminary reports made by members of the Discalced Carmelite mission in Basra during the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{language}} in which the <b>Mandaean</b> religious literature was originally composed is known as Mandaic, {{and is a member}} of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. Many <b>Mandaean</b> lay people do not speak this language, though some members of the <b>Mandaean</b> community resident in Iran and Iraq continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Mandaean</b> Book of John (Mandaic {{language}} Hebrew script-Aramaic דרשא דיחיא) is a <b>Mandaean</b> holy book in Mandaic Aramaic {{which is}} believed by Mandeans {{to have been}} written by their chief prophet John the Baptist.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mandaean</b> {{faith has}} existed in Iraq since {{the reign of}} Artabanus V of Parthia, {{according}} to the Haran Gawaitha, a text that tells {{the history of the}} <b>Mandaean</b> people. This would make the Iraqi presence of Mandaeans at least 1,800 years old, making it the third oldest continually-practiced faith in Iraqi society after Zoroastrianism and Judaism. There are about 60,000 estimated Mandaeians living in Iraq. The oldest independent confirmation of <b>Mandaean</b> existence in the region is the Kartir inscription. The <b>Mandaean</b> faith is commonly known as the last surviving Gnostic faith and its adherents believe it to be the oldest faith on Earth. John the Baptist, known as Yahia Yuhanna, is considered to have been the final <b>Mandaean</b> prophet and first true Ris'Amma, or Ethnarch, of the <b>Mandaean</b> people. Most Iraqi Mandaeans live near waterways because of the practice of total immersion (or baptism) in flowing water every Sunday. The highest concentrations are in the Mesene province with headquarters in Amarah, Qalat Saleh and Basra. Besides these southern regions bordering Khuzestan in Iran, large numbers of Mandaeans can be found in Baghdad in the Dweller's Quarters, giving them easy access to the Tigris River.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mandaeans</b> {{recognize}} several prophets. Yahya ibn Zakariyya, {{known by}} Christians as John the Baptist, is accorded a special status, higher than {{his role in}} Christianity and Islam. <b>Mandaeans</b> do not consider John to be the founder of their religion but revere {{him as one of}} their greatest teachers, tracing their beliefs back to Adam.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} modern-day people based in Iraq call {{themselves}} Sabians {{and follow the}} teachings of John the Baptist. They are <b>Mandaeans</b> (or Sabian <b>Mandaeans).</b> They are more urban than other <b>Mandaeans</b> living in southern Iraq, which perhaps explains why they prefer to be called Sabians. Due to their faith, pacifism and lack of tribal ties, they have been vulnerable to violence since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and numbered fewer than 5000 in 2007. They primarily live around Baghdad, where the last sheik resides who conducts services and baptisms. Many from the sect have moved from Baghdad to Kurdistan where it is safer.|$|R
25|$|Outside of Christianity, proxy baptisms were {{practiced by}} the <b>Mandaeans</b> of Iraq and Iran.|$|R

50|$|The {{evidence}} about <b>Mandaean</b> {{history has been}} almost entirely confined {{to some of the}} <b>Mandaean</b> religious literature.

5000|$|Early in the 9th century, a {{group of}} [...] Hermeticists in the {{northern}} Mesopotamian city of Harran declared themselves Sabians when facing persecution; an Assyrian Christian writer said that the true 'Sabians' or Sabba lived in the marshes of lower Iraq. The earliest account we have about the <b>Mandaeans</b> {{is that of the}} Assyrian writer Theodore Bar Konai (in the Scholion, 792). In the Fihrist ("Book of Nations") of Arabic scholar Al-Nadim (c. 987), the Mogtasilah (Mughtasila..., [...] "self-ablutionists") are counted among the followers of El-Hasaih. Called a [...] "sect" [...] of [...] "Sabians," [...] they are located in southern Mesopotamia. No verbatim reference to <b>Mandaeans,</b> which were a distinct group by then, seems to have been made by Al-Nadim; Mogtasilah was not that group's endonym, and the few details on rituals and habit are similar to <b>Mandaeans</b> ones. Mogtasilah may thus have been Al-Nadim's term for the <b>Mandaeans,</b> but they may just as well have been a related group which does not exist anymore today.|$|R

It was during the Portuguese occupation of the island that the <b>Mandaeans</b> first came to western attention. The <b>Mandaeans</b> were fleeing persecution in the vilayet of Baghdad (which, at the time, included Basra) and Khuzestan in Iran. When the Portuguese first encountered them, they mistakenly identified them as [...] "St. John Christians," [...] analogous to the St. Thomas Christians of India. The <b>Mandaeans,</b> for their part, were all too willing {{to take advantage of}} the confusion, offering to accept papal authority and Portuguese suzerainty if the Portuguese would invade the Ottoman Empire and liberate their coreligionists. The Portuguese were attracted by the prospect of what appeared to be a large Christian community under Muslim rule. It was not until after the Portuguese had committed themselves to the conquest of Basra that they came to realize that the <b>Mandaeans</b> were not what they claimed to be.|$|R
