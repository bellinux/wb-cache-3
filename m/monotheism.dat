5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies {{have moved from}} magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, <b>monotheism</b> and finally, ethical <b>monotheism.</b> According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution of}} ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.|$|E

5|$|Seal {{impressions}} {{found in}} Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's {{time on the}} throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting <b>monotheism.</b> The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during their lifetimes. Most of the found clay seal impressions were still undeciphered and untranslated at their time.|$|E
5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of <b>monotheism</b> (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E

5|$|The debate {{continues}} over why Peribsen {{chose this}} name. Earlier theories have favoured {{the idea that}} Egypt was split in two realms during Peribsen's time or {{that he was a}} heretic, who sought to start a new monotheistic religion with Seth as the only worshipped god. However, newer evidence and evaluations tend to show that the Egyptian kingdom was unified, but witnessed a vast and profound reform during the second dynasty. Seal impressions from tombs of this era reveal great changes in the titles held by high officials, pointing to a reduction of their power. Further seal impressions show that several deities were worshipped under Peribsen, refuting the <b>monotheism</b> theory, with other contemporary inscriptions indicating that the Egyptian grammar was perfected during his reign: In particular, the earliest seal impressions with complete sentences date back to Peribsen's reign. Thus, Peribsen's reign was in fact a time of cultural and religious advancement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full <b>monotheism,</b> which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Ethical <b>monotheism</b> {{is central}} in all sacred or {{normative}} texts of Judaism. However, <b>monotheism</b> {{has not always}} been followed in practice.

In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of <b>monotheism</b> existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.|$|E

50|$|A {{primary concern}} of Hermetic Qabalah {{is the nature}} of divinity, its {{conception}} of which is quite markedly different from that presented in monotheistic religions; in particular there is not the strict separation between divinity and humankind which is seen in <b>monotheisms.</b> Hermetic Qabalah holds to the neoplatonic conception that the manifest universe, of which material creation is a part, arose as a series of emanations from the godhead.|$|R

40|$|This {{critical}} {{inquiry into}} the social constructions of 2 ̆ 2 black 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 identities analyzes {{the roles of the}} three 2 ̆ 2 western 2 ̆ 2 <b>monotheisms</b> (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) in the cognitive and sociohistorical developments of racial slavery and antiblack racism. Specifically, it investigates the sociohistorical consequences of the inherent dualisms of the 2 ̆ 2 western 2 ̆ 2 <b>monotheisms</b> and how those dualisms are expressed in the production of social theories and systems that rely on believer/non-believer oppositions and binaries defined by a Manichaean view of the universe and a teleological conception of history that fosters and sustains an eternal holy war against infidels. What emerges from this analysis in the end is a reconnection of Islam with Judeo-Christianity, resulting in the (re) formulation of a Judeo-Christian-Islamic complex as a specific instrumentality in the formation of 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 black 2 ̆ 2 identities and the creation and preservation of white supremacy...|$|R
