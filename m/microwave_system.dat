A modest Gigawatt-range <b>microwave</b> <b>system,</b> comparable to a large commercial power plant, would require launching some 80,000 tons of material to orbit, making the cost of energy from such a system vastly more expensive than even present day nuclear plants. Some technologists speculate that this may change in the distant future if an off-world industrial base were to be developed that could manufacture solar power satellites out of asteroids or lunar material, or if radical new space launch technologies other than rocketry should become available in the future.|$|E
500|$|The Wilkinson {{power divider}} {{consists}} of two parallel uncoupled λ/4 transmission lines. [...] The input is fed to both lines in parallel and the outputs are terminated with twice the system impedance bridged between them.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Microwave</b> <b>systems</b> {{continue}} {{to benefit from}} technological and system advances that provide for new levels of performance, form factor and lowered cost. In the past, these advances were primarily associated with new materials systems or device types (e. q. GaAs, GaN, InP, MEMS, HBTs, PHEMTs, etc.). Although improvements continue in these and other new areas, system designers are increasingly looking for areas where advances in CMOS digital IC technology can improve the performance of <b>microwave</b> <b>systems.</b> The ability to realize millions of logic gates in {{an area the size}} of a bond pad provides the signal processing capability required for highly adaptive <b>microwave</b> <b>systems,</b> which monitor their environment and adapt their matching, tuning, bias, or configuration, to realize the best possible performance. These adaptive <b>microwave</b> <b>systems</b> will find wide application in areas as diverse as active phasedarray radars, wireless local area networks and even the ubiquitous cellular telephone. This paper will summarize the device and signal processing requirements of these new adaptive systems of the future, and highlight some of the research areas required for further development of the field.
