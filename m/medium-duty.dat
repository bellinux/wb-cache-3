25|$|<b>Medium-duty</b> {{trucks and}} Heavy-duty trucks have {{recently}} adopted 4×4 drive-trains. 4×4 <b>medium-duty</b> trucks became common after Ford Motor Company began selling Ford Super Duty trucks. The Super Duty trucks shared many parts between the light duty and medium duty, reducing production costs. The Dana 60 front axle {{is used on}} both medium- and light-duty Super Duty trucks. Furthermore, the Big Three share/shared parts between the companies reducing costs. The Dana S 110 is currently being used for the rear drive, under Ford and Ram's <b>medium-duty</b> trucks. The Dana 110 was also used on the General Motors 4×4s as well. Ram Trucks began selling <b>medium-duty</b> trucks, 4×4 and 4×2, in 2008. General Motors sold a 4×4 for model years 2005-2009.|$|E

25|$|The Fort Lee Volunteer Ambulance Corps, {{founded in}} 1971, {{provides}} {{emergency medical services}} to the Borough of Fort Lee, the George Washington Bridge, and the Palisades Interstate Parkway. One of the largest EMS agencies in the surrounding area, the Fort Lee Volunteer Ambulance Corps operates a fleet of four <b>medium-duty</b> ambulances, one first responder vehicle, and two command vehicles from its headquarters {{on the corner of}} Main Street and Anderson Avenue. In 2011, the agency purchased a new state-of-the-art ambulance, designated FLA-1, in order to begin retiring some of its aging ambulances. The agency plans to purchase a second ambulance sometime in 2013. With approximately 50 active members, the corps operates 24 hours a day on weekends and from 7 PM to 6 AM on weekdays, with paid borough employees staffing the ambulances during the day on weekdays.

In North America, the E-Series is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the F-650 is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the <b>medium-duty</b> B700 was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including Thomas Built, Ward, and Blue Bird, but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers.

50|$|For {{most of its}} production, the F-Series {{was sold}} in a <b>medium-duty</b> {{conventional}} truck configuration alongside the traditional pickup trucks. Beginning in 1948 with the 1½ ton F-5 (later F-500), the <b>medium-duty</b> trucks ranged up to the F-8 (F-800). Prior to the 1957 introduction of the Ford C-Series tilt-cab, the <b>medium-duty</b> range was offered as both a conventional and in a COE (cabover) configuration.|$|E
50|$|Sharing {{exterior}} styling {{derived from}} the larger L-Series trucks, the <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series saw few changes through the 1980s. As a running change during 1983, the truck adapted the Ford Blue Oval for the 1984 model year, becoming the last Ford vehicle to do so. After that change, the <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series would not see any exterior change (aside from engine badging) until its 1995 facelift (consisting of a new hood, fenders, and headlights). Although the cab itself was shared with F-Series pickup trucks produced afterward, the MY 1980-1986 interior of the <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series was carried over entirely and used until the <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series was discontinued in 1998.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, GMC transitioned its <b>medium-duty</b> {{trucks to}} the Chevrolet-based C/K <b>medium-duty</b> chassis {{introduced}} in 1967. The heavy-duty GMC school bus chassis remained in {{use by the}} division for 1970, before both divisions consolidated designs for 1971.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the fifth-generation F-Series in 1967, the <b>medium-duty</b> trucks were designed separately from the pickup truck range. Although remaining part of the F-Series range, the <b>medium-duty</b> trucks shared only the cab and interior with the F-Series pickup trucks. Since 1967, the cab design has changed only in 1980 and in 2000. Redesigned on an all-new chassis, the 2017 F-Series <b>medium-duty</b> trucks retain an updated version of the 2000-2016 F-650/F750 cab.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{after years}} of poor sales, parent company Daimler ended its sales of Mercedes-Benz <b>medium-duty</b> trucks in North America. In their place, Freightliner entered the <b>medium-duty</b> truck segment with the Business Class FL-Series. A {{downsized}} version of the FLC conventional, it used many cab components with the Mercedes-Benz LKN cabover adapted into a conventional. The first all-new entry in the <b>medium-duty</b> market in over a decade, the FL-Series met with success.|$|E
50|$|The 4R01 was a 4-speed {{automatic}} transmission from Nissan's Jatco subsidiary. It was available {{as either a}} light-duty ("RL4R01A") or <b>medium-duty</b> ("RE4R01A") unit for rear wheel drive vehicles with longitudinal engines. Mazda called the <b>medium-duty</b> version their R4A-EL.|$|E
50|$|In November 2007, the {{shuttered}} {{school bus}} manufacturer U.S. Bus Corporation was reorganized and re-located to Warwick, New York. Renamed Trans Tech Bus, {{the new company}} introduced three different models of school buses. Single and Dual Rear Wheel models were based on Ford and GM van chassis, while the <b>Medium-Duty</b> model was built on a GM <b>medium-duty</b> truck chassis. The <b>Medium-Duty</b> bus was discontinued after 2009 {{following the end of}} General Motors production of the C4500/5500 chassis.|$|E

50|$|While still {{available}} with a 7.0L gasoline V8, many <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series were diesel-powered. Instead of the Navistar T444E V8 engine {{seen in the}} F-250/F-350, the <b>medium-duty</b> models offered two inline-6 engines (the Caterpillar 3126 and the Cummins 6BT/ISB). In 1999, these trucks were discontinued, along with the B-Series bus chassis; while the bus chassis was not replaced, Ford re-entered the <b>medium-duty</b> truck market with the Ford F-650/750. Built in {{a joint venture with}} Navistar, they were integrated into the Super Duty lineup.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the first}} time since 1967, the <b>medium-duty</b> version of the F-Series (F-600 and above) were {{completely}} redesigned. Again sharing a common cab and interior with the pickup trucks, the <b>medium-duty</b> trucks were distinguished by separate bodywork ahead of the firewall. For {{the first time}} since the 1957 [...] "Big Job" [...] trucks, the fenders were separate from the hood; although a traditional rear-hinged hood was standard, the optional forward-tilting hood (in the style of the larger L-Series trucks) quickly overtook it in popularity.

5000|$|For {{its entire}} 50-year {{production}} run, the B-Series paralleled the <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series in its development. Before 1967, the body design of <b>medium-duty</b> F-Series was largely {{shared with the}} F-Series pickup trucks, after which Ford gave its larger trucks wider front axles and bodywork. Following this, the B-Series was redesigned in 1980, with a minor update in 1995.|$|E
