5|$|Across England, <b>many</b> <b>public</b> {{houses and}} inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, {{particularly}} in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, {{near the entrance}} to St Paul's Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert had been wearing when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. <b>Many</b> <b>public</b> parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E

5|$|Cheadle Hulme is {{also home}} to <b>many</b> <b>public</b> houses and {{restaurants}} that serve a variety of cuisine, including Indian, Chinese, and Italian. The John Millington, a Grade II listed building, was formerly Millington Hall, built for Stockport alderman John Millington. A row of cottages near to the hall served as a meeting place for local Methodists from 1814, before a purpose-built chapel was established. A Sunday school was also established in the same place. The King's Hall was built in 1937, and was originally a dance hall before its conversion into a restaurant and public house.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting <b>many</b> <b>public</b> causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E

Its revenues were 50, 20, and 30 percent from strategy, operations, and technology consulting, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Rodin willed to the French state {{his studio}} {{and the right}} to make casts from his plasters. Because he {{encouraged}} the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in <b>many</b> <b>public</b> and private collections. The Musée Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the Hôtel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order Légion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} however, {{in the early}} 7th century, {{as a result of}} extreme {{military}} and political pressure on the Byzantine Empire, public bathing changed from being a common luxury to a rare and infrequent one, and <b>many</b> <b>public</b> facilities and venues began to be used for the austere purposes of the military. They are last attested as being used as baths in 713, before being converted to other uses: part of the building became the prison known as Noumera, while another part appears to have been used as a silk workshop.|$|E

5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of <b>many</b> <b>public</b> schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the minority group.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{influence}} of the Church during the Middle Ages gradually turned Aarhus, with its bishopric, into a prosperous religious centre. <b>Many</b> <b>public</b> and religious buildings were built {{in and around the}} city; notably Aarhus Cathedral was initiated in the late 12thcentury by the influential bishop Peder Vognsen. In 1441, Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed {{as far back as the}} 12thcentury. The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus' birth certificate.|$|E

5|$|Albert {{promoted}} <b>many</b> <b>public</b> educational institutions. Chiefly {{at meetings}} {{in connection with}} these {{he spoke of the}} need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Jackson quickly built a {{track record}} of never missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer was able to slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness that makes it difficult to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal track record, Jackson received <b>many</b> <b>public</b> speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. <b>Many</b> <b>public</b> and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Outside of Toamasina, Honorinina damaged {{roads and}} rail lines {{connecting}} {{the city with}} the capital, Antananarivo. Several other roads were damaged by landslides or washouts, and many bridges were damaged. The high winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes along the storm's path, leaving 83,885people homeless. Many of the damaged homes lost their roofs, which resulted in additional damage when the heavy rainfall affected their interiors. The high winds also damaged <b>many</b> <b>public</b> buildings and factories along its path. The cyclone left widespread areas without water or power; the storm damaged electrical transmission and generation facilities. The high rainfall damaged dykes in Andromba and along the Ikopa and Sisaony rivers. Across the country, Honorinina killed 99people, and caused 424injuries. Damage totaled about $150million (1986USD).|$|E
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and <b>many</b> <b>public</b> health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
5|$|Ruth's legendary {{power and}} charismatic {{personality}} {{made him a}} larger-than-life figure during the Roaring Twenties. During his career, he {{was the target of}} intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a managerial job in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made <b>many</b> <b>public</b> appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with cancer, which claimed his life two years later.|$|E
