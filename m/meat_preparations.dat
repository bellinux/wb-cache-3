40|$|Campylobacter spp. {{are still}} the major {{bacterial}} cause of infectious diarrheal illness in Belgium and in many other countries. In 2003, the Superior Health Council of the Belgian Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment initiated a risk assessment of Campylobacter spp. contamination in poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> The limitation in data for the local situation in Belgium in consumer behaviour and also the semi-quantitative nature of concentration of Campylobacter spp. due to presence/absence testing was identified as an important information gap. The {{aim of this study}} is to refine and update with recently collected data the previous retail to fork quantitative risk assessment model for poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> to estimate the risk for campylobacteriosis for the Belgian consumer. In the proposed risk assessment model, data were included from a 2007 national baseline study providing quantitative Campylobacter data in Belgian poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> Survival data describing effects of undercooking, cooling and freezing on Campylobacter spp. in poultry meat preparation are also introduced in the model. Detailed data on poultry consumption and food handling and preparation practices by Belgian consumers are included in the model. A probabilistic model was developed in Excel and @Risk. The risk estimate of the model relates to the incidence of illness (campylobacteriosis) in the Belgian population due to consumption of poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> The model predicts a yearly incidence of 0. 09 % due to the consumption of poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> and current retail to fork practices. By scenario and sensitivity analysis, possible risk mitigation strategies were evaluated. Setting an action limit and rejecting highly contaminated (> 100 CFU/g) poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> before distribution to the market would lead to a fifty-percent reduction of incidence of illness. Recommendation to consumers to freeze poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> could result in a fourfold reduction, indicating the importance of home freezing. The results also indicate that good kitchen hygiene could reduce the risk of illness with major impact of prevention of cross-contamination (91 % reduction of illness). Only a minor contribution of undercooking (~ 0. 01 %) was estimated out of the scenario analysis...|$|E
40|$|Ascorbic acid is a commonly-used food {{additive}} {{permitted in}} prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> Consequently, {{the addition of}} this antioxidant is subject to a specific packaging authorization. In this survey 180 samples of not prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> have been analyzed in order to evaluate the diffusion of not authorized ascorbic acid additions. The ascorbic acid has been determined by a high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection method, validated according to the European Legislation. Quantifiable concentrations of ascorbic acid (> LOQ = 20. 1 mg · kg- 1) were registered in 33 samples confirming a wide diffusion of not authorized additions. Moreover, low concentrations not attributable to a additives additions were detected in 14 samples. Ascorbic acid sources (tomato) were declared on the label of these samples. Considering that the addition of this food additive is generally considered safe, these low concentrations registered may be useful for the determination of an allowable limit for the ascorbic acid in not prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Meat {{consumption}} and <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> methods {{are thought to}} be associated with the risk of sporadic colorectal cancer, and possibly adenomas. As the same somatic mutations occur in sporadic adenomas and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) -related adenomas, similar exogenous factors may play a role in the development of both types of adenoma. In a case control study among 57 sporadic colorectal adenoma cases and 62 adenoma cases from HNPCC families (and 148 adenoma-free controls) from the Netherlands, we examined whether <b>meat</b> {{consumption and}} <b>preparation</b> are similarly associated with sporadic and suspected HNPCC colorectal adenomas. Frequency of meat consumption was not significantly associated with adenoma risk in our population of sporadic and HNPCC family cases and controls (Odds Ratios (OR) for high versus low consumption were 1. 0 and 0. 6, respectively). Interestingly, consumption of red <b>meat</b> and specific <b>preparation</b> methods (i. e., “not adding any water” and “ closed lid with most meat types”) slightly, but non-significantly, increased the risk of adenomas in the sporadic group only (OR, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 4. 1, 0. 7 – 23. 0, 2. 0, 0. 6 – 6. 5 and 2. 6, 0. 9 – 7. 2, respectively). This is the first study to examine possible differences or similarities in risk factors for sporadic and HNPCC colorectal carcinogenesis. Our results do not provide support for meat consumption as a risk factor for adenoma formation in HNPCC family members.

Methods: We studied HCA concentration in relation to preparation habits among 63 volunteers. Associations of <b>meat</b> consumption, <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> habits, and genetic susceptibility with colorectal adenoma risk were investigated among 431 adenoma cases and 433 polyp-free controls recruited at endoscopy.

Polymorphisms of N-acetyltransferases (NAT) 1 and 2, sulfotransferase (SULT) 1 A 1, and glutathione-S-transferases (GST) M 1 and T 1 were determined. Results: HCAs were present in habitually prepared meat, although meat consumption (7 versus 5 x/week) slightly increased adenoma risk (OR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 3). Conclusions: In this Dutch population, unfavorable <b>meat</b> consumption and <b>preparation</b> habits did not increase colorectal adenoma risk, and these associations were not influenced by relevant genetic polymorphisms...|$|R
