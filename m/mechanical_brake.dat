5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{her film}} career Lawrence is also {{credited}} with designing the first “auto signaling arm”; a predecessor {{to the modern}} turn signal, along with the first <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> signal. She did not patent these inventions, however, {{and as a result}} she received no credit for–or profit from–either one.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydraulic}} brake is {{an arrangement of}} braking mechanism which uses brake fluid, typically containing ethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling unit, which is usually near the operator of the vehicle, to the actual brake mechanism, which is usually {{at or near the}} wheel of the vehicle. In 1918, the {{hydraulic brake}} was invented by Malcolm Loughead, which replaced the <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> which was used previously on automobiles.|$|E

25|$|The first {{motorcycles}} to use {{disc brakes}} were racing vehicles. MV Agusta {{was the first}} to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their relatively expensive 600 touring motorcycle, using a <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> linkage. In 1969 Honda introduced the more affordable CB750, which had a single hydraulically-actuated front disc brake (and a rear drum brake), and which sold in huge numbers. Disc brakes are now common on motorcycles, mopeds and even mountain bikes.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1945, the now-Major Verdeja {{was ordered}} to begin {{designing}} an artillery piece using a rapid-firing 75millimeter L/40 howitzer designed by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval, based on the Verdeja1 chassis. [...] The chassis' roof and rear wall were eliminated, and instead a gun shield placed over the front. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> was installed next to the idler wheel, stopping rearwards movement of the artillery piece during the firing process. [...] The availability of the required parts {{and the lack of}} complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively. The fate of the self-propelled piece was much {{the same as that of}} the Verdeja2, and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973, when it was moved to the Spanish base Alfonso XIII, housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment Wad Rassnº55. It was soon moved to another base, and finally delivered to the base of El Goloso, outside of Madrid, as a part of an armored vehicles museum.|$|E
2500|$|Silent {{film star}} Florence Lawrence is often {{credited}} with designing the first “auto signaling arm”; a predecessor {{to the modern}} turn signal, along with the first <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> signal. She did not patent these inventions, however, {{and as a result}} she received no credit for–or profit from–either one. Tail lamps and brake lamps were introduced around 1915, and by 1919 [...] "dip" [...] headlamps were available. The sealed beam headlamp was introduced in 1936 and standardised as the only acceptable type in the USA in 1940. Self-cancelling turn signals were developed in 1940. By 1945 headlamps and signal lamps were integrated into the body styling. Halogen headlamp light sources were developed in Europe in 1960. HID headlamps were produced starting in 1991. In 1993, the first LED tail lamps were installed on mass-production automobiles. LED headlamps were introduced {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>mechanical</b> drum <b>brake</b> or {{disk brake}} {{is used to}} stop turbine in {{emergency}} situation such as extreme gust events or over speed. This brake is a secondary means to hold the turbine at rest for maintenance, with a rotor lock system as primary means. Such brakes are usually applied only after blade furling and electromagnetic braking have reduced the turbine speed generally 1 or 2 rotor RPM, as the <b>mechanical</b> <b>brakes</b> can create a fire inside the nacelle if used to stop the turbine from full speed. The load on the turbine increases if the brake is applied at rated RPM. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>brakes</b> are driven by hydraulic systems and are connected to main control box.|$|R

50|$|The {{main part}} of the set up is the winding motor which is driven by the dc motor. Two double deck cages are {{attached}} to the two ends of the winding rope. At the start of the winding cycle, power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake</b> released. The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of 6 m/s until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{topic to}} reduce the energy consumption in railways {{is the use of}} energy-efficient train control (EETC). Modern trains allow regen-erative braking where the released kinetic energy can be reused. This regener-ative braking has an effect on the optimal driving regimes compared to trains which can only use <b>mechanical</b> <b>braking.</b> This paper compares the impact of regenerative braking on the optimal train control strategy on level track. The energy-efficient train control problem is modelled as an optimal control problem over distance and solved using a Pseudospectral Method. Three different braking strategies are compared: <b>mechanical</b> <b>braking</b> only, a combination of <b>mechanical</b> and regenerative <b>braking,</b> and regenerative braking only.
