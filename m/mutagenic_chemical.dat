40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the analysis of structure of carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemical</b> substances and dusts occurring in Polish enterprises, 2011 – 2012, including the number of exposed employees reported to the “Central register of data on exposure to carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemical</b> substances, mixtures, agents or technological processes”, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź. In the paper the aims, range and methodology of data collecting by the Central Register are presented. Material and Methods: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the data on occupational exposure to carcinogenic substances and technological processes reported by employers were carried out. Results: In 2011 – 2012 approximately 2600 plants reported more than 300 carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemical</b> substances annually. The most common occupational chemical carcinogens/mutagens were: benzene, one of the unspecified gasoline, chromium(VI) compounds, asbestos, chromium(VI) trioxide, ethylene oxide and benzo[a]pyrene. The highest number of employees was exposed to particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Hardwood dust was the major occupational carcinogen listed in the technological processes inventory with approximately 11 000 employees exposed in about 650 enterprises annually. Conclusions: The amended legislation concerning occupational exposure to carcinogens has not significantly influenced the exposure structure in Poland.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a concise but {{comprehensive}} information on the occurrence of carcinogenic or mutagenic agents in Polish enterprises and the number of workers exposed to those agents reported to the central register by employers. Objectives and responsibilities of the register, as well as the range and methods of data gathering are discussed. Material and Methods: Data concerning carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemical</b> substances and technological processes reported to central register in 2008 - 2010 were analyzed. Results: In 2008 - 2010 more than 300 carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemical</b> substances were reported to the register. Approximately 2500 plants reported above 150 000 per-person-exposures annually. Among all technological processes regarded as occupational carcinogens, hardwood dusts exposure (about 660 companies; 11 000 - 13 000 exposed workers each year) and exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in coal products (117 - 125 plantsl 3000 exposed per year) were reported. Conclusions: The most widespread carcinogenic/mutagenic substances were: benzene, chromium(VI) compounds: potassium dichromate and chromate, chromium(VI) trioxide and other chromium compounds, ethylene oxide, asbestos, benzo[a]pyrene and gasoline. The highest number of men was exposed to particular PAHs and benzene, and the majority of women was exposed to benzene, potassium dichromate and chromate, acrylamide, ethylene oxide and gasoline.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the activities of}} 168 chemicals tested in a standard transformation assay using A- 31 - 1 - 13 BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells. The data set includes 84 carcinogens, 77 noncarcinogens, and 7 research chemicals. Carcinogens included 49 mutagens and 35 nonmutagens; noncarcinogens included 24 mutagens and 53 nonmutagens. The transformation assay did not use an exogenous activation system, thus, all chemical responses depended on the inherent target cell metabolic capacity where metabolic activation was required. The upper dose limit was 100 milli-osmolar because the assay could not discriminate active and inactive chemicals tested above this concentration. Certain physicochemical properties resulted in technical problems that affected chemical biological activity. For example, chemicals that reacted with plastic were usually nonmutagenic carcinogens. Similarly, chemicals that were insoluble in medium, or bound metals, were usually nonmutagenic and nontransforming. Multifactorial data analyses revealed that the transformation assay discriminated between nonmutagenic carcinogens and noncarcinogens; it detected 64 % of the carcinogens and only 26 % of the noncarcinogens. In contrast, the transformation assay detected most <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> including 94 % of the mutagenic carcinogens and 70 % of the mutagenic noncarcinogens. Thus, transformation or Salmonella typuimurium mutagenicity assays could not discriminate mutagenic carcinogens from mutagenic noncarcinogens. Data analyses also revealed that <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemicals</b> were more cytotoxic than nonmutagenic chemicals; 88 % of the mutagens had an LD 50 5 mM. Binary data analyses of the same data set revealed that the transformation assay and rodent bioassay had a concordance of 71 %, a sensitivity for carcinogens of 80. 0 %, and a specificity for detecting noncarcinogens of 60 %. In contrast, Salmonella mutagenicity assays and rodent bioassays had a concordance of 63 %, a sensitivity of 58 %, and a specificity of 69 %. The transformation assay complemented the Salmonella mutagenesis assay {{in the identification of}} nonmutagenic carcinogens; thus, the two assays had a combined 83 % sensitivity for all carcinogens and a 75 % specificity for nonmutagenic noncarcinogens...|$|R

40|$|The {{carcinogenic}} {{effects of}} 1, 3 -butadiene (BD), a <b>mutagenic</b> <b>chemical</b> {{widely used in}} the manufacture of synthetic rubber, are likely initiated through its epoxide metabolites. In humans, these epoxides are detoxified predominantly by hydrolysis, a reaction mediated by the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH; EPHX 1) enzyme. It appears reasonable to hypothesize that BD-exposed individuals possessing lower mEH detoxication capacity may have elevated risk of adverse health effects. The interindividual levels of mEH enzymatic activity vary considerably, and polymorphisms in the mEH gene may contribute to this variability. In addition to the well-studied coding region polymorphisms encoding Tyr 113 His and His 139 Arg substitutions, seven other polymorphic sites in the 5 ’-flanking region of the mEH gene have been reported.

With the exception of some values at 1000 ppb of B[cr]P, DNA adduct levels increased significantly with the dose in gills and digestive gland and ranged from 0. 054 to 0. 789 adducts per 10 (8) nucleotides (mean values per dose-point). Conversely, more complex dose-response relationships were found by detecting in parallel the levels of an oxidative DNA lesion (8 -OHdC) and of CYP 1 A-immunopositive proteins (the latter measured in the digestive gland only), Overall, the formation of DNA adducts, the evidence of oxidative DNA damage, and changes in CYP 1 A-immunopositive protein levels support the hypothesis that B[a]P can induce DNA damage in mussels through a number of different molecular mechanisms...|$|E
