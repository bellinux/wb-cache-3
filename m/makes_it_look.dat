5|$|When Ra.One {{undergoes}} final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but {{chooses to}} ignore them. When {{the game is}} officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One murders Akashi and assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like a car accident.|$|E
5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard.

25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... she slides {{in and out of}} her characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> easy.|$|E

25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors.

[...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone."
