25|$|A May 2011 Hamilton College {{analysis}} of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman {{was the most}} accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd.</b>|$|E

500|$|Later in 2008, {{following}} Clinton's {{defeat for}} the Democratic presidential nomination, multiple commentators likened Tracy to the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Actress and comedian Tina Fey credited Witherspoon's performance as Tracy as an influence for Fey's extremely popular Emmy-winning impersonation of Palin on Saturday Night Live. Other political figures compared to Tracy include former U.S. Vice President Al Gore; Seattle City Council member Heidi Wills; Texas senator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz; and New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, whom <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> wrote was nicknamed Tracy Flick by her colleagues for her [...] "opportunistic and sharp-elbowed" [...] manner.|$|E

After Tracy agrees, he comes up with [...] "The Tracy Jordan Meat Machine". Armed with an [...] "endorsement" [...] from Dr. Spaceman (Chris Parnell) and hook-ups from Jack, the product is finally ready for sale. Soon after, a series of product defects prompts Tracy to tell Jack that he no longer wishes to endorse the product. Jack finds a way to make it work: by rebranding it as a Whoopi Goldberg-endorsed product targeted for Ukraine.|$|E
500|$|Going Clear {{made its}} world première on January 25, 2015, at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The Wall Street Journal {{described}} it as [...] "the hottest ticket" [...] at the festival. The première was so popular that even those with tickets were unable to find seats, because so many VIP pass-holders chose to watch the film, displacing ordinary festival-goers. It attracted numerous celebrities and media figures, including actors Alec Baldwin and Tobey Maguire, comedian Jason Sudeikis, and New York Times columnist <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd.</b> The audience gave Going Clear a standing ovation in an unusual occurrence for a Sundance presentation. 'Spanky' Taylor's appearance on stage, along with the daughter from whom the church had forced her to [...] "disconnect", reduced many in the audience to tears.

50|$|Intended {{in part as}} a {{response}} to <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd's</b> 2005 book Are Men Necessary? When Sexes Collide, Whelan presented evidence contrary to the belief that an elite education and high income among women correlate with lower marriage rates. Using Census Bureau statistics, a commissioned poll of 3,700 men and women ages 25 to 40 and personal interviews, Whelan showed that while the stereotype was valid among previous generations, today a higher income and education in fact increases a woman's marriage chances, and that high-achieving women simply marry later in life.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And So Can You). [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd's</b> column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want me to run, and I hear your clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet – even though it's clear that the voters are desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|R

He cut according to the sound of it." [...] Rebecca Dana of The Daily Beast said of Life that it [...] "covers all the bases: sex, drugs, guitar riffs, the size of Mick Jagger’s endowment. It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, no less a critic than <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> has declared the prince of darkness a [...] "consummate gentleman."

500|$|In 2003, Bowers was {{formally}} overruled by Lawrence v. Texas, from which Scalia dissented. According to Mark V. Tushnet in his {{survey of the}} Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened. According to his biographer, Joan Biskupic, Scalia [...] "ridiculed" [...] the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside Bowers when {{many of the same}} justices had refused to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In March 2009, openly gay Congressman Barney Frank described him as a [...] "homophobe". <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> described Scalia in a 2003 column as [...] "Archie Bunker in a high-backed chair". In an op-ed for The New York Times, federal appeals judge Richard Posner and Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall described as radical Scalia's positions on homosexuality, reflecting an apparent belief that the religious stances supposedly held by the majority of US citizens should take precedence over the Constitution and characterizing Scalia's [...] "political ideal as verg on majoritarian theocracy".|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} {{campaign}} stop, Trump traveled to Miami, Florida and spoke before the Cuban American National Foundation.

[...] During the visit, Trump was met with supporters touting [...] "Trump 2000" [...] posters and shouting [...] "Viva Donald Trump!" [...] There, he delivered his first foreign policy speech, capped with the line, [...] "I'd have, personally, two words for : 'Adios, amigo!'" [...] Covering the event, columnist <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> wrote that the fascination with Trump was the [...] "apotheosis of our Gilded Age," [...] where [...] "money, celebrity, polling, and crass behavior" [...] warp politics and the television show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire dominates the culture. [...] Following this theme, Saturday Night Live performed a sketch in which Darrell Hammond reprised his role as Trump, holding a press conference announcing Millionaire winner John Carpenter as his running mate. [...] Soon thereafter, the actual Trump floated possible running mates and members of his presidential cabinet during a November 28 episode of Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer. He identified Senator John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, as a possible Secretary of Defense. [...] Trump said he would consider Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and mentioned retired General Colin Powell as a possible Secretary of State. [...] He praised General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and discussed him as either Secretary of Treasury or running mate. [...] He again mentioned Oprah Winfrey as a possible running mate. [...] During the interview, Trump expressed his willingness to spend $100 million to self-finance a full-scale campaign. [...] The Reform Party scheduled a debate of the candidates seeking the presidential nomination on December 3 in Portland, Oregon. [...] When a reporter asked a Trump aide whether Trump would appear, the aide {{was unaware of the}} debate. [...] Ultimately, Buchanan attended but Trump did not.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} derided Friedman's {{idiosyncratic}} prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies. [...] Walter Russell Mead described his prose as being [...] "an occasionally flat Midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations {{about just how}} doggone irresistible globalization is – lacks the steely elegance of a Lippmann, the unobtrusive serviceability of a Scotty Reston or the restless fireworks of a <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> and is best taken in small doses." [...] Similarly, journalist Matt Taibbi has said of Friedman's writing that, [...] "Friedman came up with lines so hilarious you couldn't make them up {{even if you were}} trying – and when you tried to actually picture the 'illustrative' figures of speech he offered to explain himself, what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the Buster Keaton/Three Stooges school, with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beyond {{the content}} of the speech, some media {{coverage}} focused on {{the manner in which it}} spread through the Internet. Video of the speech [...] "went viral", reaching over 1.3 million views on YouTube within a day of the speech's delivery. By March 27, the speech had been viewed nearly 3.4 million times. In the days after the speech, links to the video and to transcripts of the speech were the most popular items posted on Facebook. The New York Times observed that the transcript of the speech was e-mailed more frequently than their news story on the speech, and suggested that this might be indicative of a new pattern in how young people receive news, avoiding conventional media filters. <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> further referenced the phenomenon on March 30, writing in her column that Obama [...] "can [...] when he has to, and he has viral appeal. Who else could alchemize a nuanced 40-minute speech on race into must-see YouTube viewing for 20-year-olds?" [...] By May 30, the speech had been viewed on YouTube over 4.5 million times. The Los Angeles Times cited the prominence of the speech and the music video [...] "Yes We Can" [...] as examples of the Obama campaign's success in spreading its message online, in contrast with the campaign of Republican (then) presumptive nominee John McCain.|$|E
2500|$|During the election, the Bush {{campaign}} {{sought to}} portray Governor Dukakis as a [...] "Massachusetts liberal" [...] who was unreasonably left wing. Dukakis was attacked for such positions as opposing mandatory recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools, {{and being a}} [...] "card-carrying member of the ACLU" [...] (a statement Dukakis made himself early in the primary campaign). Dukakis responded by {{saying that he was}} a [...] "proud liberal" [...] and that the phrase should not be a bad word in America. Bush, a graduate of Yale University, derided Dukakis for having [...] "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique." [...] New York Times columnist <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd</b> asked [...] "Wasn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle elite?" [...] Bush said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was [...] "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism," [...] and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent [...] "a philosophical enclave" [...] and not a statement about class. Columnist Russell Baker opined that [...] "Voters inclined to loathe and fear elite Ivy League schools rarely make fine distinctions between Yale and Harvard. All they know is that both are full of rich, fancy, stuck-up and possibly dangerous intellectuals who never sit down to supper in their undershirt no matter how hot the weather gets." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2006, US Vice President Dick Cheney {{referred}} {{to himself as}} the Darth Vader of the Bush administration. Discussing the administration's philosophy on gathering intelligence, he said to CNN's John King, [...] "It means {{we need to be}} able to go after and capture or kill those people who are trying to kill Americans. That's not a pleasant business. It's a very serious business. And I suppose, sometimes, people look at my demeanor and say, 'Well, he's the Darth Vader of the administration.'" [...] Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to address Dick Cheney as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] on The Daily Show on January 25, 2007. Cheney's wife, Lynne, presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10, 2007. Both Stewart and Stephen Colbert have occasionally {{referred to}} Cheney as [...] "Darth Cheney". In the satirical cartoon show Lil' Bush, Dick Cheney's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader. At her presidential campaign event on September 19, 2007, Hillary Clinton also referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. At the 2008 Washington Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner, Cheney joked that his wife Lynne told him that the Vader comparison [...] "humanizes" [...] him. George Lucas told The New York Times columnist <b>Maureen</b> <b>Dowd,</b> however, that Cheney is more akin to Emperor Palpatine, and that a better stand-in for Vader would be George W. Bush. An issue of Newsweek referenced this quote, and compared Bush and Cheney to Vader and Palpatine, respectively, in a satirical article comparing politicians to various Star Wars and Star Trek characters.|$|E
