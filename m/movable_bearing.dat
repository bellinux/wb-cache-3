The calculation of the beam vibrations, which are excited by the vehicle, {{as well as of the}} unstationary current state of the fluid is performed according to the eigen-form method that has to be adapted to the problems of hydroelastic systems. For the calculation of the fluid pressure the unstationary Bernoulli equation with the quadratic term is used. The eigen-forms of the beam are expanded in Fourier-sinus series, while the fluid potential is expanded in Fourier-cosinus series.

40|$|Rotating {{machines}} serves {{an important}} role in many different applications. Extensive research has been made, manly during the last century, in order to develop these systems and understand the dynamics. The theory of rotordynamics differs in many fundamental aspects from structural dynamics and is therefore usually treated as an own research area. In rotordynamical applications there exist several qualitatively different concepts. For example super- and subcritical machines supported on different types of bearings like ball-, roller- or journal bearings etc. At the early stage of the product development, the problem is often to find a general tool which can be used for dynamical evaluation of these concepts. Many concepts also contain significant nonlinearities which need to be studied separately. One such nonlinearity is a clearance which arises between a fixed support and an axially <b>movable</b> <b>bearing</b> assembly. Another nonlinear effect is the loss of contact which can occur in preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings. The aim is hence to present a method to dynamically evaluate different rotordynamical concepts, describe nonlinear effects due to these contact problems and suggest suitable design parameters. For the concept evaluation a linear model which captured the gyroscopic effect is proposed, while the contact problems are handled with nonlinear models (usually piecewise linear). The governing equations of motion are solved analytically in the linear case but needs to be simulated in the nonlinear cases. However, in some special cases it is possible to find steady state solutions even for the contact problems. Simulations of design spaces, Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, contact forces etc. have been used to study the systems. In order to evaluate different concept, design spaces spanned by a requirement variable and three design parameters are plotted. These are four dimensional plots where the variations of the requirement variables are visualised by colours. This is done both for the unbalance response and an impact in order to include both the homogenous and particular solution. In the clearance problem bifurcation diagrams and Poincaré maps indicates that multi-, quasi- or chaotic motions are possible which in many cases include impacts. When stabilising rods are applied the unstable areas (positive maximum Lyapunov exponent) are reduced. In the case with the spherical roller thrust bearings nonperiodic motions are found. The stability shows strong dependency on the amount of preload. A method to dynamically evaluate rotordynamical concepts is suggested. Some especially interesting ranges of the design parameters which give low vibrations are presented. It has further been shown that strong nonlinear dynamics which may lead to failure can be expected in systems with clearance between the stator and bearing assembly. One {{way to get rid of}} such unwanted vibrations is to apply stabilising rods. It is than important to choose the right parameters since otherwise worse conditions may occur. In systems supported by preloaded spherical roller thrust bearings it is important that the preloading is high enough. Otherwise jump phenomenon and nonperiodic motions can arise. An expression of the limit preload of going in or out of full contact has been derived which can be used to choose a suitable preloading. Godkänd; 2003; 20070215 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{displacement}} monitoring of a bridge, {{which is one of}} the key aspects of its structural health monitoring. A simplified Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) approach is used to monitor the displacements of the Nanjing Dashengguan Yangtze River High-speed Railway Bridge (China). This bridge is 1272  m long and hosts a total of 6 railway lines. The analysis was based on a set of twenty-nine Sentinel- 1 A images, acquired from April 2015 to August 2016. A dense set of measurement points were selected on the bridge. The PSI results show a maximum longitudinal displacement of 150  mm, on each side of the bridge. The displacements are strongly correlated with the temperature, showing that they are due to thermal expansion. Using the PSI results, the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of the whole bridge was estimated. The result agrees well with the CTE of the bridge materials. Using a regression model, the PSI-measured displacements were compared with in-situ measurements. The paper proposes a procedure to assess the performance of the <b>movable</b> <b>bearings</b> of the bridge, which is based on the PSI measurements...|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{of natural}} {{environment}} and historical areas, declining {{the environmental impact}} and aesthetic appearance {{are the most important}} issues in modern architecture especially in designing large structures such as bridges. Glass is the material that gives the opportunity for designing a transparent structure which may meet the aforementioned requirements. My initial concept was designing a structure which allows maximum transparency and not detracts people’s view of the space. In addition, glass can be used for constructing the structure because of its notable compression strength, elasticity and stiffness (young’s modulus of around 70 GPa), its durability and versatility, elegancy and transparency. However, structural applications of glass are restricted due to some deficiencies such as intrinsic brittleness and manufacturing limitations. Therefore, glass is usually associated with load-bearing skeletons usually made of metals or polymers. What is more, bridge may be the best example of engineering and structural physics which has notable role in our social life. Nowadays due to major breakthrough in the field of glass, glass has been used for constructing the bridges but regardless of having remarkable transparent structure, their load bearing capacities are again assigned to a traditional steel work. It means that using glass in a safe primary or secondary structure which still demonstrates that glass is a fragile and dangerous material. However, it is possible to exploit glass with its unique structural behavior in a safe structural component, utilize its undoubtable beauty and offer the excellent space quality. So, in that case heavy steel supports and strong aluminum systems are replaced by glass beams and columns which lead to more structural integrity of bridge and give spectacular view to the water. This project is designing a movable glass bridge which is covering the mentioned purposes and may lead to more investigation about the <b>movable</b> load <b>bearing</b> glass structure in the future.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, non-inflammatory type of arthritis, {{which usually}} affects the <b>movable</b> and weight <b>bearing</b> joints of the body. It {{is the most}} common joint disease in human beings and common in elderly people. Till date, there are no safe and {{effective}} diseases modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) to treat the millions of patients suffering from this serious and debilitating disease. However, recent studies provide strong evidence for the use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in curing cartilage related disorders. Due to their natural differentiation properties, MSCs can serve as vehicles for the delivery of effective, targeted treatment to damaged cartilage in OA disease. In vitro, MSCs can readily be tailored with transgenes with anti-catabolic or pro-anabolic effects to create cartilage-friendly therapeutic vehicles. On the other hand, tissue engineering constructs with scaffolds and biomaterials holds promising biological cartilage therapy. Many of these strategies have been validated {{in a wide range of}} in vitro and in vivo studies assessing treatment feasibility or efficacy.

40|$|The Swedish Transport Administration manage nearly 4, 000 railway bridges in {{different}} condition and age around the country. These bridges is in constant need of maintenance and requires continuous inspections. This thesis is {{designed as a}} damage investigation on a single-track railway bridge south of Solvarbo in Säter municipality. The railway bridge is in operation and serves over 10, 000 trains a year, everything from speed trains to freight trains. The bridge is built as a beam bridge, simply supported over a road. The report is made {{in consultation with the}} company Reinertsen Sweden AB. An investigation of the bridge was carried out in 2013 by Reinertsen Sweden AB, which describes that the abutments lean onto the superstructure due to motion. The damage noted was that the <b>movable</b> <b>bearings</b> are seriously tilted, the superstructure is in contact with the breast wall and several cracks were found on the abutment. These damages were considered to affect the function of the structure and found needing further investigation to consider possible future actions. The objective of this thesis is to analyze how the bridge has changed since it was built and to find what may be the underlying causes to these changes. The report is aimed to constitute a foundation and a decision basis for further measures. To determine how the bridge has moved a surveying with a total station was performed. Thereafter updated drawings of the bridge were established and later compared with the existing original drawings. To understand why the bridge has moved a sliding control was performed with different loads. In addition an inspection of structural damages was carried out and evaluated. Comparing the drawings showed a significant displacement of the eastern abutment towards the western. The movement of the abutment has made the two bearing walls tilt. The sliding control showed that there is no risk of sliding when only earth pressure is considered, but when loads of the trains are applied there is a risk of sliding. Wear of the bridge has caused several damages in the bridge structure. The visible damages found were cracks, efflorescence, bearing misalignment and corrosion of bearings and visible reinforcement. What could be determined was that the bridge has moved horizontally and vertically and one reason for the movement in the eastern abutment could be the horizontal forces brought by a passing train. By examining the damage caused to the bridge and compare them with the requirements of the Swedish Transport Administration it could be established that some of these damages have raised due to lack of maintenance. Denna rapport visar resultatet av vårt examensarbete i utbildningen till högskoleingenjör inom "Byggteknik och design" på Kungliga tekniska högskolan (KTH) i Stockholm. Organisationen Elikia na Biso, grundad av Miza Landström har med hjälp av studenter på KTH lyckats få fram ett förslag på två nya skolor som nu håller på att byggas i hennes födelseort Lwengo Basilla. Byn ligger i sydvästra delen av Demokratiska republiken Kongo. Området är i stort behov av skolor och Miza har genom sin organisation samlat in pengar för att driva igenom detta projekt. Tidigare har en grupp varit nere i Lwengo Basilla och påbörjat byggnationen av den första skolan och nästa steg är att bygga taket. Syftet med denna rapport är att med lokala material och hjälpmedel som finns att tillgå i Lwengo Basilla hitta lösningar på hur man på ett säkert sätt kan fästa taket till resten av byggnaden. Vi kommer även leda arbetet på plats för att lära ut byggtekniken till arbetarna i Lwengo Basilla. Denna rapport fokuserar på infästningarna av taket medan själva takstolskonstruktionen har arbetats fram av Shwan Delshad som har varit en samarbetspartner till denna rapport. I rapporten har fyra förslag på infästningslösningar för takstolarna tagits fram tillsammans med två förslag på pelare. Dessa har jämförts och ett lämpligt förslag har valts ut och dimensionerats. Pelarna kommer att bestå av trä och fästs i betongfundament för att få en stabilitet. Takstolarna fästs sedan i denna och balkar som löper mellan pelarna. Infästningen av takstolarna till väggen kommer utföras med hjälp av armeringsjärn som är inmurade i väggen och som spänns över takstolen och spikas fast för att takstolen ska sitta på plats.

The aim of this master thesis is to conduct a research on structural response of circular CFT (concrete filled tube) composite columns used as intermediate piers in integral bridges subjected to axial forces and bending moments caused by bridge weight and deck displacements respectively. The analysis is performed by finite element method using the software package Abaqus. A three dimensional model is defined using solid elements for both materials and paying special attention to the steel to concrete contact. Nonlinear behaviour of steel and concrete is taken into account. The confining effect of the concrete is also considered. Variations are done in ratio of steel and concrete used in the piers and also in N/Nu ratio for the equivalent bending moments. The finite element model is verified by comparing the results of numerical analysis with the results obtained by EN 1994 - 1 - 1 and by other research studies on this subject. The results of the analysis are used to make conclusions and are compared to Eurocode design codes...|$|R
40|$|In this study, two bridges {{recently}} completed at the Malpensa Airport are presented. The bridges overpass the trench where the railway track from Malpensa Airport {{runs to the}} city of Milan. They are part of a U-shaped path, called the hotel (H) ring, which connects the southern ends of the two existing taxiways. Such a crossing had to: (a) intersect the railway track twice with a high skew angle, (b) carry the maximum aeronautical loads, corresponding to the gears of an AIRBUS 380 aircraft and (c) host a 60 -m wide taxiway strip, plus a lateral safety lane and a service road, for a total width of 96 m. For a bridge operating in such an environment, it was imperative to reduce inspections and maintenance activities to a minimum. Therefore, the designers excluded any detail arrangements or auxiliary devices having life-cycle performances much shorter than that of the main structure. In particular, expansion joints and <b>movable</b> or deformable <b>bearing</b> supports were excluded. Such constraints led to design two structures having the peculiar features that characterise them as integral bridges. This paper will firstly recall the aeronautical and railway specifications and the other operating constraints that characterised the design. In the second part, the criteria followed in designing the foundations, the abutments and the deck are presented. The structural analyses were set out in accordance to the sequence of the construction stages. For the bridge in its service configuration, self-weight and permanent loads give rise to a set of internal forces typical of a portal frame, while the localised loads, due to the aircraft gears, induce bubble deformed shapes characterised by particular transversal load distribution mechanisms. Details of completions and finishing works are finally given...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{the safety}} aspects, {{the economy is}} the single most {{important}} factor when bridges are designed. Lowering the life cycle cost of bridges means that less tax-money would be spent, and that should be in the interest of the general public. Today, bridges in Sweden are generally designed with <b>movable</b> joints and <b>bearings.</b> Leaking joints are a major reason to corrosion problems, and it would be preferable if bridges were designed without these. Integral abutment bridges are bridges without any movable joints. The superstructures are rigidly connected to the abutments, which generally are supported by a single row of flexible piles. The largest benefits of integral abutment bridges are the lower construction- and maintenance costs. <b>Movable</b> joints and <b>bearings</b> are used in order to handle the expansion and contraction of the superstructure due to temperature changes. If these components are not used, then additional forces will be transferred to the abutments. Therefore, abutments in integral bridges will be laterally displaced as the temperature changes. The top of the piles will also be displaced and forces as well as moments will be induced in the piles. Pile stresses can locally exceed the yield strength of the pile material and plastic hinges can be developed. The development of plastic hinges in steel piles is allowed in the design of integral bridges in some states in the USA. The Swedish National Road Administration seems to be more hesitant about allowing pile stresses above the yield strength. And there seems to be a concern about whether or not there could be problems with fatigue involving plastic deformations, low-cycle fatigue. The aim of this thesis is to answer if, how and when low-cycle fatigue failures might happen in piles supporting integral abutment bridges. First of all, a literature review has been done in order to get a better understanding of the problem and to gain knowledge about the research areas that are involved in this report. Integral bridges have been studied in general and especially their thermal behaviour. Other areas that have been studied are piles, fatigue, effective bridge temperature, traffic loads, and the Monte Carlo method. In order to simulate pile strains in integral abutment bridges, a temperature simulation model and a traffic simulation model were created. One example bridge, Leduån Bridge, has been used in the calculations throughout the report. It is a single span composite road bridge with a span length of 40 m. A couple of input parameters have been varied in order to find out in which amount they influence the pile fatigue. Some of the varied parameters are the lateral soil stiffness, pile cross-section, the location of the bridge (different climates), and the length of the bridge. The temperature model is based on shade air temperature measurements during 30 years at five locations in Sweden. These temperatures are transformed into Effective Bridge Temperatures (EBT) in order to simulate the lateral displacements of the abutments. The seasonal temperature changes will give an annual strain cycle in the piles, and there will also be daily temperature variations giving smaller strain cycles. Variations in the vertical temperature gradient in the superstructure are also taken into consideration, since these will give rotations of the top of the piles as well as small lateral displacements. The traffic model is based on vehicle gross weights from BWIM measurements performed by the Swedish National Road Administration. Two traffic models have been used. The first one is based on the traffic intensity and gross weights at the road E 22, and the other one is based on measurements from National Road 67. The traffic load model has been combined with the temperature model, and Monte Carlo simulations of pile strains have been performed. The simulation results can be presented as pile strain spectra, involving cycles with periods from seconds up to years. A load spectrum during the designed lifetime of the bridge, 120 years, would involve more than 50 million strain cycles. These cycles have to be identified and counted in order to perform cumulative fatigue calculations. A method called the Rain-flow method has been used to identify the cycles, count them and sort them. The results from the calculations in this report indicate that low-cycle fatigue failures are not expected in piles supporting integral abutment bridges, at least up to a bridge length of 100 m. The calculation model is rather conservative and it is possible that even longer bridges can be constructed without problems with low-cycle fatigue. The importance of lowering the lateral soil stiffness can also be studied in the results, this fact has been noted in several other studies as well. It is also noted that some pile cross-sections seem to be more suitable than others for integral abutment bridges. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
