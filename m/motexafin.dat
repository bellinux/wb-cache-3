40|$|IntroductionMotexafin {{gadolinium}} {{is a novel}} antineoplastic {{drug that}} disrupts cancer cell antioxidant systems, thus contributing to cellular death. In patients with lung cancer, <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium {{has been shown to}} increase the time to neurologic progression when given in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy in randomized phase III studies. Preclinical data suggest that this drug might also enhance the antineoplastic effects of chemotherapy. MethodsIn this one-arm, open label, phase I, dose-escalation study, we administered docetaxel (75 mg/m 2), cisplatin (75 mg/m 2), and <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium every 3 weeks to patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Twenty-one patients were treated at one of four <b>motexafin</b> dose levels. ResultsThe maximal tolerated <b>motexafin</b> dose was 10 mg/kg on day 1 of a 3 -week cycle. Dose-limiting toxicities consisted of febrile neutropenia, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates. Other common grade 3 – 4 adverse events across all cohorts that {{did not appear to be}} exacerbated by <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium included granulocytopenia, fatigue, dehydration, nausea, and vomiting. Two episodes of myocardial ischemia and one sudden death of unknown cause were observed. Response rates were partial response (10 %), stable disease (60 %), and disease progression (30 %). ConclusionsThe regimen studied was tolerable and showed activity in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The recommended doses for future phase II trials are <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium 10 mg/kg, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2, and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on day 1 every 3 weeks.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in technology, targeting, and chemotherapy, brain metastasis from {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) remains a significant problem.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} using <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium (MGd) to characterize atherosclerotic plaques of deep-seated arteries with MRI. Materials and Methods: We exposed vascular endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in vitro to varying concentrations of MGd. The fluorescence properties of MGd were then exploited using confocal microscopy to image exposed cells. For an in vivo validation study, we performed surface coil-based and intravascular coil-based high-resolution MRI of the iliac arteries and the abdominal aorta of three atherosclerotic Yucatan pigs. Subsequently, MGd enhancement of the target vessel walls was quantitatively evaluated and MR images were correlated with histology of the target vessels. Results: The in vitro study confirmed the intracellularization of MGd in both cell types and determined the optimum MGd dosage of 0. 004 mmol/kg that produced the sufficiently high intracellular fluorescent intensity. The in vivo study showed a steady increase of MGd enhancement to approximately 25 % at three hours postinjection of MGd. MRI showed areas of strong enhancement along the lumen boundary, which corresponded to fibrous tissue seen in histology. Conclusion: This study provides initial evidence that MGd may enhance MR vessel wall imaging for the characterization of plaque in deep-seated arteries. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

Real-time clinical measurement of these hemo-dynamic quantities, however, is rare. This paper reports the development and application of a probe, combining diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for measurement of tumor blood oxygenation and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement of tumor blood flow. The instrument was adapted for clinical use during interstitial prostate PDT. Three patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer received 2 mg/ kg <b>motexafin</b> lutetium (MLu) 3 h before illumination and a total light dose of 100 J/cm 2 at 150 mW/cm. Prostrate blood oxygen saturation (StO 2) decreased only slightly (~ 3 %) after treatment.

While it is certainly impos-sible to draw definite conclusions from measurements of only three patients, the observed differences in tumor blood flow and blood oxygenation responses during PDT can, in prin-ciple, be used to choose among tissue oxygen consumption models and therefore emphasize the potential clinical value for simultaneous monitoring of both parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{thioredoxin}} (Trx) {{system is}} a major antioxidant system integral to maintaining the intracellular redox state. It contains Trx, a redox active protein, which regulates the activity of various enzymes including those that function to counteract oxidative stress within the cell. Trx can also scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and directly inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1). The oxidized form of Trx is reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). The cytoplasm and mitochondria contain equivalent Trx systems and inhibition of either system can lead to activation of apoptotic signaling pathways. There {{are a number of}} inhibitors with chemotherapy applications that target either Trx or TrxR to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is effective against many cancer cells and functions by up-regulating an endogenous inhibitor of Trx. Other compounds target the selenocysteine-containing active site of TrxR. These include gold compounds, platinum compounds, arsenic trioxide, <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium, nitrous compounds and various flavonoids. Inhibition of TrxR leads to an accumulation of oxidized Trx resulting in cellular conditions that promote apoptosis. In addition, some compounds also convert TrxR to a ROS generating enzyme. The role of Trx system inhibitors in cancer therapy is discussed in this review. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of possible {{improvement in the}} use of Gd in cancer therapy, particularly in the assessment of TPS, in reference to GdNCT, has been analyzed. At first the problem of the gadolinium compounds toxicity was reviewed identifying the <b>Motexafin</b> Gadolinium (De Stasio et al., 2006) as the best. Afterwards, the spectrum of IC and Auger electrons was calculated using a special method. Afterwards, this electron source has been used as input of the PENELOPE code (Salvat et al., 2006) and the energy deposit in DNA was well defined. Taking into account that the electron yield and energy distribution are related to the neutron beam spectrum and intensity, the shaping assembly architecture was optimized through computational investigations (Cerullo et al., 2005). Finally the study of GdNCT was performed from two different points of view: macrodosimetry using MCNPX, with calculation of absorbed doses both in tumour and healthy tissues, and microdosimetry using PENELOPE, with the determination of electron RBE through the energy deposit. The equivalent doses were determined combining these two kinds of data, introducing specific figures of merit to be used in TPS.

MGd was administered as a 5 -min intravenous bolus 2 – 5 h prior to standard radiation. The starting dose was 1. 7 mg/kg. After first establishing that 5 doses/week for 6 weeks was tolerable, the dose of MGd was escalated until dose-limiting toxicity was reached.

40|$|Background—Motexafin {{lutetium}} (MLu; Antrin) is a photosensitizer that {{is taken}} up by atherosclerotic plaque and concentrated within macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells. After photoactivation with far red light, MLu facilitates production of cytotoxic oxygen radicals that mediate apoptosis. We assessed the safety and tolerability of phototherapy (PT) with MLu in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment. Methods and Results—An open-label, phase I, drug and light dose-escalation clinical trial of MLu PT enrolled 80 patients undergoing de novo coronary stent deployment. MLu was administered to 79 patients by intravenous infusion 18 to 24 hours before procedure, and photoactivation was performed after balloon predilatation and before stent deployment. Clinical evaluation, serial quantitative angiography, and intravascular ultrasound were performed periprocedurally and at 6 months follow-up. MLu PT was well tolerated without serious dose-limiting toxicities, and side effects (paresthesia and rash) were minor. No adverse angiographic outcomes were attributed to phototherapy. Conclusions—This study demonstrates that coronary MLu PT seems safe, and the maximum well-tolerated MLu dose and range of tolerated light doses were identified.

40|$|The FDA employs an average-patient {{standard}} when reviewing drugs: it approves a drug only if is {{safe and}} effective for the average patient in a clinical trial. It is common, however, for patients to respond differently to a drug. Therefore, the average-patient standard can reject a drug that benefits certain patient subgroups (false negative) and even approval a drug that harms other patient subgroups (false positives). These errors increase the cost of drug development – and thus health care – by wasting research on unproductive or unapproved drugs. The reason why the FDA sticks with an average patient standard is concern about opportunism by drug companies. With enough data dredging, a drug company can always find some subgroup of patients that appears to benefit from its drug, even if it truly does not. In this paper we offer alternatives to the average patient standard that {{reduce the risk of}} false negative without increasing false positives from drug company opportunism.

A canine study of <b>motexafin</b> lutetium (Lu-Tex) -mediated IP PDT was performed to evaluate normal tissue toxicities of this treat-ment in the presence and absence of a bowel resection and to assess the feasibility of measuring Lu-Tex fluorescence in ab-dominal tissues. Thirteen dogs were treated with Lu-Tex (0. 2 – 2 mg/kg) i. v. 3 h before laparotomy and 730 -nm light delivery (fluences, 0. 5 – 2. 0 J/cm 2; average fluence rate < 150 mW/cm 2). Laparoscopy was performed 7 – 10 days after the procedure to assess acute toxicities. In situ fluorescence spectra were ob-tained from various abdominal tissues before and after light delivery using a fiber array probe with fixed-source detector distances. Lu-Tex-mediated IP PDT was well tolerated at the doses of drug and light studied. Bowel toxicity was not ob-served in animals treated with a bowel resection before PDT. Mild transient liver function test abnormalities without associ-ated clinical sequelae were observed. No gross PDT-related abnormalities were observed at laparoscopy or necropsy; how-ever, thickening in the glomerular capillary wall and the me-sangium were noted microscopically in the kidneys of seven dogs. No renal function abnormalities were found. Analysis of the fluorescence spectra from intra-abdominal tissues suggests that measurements of Lu-Tex in situ are feasible and may provide a way of assessing photosensitizer concentration in vivo without the need for a biopsy.

40|$|Purpose: {{to report}} the neurocognitive {{findings}} in a phase III randomized trial evaluating survival and neurologic and neurocognitive function in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors receiving whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) with or without <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium (MGd). Patients and Methods: patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive WBRT 30 Gy in 10 fractions with or without MGd 5 mg/kg/d. Monthly neurocognitive testing for memory, executive function, and fine motor skill was performed. Results: four hundred one patients were enrolled (251 with non–small-cell lung cancer, 75 with breast cancer, and 75 with other cancers); 90. 5 % patients had impairment of one or more neurocognitive tests at baseline. Neurocognitive test scores of memory, fine motor speed, executive function, and global neurocognitive impairment at baseline were correlated with brain tumor volume and predictive of survival. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment arms in time to neurocognitive progression. Patients with lung cancer (but not other types of cancer) who were treated with MGd tended to have improved memory and executive function (P =. 062) and improved neurologic function as assessed by a blinded events review committee (P =. 048). Conclusion: neurocognitive tests are a relatively sensitive measure of brain functioning; a combination of tumor prognostic variables and brain function assessments seems to predict survival better than tumor variables alone. Although the addition of MGd to WBRT did not produce a significant overall improvement between treatment arms, MGd may improve memory and executive function and prolong time to neurocognitive and neurologic progression in patients with brain metastases from lung cancer. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with radiosensitizer in comparison with WBRT alone for patients with brain metastases in terms of overall survival, disease progression, response to treatment and adverse effects of treatment. Methods: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) was performed in order to compare WBRT with radiosensitizer for brain metastases and WBRT alone. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library databases, in addition to Trial registers, bibliographic databases, and recent issues of relevant journals were researched. Significant reports were reviewed by two reviewers independently. Results: A total of 8 RCTs, yielding 2317 patients were analyzed. Pooled results from this 8 RCTs of WBRT with radiosensitizer have not shown a meaningful improvement on overall survival compared to WBRT alone OR = 1. 03 (95 % CI 0. 84 – 1. 25, p = 0. 77). Also, {{there was no difference}} in local brain tumor response OR = 0. 8 (95 % CI 0. 5 – 1. 03) and brain tumor progression (OR = 1. 11, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 3) when the two arms were compared. Conclusion: Our data show that WBRT with the following radiosentizers (ionidamine, metronidazole, misonodazole, <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium, BUdr, efaproxiral, thalidomide), have not improved significatively the overall survival, local control and tumor response compared to WBRT alone for brain metastases.

30|$|Network {{biomarkers}} {{and interaction}} networks were most studied in lung cancer among {{all kinds of}} respiratory diseases. Transcription factor profiling of lung adenocarcinomas in c-myc-transgenic mice suggested {{a model of a}} transcriptional regulatory network where different transcription factors acted in concert upon c-Myc overexpression [32]. Molecular networks for transcriptional regulation could explain partly the carcinogenic effect seen in mice with over-expression of the c-Myc oncogene. Similarly, the GATA 2 transcriptional network was discovered to be requisite for RAS oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer [33]. Novel functional view of the crocidolite asbestos-treated A 549 human lung epithelial transcriptome revealed an intricate network of pathways with opposing functions including cell death, cancer, cell cycle, cellular growth, proliferation, and gene expression [34]. Network Component Analysis and Pathway Crosstalk Analysis was performed to construct a regulatory network in human lung cancer (A 549) cells which were treated with <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium (MGd), a metal cation-containing chemotherapeutic drug for 4, 12, and 24  hours [35]. This dynamic network of transcription and pathway crosstalk clearly demonstrated molecular mechanism of MGd-treated human lung cancer cells. After downloading the preprocessed microarray expression dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus database, our group [36] applied a new computational strategy for the identification and biological interpretation of new candidate genes in lung cancer and smoking by coupling a network-based approach with gene set enrichment analysis. Panels of top ranked gene candidates, major gene hubs and commonly involved pathways in both the smoking and cancer related network were identified.

Drug companies have a financial incentive to avoid false negatives. After their clinical trials reveal that their drug does not benefit the average patient, they conduct what is called post hoc subgroup analysis to highlight patients that benefit from the drug.

The LC-MS/MS method was specific for MLu, whereas the ICP-AES method measured total elemental lutetium. Both methods were fast, simple, precise, and accurate. For the LC-MS/MS method, a closely related analogue (PCI- 0353) was used as the internal standard (IS). MLu and the IS were extracted from plasma by protein precipitation and injected onto and LC-MS/MS system configured with a C 18 column and an electrospray interface. The lower limit of quantitation was 0. 05 μg MLu mL− 1, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 15 ∶ 1. The response was linear from 0. 05 to 5. 0 μg MLu mL− 1. For the ICP-AES method, indium was used as the IS. The sample was digested with nitric acid, diluted, filtered, and then injected onto the ICP-AES system. Two standard curve ranges were validated to meet the expected range of sample concentrations: 0. 5 to 50, and 0. 1 to 10 μg Lu mL− 1.

The nanoparticle technologies can target tumors with high concentration of high-Z materials. This Monte Carlo study is the first detailed quantitative investigation of high-Z material Gd-induced dose enhancement in megavoltage external beam photon therapy. BEAMnrc, a radiotherapy Monte Carlo simulation package, was used to calculate dose enhancement {{as a function of}} Gd concentration. Published phase space files for the TrueBeam flattening filter free (FFF) and conventional flattened 6 MV photon beams were used. High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy with Ir- 192 source was also investigated as a reference. The energy spectra difference caused a dose enhancement difference between the two beams. Since the Ir- 192 photons have lower energy yet, the photoelectric effect in the presence of Gd leads to even higher dose enhancement in HDR. At depth of 1. 8 cm, the percent mean dose enhancement for the FFF beam was 0. 38 ± 0. 12, 1. 39 ± 0. 21, 2. 51 ± 0. 34, 3. 59 ± 0. 26, and 4. 59 ± 0. 34 for Gd concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL, respectively.

For Ir- 192 with direct contact, the enhanced were 0. 50 ± 0. 14, 2. 79 ± 0. 17, 5. 49 ± 0. 12, 8. 19 ± 0. 14, and 10. 80 ± 0. 13. Gd-containing materials used in MRI as contrast agents can also potentially serve as radiosensitizers in radiotherapy. This study demonstrates that Gd can be used to enhance radiation dose in target volumes not only in HDR brachytherapy, but also in 6 MV FFF external beam radiotherapy, but higher than the currently used clinical concentration (> 5 mg/mL) would be needed...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{design of}} {{anti-cancer}} treatments involving radiation- and photo-sensitizing therapeutics requires knowledge of tissue-specific drug concentrations. This dissertation investigates {{the utility of}} the Optical Pharmacokinetic System (OPS), a fiber-optic based elastic-scattering spectroscopy device, to noninvasively quantitate concentrations of sensitizing compounds and hemoglobin within tissue in vivo. The OPS was used to quantitate concentrations of <b>motexafin</b> gadolinium (MGd), in mouse tissues in vivo and in situ. An algorithm was developed to quantify MGd absorbance by integration of the MGd peak absorbance area, thereby relaxing the requirement that the extinction coefficient be known a priori. Concentrations measured by OPS were well-correlated with measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Compartmental pharmacokinetic models were developed from tissue-specific MGd concentrations measured by OPS and HPLC. Models predicted both rapid initial distribution and slow elimination of MGd in plasma, fast transport of MGd out of the skin, and MGd retention at long times in the tumor. In vivo tumor MGd concentrations measured by the OPS were estimated by a linear combination of the plasma, tumor, and skin PK profiles. A theoretical analysis of the OPS measurement of tissue was conducted using a Monte Carlo (MC) model of light transport through tissue that included discrete blood vessels. Simulation results motivated extensions to a previous analysis algorithm, including: (1) a novel analytic functionality between mean photon path length and total absorption coefficient; and (2) incorporation of a vessel correction factor to account for the pigment packaging effect of discrete vessels on the OPS-estimated absorption coefficient. These extensions improved OPS-estimates of both silicon phthalocyanine (Pc 4) and hemoglobin concentration in a mouse xenograft in vivo following photodynamic therapy (PDT). Mathematical models were utilized to investigate in silico the sensitivity of the OPS to chronically and acutely hypoxic regions within tumor tissue. PDT-induced acute hypoxia occured via simulation of the photodynamic reaction. Subsequent simulation of the OPS measurement suggested that the OPS may be sensitive to the presence of chronically hypoxic vessels (an OPS-estimated hemoglobin saturation of &ge 57 indicated < 6 of vessels hypoxic), but may have limited application to detection of acute hypoxia following PDT...|$|E
40|$|Faithful {{replication}} of DNA and its repair are fundamental processes in all living cells which utilize deoxyribonucleotides as DNA building blocks. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) {{is the essential}} enzyme for de novo synthesis of these precursors from ribonucleoside diphosphates. Each catalytic cycle of RNR, requires disulfide bond reduction which as shown in Escherichia coli,is catalyzed by thioredoxin (Trx) or glutaredoxin (Grx) systems. These are general protein disulfide reductases, {{and the presence of}} one system is essential. The Trx system comprises Trx, Trx reductase (TrxR), and NADPH; and the Grx system is composed of Grx, glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase, and NADPH. This thesis studies mammalian RNR; in S-phase cells RNR comprises a weak complex of a catalytic R 1 protein, containing redox active cysteine residues, and a radical generator subunit termed R 2. By analyzing recombinant mouse RNR with respect to electron donors, we found that Trx 1 and Grx 1 had similar catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). With 4 mM GSH, Grx 1 showed a higher affinity (apparent Km-value 0. 18 µM) compared to Trx 1 which displayed a higher apparent kcat suggesting its major role in S-phase DNA replication. Surprisingly, Grx activity was strongly dependent on GSH concentrations (apparent Km-value 3 mM), and a Grx 2 Cys 40 Ser mutant was active despite only one cysteine residue in the active site. These results demonstrate a GSH-mixed disulfide mechanism for Grx catalysis, in contrast to the dithiol mechanism for Trx. We propose that this may be an advantage with the low levels of RNR for DNA repair or in tumor cells with high RNR and no or low Trx expression. Different isoforms of mouse Grx 2 were identified, which were further characterized with respect to subcellular localization, expression pattern, and enzymatic activity. Amoung three different isoforms (Grx 2 a, Grx 2 c, and Grx 2 d), mitochondrial Grx 2 a was expressed in all tissues, except testis. On the other hand, Grx 2 c and Grx 2 d were cytosolic and expressed in testis. Mouse Grx 2 c had general Grx-activity and could reduce RNR, but Grx 2 d lacked enzymatic activity. These data provide evidence for additional functions of Grx 2 in the cytosol, in cell proliferation, and in cellular differentiation. <b>Motexafin</b> gadolinium (MGd) is a new anticancer agent with promising results in clinical trials, which selectively targets tumor cells and works as a radiation enhancer. It mediates redox reactions generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) with oxidation of intracellular reducing molecules. MGd was an NADPH-oxidizing substrate for TrxR. The reaction involved redox cycling of MGd by oxygen producing superoxide. MGd acted as a non-competitive inhibitor for TrxR. In contrast, direct reaction between MGd and reduced Trx was negligible. MGd inhibited recombinant RNR activity with either the Trx system or dithiothreitol as electron donors. Overall, our results show that MGd induces generation of ROS by TrxR and is a powerful inhibitor of RNR. Further studies on the mechanism of inhibition of RNR by MGd, revealed at least two different mechanisms for its effect: interruption in subunit oligomerization, and direct inhibition of the catalytic subunit (R 1). Co-localization of MGd and RNR in the cytoplasm was shown particularly in the S-phase. These data elucidate another important effect of MGd on the cancer cells with overproduction of RNR, and highlights its efficacy as an anticancer agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{homeostasis}} of intracellular redox status has {{a crucial}} role in the cell survival and different processes such as DNA synthesis, gene expression, enzymatic activity, etc. This homeostasis is achieved via an intense balance between pro-oxidants and anti-oxidants. Among anti-oxidants, there are two enzymatic systems which are also the main intracellular general protein disulfide reductases, the thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) systems. The Trx system contains Trx, Trx reductase (TrxR) and NADPH, while the Grx system is composed of glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), Grx and NADPH. The upregulation of Trx, TrxR, and Grx have been reported in various tumor cells that are directly correlated to the resistance to chemotherapy, aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis. Therefore, these two systems are potential targets for anti-tumor therapy as well as some other clinical applications. Hence, it is important to know how the activity and structure of these proteins are affected via chemical compounds or by post-translational modifications. <b>Motexafin</b> gadolinium (MGd), a new chemotherapeutic drug, was an NADPH oxidizing substrate for mammalian TrxRs with a Km-value of 8. 65 μM (kcat/Km of 4. 86 × 104 M- 1 s- 1). The reaction involved redox cycling of MGd by oxygen producing superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. MGd acted as a non-competitive inhibitor (IC 50 of 6 μM) for rat TrxR. MGd was a better substrate (kcat/Km of 2. 23 × 105 M- 1 s- 1) for TrxR from E. coli and a strong inhibitor of Trx-dependent protein disulfide reduction. Direct reaction between MGd and reduced Trx from either human or E. coli was negligible. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme for DNA synthesis. MGd inhibited recombinant mouse RNR activity with either 3 μM reduced human Trx (IC 50 2 μM) or 4 mM dithiothreitol (IC 50 6 μM) as electron donors. Our results may explain the effects of the drug on cancer cells, which often overproduce TrxR and have induced RNR for replication and repair. Besides two cysteines in the active site, human cytosolic Grx 1 and mitochondrial Grx 2 contain three and two additional structural cysteines, respectively. We analyzed the redox state and disulfide pairing of Cys residues upon GSSG oxidation and S-nitrosylation. Grx 1 was partly inactivated both by S-nitrosylation and oxidation. Inhibition by nitrosylation was reversible under anaerobic conditions; aerobically it was stronger and irreversible, due to nitration. Oxidation of Grx 1 induced a complex pattern of disulfide bonded dimers and oligomers formed between Cys 8 and either Cys 79 or Cys 83. An intramolecular disulfide between Cys 79 and Cys 83 was also identified. Grx 2 retains activity upon oxidation, did not form dimers or oligomers and could not be S-nitrosylated. The dimeric iron sulfur cluster coordinating inactive form of Grx 2 dissociated upon nitrosylation, leading to activation of the protein. Besides active site cysteines in the conserved motif of -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-, human cytosolic Trx 1 has three structural Cys residues in positions 62, 69 and 73 which upon diamide oxidation induce a second Cys 62 -Cys 69 disulfide as well as dimers and multimers. After incubation with H 2 O 2, only monomeric two-disulfide molecules are generated which are inactive but able to regain full activity in an autocatalytic process in the presence of NADPH and TrxR. We found that nitrosylation by GSNO at physiological pH is critically dependent on the redox state of Trx. Starting from fully reduced human Trx, both Cys 69 and Cys 73 were nitrosylated and the active site formed a disulfide; the nitrosylated Trx was not a substrate for TrxR but regained activity after a lag phase consistent with autoactivation. The reversible inhibition of human Trx 1 activity by H 2 O 2 and NO donors is suggested to act in cell signaling via temporal control of reduction for the transmission of oxidative and/or nitrosative signals in thiol redox control...|$|E
