25|$|Allianoi {{was still}} densely {{populated}} during the Byzantine period. Nevertheless, {{as was the}} case with neighboring Pergamon, the socio-economic fabric of the urban settlement had frayed. Some architectural elements of the Roman Period were re-used by the Byzantine settlers. Utilizing the paved streets of the stoas and streets of the Roman period, succeeding Byzantine populations constructed simpler dwellings. The most important buildings of Allianoi, namely the thermal baths and the nympheum, remained in use for a long time, with some minor alterations. A large church reminiscent of a basilica was built in the east, while chapels were constructed in and around the settlement. <b>Metal,</b> <b>ceramic</b> and glass workshops were all traceable to this period.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this {{in-vitro}} study was to evaluate the frictional characteristics of conventional <b>ceramic</b> versus <b>metal</b> insert <b>ceramic</b> brackets in combination with stainless steel and Teflon-coated stainless steel archwires. Materials and Methods: Twenty brackets each, of <b>ceramic</b> and <b>metal</b> insert <b>ceramic</b> Maxillary canine preadjusted edgewise brackets 0. 022 × 0. 028 in slot) and 20 archwires, each of stainless steel and Teflon-coated stainless steel (0. 019 × 0. 025 in) were tested for frictional resistance. Friction was evaluated in a simulated Tidy′s design apparatus on universal testing machine. The kinetic friction {{data were analyzed using}} Student′s ′t′ test. The effects of surface characteristics on frictional resistance were qualitatively assessed using scanning electron microscope. Results: <b>Metal</b> insert <b>ceramic</b> brackets generated significantly lower kinetic frictional resistance than the conventional ceramic brackets with Teflon-coated stainless steel archwires (P < 0. 001) as well as stainless steel archwires (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Metal</b> insert <b>ceramic</b> bracket with stainless steel archwire is the best possible combination among the materials studied because it generated the least frictional resistance during simulated tooth movement...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the shear bond {{strength}} (SBS) of resin modified glass ionomer (RMGI) and composite resin for bonding <b>metal</b> and <b>ceramic</b> brackets. Eighty-eight human premolars extracted for orthodontic purposes were divided into 4 groups (n= 22). In groups 1 and 2, 22 <b>metal</b> and <b>ceramic</b> brackets were bonded using composite resin (Transbond XT), respectively. Twenty-two <b>metal</b> and <b>ceramic</b> brackets in groups 3 and 4, respectively were bonded using RMGI (Fuji Ortho LC, Japan). After photo polymerization, the teeth were stored in water and thermocycled (500 cycles between 5 ° and 55 °). The SBS value of each sample was determined using a Universal Testing Machine. The amount of residual adhesive remaining on each tooth was evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Statistical analyses were done using two-way ANOVA. RMGI bonded brackets had significantly lower SBS value compared to composite resin bonded groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between <b>metal</b> and <b>ceramic</b> brackets bonded with either the RMGI or composite resin. The comparison of the adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores between the groups indicated that the bracket failure mode was significantly different among groups (P< 0. 001) with more adhesive remaining on the teeth bonded with composite resin. RMGIs have significantly lower SBS compared to composite resin for orthodontic bonding purposes; however the provided SBS is still within the clinically acceptable range...|$|R
