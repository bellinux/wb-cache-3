5|$|There {{are five}} methods {{that can be}} used to deliver breast brachytherapy: Interstitial breast brachytherapy, Intracavitary breast brachytherapy, Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy, Permanent Breast Seed Implantation and non-invasive breast brachytherapy using <b>mammography</b> for target localization and an HDR source.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mammography</b> is {{a common}} {{screening}} method, since it is relatively fast and widely available in developed countries. <b>Mammography</b> {{is a type of}} radiography used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms or has been called back for follow-up views (called diagnostic <b>mammography),</b> and for medical screening of apparently healthy women (called screening <b>mammography).</b>|$|E
25|$|CAD {{is used in}} {{screening}} <b>mammography</b> (X-ray {{examination of}} the female breast). Screening <b>mammography</b> {{is used for the}} early detection of breast cancer. CAD systems are often utilized to help classify a tumor as malignant or benign. CAD is especially established in US and the Netherlands and is used in addition to human evaluation, usually by a radiologist. The first CAD system for <b>mammography</b> was developed in a research project at the University of Chicago. Today it is commercially offered by iCAD and Hologic. There are currently some non-commercial projects being developed, such as Ashita Project, a gradient-based screening software by Alan Hshieh, as well. However, while achieving high sensitivities, CAD systems tend to have very low specificity and the benefits of using CAD remain uncertain. Some studies suggest a positive impact on <b>mammography</b> screening programs, but others show no improvement. A 2008 systematic review on computer-aided detection in screening <b>mammography</b> concluded that CAD does not {{have a significant effect on}} cancer detection rate, but does undesirably increase recall rate (i.e. the rate of false positives). However, it noted considerable heterogeneity in the impact on recall rate across studies.|$|E
25|$|Procedures to {{evaluate}} <b>mammography</b> based on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} exist too.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether the higher rate of breast cancer {{associated}} with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by <b>mammography.</b> Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of <b>mammography</b> reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of <b>mammography</b> screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of <b>mammography</b> among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese {{women are more likely to}} list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid <b>mammography</b> are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that <b>mammography</b> patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at a healthy weight indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups.|$|E
25|$|Three out {{of twelve}} (3/12) breast cancer {{screening}} programs in Canada offer clinical breast examinations. All twelve offer screening <b>mammography</b> {{every two years}} for women aged 50–69, while nine out of twelve (9/12) offer screening <b>mammography</b> for women aged 40–49. In 2003, about 61% of women aged 50–69 in Canada reported having had a mammogram within the past two years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mammography</b> is {{not very}} useful in finding breast tumors in dense breast tissue {{characteristic}} of women under 40 years. In women over 50 without dense breasts, breast cancers detected by screening <b>mammography</b> are usually smaller and less aggressive than those detected by patients or doctors as a breast lump. This is because the most aggressive breast cancers are found in dense breast tissue, which mammograms perform poorly on.|$|E
25|$|A fibroadenoma {{is usually}} {{diagnosed}} through clinical examination, ultrasound or <b>mammography,</b> {{and often a}} needle biopsy sample of the lump.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mammography</b> and DXA are two {{applications}} of low energy projectional radiography, {{used for the}} evaluation for breast cancer and osteoporosis, respectively.|$|E
25|$|As of 2009 the United States Preventive Services Task Force {{recommends}} that {{women over the}} age of 50 receive <b>mammography</b> once every two years.|$|E
25|$|The St. Cloud Hospital Breast Center {{also offers}} breast cancer screenings, assessments, {{diagnostic}} work-ups, education and treatment plans {{as well as}} a mobile <b>mammography</b> unit and other services.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{ultrasonography}} is {{a diagnostic}} aid to <b>mammography.</b> Adding ultrasonography testing {{for women with}} dense breast tissue increases the detection of breast cancer, but also increases false positives.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{screening}} <b>mammography</b> {{is promoted}} by the breast cancer culture as the sole possible approach to public health for breast cancer. Alternatives, such as pollution prevention, are largely ignored.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{national}} bodies recommend breast cancer screening. For the average woman, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends <b>mammography</b> {{every two years}} in {{women between the ages}} of 50 and 74, the Council of Europe recommends <b>mammography</b> between 50 and 69 with most programs using a 2-year frequency, and in Canada screening is recommended between the ages of 50 and 74 at a frequency of 2 to 3 years. These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>mammography</b> in {{universal}} {{screening for}} breast cancer is controversial as it may not reduce all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures. Many national organizations recommend it for most older women. In the United States screening <b>mammography</b> women at normal risk {{for breast cancer}}, is only recommended every two years in {{women between the ages}} of 50 and 74. Several tools are available to help target breast cancer screening to older women with longer life expectancies. Similar imaging studies can be performed with magnetic resonance imaging but evidence is lacking.|$|E
25|$|As of 1998, Medicare (available {{to those}} aged 65 or older {{or who have}} been on Social Security Disability Insurance for over 2 years) pays for annual {{screening}} <b>mammography</b> in women aged 40 or older.|$|E
25|$|First medical {{applications}} like a pre-clinical <b>mammography</b> study, show {{great potential for}} the future of this technique. Beyond that GBI has applications in a wide field of material science, for instance it could be used to improve security screening.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its high}} {{sensitivity}} to {{small changes in}} the refraction index this method is well suited to image soft tissue samples and is already implemented to medical imaging, especially in <b>Mammography</b> for a better detection of microcalcifications and in bone cartilage studies.|$|E
25|$|Breast {{augmentation}} surgery generally {{does not}} interfere with future ability to breastfeed. Breast reduction surgery more frequently leads to decreased sensation in the nipple-areola complex, and to low milk supply in women who choose to breastfeed. Implants can interfere with <b>mammography</b> (breast x-rays images).|$|E
25|$|There is also {{development}} for a safer, {{more comfortable and}} accurate test for breast cancer by Lab scientists Lianjie Huang and Kenneth M. Hanson and collaborators. The new technique, called ultrasound-computed tomography (ultrasound CT), uses sound waves to accurately detect small tumors that traditional <b>mammography</b> cannot.|$|E
25|$|Breast cancer {{screening}} refers to testing otherwise-healthy women {{for breast cancer}} {{in an attempt to}} achieve an earlier diagnosis under the assumption that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed including clinical and self breast exams, <b>mammography,</b> genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
25|$|Sumner Regional Medical Center is a {{hospital}} located in Gallatin. It has an emergency room, {{a nationally recognized}} cancer-treatment program, a wound care center, a cardiac catheterization lab, and a diagnostic sleep center. The staff can also perform digital <b>mammography,</b> interventional cardiology, neurosurgery, computerized knee replacement surgery, and PET therapy, among other procedures.|$|E
25|$|CAD is an {{interdisciplinary}} technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is {{the detection of}} a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in <b>mammography</b> (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in the colon, and lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used screening methods, physical examination of the breasts by a healthcare provider and <b>mammography,</b> can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer, and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst. When these examinations are inconclusive, a healthcare provider can remove {{a sample of the}} fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration and cytology—FNAC) to help establish the diagnosis. The needle aspiration may be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic using local anaesthetic if required. A finding of clear fluid makes the lump highly unlikely to be cancerous, but bloody fluid may be sent off for inspection under a microscope for cancerous cells. Together, physical examination of the breasts, <b>mammography,</b> and FNAC can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{risk factors}} include {{radiation}} and shift-work. A number of chemicals {{have also been}} linked, including polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and organic solvents Although the radiation from <b>mammography</b> is a low dose, {{it is estimated that}} yearly screening from 40 to 80 years of age will cause approximately 225 cases of fatal breast cancer per million women screened.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely {{discussed}} false positives in medical screening come from the breast cancer screening procedure <b>mammography.</b> The US rate of false positive mammograms is up to 15%, the highest in world. One consequence of the high false positive rate in the US is that, in any 10-year period, half of the American women screened receive a false positive mammogram. False positive mammograms are costly, with over $100million spent annually in the U.S. on follow-up testing and treatment. They also cause women unneeded anxiety. As {{a result of the}} high false positive rate in the US, as many as 90–95% of women who get a positive mammogram do not have the condition. The lowest rate in the world is in the Netherlands, 1%. The lowest rates are generally in Northern Europe where <b>mammography</b> films are read twice and a high threshold for additional testing is set (the high threshold decreases the power of the test).|$|E
25|$|Recommendations {{to attend}} to <b>mammography</b> {{screening}} vary across countries and organizations, with the most common difference being {{the age at which}} screening should begin, and how frequently or if it should be performed, among women at typical risk for developing breast cancer. In November 2016 the European Commission published recommendations suggesting asymptomatic women with average risk to attend organised screening between 45 and 74 years old.|$|E
25|$|Supporting {{breast cancer}} {{was seen as}} a distinctively pro-woman stance popular among public official. This has {{resulted}} in better access to care. For example, in much of the United States, low-income women with breast cancer may qualify for taxpayer-funded health care benefits, such as screening <b>mammography,</b> biopsies, or treatment, while women with the same income, but another form of cancer or a medical condition other than cancer, do not.|$|E
25|$|Other {{options for}} biopsy include a core biopsy or vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, which are {{procedures}} {{in which a}} section of the breast lump is removed; or an excisional biopsy, in which the entire lump is removed. Very often the results of physical examination by a healthcare provider, <b>mammography,</b> and additional tests that may be performed in special circumstances (such as imaging by ultrasound or MRI) are sufficient to warrant excisional biopsy as the definitive diagnostic and primary treatment method.|$|E
25|$|Lumpectomy {{techniques}} are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that {{for patients with}} a single tumor smaller than 4cm, a lumpectomy with negative surgical margins may {{be as effective as}} a mastectomy. Prior to a lumpectomy, a needle-localization of the lesion with placement of a guidewire may be performed, sometimes by an interventional radiologist if the area being removed was detected by <b>mammography</b> or ultrasound, and sometimes by the surgeon if the lesion can be directly palpated.|$|E
25|$|Molecular breast imaging is {{a nuclear}} {{medicine}} technique {{that is currently}} under study. It shows promising results for imaging people with dense breast tissue and may have accuracies comparable to MRI. It may be better than <b>mammography</b> in some people with dense breast tissue, detecting {{two to three times}} more cancers in this population. It however carries a greater risk of radiation damage making it inappropriate for general breast cancer screening. It is possible to reduce the dose of radiation used.|$|E
25|$|Explanations for {{the delayed}} {{presentation}} {{among women in}} Ghana have been traced to the cost of, and access to, and routine screening <b>mammography.</b> Furthermore, women with breast cancer in Ghana describe a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, largely due to their belief in fatalism, which contributes to denial {{as a means of}} coping. Mayo et al. (2003) conclude, however, that lack of awareness may be a more critical variable than fatalism in explaining health care decisions among women in Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Carriers of A-T, such as {{the parents}} of a person with A-T, have one mutated copy of the ATM gene and one normal copy. They are {{generally}} healthy, but there is an increased risk of breast cancer in women. This finding has been confirmed in a variety of different ways, and is the subject of current research. Standard surveillance (including monthly breast self-exams and <b>mammography</b> at the usual schedule for age) is recommended, unless additional tests are indicated because the individual has other risk factors (e.g., family history of breast cancer).|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{the month}} of October is {{recognized}} as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month by many governments, the media, and cancer survivors. The month-long campaign has been called Pinktober because of the increased production of pink goods for sale, and National Breast Cancer Industry Month by critics like Breast Cancer Action. NBCAM was begun in 1985 by the American Cancer Society and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The organization that runs the official NBCAM aims to promote <b>mammography</b> {{and other forms of}} early detection as the most effective means of fighting breast cancer.|$|E
