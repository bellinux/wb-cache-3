40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} an alternative form of coarse geometry on proper metric spaces, {{which is more}} delicate at infinity than the standard <b>metric</b> <b>coarse</b> structure. There is an assembly map from the K-homology of a space to the K-theory of the C*-algebra associated to the new coarse structure, which factors through the coarse K-homology of the space (with the new coarse structure). A Dirac-type operator on a complete Riemannian manifold M {{gives rise to a}} class in K-homology, and its image under assembly gives a higher index in the K-theory group. The main result of this paper is a vanishing theorem for the index of the Dirac operator on an open spin manifold for which the scalar curvature ?(x) tends to infinity as x tends to infinity. This is derived from a spectral vanishing theorem for any Dirac-type operator with discrete spectrum and finite dimensional eigenspaces. <br/...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Following Roe {{and others}} (see, e. g., [8]), we (re) develop coarse {{geometry}} from the foundations, taking a categorical point of view. In this paper, we {{concentrate on the}} discrete case in which topology plays no role. Our theory is particularly suited {{to the development of}} the Roe (C ∗-) algebras C ∗ (X) and their K-theory on the analytic side; we also hope that it will be of use in the more strictly geometric/algebraic setting of controlled topology and algebra. However, we leave these topics to future papers. Crucial to our approach are nonunital coarse spaces, for which we introduce the concept of locally proper maps. Our coarse category Crs is a generalization of the usual one: its objects are (possibly nonunital) coarse spaces and its morphisms are (locally proper) coarse maps modulo closeness. Crs is considerably richer than the usual coarse category of unital coarse spaces and proper coarse maps. As such, it has all nonzero limits and all colimits (all of which are easily constructed). We examine various other categorical issues. For example, Crs does not have a terminal object, so we substitute a termination functor. This functor will be important in the development of exponential objects (i. e., “function spaces”) [12], and also leads to a notion of quotient coarse spaces. To connect our methods with the standard methods, we also examine the relationship between Crs and the usual coarse category. Finally we briefly discuss some basic examples and applications. Topics include <b>metric</b> <b>coarse</b> spaces, continuous control [1], metric and continuously controlled coarse simplices, σ-coarse spaces [4], and the relation between quotient coarse spaces and the K-theory of Roe algebras (which is of particular interest for continuously controlled coarse spaces) ...|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers to}} study locally compact groups {{from the point}} of view of {{appropriate}} metrics that can be defined on them, in other words to study "Infinite groups as geometric objects", as Gromov writes it in the title of a famous article. The theme has often been restricted to finitely generated groups, but it can favorably be played for locally compact groups. The development of the theory is illustrated by numerous examples, including matrix groups with entries in the the field of real or complex numbers, or other locally compact fields such as p-adic fields, isometry groups of various metric spaces, and, last but not least, discrete group themselves. Word metrics for compactly generated groups play a major role. In the particular case of finitely generated groups, they were introduced by Dehn around 1910 in connection with the Word Problem. Some of the results exposed concern general locally compact groups, such as criteria for the existence of compatible metrics on locally compact groups. Other results concern special classes of groups, for example those mapping onto the group of integers (the Bieri-Strebel splitting theorem for locally compact groups). Prior to their applications to groups, the basic notions of coarse and large-scale geometry are developed in the general framework of metric spaces. Coarse geometry is that part of geometry concerning properties of metric spaces that can be formulated in terms of large distances only. In particular coarse connectedness, coarse simple connectedness, <b>metric</b> <b>coarse</b> equivalences, and quasi-isometries of metric spaces are given special attention. The final chapters are devoted to the more restricted class of compactly presented groups, generalizing finitely presented groups to the locally compact setting. They can indeed be characterized as those compactly generated locally compact groups that are coarsely simply connected. Comment: Book in preparation (233 p).

A coarse timing offset estimate is first obtained by maximizing a normalized correlation <b>metric.</b> A <b>coarse</b> frequency offset estimate is similarly obtained by a correlation metric.

This paper addresses how to obtain this CIR estimate and presents how this channel estimation assists in improving the timing offset estimation.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of an exact functional renormalization group equation for Quantum Einstein Gravity necessitates {{that the underlying}} effective average action depends on two metrics, a dynamical metric giving the vacuum expectation value of the quantum field, and a background <b>metric</b> supplying the <b>coarse</b> graining scale. The central requirement of "background independence" is met by leaving the background metric completely arbitrary. This bimetric structure entails that the effective average action may contain three classes of interactions: those built from the dynamical metric only, terms which are purely background, and those involving a mixture of both metrics. This work initiates the first study of the full-fledged gravitational RG flow, which explicitly accounts for this bimetric structure, by considering an ansatz for the effective average action which includes all three classes of interactions. It is shown that the non-trivial gravitational RG fixed point central to the Asymptotic Safety program persists upon disentangling the dynamical and background terms. Moreover, upon including the mixed terms, a second non-trivial fixed point emerges, which may control the theory's IR behavior. Comment: 35 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Dedicated to {{the memory}} of Candida Silveira. Abstract. We study the large scale {{geometry}} of the mapping class group, MCG. Our main result is that for any asymptotic cone of MCG, the maximal dimension of locally compact subsets coincides with the maximal rank of free abelian subgroups of MCG. An application is a proof of Brock-Farb’s Rank Conjecture which asserts that MCG has quasi-flats of dimension N if and only if it has a rank N free abelian subgroup. (Hamenstadt has also given a proof of this conjecture, using different methods.) We also compute the maximum dimension of quasiflats in Teichmuller space with the Weil-Petersson <b>metric.</b> The <b>coarse</b> geometric structure of a finitely generated group can be studied by passage to its asymptotic cone, which is a space obtained by a limiting process from sequences of rescalings of the group. This has {{played an important role in}} the quasi-isometric rigidity results of [DS], [KL 1] [KL 2], and others. In this paper we study the asymptotic cone M ω (S) of the mapping class group of a surface of finite type. Our main result is Dimension Theorem. The maximal topological dimension of a locallycompact subset of the asymptotic cone of a mapping class group is equal to the maximal rank of an abelian subgroup. Note that [BLM] showed that the maximal rank of an abelian subgroup of a mapping class group of a surface with negative Euler characteristic is 3 g − 3 + p where g is the genus and p the number of boundary components. This is also the number of components of a pants decomposition and hence the largest rank of a pure Dehn twist subgroup. As an application we obtain a proof of the “geometric rank conjecture” for mapping class groups, formulated by Brock and Farb [BF], which states: Rank Theorem. The geometric rank of the mapping class group of a surface of finite type is equal to the maximal rank of an abelian subgroup. Hamenstädt has previously announced a proof of the rank conjecture for mapping class groups, which has now appeared in [Ham].

40|$|Coarse {{structures}} are an abstract construction describing {{the behavior of}} a space at a large distance. In this thesis, a variety of existing results on coarse {{structures are}} presented, with the main focus being coarse embeddability into Hilbert spaces. The end goal is to present a hierarchy of three coarse invariants, namely coarse embeddability into a Hilbert space, a property of metric spaces known as Property A, and a finite-valued asymptotic dimension. After outlining the necessary prerequisites and notation, the first main part of the thesis is an introduction to the basics of coarse geometry. Coarse structures are defined, and it is shown how a <b>metric</b> induces a <b>coarse</b> structure. Coarse maps, equivalences and embeddings are defined, and some of their basic properties are presented. Alongside this, comparisons are made to both topology and uniform topology, and results related to metrizability of coarse spaces are outlined. Once the basics of coarse structures have been presented, the focus shifts to coarse embeddability into Hilbert spaces, which has become a point of interest due to its applications to several unsolved conjectures. Two concepts are presented related to coarse embeddability into Hilbert spaces, the first one being Property A. It is shown that Property A implies coarse embeddability into a Hilbert space, and that it is a coarse invariant. The second main concept related to coarse embeddability is asymptotic dimension. Asymptotic dimension is a coarse counterpart to the Lebesgue dimension of topological spaces. Various definitions of asymptotic dimension are given and shown equivalent. The coarse invariance of asymptotic dimension is shown, and the dimensions of several example spaces are derived. Finally, it is shown that a finite asymptotic dimension implies coarse embeddability into a Hilbert space, {{and in the case of}} spaces with bounded geometry it also implies Property A...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} going wireless, and the {{availability}} of high-speed ubiquitous wireless connectivity is being taken for granted. Along with high bandwidth consuming applications such as high-definition video, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming omnipresent. The legacy wireless systems are not designed to meet such an exponential growth in the demand for wireless connectivity. To meet both short- and long-term demands, we need to develop methods to maximize the spectral efficiency of existing wireless systems, and also understand the fundamental limits of various architectures to guide the design of future wireless networks. Breaking the interference barrier is an important step in achieving higher throughput in both cellular and ad-hoc wireless networks. Towards this end, there has been a renewed interest in information-theoretic studies of Gaussian interference channels in recent years. The technique used by almost all legacy systems to handle interference in wireless networks is to separate the users signals as much as possible using the available time, frequency and spatial dimensions, and then to treat the residual interference as noise. We refer to this technique as simply treating interference as noise. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, we consider the following two problems: (1) Suppose we restrict the strategy to treating interference as noise, then what is the best achievable sum-rate? (2) How sub-optimal is this strategy compared to the best possible strategy? Both of these problems have been widely studied for over three decades, and yet they remain open. We solve both of these problems under certain conditions on the channel parameters which are satisfied when the interference levels are low compared to the signal levels. In such a low interference regime, we show that the best sum-rate achievable with treating interference as noise is a solution to a convex maxmin optimization problem, and therefore the optimal transmit strategies and the corresponding best sum-rate can be efficiently computed using standard convex optimization algorithms. We also show that the corresponding best sum-rate is indeed equal to the sum capacity, thus proving that treating interference as noise is the best strategy in the low interference regime. In the second part of the dissertation, we obtain insights into the problem of interference channel with coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception, where the transmitters cooperate to jointly transmit the messages, and the receivers cooperate to jointly receive the messages. The advanced cellular systems such as LTE-Advanced are likely to use CoMP as the physical layer interference management technique to enhance the capacity. Since determining the exact capacity of wireless systems is a difficult problem, often the <b>coarser</b> <b>metric</b> of degrees of freedom (DoF) is used to obtain first-order insights at high SNRs. We provide some insights into the benefits of CoMP by studying the DoF of interference channel with CoMP transmission and reception as a function of the transmit and receive cooperation orders...|$|R
