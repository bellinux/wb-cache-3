Widespread commercial acceptability of these machines depends upon their efficiency. This largely depends upon the geometric features of the <b>marine</b> <b>turbines</b> such as number of blades, shape of blades etc. Researchers have been using experimental facilities to optimise these machines for maximum power generation. With the advent of advanced computational techniques, it has now become possible to numerically simulate {{the flow of water}} in the vicinity of <b>marine</b> <b>turbines</b> and monitor their performance output. In this work Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been used to analyse the effects of number of blades within the stator and rotor, of an in-house built Vertical Axis <b>Marine</b> Current <b>Turbine</b> (VAMCT), on the performance output of the turbine. Furthermore, an effort has been put forward towards better understanding of the flow structure {{in the vicinity of the}} blades during transient interaction between rotor and stator blades. This study provides vital information with regards to the flow sensors’ requirements and placements in order to monitor various blade configurations of a VAMCT in real world. The results of this study show that the torque output from a VAMCT is a strong function of blade configurations and there is a significant degradation in the performance output of <b>marine</b> <b>turbines</b> as the inequality between the number of rotor and stator blades increases.

Indeed for submarine applications, drive train reliability is a key feature to reduce maintenance requirements.

40|$|In recent decades, {{the number}} of {{theoretical}} studies and applications on electric power production from renewable sources such as wind, solar, sea and tidal flows, has been increasing rapidly. Marine Current Turbines (MCTs), among the power turbines, produce power from alternating flows and are a means of power production even at lower flow rates in oceans and seas. In this study, while maintaining functional requirements, an initial and detailed design (mechanic and hydrodynamic), of an MCT fixed on a sailing boat and at sail which extracts power from the flow around the boat, is undertaken. In the design stages, for analysis and optimization of the <b>marine</b> <b>turbine</b> blade design, the Momentum Blade Element Method is utilized. The Horizontal Axis <b>Marine</b> <b>Turbine</b> (HAMT), determined by the initial and mechanical design, is illustrated with its components included. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses, covering turbine pod geometry at required flow rates and turbine speeds are performed. These analyses are performed very close to real conditions, considering sailing with and without the turbine running (on and off states). The alternator is determined from the results, and the final design which meets the design requirements, is obtained. As a result, a user friendly and innovative turbine design for sail boats, offering more power and efficiency, which is longer lasting compared to solar and wind technologies, that also makes use of renewable sources, such as wind and/or solar, and in addition stores and uses accumulated energy when needed, is proposed...|$|E
