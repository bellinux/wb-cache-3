After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now <b>makes</b> <b>money</b> with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian to admit he never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E

500|$|Rosenbloom's film {{differed}} from Naylor's novel in several key aspects. In the novel, Marty's family is poor and economic opportunities are limited. The family's four-room homestead is ancient {{and has not}} seen remodeling in decades. In the film, the family is wealthy and there are numerous economic opportunities. The family's two-story house is a [...] "stunning showplace of hardwoods, elegant color schemes, and tasteful appointments". Marty <b>makes</b> <b>money</b> very quickly by doing various chores. By transforming Marty's family from being poor to being well off, Rosenbloom makes the conflict between Marty and Judd an emotional, instead of an economic one. In the novel, Marty and his family hunt animals, while in the film, his father does not hunt. Author Timothy Morris states that [...] "he force of the film's ideology is to blur all distinctions between humans and animals". Judd is transformed from a native in the novel into an interloper in the film who holds the contrarian view that humans and animals are different, that [...] "nimals were put here for us. They ain' got no other purpose or feelin's." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxist academics {{are convinced}} that the statistical data show that profitability is falling, businessmen can often happily see their profits grow anyway, and have more real money in the bank. In theory they should have less money, but in practice they have more. That is because financial relationships between quantities of money (defined using a currency unit) can vary from the value proportions that exist between products or physical assets (defined in terms of the MELT, i.e. the monetary equivalent of labor time). If there is a significant drop in overall profitability, this will very likely also be reflected in data about the profit included in value-added, but that is only a rough indicator of the trend (the data quality may not be very great). Official statistics include in value-added only the net value of new production; if a business <b>makes</b> <b>money</b> simply from selling an asset it has, or from asset appreciation, this is not normally considered [...] "value-added", but property income. [...] If that was not the case, then any kind of business income (or just about any kind of income) would represent value-added. It does not.|$|E
2500|$|Free-to-play is newer {{than the}} pay to play model, and {{the video game}} {{industry}} is still attempting {{to determine the best}} ways to maximize revenue from their games. Gamers have cited the fact that purchasing a game for a fixed price is still inherently satisfying because the consumer knows exactly what they will be receiving, compared to free-to-play which requires that the player pay for most new content that they wish to obtain. The term itself, [...] "free-to-play", has been described as one with a negative connotation. One video game developer noted this, stating, [...] "Our hope—and the basket we're putting our eggs in—is that 'free' will soon be disassociated with [...] 'shallow' and 'cruddy'." [...] However, another noted that developing freeware games gave developers the largest amount of creative freedom, especially when compared to developing console games, which requires that the game follow the criteria as laid out by the game's publisher. Many kinds of revenue are being experimented with. For example, with its Free Realms game targeted to children and casual gamers, Sony <b>makes</b> <b>money</b> from the product with advertisements on loading screens, free virtual goods sponsored by companies such as Best Buy, a subscription option to unlock extra content, a collectible card game, a comic book, and micropayment items that include character customization options.|$|E
