The GIS based numerical simulation is validated by two study cases. First is the prediction of 21 -year of ground subsidence due to complex underground <b>mining</b> <b>geometry</b> in Japan. Second is the assessment of dynamic ground movement due to underground mining sequence in China. The tight coupling model, the component object model (COM) using GIS, is used to develop a GIS based tool for ground movement prediction system. Therefore in this paper, first, the fundamental calculation of ground movement over time using the Knothe time model and stochastic prediction model is briefly introduced. Second, a GIS-based prediction methodology for four-dimensional analysis is described. Third, two case studies are given for the validations the GIS-based computational model. Using GIS COM protocol, a computational implementation of the developed tool is discussed for prediction of 4 D ground subsidence from underground mining sequences. Finally, the computational system software of the developed tool within GIS is presented.|$|E

The study emphasises the effect of inter-panel lag on the development of mining-induced fractures which are considered a major contributor to hangingwall instability in geologically undisturbed ground. The geology and <b>mining</b> <b>geometry</b> at Western Deep Levels, Limited, particularly at the selected research site, is outlined.

The effects of inter-panel lag length on energy release rate are demonstrated and discussed.

The outcomes of an industry sponsored (ACARP) research project on the geotechnical issues associated with conventional longwall recoveries is presented with updates the experiences gained. A number of critical features of the geotechnical environment, support design and <b>mining</b> <b>geometry</b> have a pronounced impact on ground control during take-off. A model of roof behaviour at the take-off point has been developed and validated. Key geotechnical issues include low roof competency (ie weak roof), an adverse weighting environment, geological structure and horizontal stress concentrations at the gate ends (generally the maingate). All of these are identifiable either at the support design stage or, at worst, {{prior to the start}} of powered support removal, which is the critical stage of the take-off process. Key aspects of the geometry and process are the ability to maintain powered support resistance during bolt-up and take-off, the direction in which the powered supports are removed, the impact of take-off chutes and the speed of the powered support removal process.

30|$|In a 4 D {{numerical}} simulation of a mining area with multiple extraction panels {{in a complicated}} mining sequence, {{it is difficult to}} obtain the component distribution of ground subsidence with the current existing prediction methods. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} assess structural damage accurately. Numerical methods that could simulate the movement considering spatially and temporal processes are desirable for the reliable design of the mining layout in order to minimize structural damage. In considering the development of the computer-based prediction methodology, it is important to predict 4 D ground subsidence components at any point with any shape of excavation so as to cover a wide range of <b>mining</b> <b>geometry</b> as well as to provide automation, intellection, and visualization in the simulation of subsidence process. The recent development of geographical information systems (GIS) comprises a technology designed to support integrative modeling, to conduct interactive spatial analysis and for understanding various processes. In case of a progressive ground subsidence simulation during undermining, GIS would be effective and efficient in computing such 4 D ground movement and deformation if a prediction system could be properly developed. It also should be addressed that the GIS approach could result in an uncertain issue once it relies on just a small amount of information (Longoni et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|Why do {{some room}} and pillar retreat panels {{encounter}} abnormal conditions? What factors deserve the most consideration during the planning and execution phases of mining {{and what can be}} done to mitigate those abnormal conditions when they are encountered? To help answer these questions, and to determine some of the relevant factors influencing the conditions of {{room and pillar}} (R & P) retreat mining entries, four consecutive R & P retreat panels were evaluated. This evaluation was intended to reinforce the influence of topographic changes, depth of cover, multiple-seam interactions, geological conditions, and <b>mining</b> <b>geometry.</b> This paper details observations were made in four consecutive R & P retreat panels and the data were collected from an instrumentation site during retreat mining. The primary focus was on the differences observed among the four panels and within the panels themselves. The instrumentation study was initially planned to evaluate the interactions between primary and secondary support, but produced rather interesting results relating to the loading encountered under the current mining conditions. In addition to the observation and instrumentation, numerical modeling was performed to evaluate the stress conditions. Both the LaModel 3. 0 and Rocscience Phase 2 programs were used to evaluate these four panels. The results of both models indicated a drastic reduction in the vertical stresses experienced in these panels due to the full extraction mining in overlying seams when compared to the full overburden load. Both models showed a higher level of stress associated with the outside entries of the panels. These results agree quite well with the observations and instrumentation studies performed at the mine. These efforts provided two overarching conclusions concerning R & P retreat mine planning and execution. The first was that there are four areas that should not be overlooked during R & P retreat mining: topographic relief, multiple-seam stress relief, stress concentrations near the gob edge, and geologic changes in the immediate roof. The second is that in order to successfully retreat an R & P panel, a three-phased approach to the design and analysis of the panel should be conducted: the planning phase, evaluation phase, and monitoring phase.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{well-established}} empirical and mechanistic {{methods used to}} predict mine subsidence due to longwall mining. These methods can provide reliable predictions of vertical subsidence, tilt and the overall/macro curvature when properly calibrated to the local conditions. The prediction of horizontal movement and strain at the surface are much more difficult, as these parameters are sensitive to variations in the surface topography {{and the presence of}} near-surface geological structures, which can result in localised and elevated movements. Many existing predictive methods do not consider the potential for these irregular movements or are not capable of predicting such behaviour. Existing predictive methods often only provide a single predicted value of strain that represents the regular or general levels of strain. The irregular strains due to the effects of surface topography and near-surface geology can exceed the regular movements by factors of two to three times. Strain {{is also one of the}} most important parameters for assessing the potential for impacts on natural and built features on the surface. It is recognised in the industry that improved methods for the prediction of horizontal movement and strain are required to better assess the potential impacts on surface features. Predictive methods for strain have been developed through this research that consider the effects of the <b>mining</b> <b>geometry,</b> surface topography, near-surface lithology and the potential for irregular anomalous movement. These methods provide the range of potential strains, rather than a single predicted value, based on both the regular and irregular movements. The predicted distribution of strain provides better guidance on the magnitudes of the localised and elevated movements, which are often not considered in other existing methods. A large database of ground monitoring data from the Australian coalfields was available for this research. The methods have therefore been derived using an empirical approach supplemented with numerical modelling. Strain is predicted using a two-step process. Firstly, the net horizontal movements of the surface are predicted across each of the hogging and sagging curvature zones above the active longwall. The distributions of strain are then predicted within each of these zones based on these net horizontal movements. A predictive method has also been developed for shear deformation based on the parameter horizontal mid-ordinate deviation. The predictive equations for net horizontal movement, bay length difference and strain for the Southern Coalfield are provided in the appendices of this thesis. These methods can be applied to coalfields elsewhere in Australia and overseas by calibrating the coefficients for the local conditions using the available ground monitoring data. The proposed methods are an improvement on many existing empirical and mechanistic methods, as they consider the effects of surface topography, near-surface lithology and the potential for irregular anomalous movement. The mining-induced impacts on the natural and built features at the surface are often governed by the localised and elevated strains that develop from these effects...|$|E

40|$|Variations in {{overburden}} geology must {{be considered}} in applying subsidence prediction methodologies developed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). To characterize rock mass overlying high-extraction coal mines, the USBM utilizes a computer spreadsheet program and modified Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system. The spreadsheet calculates an RMR based on a bed's engineering properties determined from core logs and laboratory tests. An in situ deformation modulus and a bending stiffness are computed for each bed. Stiffness-versus-depth plots identify groups of beds with similar stiffness. Large variations in stiffness between adjacent beds are considered significant horizontal discontinuities where slip is likely. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is used to verify this hypothesis by measuring shear displacement along such discontinuities. A model of the overburden is built by assuming that a near-surface laminated beam exists above a transition zone in which large plastic slip occurs along horizontal discontinuities. Increasingly thicker groups of beds are modeled to determine the most probable beam thickness based on a comparison with measured deflection profiles.

40|$|Abstract: Two seams at the Tab-Simco {{abandoned}} underground {{coal mine}} site in southern Illinois were mined intermittently from the 1890 ’s until 1955, and later surface mined. The stripping operations resulted in several break-ins {{into the old}} underground works which were later buried by mine spoil. The resulting mine pool in the lower of the two seams has been producing an average of ~ 150 m 3 per day of acid mine drainage (AMD) {{for the past few}} decades. After exiting through the breakins, the contaminated water flows along discrete pathways through the base of the spoil and emerges as 5 perennial seeps. The AMD has contaminated a nearby stream and has produced a 4 ha “kill zone ” within its otherwise forested floodplain.

40|$|In {{the mining}} {{industry}} {{there are several}} methods to predict how the rock mass will behave. One of those methods is numerical analysis with modeling software, e. g. Finite Element Method (FEM). These numerical methods require good input parameters to yield good results. Today these models most likely consist of the <b>mine</b> <b>geometry</b> and a few different material property zones, like ore body and different zones between different lithologies. Since rock mass is not a homogeneous material {{this may not be}} sufficient to reproduce real conditions. A way to improve the model is to have more material property zones. A {{way to do that is}} to have more accurate input data. These data comes from testing drill cores. But it is time consuming and expensive to have extensive sampling campaigns. Solving that problem is geostatistics. With geostatistics a limited number of data points can be used to estimate material properties to areas that have little or none data points. In this thesis geostatistical estimation is performed on mechanical properties from bore hole data. A data set with information from Rana Gruber AS provided by Steinar Ellefmo was used as input. The geostatistical estimation method ordinary kriging was performed on the data in the software Surpac. Results from the estimation were then put in the numerical analysis software Phase 2.

40|$|The basic {{underlying}} {{mechanism for}} outburst initiation involves {{the expulsion of}} coal at a pressure gradient above a critical value which {{is directly related to}} the strength and porosity of the coal at the current state, and the composition (degree of gas saturation) of the pore fluid. Coal strength, porosity, stress, gas pressure and pressure gradient are important for outburst initiation. Permeability and rate of desorption can be important for outburst evolution by controlling the amount of gas that would become available to drive an outburst. The severity of an outburst depends on gas pressure, the hydrodynamic force, the strength and toughness of the coal, and the amount of free gas that becomes available during an outburst. For the same pressure gradient, the degree of violence is greater for weaker and more friable coal. Outburst propensity can be reduced by changing the method of <b>mining,</b> <b>mine</b> <b>geometry,</b> and the preventive and control measures adopted by the mines. The relative importance of the various factors and parameters will depend on the conditions of individual mines. As the interaction among the various processes and factors leading to outburst can be very complex, it is necessary to treat the coal-rock-stress-structure-gas interaction as a system. For outburst prediction, one approach is to use a numerical model that can model the individual processes and their interactions. This paper lists some of conclusions that have been derived from the results of the laboratory experiments and the modelling studies conducted to date and describes how the model can be used to help a particular mine assess outburst proneness and the potential risks, and to identify the critical factors for the purpose of outburst control and management. Based on the assessed risk and the degree of uncertainty, one may choose complete prevention or suitable control and management measures, without undermining safety which is one of the most important considerations...|$|R

The data for analysis was collected during 2 months {{of research at the}} Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Ltd. Callinan Mine in Flin Flon, Manitoba, a few trips to the Cameco Rabbit Lake mine in northern Saskatchewan, and 3 years of research and employment at the Xstrata Zinc George Fisher mine near Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. Other sites visited, where substantial stope stability knowledge was accessed include the Inco Thompson mines in northern Manitoba; BHP Cannington mine, Xstrata Zinc Lead Mine, and Xstrata Copper Enterprise Mine, in Queensland, Australia; and the Kazzinc Maleevskiy Mine in north-eastern Kazakhstan. An improved understanding of stability and design of open stope HWs was developed based on: 1) 	Three years of data collection from various rock masses and <b>mining</b> <b>geometries</b> to develop new sets of design lines for an existing HW stability assessment method; 2) 	The consideration of various scales of domains to examine HW rock mass behaviour and development of a new HW stability assessment method; 3) 	The investigation of the HW failure mechanism using analytical and numerical methods; 4) 	An examination of the effects of stress, undercutting, faulting, and time on stope HW stability through the presentation of observations and case histories; and 5) 	Innovative stope design techniques to manage predicted stope HW instability. An observational approach was used for the formulation of the new stope design methodology. To improve mine performance by reducing and/or controlling the HW rock from diluting the ore with non-economic material, the individual stope design methodology included creating vertical HWs, leaving ore skins or chocks where appropriate, and rock mass management.

40|$|Determination of {{the optimum}} mine layout {{is one of}} the {{important}} tasks in mine planning. In the case of open pit mines, a large number of algorithms using a range of techniques have been developed to generate the true optimum solution. Several commercial computer packages are available to assist mining engineers design open pits. In contrast, only a few algorithms, using limited techniques, have been developed to optimise the stope geometry in underground operations. Most of which fail to provide optimum 3 D solutions. A heuristic algorithm, termed the 2 ̆ 2 Maximum Value Neighbourhood 2 ̆ 2 (MVN) was developed in this thesis to optimise stope boundaries. The MVN algorithm benefits from its simplicity in both concept and implementation. It provides a 3 D analysis and can be applied to any underground mining method, although it does not guarantee the true 2 ̆ 2 optimum 2 ̆ 2 stope layout. The MVN algorithm uses a 3 D fixed economic block model to locate the best neighbourhood of a block, which guarantees the maximum net value. Neighbourhoods are restricted by the <b>mine</b> <b>geometry</b> constraints. The neighbourhood concept is {{based on the number of}} mining blocks equivalent to the minimum stope size. Since a variety of neighbourhoods are available for each block, the one that provides the maximum net value (the maximum value neighbourhood, MVN) is located for inclusion in the final stope.

The features examined are: reclaimed <b>mine</b> <b>geometry,</b> relative transmissivity between the reclaimed spoil and the surrounding unmined coal bed aquifer, anisotropy, the gravity sorted rubble layer, coal wedges left between trench cuts, and the position and size of an operational mine in the regional flow system. A finite element computer model was used to simulate the groundwater flow field from three frames of reference: a local plan view of the mine site (local hydrology), a cross sectional view of flow through the reclaimed mine interior (interior flow), and a cross sectional view of a regional flow system (regional hydrology). The simulation model solved for the piezometric head distribution in each system. For each simulation the piezometric head contours were plotted, and in some cases, the increase in flux induced by the mine properties, and the contact time of water passing through the reclaimed spoil were calculated. Although only {{the flow of water}} through the spoil was modeled, water quality effects were inferred through a set of indices dealing with the reclaimed mine size and amount of water passing through it. The effects of a reclaimed mine were studied in the local and interior flow simulations. The influence of an operational mine was examined in the regional simulation. In all cases, the long term impacts were simulated by solving for the steady state condition. Regional location is found {{to be the most important}} factor in {{the influence of}} an operational mine on groundwater resources. Relative transmissivity is the most important factor in determining the influence of a reclaimed mine. When present, the rubble layer dominates the flow pattern through the mine spoil. The coal wedges are apparently of little hydrologic consequence. Equidimensional mine shapes are preferred to elongated shapes because they induce the least amount of flow through the spoil per unit extracted coal.

This research is designed to develop a scientific understanding of airflow distribution in room-and-pillar mining areas that is fundamental to developing engineering controls. The overall goal {{of the study is}} to develop improved engineering controls to minimize dust exposure of mine workers in the face area. Dust exposure can be a health hazard in underground coal mining industry based on historical data of coal workers 2 ̆ 7 pneumoconiosis among underground mine workers. Current regulatory dust exposure standards of 1. 5 mg/m 3, averaged over an 8 -hour period, have been recently revised with approval of new MSHA standards in April of 2014. Mining companies are currently seeking new technologies in order to comply with the new dust standards. Since <b>mining</b> <b>geometries</b> are complex and do not lend themselves to closed-form analytical solutions, CFD numerical modeling approach was used to develop an understanding of airflow distribution in the face areas. Since previous studies had focused on some cuts in mining heights of less than 2. 4 m (8 -ft), this study was performed for high mining areas of 4. 2 m (14 -ft). Such mining heights are very common in longwall mine development areas, particularly in the State of Illinois. The primary goal was to identify major differences in airflow between the two mining heights and how they affect development of engineering controls for minimizing dust exposure. Simulations were done using ANSYS software such as DesignModeler for modeling and meshing and FLUENT for calculations. Recirculation (RC) and low air velocity (LAV) zones were located for straight deep cut, straight deepest cut, cross-cut right, cross-cut right mine through, left turn cross-cut, and left turn cross-cut mine through for low mining height (LMH) and high mining height (HMH) with varying air quantity {{at the end of the}} line curtain (ELC). Air at the ELC was adjusted to achieve a ratio of 0. 85, 1. 00 and 1. 15 over the wet scrubber fan (WSF) discharge capacity. Results show that the air velocity in HMH case is much lower than for the LMH. In addition, the location of RC and LAV zones differ based on mining height and air quantity at the ELC. Furthermore, lower air quantity at the ELC causes the air exhausted by the WSF to recirculate back to the face area in order to satisfy the WSF requirement. Recommendations to deal with these differences are formulated...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{contained}} in underground flooded mine workings is actively exploited, often via heat pump technology, {{at a number}} of locations in Europe and North America. Several different heat exchange configurations may be utilised in this context, but for those (“standing column” and “open loop” arrangements) where mine water reinjection is practised, the rate of heat transfer between mine walls and mine water is a critical process to quantify. The two most commonly-used analytical solutions to this problem have been applied to the same baseline scenario, exploring and comparing their sensitivity, strengths, weaknesses and areas of application. It is found that the Rodríguez- Díaz solution generally predicts heat transfer rates (typically of the order of several tens of W per m of tunnel) greater than the Lauwerier-Pruess-Bodvarsson approach, the difference being {{due to the fact that}} the former assumes a radial heat conductive flow geometry in the rock surrounding the mine void, while the latter assumes a less efficient parallel linear flow. The Rodríguez-Díaz solution is more appropriate for approximately cylindrical mine shafts and tunnels. The Lauwerier-Pruess-Bodvarsson approach is more likely to be applicable to tabular <b>mined</b> void <b>geometries.</b> Improvements to the Rodríguez and Díaz model are proposed to enhance its transparency and applicability...|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{a casing}} design model is {{introduced}} to design casing strings for a gas {{well in the}} longwall mining area for production from the Marcellus shale. The stress/strain data are obtained using numerical modeling of ground. The data used in the completion design are obtained by using a query function, which lists the calculated parameters along a vertical line representing the gas well. The stress/strain data obtained from modeling {{are used in the}} background spreadsheet for casing design and are not accessible by users. Also, the horizontal displacement observed from the FEA model needs to be considered in the casing design modeling. For <b>mining</b> <b>geometries</b> other than the one set forth, background stress and strain data need {{to be added to the}} spreadsheet prior to undertaking casing design. There are five types of casing to be used in gas well completion in the longwall mining areas. This system was included in the base casing/completion design model. The casings include: drive pipe, aquifer casing, coal protection casing, intermediate casing, and production casing. The model is built into a spreadsheet and allows an interactive design by changing the input parameters and shows the resulting casing and well completion design parameters. Figure  7 displays the interface of inputs in this model. In the case considered in this study, the coal seam depth is fixed to 200  m (660 – 670 ft). The depth of groundwater can be varied to between 60 and 120  m (200 – 400 ft). Through the input interface in this model, users are also allowed to input safety factors, which are used to quantify the minimum strength of all casings. Then by selecting the “read safety factors” and corresponding buttons, the user can see the results for various casing sizes. Users are able to click the “start over” button to erase all input data and calculated results, and retype other groups of data as needed. For the selection of casing, four tables of casings with various minimum performance properties were put at the right side of the buttons with the name of casings. After the initial setting and data entry, the model automatically selects proper casing size and grade for the aquifer casing, coal protection casing, intermediate casing, and drive pipe. Then, the numbers of available casings will appear in the “Results” column on the left side of the input data for manual selection of feasible casings for the given geometric and ground conditions. As noted before, if the geometry of the longwall panels, including the depth, width of the panel and size of the pillars change, numerical modeling has to be performed to revise the background data on stresses and strain that should be used in the wellbore completion design program.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} the major metalliferous mining {{companies}} with interest in caving mining methods are currently {{at different stages of}} design and planning of what could arguably be classed as a new generation of much larger scale block and panel cave operations referred to by some as Supercaves. Some of these future operations, expected to be producing in the next 5 to 10 years, are in deposits or geological systems which are located at much greater depths than current, in even more challenging geotechnical and therefore mining environments characterised by strong rock masses i. e. primary rocks, and in higher stress regimes. These conditions, combined, are likely to impose greater technical and mining challenges and therefore risks in terms of the caving processes (caving mechanics including seismicity), cave establishment (ramp-up time) and subsequent production (fragmentation and stability issues). In order to mitigate such potential risks, rock mass preconditioning techniques are increasingly being integrated by some companies into mine design and planning even for current “conventional” cave <b>mining</b> <b>geometries.</b> To date preconditioning using hydraulic fracturing in particular has been implemented and reported to produce measurable and positive outcomes even though there is still on-going debate on the real impact of preconditioning with respect to cave mining performance. This paper describes a proposed methodology for evaluation of the preconditioning by blasting exercise at the Newcrest Mining Limited’s Cadia East (CE) panel cave mine. This was part of a full scale “blasting” preconditioning trial conducted as {{the first of a series}} of planned panel caves in the Cadia East (CE) mining complex in New South Wales, Australia. The full scale trials formed part of a technology exchange agreement between Newcrest Mining Ltd. and Codelco-Chile. This paper describes a proposed methodology for evaluation of the preconditioning by blasting. The methodology uses a numerical model of the blasting process designated as the Hybrid Stress Blasting Model or HSBM which in its current form of development is best described as an advanced research tool. However the HSBM has unique features which qualify it as an effective tool to quantify the level and extent of damage around blastholes detonated in a fully confined environment (rock mass). The in-situ stress state of the blast volume is taken into account including the actual blasthole timing and initiation uses. The trials incorporated the use of acoustic televiewer (ATV) images of borehole walls, tri-axial accelerometers, cross-hole seismic tomography and acoustic emission tri-axial tests of core samples collected pre and post blasting. This was to also provide data to quantify the effect of the confined blasting preconditioning. This paper only focuses on the application of the HSBM model as a viable pathway for the quantification of preconditioning by blasting. The actual data to quantify the impacts of the preconditioning were not available at the time of submission of this paper...|$|R

40|$|The precise {{formulation}} of a geometallurgical optimisation problem is by necessity a simplification of reality. It includes implicit choices such as data availability or <b>mining</b> block <b>geometry.</b> Additional {{data can be}} orebody data, production data or market data. Often these choices are predetermined by the software, the workflow or the corporate culture, and as such are not even queried. There are several aspects that might {{play a role in}} the optimisation. They include not only the spatial model on which the selection of mining blocks and the potential mining sequence are based, but also the complexity of the processing model, the way in which uncertainty is treated, the scope of responsibility and the complexity of the model. In addition the timing of the optimisation and the availability (or lack thereof) of information will influence the outcome of any optimisation. We show that different modelling choices and different model formulations for the same mine can lead to very different processing choices, substantially different net present values (NPV), opposite investment decisions and so to overall different values for the entire operation. The selection of adequate simplifications and corresponding formulations for the optimisation problem is thus an important task in itself. For this purpose we introduce a method for quantifying the impact of certain simplifications prior to the optimisation. For example, the effect of mining block choices depends mainly on the spatial structure and the structure of the processing gain function. Both can be quantified beforehand. Based on the outcome, appropriate simplifications can be selected for the geometallurgical optimisation...|$|R
40|$|The Garpenberg mine, {{owned and}} {{operated}} by Boliden Mineral, has conducted tests of rill mining in the Dammsjön orebody to increase production. Dammsjön is a steeply dipping orebody surrounded by limestone on the hangingwall side and a quartzitic rock on the footwall side. The rill mining test was conducted on the 753 meters level and had a bench height of approximately 10 meters. Monitoring data obtained during the rill mining provided an opportunity to create a numerical model representing the real rock mass. The model could be calibrated to replicate the behavior observed in the monitoring data. As a first part of this thesis work, analyzes of the monitoring data showed that the problem could be considered two-dimensional (2 D). A 2 D model was created in the numerical code FLAC. The model was calibrated, in terms of material parameters of the rock mass and mechanical parameters of the contact zones between them, to replicate the rock mass behavior observed in the real rock mass. The desired behavior included (i) deformational pattern, (ii) magnitudes of deformations and (iii) relationships between the magnitudes of roof and wall deformations. A three-dimensional (3 D) model was also created in the numerical code FLAC 3 D. The model is an extension of the 2 D model in the third dimension and represents the real test mining sequence. The 3 D model was used to verify the behavior of the rock mass in three dimensions. The 3 D model also includes ground support in terms of rock bolts installed in the drifts {{in the same manner as}} in the real mining operation. In future work, the bolted 3 D model may be calibrated against the observed bolt failures of the test mining to further increase the reliability of the model. Two sets of material parameters were determined that made the model replicate the desired behavior. The calibrated 2 D model was finally used to investigate alternative geometrical cases of rill mining that the mine expects to encounter in future mining. The investigation included ore widths of 8, 12 and 16 meters with bench heights of 10, 12 and 15 meters, respectively. Analyzes were also conducted regarding four consecutive levels of rill mining with the same nine geometric cases as above. The investigations included analyzes of deformation, stress redistribution, yielding, and sliding along the ore – host rock contacts. The mine strives for failed rill benches before extraction in terms of destressing, but without collapse. The recommended bench heights for conducting rill mining under the conditions of this study are: (i) for 8 meters wide orebodies, bench heights of 10 meters or lower are required to ensure failed benches before excavation, and (ii) for 12 and 16 meters wide orebodies, bench heights of 15 meters are possible, while still having failed benches to extract. The analyzes of alternative <b>mining</b> <b>geometries</b> showed that roof displacement increased with increased bench height, but decreased with increased ore width, wall displacement increased with increased bench height, but decreased with increased ore width and sliding along the ore – host rock contacts increased with increased bench height, but decreased with increased ore width.

40|$|SUPPLEMENT : RESTRICTED (not {{available}} on-line) Coal {{is being}} mined from seams which lie beneath urban {{areas around the}} City of Newcastle, New South Wales, under nearby Lake Macquarie and the Pacific Ocean. Subsidence {{occurs as a result}} of pillar extraction or longwall mining and homes and other structures or surface features can be affected. Detailed field surveys commenced in the late 19602 ̆ 7 s in the coalfields north and south of Sydney. This work was developed and extended by the author in order to provide the basic information which was used to develop a method of subsidence prediction. Because of the large quantity of results, several computer programmes were designed to handle the calculations, filing and data manipulation from the field booking sheets to the presentation of calculated results from the computer. Detailed analyses of the results of these surveys have enabled the relationship between the <b>geometry</b> of <b>mine</b> workings and the subsidence at the surface to be established for the particular geological environments. This research has shown that the massive and strong conglomerates of the Newcastle area {{have a significant effect on}} the value of the maximum subsidence. For the lower range of widths of extraction, the investigations showed that the nature of the caving of the roof strata over the mined seam influenced the magnitude of the surface subsidence. Subsidence in Newcastle was shown to be significantly less than what would be experienced in areas of mainly argillaceous strata such as in the United Kingdom because of their different caving properties and strata deformation characteristics. On the basis of a theoretical subsidence prediction method developed for the Newcastle area by the author using the survey, geological and mining information, panel and pillar mining layouts are now designed for maximum coal recovery consistent with small values of maximum subsidence. With the aid of these locally established guidelines, longwall extraction is now taking place beneath the Pacific Ocean, Lake Macquarie and areas of surface development along their shorelines. The research showed that, in the Newcastle District, subsidence develops in four stages as the ratio of the width of extraction w to the depth of cover h increases for panels of critical or supercritical length. Extraction layouts with subcritical w/h values up to 0. 55 result in a slight undulation of the surface and it is within this range that panel and pillar extraction layouts have been designed for protection of structures on the surface. Where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 55 and less than 0. 65, a pronounced subcritical subsidence trough develops. For extraction layouts where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 65 the maximum subsidence increases rapidly as the conglomerate within the strata fails to support itself over the increasingly wide panel. The subsidence reaches its maximum possible value at a critical w/h value of around 1. 3. In the supercritical range above 1. 3 the maximum subsidence is 0. 65 of the seam height mined. The research also revealed the factors which influenced the maximum subsidence such as the recovery of coal from the seam mined, the caving of the roof strata, whether other seams have been mined, the presence of significant faulting and the stability of pillars which remain between or adjacent to extracted panels. Other features of subsidence profiles in Newcastle studied in relation to the <b>mine</b> <b>geometry</b> were the shape of the subsidence profile, the various relationships between subsidence, slope change, curvature and strain, and the time-subsidence relationships. It was also discovered that the travelling slopes and strains above an advancing face are significantly less than the final static values over the end of the panel. Strain triangles were used to investigate the magnitudes and directions of the maximum and minimum principal strains. The principles developed as a result of the author 2 ̆ 7 s research work are unique to the Newcastle district north of Sydney where they are now used as a predictive tool in the control of mine subsidence...|$|R
