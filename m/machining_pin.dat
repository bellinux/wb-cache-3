Several automation tools {{in term of}} hardware and software are necessary for successfully remote operation of a machine. This paper presents a prototype of workpiece holding attachment for remote operation of milling process by self configuration the workpiece setup. The prototype is designed with mechanism to reorient the work surface into machining spindle direction with high positioning accuracy. Variety of parts geometry is hold by attachment to perform single setup <b>machining.</b> <b>Pin</b> type with array pattern additionally clamps the workpiece surface from two opposite directions for increasing the machining rigidity. Optimum pins configuration for conforming the workpiece geometry with minimum deformation is determined through hybrid algorithms, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Prototype with intelligent optimization technique enables to hold several variety of workpiece geometry which is suitable for machining low of repetitive production in remote operation...|$|E

30|$|Guard rails were {{installed}} over {{the length of}} the track bridge to prevent wheel derailment. The addition of the guard rails also had the effect of stiffening the frame made up of the rails and bearer bars, thereby limiting lateral movement of the rails under train passage. The guard rails were continuous across the CESuRa system, connected to the bearer bars using <b>machined</b> <b>pins,</b> and connected to the guard rail of the adjacent span through a sliding mechanism. These provisions were meant to limit the frame action contribution of the guard rails in order to promote distributed curvature of the track-rail frame under yaw movements while also accommodating surge movements.|$|R

25|$|Big Machine and Super Machine {{wrestled}} {{the majority}} of the matches against Bobby Heenan's cronies, occasionally with Lou Albano joining them to face Bundy, Studd and Heenan in six man tag-team action. Soon, other masked wrestlers (whose identities were generally obvious) appeared and temporarily teamed with The Machines. On September 10, Big and Super Machine were joined by Animal Machine to defeat King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd and Bobby Heenan. On September 16 the Machines were joined by Hulk Machine as the trio defeated the Heenan Family. The Hulk Machine returned on September 22 and helped the Machines win in the main event at the Madison Square Garden. A few weeks later the Machines received help from the kilt-wearing Piper Machine. On a house show in St. Paul, Minnesota the Machines even got the help of Crusher <b>Machine,</b> <b>pinning</b> John Studd to gain the victory for his team. On October 28, The Machines wrestled their last match under that gimmick, a loss to Bundy and Studd. This also marked the last appearance as a manager in the WWF for Lou Albano.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a concept for a pinning process and the associated machinery to handle odd-form pins specific to a company in the surface mount electronics industry. The developed <b>pinning</b> <b>machine</b> will reduce manual labor requirements, increase flexibility over current automated systems, and allow for greater part traceability. A brief history of industrial automation is presented to establish a background of the industry, followed by a more detailed look at robotic tooling. The design of the automated <b>pinning</b> <b>machine</b> is described in detail, as well as the design methodology behind the sub-systems and components themselves. Finally, the performance of the machine is documented in a testing chapter, comparing machine performance to the original design specifications. The final <b>pinning</b> <b>machine</b> is capable of processing pins with cycle times of 850 ms, and has a mean time to failure of 0. 24 hours. by Daniel J. Cook. Thesis (M.

40|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide for neutralising pulp mill black liquor {{residuals}} and controlling paper machine stock pH has increased dramatically over the past decade. It is replacing, or supplementing, alum and sulfuric acid as the chemical of choice {{because it does not}} add any metal or sulfate ions to the water system; an important consideration with the trend to closed loop water systems in paper mills. However, dissolved and entrained gases can create production problems and paper quality faults at the wet end of the paper <b>machine.</b> <b>Pin</b> holes (where there’s a bubble of gas, there no fibre!), drainage loss and poor formation are some of the more noticeable impacts on paper quality, whilst sheet breaks and pump cavitation can create runability problems. Entrained gases in stock systems have historically been due to mechanical inclusion of air in falling stock, leaky pump glands and poor piping design. Air has a limited solubility in water (~ 120 mg/L), whilst carbon dioxide has a solubility of 1450 mg/L in water at 25 OC and 1 atm. pressure. Thus carbon dioxide can create up to 12 times more dissolved gas than air, which will erupt out of solution when the stock pressure is reduced to one atmosphere as occurs at the flowbox slice. So while entrained air was a minor annoyance, entrained carbon dioxide can be a major problem. Up until now, the method for measuring entrained gas yielded a total entrained gas result and did not distinguish between air and carbon dioxide. Recent developments have resulted in a new test procedure which allows the measurement of both total gases and CO 2. The method is simple, fast and reproducible as long as the carbon dioxide pressure-solubility ratio is borne in mind – i. e. correct sampling is a critical step in obtaining accurate results. This paper discusses the development of the test method and the background chemistry {{of carbon dioxide}} addition to paper machine stock systems...|$|R
