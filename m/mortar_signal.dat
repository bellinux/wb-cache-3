50|$|National Service (conscription of 20-year-olds by ballot) was {{introduced}} by the Menzies government in November 1964 and operated until December 1972. During this period, the regiment provided an alternative form of military service for university students. SUR during this period consisted of four rifle companies, a recruit-training company and an HQ and support company. The support company provided <b>mortar,</b> <b>signal,</b> pioneer and transport platoons. This {{was a period of}} increasing student activism and, in particular, protests against conscription and Australia's participation in the Vietnam War. In May 1969, protesting students confronted a guard of honour for Sir Roden Cutler VC, who was honorary colonel of the regiment and governor of NSW.|$|E

As of October 2016, TGT-3 had trained approximately 6,000 Iraqi Army soldiers, many of whom {{took part in the}} Battle of Mosul. During TGT-3's rotation, the Australian Government changed its policy regarding where and whom Australian forces are authorised to train in Iraq. Not only are Australian forces permitted to train Iraqi Army, but Iraqi Security Forces in general, including Federal Police at various sites including the Taji Military Complex and other secure Coalition bases in Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|By 1982 the {{regiment}} had grown {{once more to}} about 600 members as it began recruiting {{from a number of}} different universities including Griffith University, the Queensland Institute of Technology and the Brisbane College of Advance Education. Two years later, {{the regiment}} consisted of a regimental headquarters, two rifle companies, a training company, support company (<b>mortars,</b> <b>signals,</b> demonstration and employment platoons and intelligence section), and an administration company, with an authorised strength of 540 personnel. On 12 July 1986, the regiment exercised the Freedom to Enter the City of Brisbane and paraded before the Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson; later that year it exercised {{for the first time in}} Shoalwater Bay, deploying by air. The late 1980s saw a period of change as the regiment lost its mortar and machine-gun platoons and the way in which officer training was delivered in the regiment was changed. Instead of having officer trainees serve in the ranks and then as NCOs prior to commissioning a new system required such members to be [...] "appointed" [...] as officer cadets. This resulted in a reduction in the number of soldiers and NCOs in the regiment and the requirement to establish a new mess.|$|R

5|$|Following the British request, the Australian Government {{decided on}} 15 February 1917 to {{establish}} a 6th Division in the United Kingdom. The first element of this division, the 16th Brigade, was formed soon afterwards, with most of its personnel being soldiers recovering in the UK from illness or wounds. As the AIF units in France were at or above their authorised strength at this time, officers and non-commissioned officers were also transferred from the five existing divisions to the new unit. A 17th Brigade and several machine gun, <b>mortar,</b> engineer, <b>signal</b> and sanitary units were subsequently established within the 6th Division. While no officer was appointed to command the division, Brigadier General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan and Brigadier General John Gellibrand were designated for this role at different times.|$|R
50|$|Setting-up {{the radar}} {{involved}} orientating it in a known azimuth (the basic mounting could cover an arc of 4800 mils) {{and setting the}} datum beam elevation between -90 and 360 mils {{so that it was}} above the radar horizon. Other beam positions, 25, 40, 45, 65 and 90 mils were relative to this datum. The lowest beam position was used to alert the operator that a bomb was in flight and where to expect it on his screen; once alerted he tilted the beam into the first position and then into the next. The angles were pre-selected according to the local circumstances. Data memory was also available, although in British service this was normally only fitted to Cymbeline Mk 2; in essence it recorded the detected <b>mortar</b> bomb <b>signal</b> and allowed it to be replayed.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the finest}} cannon were given out by the Sultans of Brunei as part of ceremonies (such as birthdays or weddings) of the many princes and princesses of the {{extended}} Royal family.

5000|$|... 5 RAR's {{involvement}} in Afghanistan began modestly in October 2008 {{when one of}} the Battalion's mortar sections deployed with the 7 RAR battle group to conduct operations in Uruzugan Province. The deployment of an infantry-led battle group - at this time known as Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force Two (MRTF 2) - marked a change away from the engineer-led reconstruction activities begun in 2006 towards a wider range of operations, especially building the capacity of the Afghan National Army. The deployment also marked {{the first time that a}} mortar section from the Battalion fired high explosive rounds to support friendly troops in contact since the Vietnam War. A larger commitment followed in September 2010 when, as part of the evolving mission, 5 RAR deployed as Mentoring Task Force Two (MTF-2). The 5 RAR battle group was one of two units that made up the main fighting force of what was effectively a small coalition brigade called Combined Team Uruzgan (CTU). The U.S. 1-2 Stryker Regiment initially served in CTU with 5 RAR until March 2011 when it was replaced by the U.S. 4-70 Armoured Regiment.

Following the arrival of German forces in North Africa, the British were pushed onto the defensive and they were forced to withdraw from Benghazi to the strategic port of Tobruk, which subsequently fell under siege; the 2/13th formed part of the rearguard during the withdrawal during which it gained the distinction of being the first Australian Army unit to see action against the Germans, [...] fighting a short, but sharp delaying action at Er Regima on 4 April 1941 against a force three times their size.

These colours were black over light blue, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart.|$|R
