5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the upper atmosphere. Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, Giolitti {{acknowledged}} {{the need to}} stifle the agitation. From May 1893 onwards, leaders of the Fasci were arrested occasionally and police and military reinforcements were sent to Sicily. In the autumn of 1893 the leadership lost control over the Fasci and the popular agitation got out of hand. Peasant squatters seized land, violent crowds demonstrated for work and against local misgovernment, tax offices were burnt down and clashes with the police grew <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> bloody. The violent social conflict almost rose {{to the point of}} insurrection. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E
5|$|The few impact craters on Triton {{are almost}} all {{concentrated}} in the leading hemisphere—that facing {{the direction of the}} orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude, resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune. Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer impacts on its trailing hemisphere, due to impacts on the leading hemisphere being <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> more violent. Voyager 2 imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|The volcano also erupted phreatically several times, as {{recorded}} by Vogel in 1913 and 1920, with its activity increasing from 1916 to 1926. During these years, the eruptions grew <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> more violent. A major outburst on November 2, 1927 started {{a period of}} nearly continuous violent eruptions that lasted until 1929. During this period, Cerro Azul sometimes erupted daily, sending columns of ash as far as 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air. Quizapu Crater grew slightly during this eruptive period.|$|E
5|$|To {{some degree}} the {{movement}} has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has been changed to contain <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> favorable mention of aborigines. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed aboriginal/Han parents.|$|E
5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold air from the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold air from the south. Thus, invasions of cold air from the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold air from the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 WHO {{publication}} {{was highly}} influential in causing widespread {{changes in the}} practices and prevalence of institutional care for infants and children, and in changing practices relating to the stays of small children in hospitals so that parents were allowed <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> longer visits. Although the monograph was primarily concerned with the removal of children from their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen. The publication was also highly controversial with, amongst others, psychoanalysts, psychologists and learning theorists, and sparked significant debate and research {{on the issue of}} children's early relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 2020, the Jaeger Gipsy Danger, piloted by {{brothers}} Raleigh and Yancy Beckett, defends Anchorage {{from the}} Kaiju Knifehead. They both engage in combat, with Gipsy gaining {{the upper hand}} and defeating the Kaiju by blasting it with its plasma cannon. Unknown to them, the Kaiju is still alive. Knifehead then reemerges, ambushes them, critically damages Gipsy Danger by severing its left arm and throws Yancy out of the cockpit, killing him. Raleigh manages to pilot Gipsy alone, activating the remaining plasma cannon and finally killing Knifehead. Traumatized by Yancy’s death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program. In 2025, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers, in favor of building massive coastal walls, but the Kaiju are growing more powerful, their attacks <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they are built. The remaining four Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong {{under the command of}} Marshal Stacker Pentecost, who plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying The Breach using a nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>and</b> intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E

40|$|Hyperglycemia and glucose {{intolerance}} are common manifestations of perioperative stress in many hospitalized patients. Diabetic patients have <b>more</b> <b>frequent,</b> <b>more</b> prolonged, <b>and</b> more expen-sive hospital admissions {{that result in}} increased morbidity and mortality than nondiabetics. Diabetic patients also require <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> surgical inter-ventions <b>and</b> are more often admitted to the inten-sive care unit (ICU). Moreover, {{it is common for}} even nondiabetic surgical and ICU patients to develop acute hyperglycemia during stress. This hyperglycemia is mediated by the release of proin-flammatory cytokines (e. g., TNF-alpha and IL- 6) and elevated concentrations of catecholamines, growth hormone, glucagon, and glucocorticoids. ...|$|R
