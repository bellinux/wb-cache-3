He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

Ghosts and various supernatural entities form {{an integral part of the}} socio-cultural beliefs of the both Hindu and Muslim communities of rural Bengal. Fairy tales often use the concept of ghost and references to paranormal activities are found amply in modern-day Bengali literature, cinema, radio and TV programmes.|$|E

The event was still fresh in the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of New York, and the Protestant men of Buffalo felt threatened, increasing their strong objection to the educated, Catholic females who were running a now-state funded hospital. Buffalo's elite began speaking out against the Sisters Hospital and its state funding, criticizing its all-female leadership, lack of physicians' influence in decision making, and small staff. In early February 1850, Protestant doctors Josiah Trowbridge, Austin Flint, and James White privately complained to Lord, possibly Buffalo's most influential citizen at the time, about {{the administration of the}} hospital, arguing that three Sisters alone was not proper for the management of an entire hospital. He was enraged, seeing it not only as a religious threat but a political concern.|$|E

500|$|Shahin's rise {{generally}} confused the Ottoman {{government because}} Shahin used the Tanzimat to legitimize his revolt. The Ottomans {{did not consider}} the religious equality called for by the Tanzimat reforms to translate into class equality, which is how Shahin interpreted it. Moreover, the Ottomans did not countenance that a semi-literate Arabic-speaking peasant from a rural region such as Keserwan {{would serve as a}} representative of the Tanzimat. They reacted to Shahin's revolt negatively, although the provincial Ottoman authorities of Beirut generally felt powerless to act against the peasant rebels due to a lack of funds and forces on the ground. Khurshid Pasha sympathized more with the Khazen sheikhs and in a letter to the Patriarchate accused Shahin of using [...] "deceit to lead astray the <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> and to seduce them into following his evil ways". The principal focus of the Ottoman authorities in Lebanon was containing Shahin's revolt. However, later historians of Lebanon accused Khurshid Pasha of at least tacitly supporting Shahin in order to break communal solidarity.|$|E

[...] He, along with other pre-Dominion magistrates and some members of Andros' council, addressed an open letter to Andros on that day calling for his surrender in order to quiet the mob.
