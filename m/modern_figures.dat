500|$|The high humidity, {{temperatures}} and weather patterns of Sydney increased {{the strength of}} the storm. The cost of damages from the storm were, at the time, approximately GB£750,000 (US$3million); this is the equivalent of around A$45million in <b>modern</b> <b>figures.</b> The supercell dropped hailstones larger than [...] in diameter, with the most significant damage occurring in the central business district and eastern suburbs of Sydney.|$|E
500|$|Early antiquarians {{associated}} {{the figure}} with a Saxon god whose name contained some {{variant of the}} element Hel-. This god is attested in several medieval and early modern texts, and {{was associated with the}} Cerne Abbas Giant by an editor of a 1789 edition of William Camden's Britannia and by William Stukeley, who indicated that locals referred to the giant as [...] "Helis". A Saxon origin is unlikely, but Stukeley was also the first to hypothesize that the figure was Hercules, a suggestion that has found more support. Some 19th-century sources describe the giant as having [...] "between his legs, three rude letters, scarcely legible, and over them in <b>modern</b> <b>figures,</b> 748", (rude meaning [...] "roughly cut") and being the representation of Cenric, the son of Cuthred, King of Wessex.|$|E

This is approximately equal to A$45million in <b>modern</b> <b>figures,</b> placing it well below the costliest natural disasters in Australian history; this, given the severity of the storm cell, is attributable mainly to the relative inexpensiveness of buildings and other items of the era. More definite historical accounts exist for damage caused to certain buildings. The historic skylight which runs through the centre of the main Central railway station building was smashed, and the shards reportedly fell in sizes up to [...] on around 100 waiting passengers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{financial}} misdeeds {{of various}} figures throughout American history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole, and include {{names such as}} William Duer, Jim Fisk and Jay Gould (the latter two {{believed to have been}} involved with an effort to collapse the U.S. gold market in 1869) as well as <b>modern</b> <b>figures</b> such as Bernard Madoff who [...] "bilked billions from investors".|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{historical}} analysis may be {{more accurate}} than the medieval sources as the <b>modern</b> <b>figures</b> are based on estimates of the logistical ability of the countryside to support these numbers of men and animals. Both Davis and Hanson point out that both armies had to live off the countryside, neither having a commissary system sufficient to provide supplies for a campaign. Other sources give the following estimates: [...] "Gore places the Frankish army at 15,000–20,000, although other estimates range from 30,000 to 80,000. In spite of wildly varying estimates of the Muslim force, he places that army as around 20,000–25,000. Other estimates also range up to 80,000, with 50,000 not an uncommon estimate." ...|$|E
60|$|MacIan had learnt {{much and}} thought more {{since he came}} out of the cloudy hills of Arisaig. He had met many typical <b>modern</b> <b>figures</b> under {{circumstances}} which were sharply symbolic; and, moreover, he had absorbed the main modern atmosphere from the mere presence and chance phrases of Turnbull, as such atmospheres can always be absorbed from the presence and the phrases of any man of great mental vitality. He had at last begun thoroughly to understand what are the grounds upon which the mass of the modern world solidly disapprove of her creed; and he threw himself into replying to them with a hot intellectual enjoyment.|$|E

Note especially the grand way in [...] which the oblique archstones rest on the butments of the bridge, safe, [...] palpably both to the sense and eye: note also the sculpture of the [...] Annunciation on the southern side of it; how beautifully arranged, so [...] as to give more lightness and a grace to the arch--the dove, flying [...] towards the Madonna, forming the keystone,--and thus the whole action [...] of the figures being parallel to the curve of the arch, while all the [...] masonry is at right angles to it. Note, finally, one circumstance [...] which gives peculiar firmness to the figure of the angel, and [...] associates itself with the general expression of strength in the [...] whole building; namely that the sole of the advanced foot is set [...] perfectly level, as if placed on the ground, instead of being thrown [...] back behind like a heron's, as in most <b>modern</b> <b>figures</b> of this kind.|$|E
60|$|And {{there was}} the shock lately given to his health always sadly present with him. He was {{certainly}} much revived; he had recovered all his usual power of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there might still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would justify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made the sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp & Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the tombs of the past, those <b>modern</b> <b>figures</b> came athwart the dim light, and interrupted his diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his mistake, {{so that he would}} have to eat his own words with a good deal of indigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship, which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus, the prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter savors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other persons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a potently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some undermining disease was at work within him, there might be large opportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if one of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his disembodied existence.|$|E

2500|$|While {{people have}} been ice skating for centuries, figure skating {{in its current form}} {{originated}} in the mid-19th century. A Treatise on Skating (1772) by Englishman Robert Jones, is the first known account of figure skating.

Young skaters are often possessed of [...] "temperaments", but Mr Hall's patience and good humour overcame all difficulties." ...|$|R
50|$|The late 19th century saw the {{publication}} of popular sympathetic studies making use of recently rediscovered source materials. In this period {{there was also the}} revival of a Gnostic religious movement in France. The emergence of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 greatly increased the amount of source material available. Its translation into English and other modern languages in 1977 resulted in a wide dissemination, and has as a result had observable influence on several <b>modern</b> <b>figures,</b> and upon modern Western culture in general. This article attempts to summarize those <b>modern</b> <b>figures</b> and movements that have been influenced by Gnosticism, both prior and subsequent to the Nag Hammadi discovery.|$|E
