40|$|Using the {{activation}} goal memory framework, this study categorized 256 separate emergency department interruptions {{in a large}} research hospital setting. Prior to and following their shift, twelve physicians completed a semi-structured qualitative survey about their experiences with, and perceptions of, interruptions at work. During their shift, these physicians were shadowed and the interruptions they experienced were documented. Frequencies of four types of interruptions were tallied: Direct reminders, indirect reminders, <b>memory</b> <b>lapses</b> and no reported memory change. Memory events were {{a significant proportion of}} interruptions (47 %). Direct reminders comprised the largest majority, followed by <b>memory</b> <b>lapses,</b> indirect reminders and combination memory events. Both prior to and following their shifts, physicians overestimated both the harmfulness of interruptions to themselves and the helpfulness of interruptions to the interrupter. Physicians perceived the majority of interruptions they experienced as justified...|$|R

50|$|Absent-mindedness is {{a mental}} {{condition}} in which the subject experiences low levels of attention and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a state people experience {{in their daily lives}} from a variety of different causes including boredom, sleepiness, or focus on internal thoughts instead of external surroundings. When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of <b>memory</b> <b>lapse</b> and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems.|$|E

5000|$|The use {{of letters}} on dials was {{proposed}} in 1917 by W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T. Large cities like New York would ultimately require a seven-digit number, but some {{tests in the}} early 1900s indicated that the short-term memory span of many people could not handle seven digits and many dialling errors due to <b>memory</b> <b>lapse</b> might occur (the documentation for these tests is lost). Hence the first Panel automatic exchanges cutover in 1915 in Newark, New Jersey used [...] "semiautomatic" [...] operation with the local operator keying the number for the caller. And as large cities would have both manual and automatic exchanges for some years, the numbers for manual or automatic exchanges {{would have the same}} format (originally MULberry 3456, with three letters then four numbers), which could be either spoken or dialled.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{a survey}} that the International Diabetes Federation {{conducted}} in 2002 on the access to and availability of insulin in its member countries, approximately 70% of the insulin that is currently sold {{in the world is}} recombinant, biosynthetic 'human' insulin. [...] A majority of insulin used clinically today is produced this way, although the clinical evidence has provided conflicting evidence on whether these insulins are any less likely to produce an allergic reaction. Adverse reactions have been reported; these include loss of warning signs that sufferers may slip into a coma through hypoglycemia, convulsions, <b>memory</b> <b>lapse</b> and loss of concentration. However, the International Diabetes Federation's position statement is very clear in stating that [...] "there is NO overwhelming evidence to prefer one species of insulin over another" [...] and [...] "highly purified animal insulins remain a perfectly acceptable alternative." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{confusion}} {{has led to}} Dodd's birthplace being {{listed as}} Des Moines, Iowa.

[...] Dodd had numerous relatives who still lived in and around Baxter when her apparent <b>memory</b> <b>lapse</b> was reported in the Register & Tribune's Iowa News Service on April 29, 1935.
