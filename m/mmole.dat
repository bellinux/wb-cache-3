One of the first mid scale synthesizers appeared in the late 1980s, manufactured by the Biosearch company in Novato, CA (The 8800). This platform was originally designed as a peptide synthesizer and made use of a fluidized bed reactor essential for accommodating the swelling characteristics of polystyrene supports used in the Merrifield methodology. Oligonucleotide synthesis involved the use of CPG (controlled pore glass) which is a rigid support and is more suited for column reactors as described above.

Some novel reactor designs as well as higher than normal pressures enabled the 8800 to achieve scales that would prepare 1 <b>mmole</b> of oligonucleotide. In the mid 1990s several companies developed platforms that were based on semi-preparative and preparative liquid chromatographs. These systems were well suited for a column reactor approach. In most cases all that was required was to augment the number of fluids that could be delivered to the column. Oligo synthesis requires a minimum of 10 and liquid chromatographs usually accommodate 4. This was an easy design task and some semi-automatic strategies worked without any modifications to the preexisting LC equipment. PerSeptive Biosystems as well as Pharmacia (GE) were two of several companies that developed synthesizers out of liquid chromatographs. Genomic Technologies, Inc. {{was one of the few}} companies to develop a large scale oligonucleotide synthesizer that was, from the ground up, an oligonucleotide synthesizer.

40|$|In this research, {{hydrogen}} production from conventional slow pyrolysis, flash pyrolysis, steam gasification and catalytic steam gasification of various biomass samples including rice husk, wood pellets, wheat straw and sugarcane bagasse was investigated at ultra-high temperature (~ 1000 °C). During flash pyrolysis {{of the waste}} wood, the gas yield was improved to ~ 78 wt. % as compared to ~ 25 wt. % obtained during slow pyrolysis. The addition of steam enhanced the hydrogen concentration from 26. 91 vol. % for pyrolysis to 44. 13 vol. % for steam gasification. The comparison of pyrolysis, steam gasification and catalytic steam gasification in a down-draft gasification reactor at 950 °C using rice husk, bagasse and wheat straw showed {{a significant increase in}} gas yield as well as hydrogen yield. The hydrogen yield was enhanced from ~ 2 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1 for pyrolysis to ~ 25 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1 during steam gasification using a 10 wt. % Ni-dolomite catalyst. The higher hydrogen yield was due to the enhanced steam reforming of hydrocarbons and thermal cracking of tar compounds at higher temperature. When compared with the other catalysts such as 10 wt. % Ni-dolomite, 10 wt. % Ni-MgO, and 10 wt. % Ni-SiO 2, the 10 wt. % Ni-Al 2 O 3 catalyst showed the highest hydrogen yield of 29. 62 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1. The investigation on gasification temperature showed that the hydrogen yield was significantly improved from 21. 17 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1 at 800 °C to 35. 65 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1 at 1050 °C. The hydrogen concentration in the product gas mixture was increased from 50. 32 vol. % at 800 °C to 67. 41 vol. % at 1050 °C. The increase in steam injection rate from 6 to 35 ml hr- 1 enhanced the hydrogen yield from 29. 93 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1 to 44. 47 <b>mmoles</b> g- 1. The hydrogen concentration increased from 60. 73 to 72. 92 vol. %. The increase was mainly due to the shift in the equilibrium of the water gas shift reaction as H 2 :CO ratio increased from 2. 97 to 7. 78. The other process variables such as catalyst to sample ratio, carrier gas flow rate showed little or no influence on the gas yield and hydrogen yield. The steam gasification of residual biomass char was performed at 950 °C to recover extra hydrogen. The presence of 10 wt. % Ni-Al 2 O 3 in the gasifier improved the hydrogen yield to ~ 47 <b>mmoles</b> per gram of biomass as compared to the other catalysts such as 10 wt. % Ni-dolomite and 10 wt. % Ni-MgO.

Mean (± SD) total daily methionine excretion was 0. 06 ± 0. 04 <b>mmoles</b> (of 28 ± 4 <b>mmoles</b> infused) in patients treated with the L-methionine containing solution, and was 15. 2 ± 4. 2 mmoles/day (of 45. 2 ± 5 <b>mmoles</b> DL-isother infused) in patients treated with the DL-methionine containing solution. In these latter patients, 90 to 98 % of the excreted methionine was the 1) -isomer. The data indicate 64 ± 23 % of infused r-metbionine is excreted in the urine. Four patients excreted between 70 to 85 % of infused D-methionine in the urine, but one patient excreted only 35 to 55 %, suggesting better utilization.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies {{demonstrated that the}} topical application of caffeine is a potent inhibitor of UVB-induced carcinogenesis and selectively increases apoptosis in tumors but not in non-tumor areas of the epidermis in mice that are at a high risk for developing skin cancer. While this effect is mainly through a p 53 independent pathway, the mechanism by which caffeine inhibits skin tumor formation has not been fully elucidated. Since caffeine is a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, we investigated the effects of several PDE inhibitors on the formation of sunburn cells in mouse skin after an acute exposure to ultraviolet light B (UVB). The topical application of a PDE 2 inhibitor, erythro- 9 -(2 -hydroxy- 3 -nonyl) adenine hydrochloride (EHNA hydrochloride), stimulated epidermal apoptosis compared to control (P, 0. 01) and {{to a greater extent}} than caffeine whereas a PDE 4 inhibitor attenuated the epidermal apoptosis compared to control (P, 0. 01). Since PDE 2 hydrolyzes cyclic nucleotides, mainly cGMP, the effects of EHNA hydrochloride on epidermal apoptosis following UVB exposure may be mediated, in part, by increased cGMP signaling. Data demonstrated that the topical application of dibutyryl cGMP stimulated epidermal apoptosis (P, 0. 01) following an acute exposure to UVB.

40|$|Benthic carbon {{oxidation}} {{rates and}} carbon burial {{rates have been}} determined for two contrasting continental margins and their sum {{has been used as}} an estimate of carbon rain rate to the sediments.

The rain rate estimates, CR, were described by a power function, CR 5 CR 100 m (z/ 100) 2 a, with an attenuation coefficient, a, of 0. 93 (CR 100 m 5 16. 2, r 2 5 0. 89). This attenuation rate is similar to numerous others previously reported for various oceanic areas. In contrast, off northwest Mexico, where the water column is oxygen deficient between 180 and 700 m, rain rates at 100 m were considerably less, about 7. 5 <b>mmoles</b> C m 22 d 21, but rain rates at 1, 000 m were similar to those off Washington. Thus, the attenuation coefficient for the Mexican margin was significantly lower, a 5 0. 36 (CR 100 m 5 7. 4, r 2 5 0. 77). Off Mexico, the rain rates estimated from sedimentary parameters were corroborated by values determined directly from sediment-trap deployments. The generally smaller rain rates off Mexico are probably due to the lower primary production, hence lower initial supply. The lower attenuation rate, however, is hypothesized to result from a decreased oxidation rate of the sinking flux within the oxygen-deficient zone relative to a more typical oxic water column...|$|R

Their research and extension was imposed especially in hilly areas with specific problems of desertification (erosion, drought) as bioremedial measures. Our research follows the effects of the three tillage systems: conventional systems, minimum tillage and no-tillage on soil properties (bulk density, penetration resistance, temperature and moisture, soil respiration) and on the production of wheat, maize and soybean, obtained on an Argic Faeoziom from the Somes Plateau. Average soil bulk density grows, compared to the conventional system (1. 20 - 1. 24 g/cm 3), in all variants with minimum tillage (1. 22 - 1. 32 g/cm 3); the highest growth is recorded at no-tillage, being 1. 35 - 1. 38 g/cm 3 with statistically significant positive differences. Soil moisture increases in all variants with minimum and no-tillage with different percentages, ranging from 1 - 15 % v/v, compared to the conventional system. This is also reflected in the values of resistance to penetration. Tillage appeared to affect the timing rather than the total amount of CO 2 production: the daily average is lower at no-tillage (315 - 1914 <b>mmoles</b> m- 2 s - 1), followed by minimum tillage (318 - 2395 <b>mmoles</b> m- 2 s - 1) and is higher in the conventional system (321 - 2480 <b>mmoles</b> m- 2 s - 1).

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that the barrier system for high environmental salinity {{is closely related to}} the salt-resistance of Staphyloccus aureus. The present investigation was undertaken to clarify the energy dependency for the maintenance of intracellular univalent cation contents in cells grown on high concentration of salt containing medium. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The growth of 10 % NaCl-Staph which was grown in the 10 % NaCl containing nutrient broth was more sensitive to NaN 3 than Normal-Staph which was grown only on nutrient broth. The anaerobic conditions in both media demonstrated a more powerful effect on growth inhibition of 10 % NaCl-Staph than Normal-Staph. Therefore, 10 % NaCl-Staph must have a higher energy dependency than Normal-Staph. (2) The high sensitivity to uncouplers, such as DNP and FCCP in 10 % NaCl-Staph, also suggested an energy dependency which was probably related to respiration and not to anaerobic glycolysis. (3) The intracellular Na+ contents of Normal-Staph and 10 % NaCl-Staph were 12. 0 and 152. 9 <b>mmoles</b> per Kg wet weight of cells respectively, and the content of K+ in 10 % NaCl-Staph (90. 2 <b>mmoles</b> per Kg wet weight) was lower than that of Normal-Staph (215. 8 <b>mmoles</b> per Kg wet weight). These intracellular Na+ and K+ contents were strongly affected by the addition of various inhibitors to the medium. The measurements of intracellular univalent cation contents indicated the existance of an adaptively developed barrier system in 10 % NaCl-Staph and the existence of energy-dependent transport mechanisms for efflux of Na+ in Normal-Staph and for the influx of K+ in 10 % NaCl-Staph. </p...|$|R
