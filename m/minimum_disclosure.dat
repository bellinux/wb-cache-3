Such an identity system is expected, from where, people can retrieve any of the identities necessary to access every available service with adequate security. Success of such identity depends on its usability in the current and probable future wireless technology. Authentication is another important issue for acceptance of this system. This paper proposes a concept of identity mechanism through which individuals can exercise exactly the similar real world roles in the digital world.

40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} few years, a large and ever increas-ing number of Web sites have {{incorporated}} one or more social login platforms and have encouraged users to log in with their Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other social networking iden-tities. Research results suggest that {{more than two million}} Web sites have already adopted Facebook’s social login plat-form, and the number is increasing sharply. Although one might theoretically refrain from such social login features and cross-site interactions, usage statistics show that more than 250 million people might not fully realize the privacy implications of opting-in. To make matters worse, certain Web sites do not offer even the minimum of their functional-ity unless users meet their demands for information and social interaction. At the same time, in a large number of cases, it is unclear why these sites require all that personal informa-tion for their purposes.

Our example case is Facebook, which combines a very popular single sign-on platform with information-rich social networking profiles.

40|$|Drawing {{on recent}} {{observational}} fieldwork {{as well as}} existing research studies {{in the fields of}} law and of psychology, this article examines the nature of police practices in the disclosure of evidence before and during custodial interviews of legally represented suspects. Whilst police pre-interview disclosure to lawyers was a fixed practice, the format of disclosure varied and lawyers were rarely permitted to inspect the evidence, relying instead on the officer’s account. Disclosure was sometimes provided in stages, either as a deliberate tactic or when evidence was lacking. Officers occasionally exaggerated the strength of their case to suspects and resisted providing more detail to lawyers – an approach that seemed designed to elicit an admission from the suspect. In line with past research, lawyers relied on the evidence that police disclosed when advising clients before the interview and occasionally argued with the police for more disclosure. Taken together, these findings suggest that police are complying with the <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements set out by legislation, and that police may be more open with lawyers than previous research suggests. Some of our findings warrant concern, however, and raise questions about risks to vulnerable suspects in custody and risks to suspects without legal representation...|$|E

With the advent of high speed networks and easily available storage, many organizations are able to collect large amounts of data. On one hand, these organizations would like to mine their data to understand and discover interesting patterns; on the other hand, many legal and commercial reasons may prevent the organizations from sharing their data.

The broadening {{of the definition of}} the duty to inform that senior officers owe directors to include an underlying affirmative duty to provide information, even when director or shareholder action is not requested, offers an opportunity for greater monitoring of corporate governance by focusing on those often most culpable. Currently, the plain language of Delaware’s delegation of authority statute protects directors who reasonably rely in good faith on the reports of corporate officers.

The empirical data was gathered from the years 2008 to 2010 to provide {{a clear picture of}} the change in the level and extent of NMD, and its influences over the periods 2008 to 2010. It {{can be seen from the}} Fiji perspective that the mandatory requirements tend to have a financial focus. However, it would be expected that the level of company disclosures would have changed over time, with not only global market forces but through differing societal values which have increased the frequency and demand of non-mandatory reporting by companies. All companies showed some degree of NMD, and on average this demonstrates an increasing trend. The stakeholders are receiving more information about a company’s activities. The companies were analysed in light of recent developments in corporate governance by the Capital Markets Development Authority (CMDA) implementing their 10 corporate governance principles. This became a major driver of the increase in NMD levels of the disclosures in the annual reports of the listed companies. However, a large variation still exists between the level and extent of the NMD and the different listed companies. The <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> level found over the three years was 9. 09 percent, which has increased to a minimum of 13. 66 percent in 2010, and the maximum disclosure level over the three years was 81. 82 percent. The findings for {{the extent of}} NMD was also similar where the minimum words used in NMDs was 114, increasing to 854 in 2010, and the maximum disclosure extent over the three years was 21, 414 words. However, it was found that the measurement of counting words tended to fluctuate over different periods where significant events took place that affected the company. Therefore, it was established that disclosure is impacted by what happens in the reporting period, and can explain why one period may have greater disclosure than another. The paper aims to extend earlier work of Sharma & Davey (2013) on the extent of NMD in Fijian context. While Sharma & Davey (2013) considered voluntary disclosure from 1999 - 2005, our study reviews NMD over 2008 - 2010.

40|$|Path {{authentication}} thwarts counterfeits in RFID-based supply chains. Its {{motivation is}} that tagged products taking invalid paths are likely faked and injected by adversaries at certain supply chain partners/steps. Existing solutions are path-grained {{in that they}} simply regard a product as genuine if it takes any valid path. Furthermore, they enforce distributed authentication by offloading the sets of valid paths to some or all steps from a centralized issuer. This not only imposes network and storage overhead but also leaks transaction privacy. We present StepAuth, the first step-grained path authentication protocol that is practically efficient for authenticating products with strict path bindings. We encode a path into a secret with <b>minimum</b> path visibility <b>disclosure</b> between adjacent steps. Carrying the secret, a product {{has to go through}} steps in the exact order as in the designated path to pass authentication. StepAuth enforces no tag computation and enables each step to locally verify path secrets without pre-offloaded valid-path sets. Toward an even higher security guarantee, StepAuth can hinder an adversary capable of compromising all steps from forging valid secrets. We make StepAuth practically efficient by taking advantage of nested encryption and hybrid encryption. To achieve a 128 -bit security for a practically long path of 100 steps, StepAuth generates a secret around 10 KB, which can be well supported by high-memory EPC Gen 2 tags. Such secrets take StepAuth less than 1 s to encode and around 10 ms to verify...|$|R

I find that audit firms meet the <b>minimum</b> transparency report <b>disclosure</b> requirements, but have different approaches to governance in the areas which may impact audit quality. I identify specific areas where transparency reports may give rise to future research opportunities. In the second study, I use disclosures from first-time mandatory audit firm transparency reports to investigate the association between the design features of partner remuneration schemes and audit quality. Specifically, I examine the influence of four features of partner remuneration schemes: the inclusion of performance-based compensation components, whether partner remuneration is linked to internally assessed measures of audit quality, whether partner remuneration is linked to client retention and acquisition and the size of profit sharing pool. Using the issuance of going-concern opinion and discretionary accruals as audit quality proxies, I find evidence of differences in audit quality related to partner remuneration schemes. I find that the inclusion of a link between partner remuneration and internally assessed measures of audit quality is associated with higher audit quality proxied by the issuance of going concern report and discretionary accruals. I also document that the inclusion of client retention and growth in partner remuneration schemes is associated with higher audit quality. However, I find mixed evidence of the role of performance-based components in partner remuneration schemes and find no evidence that the size of the profit sharing pool is associated with audit quality. My findings inform regulators and the profession that partner remuneration design features are associated with differences in audit quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the various elements of financial reporting frameworks and practice in the context of the Internet. The Internet has emerged as a recent medium of presentation of corporate information. Currently, the levels of disclosure vary widely between companies within countries and on an international level, in relation to financial reporting disclosure on websites. It was intended in this research to identify the national and international regulatory frameworks that shed light on the <b>minimum</b> level of <b>disclosure</b> required of companies. Actual disclosure by companies was then investigated in order to compare de jure and de facto financial reporting disclosure. The financial reporting elements investigated were broadly classified as basic financial reporting elements such as financial reports, corporate social responsibility reporting elements, corporate governance elements and audit reports. A sample of 177 companies was selected from four sub-groups: hotels, diversified companies, multinational companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and multinational companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. The companies’ websites were then investigated in relation to financial reporting disclosure on the Internet. For companies that did not have their own (primary) websites, further investigation was carried out as to whether financial reporting information was provided on secondary websites. The nature of this information was also analyzed. It was found that 82 companies had annual reports on their websites and 7 companies had interim results only. The financial reports of these companies were then studied in order to determine the nature and level of disclosure in relation to the financial reporting elements and disclosure scores were formulated. In relation to the adoption of the Internet for financial reporting purposes, it was found that 33 companies had no financial information on their websites and that 55 companies did not have annual reports online because they did not have websites. The findings indicated that only 67 percent of the companies with websites had some kind of financial information on their websites. In relation to companies with financial reports on their websites, it was found that all sample companies diverted from what was required by the regulation by not disclosing financial reporting elements in one aspect or another. In relation to audit reports, it was found that only half of the relevant sample companies had audit reports accompanying their financial reports. Other observations were also made, indicating a spectrum picture of financial reporting disclosure on the Internet, in the context of basic, corporate social responsibility and corporate governance financial reporting. The findings made in this study were supported by literature, in that there is a lack of a uniform approach to financial reporting disclosure on the Internet. Financial reporting disclosure on the Internet ranges from none to extreme detail (including voluntary reporting disclosures) for corporations on the Internet. In the context of the qualitative characteristics identified by the International Accounting Standards Board framework, adopted by national jurisdictions, this would compromise quality, relevance, usefulness and timeliness of financial reporting information on the Internet. In return this would pose a dilemma for the user in the context of comparability, due to the lack of uniformity. In this study one reporting language, called the XBRL was also investigated. This was done due to the immense benefits and potential offered in the literature in support of XBRL, enhancing the qualitative characteristics of understandability, timeliness and more extensive coverage of auditing and verification of information. It was found that this reporting language is at this point in time, in its experimental stage and that a more extensive time frame may be required for its wider adoption and usage. In this study recommendations were made to improve financial reporting disclosure by companies on the Internet and to make the Internet a more reliable source for presentation of financial reporting information. ...|$|R
