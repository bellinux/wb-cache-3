40|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>models</b> play an {{increasingly}} important role in economic policy-making and evaluation. They cost large sums of money, yet appear unable to forecast {{the ups and downs}} of economic activity with any accuracy. Drawing on material gathered during interviews with leading UK economists, I draw a distinction between `strong' and `weak' claims in econometrics, and discuss how these relate to the falsification of economic models and theories. Empirical work in econometrics is shown to be chronically ambiguous, and it is argued that the stochastic properties of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>models</b> swamp any trends identified. Furthermore, although <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>models</b> can support economic forecasts, they cannot produce them unaided — forecasters must use their skill and judgement to anticipate future events and render forecasts plausible. The conclusion drawn is that although their pedagogic value is undisputed, the case for using <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>models</b> to guide, frame and evaluate economic policy has not yet been made...|$|R

State of the art in sustainability, inspired by interdisciplinary ideas of ecological economics, this book is focusing on sustainability pathways, new economic theory, democracy and institutions, multidimensional assessment of sustainability, <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>modelling</b> and policies, climate change and renewable energy, resource flows and circular economy, regenerative cities, environmental conflicts and values. We are hoping that this thought provoking collection of top level contributions will help facilitate a transition towards sustainability and educational reform.The contributors include the stars of ecological economics: Professors David Orr, Peter Söderbaum, Robert Ayres, Herman Daly, Stanislav Shmelev, Anthony Friend, Stefan Speck, Herbert Girardet, Stefan Giljum, Terry Barker, Jeroen van den Bergh, David Elliott, Joan Martinez-Alier, Irina Shmeleva, Robert Costanza, Gar Alperovitz, Joshua Farley, Carol Franco, Tim Jackson, Ida Kubiszewski, Juliet Schor and Peter Victor.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Comparative {{analysis}} of macroeconometric models took {{a significant step}} forward in 1983 {{with the establishment of}} the ESRC <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Modelling</b> Bureau. This was an important initiative by the <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Modelling</b> Consortium, itself newly established to coordinate support for a programme of research in <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>modelling</b> provided by the Research Council, HM Treasury and the Bank of England, and to manage this on a four-year cycle. Both developments resulted from the acceptance in June 1981 by the then Social Science Research Council of the recommendations of a subcommittee on macroeconomic research chaired by Michael Posner (SSRC, 1981). In the course of its deliberations the subcommittee had considered the case for setting up a new centre, to undertake comparative research on existing models of the UK economy and to help achieve greater openness and understanding of the models and their associated forecasts and policy analysis. It was supported in thi...|$|E

As Paul Samuelson observed, Modigliani's theoretical work was fundamental {{in the development}} of the basic framework within which the "post-Keynesian eclecticism" of the later twentieth century developed. In the move from theory to practice two aspects of Modigliani's work are considered: 1) the systemic approach that focuses on the relationship between the short and the long term; 2) the special reference to the mechanism of monetary policy transmission in the use of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>model</b> for economic stabilisation policy.
