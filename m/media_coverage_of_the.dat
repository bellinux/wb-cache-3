5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement {{was the most important}} issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's murder {{received}} {{considerable attention}} in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more {{on the lack of}} parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder has been cited as an example of blaming the victim. Leigh's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled A Property of the Clan, which was later revised and renamed Blackrock, as well as a feature film of the same name.|$|E
5|$|<b>Media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} {{has focused on}} popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E

The subsequent <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protest and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in Life magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.|$|E

5|$|Chinese <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was {{compared}} favourably {{to that of}} the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight {{earlier in the season}} with Derek Boogaard. The resulting <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E

In addition, the winner of the game would be awarded an automatic bid to the Bowl Championship Series 2008 Orange Bowl game in Miami, Florida on January 3, 2008. Despite Boston College's earlier win over Virginia Tech, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech by five points.|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Bedfordshire in partial fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirements for <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> Doctor of PhilosophyThis study, {{which seeks to}} contribute to <b>the</b> shared-body <b>of</b> knowledge on media and war crimes jurisprudence, gauges <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Defence Forces (CDF) and Charles Taylor trials conducted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) on <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> civil society organizations (CSOs) in promoting transitional (post-conflict) justice and democratic legitimacy in Sierra Leone. The media’s impact is gauged by contextualizing the stimulus-response paradigm in the behavioral sciences. Thus, media contents are rationalized as stimuli and <b>the</b> perceptions <b>of</b> CSOs’ representatives on <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trials are deemed to be their responses. The study adopts contents (framing) and discourse analyses and semi-structured interviews to analyse <b>the</b> publications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected media (For Di People, Standard Times and Awoko) in Sierra Leone. The responses to such contents are theoretically explained with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structured interpretative and post-modernistic response approaches to media contents. And, methodologically, CSOs’ representatives’ responses to the media’s contents are elicited by ethnographic surveys (group discussions) conducted across the country. The findings from the contents and discourse analyses, semi-structured interviews and ethnographic surveys are triangulated to establish how <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two trials impacted CSOs’ representatives’ perceptions on post-conflict justice and democratic legitimacy in Sierra Leone. To test the validity and reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings from the ethnographic surveys, four hundred (400) questionnaires, one hundred (100) for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four regions (East, South, North and Western Area) of Sierra Leone, were administered to barristers, civil/public servants, civil society activists, media practitioners, students etc. The findings, which reflected <b>the</b> perceptions <b>of</b> people from large swathe of opinions in Sierra Leone, appeared to have dovetailed with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSOs’ representatives across the country. The study established that <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CDF trial {{appeared to have been}} tainted with ethno-regional prejudices, and seemed to be ‘a continuation of war by other means’. However, the focus groups perceived the media reporting as having a positive effect on <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> post-conflict justice, good governance and democratic accountability in Sierra Leone. <b>The</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charles Taylor trial appeared to have been devoid of ethno-regional prejudices, but, in <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CSOs, seemed to have been coloured by lenses of patriotism and nationalism...|$|R

Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E

The game was played on January 1, 2009, and also featured the No. 12 Cincinnati Bearcats, champions of the Big East Conference.

A hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and, when diagnosed in 1984, was given six months to live. Though doctors said he posed no risk to other students, AIDS was poorly understood at the time, and when White tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied against his attendance.

It was Texas' third Sugar Bowl appearance and its first since 1958. In exchange for playing in the game, each team received $8.3 million. Thanks to revenue-sharing agreements with Big East conference members, Virginia Tech received $3.5 million, minus expenses, for playing in the Sugar Bowl. Pregame <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event focused on Virginia Tech making its first appearance in a major bowl game and Texas' resurgence as a major college football power.

5|$|Tim Folger {{speculates that}} news of radio {{contact with an}} {{extraterrestrial}} civilization would prove impossible to suppress and would travel rapidly, though Cold War scientific literature on the subject contradicts this. <b>Media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discovery would probably die down quickly, though, as scientists began to decipher the message and learn its true impact. Different branches of government (for example legislative, executive, and judiciary) may pursue their own policies, potentially giving rise to power struggles. Even {{in the event of}} a single contact with no follow-up, radio contact may prompt fierce disagreements as to which bodies have the authority to represent humanity as a whole. Michaud hypothesizes that the fear arising from direct contact may cause nation-states to put aside their conflicts and work together for the common defense of humanity.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there was}} a massive scale of fraud and {{deception}} uncovered in the Levin-Coburn Report, <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> report was timid. In an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> report, the Columbia Journalism Review criticizes the Wall Street Journal, the nation’s foremost business newspaper, for its placement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story in <b>the</b> third section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day’s paper, {{as well as its}} general dodging around the facts laid by and the criticisms made in the Report about Wall Street investment banks.
