All <b>monosomic</b> additions were accurately distinguished from diploid sib plants with both DNA probes. The probe PB 6 - 4, with the strongest signal after hybridization, was selected for rapid screening of an extensive number of putative <b>monosomic</b> additions in B. patellaris or B. procumbens addition families using a squash-blot hybridization procedure. The probe PB 6 - 4 detected 118 <b>monosomic</b> additions in 640 plants (18. 4 %) in eight different B. procumbens addition families. The addition family with chromosome 4 of B. procumbens was semi-lethal {{and could not be}} tested. The {{distribution of}} PB 6 - 4 in B. patellaris addition families was confirmed in 63 addition families using the squash-blot procedure. In 4580 plants of these addition families, 628 individual <b>monosomic</b> additions (13. 7 %) were found.

40|$|In general, {{autosomal}} monosomy is lethal {{much earlier}} in mammalian development than autosomal trisomy. In {{an attempt to}} understand why monosomy is so deleterious, we have begun to characterize the development of mouse embryos <b>monosomic</b> for chromosome 19. A dramatic loss of monosomy 19 embryos was found to occur between days 3 and 4 of development. This loss occurred both in vivo and in vitro and with intact blastocysts or isolated inner cell masses. Experiments with inbred strains showed that this loss was not; due to the expression of recessive lethal genes. While <b>monosomic</b> embryos {{were found to have}} fewer cells than normal and trisomic litter-mates beginning at the early morula stage, the ability to form blastocysts is not interfered with. Electron microscopy revealed no differ* ence in the cellular ultrastructure of <b>monosomic</b> when compared with diploid embryos. Furthermore, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis did not reveal any differences in the proteins synthesized by <b>monosomic,</b> trisomic or diploid litter-mates when examined at day 3 of development. These results indicate a lack of gross genomic disturbances in <b>monosomic</b> embryos. When monosomy diploid chimaeras were made, viable <b>monosomic</b> cells were found in day- 9 post-implantation embryos, well past the lethal period. Thus, in chimaeric embryos, the normal cells appear to be able to provide whatever is lacking, suggesting that monosomy 19 is not a cell lethal. Instead, death may be due to a dosage alteration in specific gene products needed during early development...|$|E

Since the conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid is a single-enzyme-mediated reaction, we suggest that a gene involved in linoleic acid biosynthesis is located on chromosome 2.

40|$|Distributive {{disjunction}} {{is defined}} as the first division meiotic segregation of either nonhomologous chromosomes that lack homologs or homologous chromosomes that have not recombined. To determine if chromosomes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were capable of distributive disjunction, we constructed a strain that was <b>monosomic</b> for both chromosome I and chromosome III and analyzed the meiotic segregation of the two <b>monosomic</b> chromosomes. In addition, we bisected chromosome I into two functional chromosome fragments, constructed strains that were <b>monosomic</b> for both chromosome fragments and examined meiotic segregation of the chromosome fragments in the <b>monosomic</b> strains. The two nonhomologous chromosomes or chromosome fragments appeared to segregate from each other in approximately 90 % of the asci analyzed, indicating that yeast chromosomes were capable of distributive disjunction. We also examined the ability of a small nonhomologous centromere containing plasmid to participate in distributive disjunction with the two nonhomologous <b>monosomic</b> chromosomes. The plasmid appeared to efficiently participate with the two full length chromosomes suggesting that distributive disjunction in yeast is not dependent on chromosome size. Thus, distributive disjunction in S. cerevisiae appears to be different from Drosophila melanogaster where a different sized chromosome is excluded from distributive disjunction when two similar size nonhomologous chromosomes are present...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} genetic systems are {{described}} which involve {{the use of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The systems may be used to detect the production of aneuploid cells produced during both mitotic and meiotic cell division in the presence of genetically active chemicals. During mitotic cell division, <b>monosomic</b> colonies (2 n - 1) may be detected by plating upon selective medium. Increases in such <b>monosomic</b> colonies are produced by exposure of cells to a number of chemical mutagens such as ethyl methane-sulfonate and mitomycin C. More importantly, <b>monosomic</b> colonies are also induced by nonmutagens such as sulfacetamide and saccharin, which suggests that such chemicals are capable of inducing aneuploidy (aneugenic) in the absence of mutagenic activity. Genetic analysis of aneuploid colonies produced on nonselective medium indicate that at least a proportion of the <b>monosomic</b> colonies were the result of mitotic nondisjunction. During meiotic cell division, disomic cells (n + 1) produced by chromosome nondisjunction may be detected by plating on selective media.

40|$|Strains <b>monosomic</b> for {{chromosome}} I of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain 25 to 35 % fewer rRNA genes than do normal diploid strains.

Some of these haploids contained 24 to 48 % more rRNA genes than a normal euploid strain.

Genetic analysis of the haploids containing extra rRNA genes suggested that these genes are linked to chromosomal DNA and are heterozygous. They were not closely linked to any centromere and were not located on chromosome I. Furthermore, all the DNA complementary to rRNA in one of these haploid strains with magnified rRNA genes sedimented at a chromosomal molecular weight, consistent with chromosomal linkage. In addition, several new mutations mapping on chromosome I were used to show that ribosomal DNA magnification was not due to a chromosome I duplication...|$|E

Strong pSc 119. 2 FISH signals could be observed at the telomeric regions of 3 DS arms in ‘Mianyang 11 ’. However, the pSc 119. 2 FISH signals were disappeared from the selfed progeny of 4 R <b>monosomic</b> addition line and the changed 3 D chromosomes could be transmitted to next generation stably.

Identification of the extra chromosomes in the 16 plants by elaborate karyotype analyses indicate that a complete series (eight different types) of the alien <b>monosomic</b> addition lines was established in Allium {{for the first time}} in this study. Chromosomal locations of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) gene, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) gene and 5 S rDNA of A. cepa Aggregatum group were determined using the series; The gene locus Mdh- 1 was located on 4 A, Tpi- 1 on 3 A and a 5 S rDNA locus on 7 A.

40|$|With a view {{to assess}} the {{possibility}} of homoeologous pairing and crossing-over between the chromosomes of potato (Solanum tuberosum) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), a somatic fusion hybrid and two <b>monosomic</b> alien tomato addition genotypes were investigated through genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH). The somatic fusion hybrid, C 31 - 17 - 51, was near hexaploid (2 n = 6 x - 4 = 68) possessing 46 potato chromosomes + 20 tomato chromosomes + 2 translocated chromosomes. The two alien addition genotypes were near tetraploids (2 n = 4 x + 1 = 49) and consisted of <b>monosomic</b> alien additions for tomato chromosome 1 in genotype 2103 - 1, and tomato chromosome 8 in genotype 2301 - 2. In the fusion hybrid the tomato pachytene chromosome identification revealed that the chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12 were in diploid condition whereas among those that were in haploid condition, three could be identified viz., 4, 9, and 11. The remaining three chromosomes could not be cytologically identified. Although the chromosomes with translocated segments could not be identified at the pachytene stage due to technical difficulties, there was clear evidence {{for the presence of}} a reciprocal translocation observed at diakinesis and metaphase I stages. Because of autosyndetic pairing of the translocated segments, it gave a false impression as if there was a high frequency (86. 0 %) of allosyndetic pairing. In contrast to the fusion hybrid, the two alien <b>monosomic</b> addition genotypes showed a very low frequency of allosyndetic pairing, namely 1. 1 and 1. 3 % respectively for the <b>monosomic</b> additions 1 and 8. In the genotype 2301 - 2, <b>monosomic</b> addition for tomato chromosome 8, crossing-over between the homoeologous chromosomes was estimated to occur in 0. 8 % of the meiotic cells investigated.

Four <b>monosomic</b> addition lines were for normal chromosomes 1 D, 2 D, 3 D and 6 D while the remaining three chromosomes 4 D, 5 D and 7 D were represented by translocated chromosomes 4 DS- 5 DS, 7 DS- 5 DL and 7 DL- 4 DL...|$|E
40|$|Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is {{the most}} serious viral disease {{affecting}} wheat and genes for BYDV resistance have not been found in wheat. BYDV-resistant alien addition and alien substitution lines produced from a wheat × Thinopyrum intermedium (species of Agropyron complex) cross were characterized. Chromosome pairing in the hybrids between two substitution lines showed that they had the same Th. intermedium chromosome. Likewise, two addition lines involved the same alien chromosome. In situ hybridization of chromosomes, confirmed that line P 29 is a disomic substitution line. Double <b>monosomic</b> seeds and self-pollinated seeds from <b>monosomic</b> addition plants were irradiated to induce translocations between wheat and Th. intermedium chromosomes. Putative translocations were {{selected on the basis of}} BYDV resistance and studied by chromosome analysis, Southern hybridization using Thinopyrum specific probe and RFLP markers. A BYDV-resistant translocation was identified...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal {{structural}} changes—deletions and translocations—occurred In {{almost half}} the progeny of a <b>monosomic</b> addition line of common wheat, Triticum aestivum (2 n = 42, AABBDD), which had a chromosome from Aegilops cylindrica (2 n = 28, CCDD). Most of the progeny with chromosomal structural changes lacked the A. cylindrica chromosome. Chromosome breaks were observed in various regions of all the wheat chromosomes and the A. cylindrica chromosome. Chromosome aber-rations occurred far less frequently both in the self-progeny of the dlsomic addition plants and in the F, <b>monosomic</b> addition plants derived from reciprocal crosses with normal common wheat These findings suggest that when the A. cylindrica chro-mosome was in the sporophytes, chromosome breakage was {{likely to occur in}} the gametophytes that lacked it but that the gametophytes were still functional, resulting in the production of offspring with chromosomal structural changes...|$|E
40|$|Genomic in situ {{hybridization}} (GISH) {{was used}} to identify alien chromosomes {{in a series of}} eight different Allium fistulosum - A. cepa <b>monosomic</b> addition lines. Biotin-labeled total genomic DNA from shallot (A. cepa L. Aggregatum group) was used as a probe together with an excess amount of unlabeled blocking DNA from the recipient plant, Japanese bunching onion (A. fistulosum L.). Probe hybridization sites were detected by FITC-conjugated avidin and anti-avidin antibody using an epifluorescence microscope. In each mitotic metaphase cell of all the eight types of <b>monosomic</b> addition lines, the alien chromosomes were successfully discriminated from other 16 A. fistulosum chromosomes. Furthermore, no clear exchanges of chromosome segments between A. cepa and A. fistulosum were observed. This finding indicates that in each addition line an entire (unrecombined) A. cepa chromosome is present in an integral diploid background of A. fistulosum...|$|E
