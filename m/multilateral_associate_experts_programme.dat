40|$|Self-care {{is seen as}} a {{key element}} in {{managing}} resource demand in chronic disease and is also perceived as an empowering right for patients. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Programme developed in the USA has been adopted in a number of countries and in the UK has been as adapted as the <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme.</b> However, despite its potential as a layled empowering initiative, the <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme</b> has been criticised as perpetuating the medical model and failing to reach those in most need. This paper revisits a critique of the <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme,</b> and drawing upon a qualitative study seeks to explore whether the <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme</b> enables empowerment or replicates traditional patterns of the patient???professional relationship. A grounded-theory approach was adopted utilising focus groups, in-depth interviews and participant observation. Data were analysed through the constant comparative method and the development of codes and categories. Conducted in the relatively affluent area of the south-east of England, this paper draws on data from 66 individuals with a chronic illness who were knowledgeable, active and informed. The study revealed a number of characteristics common to expert patients that were linked to a systematic, proactive and organised approach to self-management, a clear communication style and the ability to compartmentalise emotion. The study included participant observation of an <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme</b> and a professional-led self-management course. The paradoxical nature of the <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme</b> was revealed, for whilst there was evidence that it reinforced the medical paradigm, there was a concurrent acknowledgement and support for the subjective experience of living with a long-term condition. Furthermore, whilst the policy emphasis has been on individual empowerment within the <b>Expert</b> Patients <b>Programme,</b> {{there is some evidence that}} it may be triggering a health consumer movement...|$|R

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a chronic}} condition that has reached epidemic proportions. AF {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality, as it particularly leads to serious cardiovascular complications like ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism and heart failure. Moreover, AF {{is often associated with}} underlying diseases, implying specific treatment and making the management of AF complex. Two-third of the patients with AF experience symptoms. Some patients can be severely incapacitated by their symptoms and experience a negative impact on their quality of life. This all can lead to increased hospitalisations. AF, therefore, puts a major pressure on healthcare systems and places a significant economic burden on society. AF is likely to expand in an ageing population because AF increases with age. Hence, a continuously augmenting impact on the healthcare system is anticipated. In response to this, evidence-based guidelines were developed to facilitate clinicians in obtaining positive patient outcomes. Nonetheless, guideline adherence in practice is often poor, leading to a substantial gap between ‘evidence-based’ and ‘real-life’ care in clinical practice. The recognition that care for patients with AF is complex, that symptom management and improving guideline adherence are important, is urging researchers, clinicians and healthcare administrators to develop and implement sustainable solutions for healthcare concerning AF patients. An interdisciplinary, nurse-coordinated AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme</b> is argued to be a promising approach for this chronic condition. Such a disease-management programme is a complex intervention and it should be developed and evaluated accordingly. Therefore, this PhD project is built-up around the first 3 phases of the MRC framework entailing the development, feasibility evaluation, and conceptualisation of prospective effectiveness evaluation of an interdisciplinary, nurse-coordinated AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme.</b> First, the overall evidence base has been identified and a theoretical underpinning regarding the rationale for and content of interdisciplinary, nurse-coordinated AF <b>expert</b> <b>programmes</b> as a way to structure daily practice in AF management was provided. It was acknowledged that AF <b>expert</b> <b>programmes</b> must be built around 5 important cornerstones: comprehensive assessment; systematization of medical care; education; coordination of care; and evaluation of care plan execution. It was described how different disciplines could be structured around the patient, with a focus on patient-centred care. Moreover, a flowchart describing the main care process of the patients with AF from consultation request until follow-up of an AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme</b> was proposed. Second, nurse-coordinated AF care should be provided to achieve clearly defined AF management-related outcomes, which are universally accepted. Nonetheless, no consensus existed on which outcomes should primarily be assessed. Therefore, we empirically derived a list of prioritized outcomes for AF disease management. Overall, 54 outcomes or key performance indicators (15 medical/clinical, 24 patient and 15 economical outcomes) were listed. They were rank-ordered according to their priority, as perceived by an international panel of experts. This list can form the basis of ‘benchmarks’ when assessing the effectiveness of AF disease management programmes or other interventions to improve AF management. Third, an adequate management of AF patients requires accurate assessment of AF related symptoms experienced by patients. However, no standardized patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment of AF symptoms has been accepted as a gold standard. Therefore, a PRO to comprehensively assess symptom experience of patients with AF, the Leuven ARrythmia Questionnaire (LARQ), is developed and tested. The strength in its development was the use of a conceptual framework of symptom experience. In contrast to the other existing PROs, the LARQ is likely to be more useful in clinical practice as it provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence of all relevant AF-related symptoms, and all components of symptom experience. It was demonstrated to be a valid and reliable tool for its purpose. Indeed, we have proven its ability to comprehensively assess symptom prevalence and all aspects of symptom experience, and its capacity to discriminate across 4 clinically different groups. Overall, 80. 3 % of all patients with AF reported symptoms. Patients in the emergency department group reported significantly more symptoms and had the most profound symptom experience profile compared to the other groups. The least profound symptom profile was found in control persons. Despite an overall good correlation between the EHRA and LARQ scores, physicians systematically underestimated symptom prevalence. Moreover, the EHRA score provides no information on the specific symptoms that patients experience and it provides less information about frequency and duration of symptoms. Fourth, AF <b>expert</b> <b>programmes</b> can focus on patients referred to the outpatient clinic and/or on hospitalised patients. In this respect, it is unknown what the prevalence of AF in an inpatient population is. Therefore, we determined the point prevalence and overall prevalence of AF in a tertiary care centre. This was the first ECG-based evaluation of nearly the whole inpatient population of a tertiary care centre on a single day. A remarkable high prevalence of AF (16. 8 %) has been found and AF appeared to be present in all hospital zones. Hence, AF should be a concern for clinicians and hospital administrators. Most of the patients with AF were at high risk for stroke. However, anticoagulation management was inappropriate in half of those. These observations distinctively demonstrate the need to establish structural support by an AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme,</b> to assist non-cardiac providers of the hospital in the accurate detection and appropriate management of AF. Interestingly, the results indicate that the scope of an AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme</b> for hospitalised patients should be targeted especially to AF patients in non-cardiac wards, as 87. 5 % of the undertreated high-risk patients were admitted to non-cardiac wards. Finally, the results of these preparatory studies were used to outline the rationale, design and methods of a future study to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary, nurse-coordinated AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme</b> for patients in primary care. We have chosen for a cluster randomised trial at general practice level. The intervention group under study will receive the intervention as described in Chapter 2. More specifically, the intervention will be based on the cornerstones described. This interdisciplinary AF <b>expert</b> <b>programme</b> will be nurse-coordinated and the flowchart developed will be used as a blueprint to guide the care process of the primary care patients from consultation request until follow-up. A crucial aspect in designing such a trial is the choice of outcomes and outcome measures. Therefore, the priority-ordered list developed in Chapter 3 was used to define primary and secondary outcomes. More specifically, 6 medical/ clinical, 14 patient and 5 economical outcomes, or 25 out of 54 prioritised outcomes were carefully chosen from the list. Finally, the LARQ developed in Chapter 4 will be used to assess symptom prevalence and symptom experience. In conclusion, tackling the AF epidemic through the development of interdisciplinary AF <b>expert</b> <b>programmes</b> that implement guidelines into real care is urgently needed. Hence, with this PhD we have laid the foundations {{for a new generation of}} studies focussing on the potential benefits of AF-specific disease management programmes. status: publishe...|$|R
