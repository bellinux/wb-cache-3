40|$|For {{decisions}} {{related to}} investments in societal safety and health, {{it is often}} difficult to balance the discretionary competence of decision-makers with theoretical optimum levels of investment. While removing day-to-day decisions about risk from the political arena would arguably result in better decisions, a full depoliticization is not desirable since public and private risk preferences cannot simply be neglected without negatively affecting the perception of risk and inducing a democratic deficit. Therefore a decision making tool has been developed which allows for narrowing the scope of possible decisions for the decision maker, based on predetermined <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviations</b> from the theoretic optimum investment level. These <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviations</b> should be established upfront on a general basis and may subsequently be applied on a case-by-case basis. In this paper the basic calculation concepts are explained and a detailed example study is presented in which limits for the target safety level of concrete slabs are determined under some specific considerations...|$|E

For this model, the mean square error compared to the theoretical power level is 2.5 dB. In which the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviation</b> in the signal level that was received by the mobile {{in relation to the}} prediction is 8 dB [7]. Note that the average and standard deviation calculated for the proposed model showed values very close to those obtained for the data collected in the field (measured values).|$|R
40|$|In this study, a new robust double-ring junction-termination-extension (DR-JTE) for {{high-voltage}} pn-diodes {{is presented}} and analyzed using numerical simulations. As figured out, the DR-JTE reduces the electrical field at both, {{the edge of}} the single-JTE region and the MESA-transition, respectively. Thereby, due to the reduction of the electrical field, the maximum breakdown voltage is increased to 91. 5 % of the theoretical, parallel-plane breakdown voltage of 6. 5 kVand the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviation</b> of the optimum implantations dose is twice than that of the single-JTE structure. Furthermore, due to the internal ring, the MESA-transition is shielded from the electrical field and therefore the breakdown voltage is much less affected by the angle of the MESA...|$|R

Very important parameters that influence dielectric material 2 ̆ 7 s properties in, for example, marine applications are operating frequency, expected temperature {{in practice and}} moisture. The proposed optimal solution for the dielectrics choice is based on theory of sets. Instead of using function to find best value for the dielectric constant, the parameters’ dependences are used to produce sets of possible values, which are used to find the optimal material for the desired application. The intersection of the three sets of possible solution is the optimal solution if the material with such value exists. If not, <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviation</b> is used to find the acceptable material...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the ideal and <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviation</b> for nine smile characteristics by using digital manipulation of hard and soft tissue smile components. Intraoral photographs were manipulated using Adobe ® Photoshop ® CS 2 to alter buccal corridor, smile arc, gingival display, crown torque in maxillary canines and the posterior buccal segments. Smiles were placed in a gender neutral face showing nasal tip to mentolabial fold. Quask ™ Form Artist was used to generate the survey, which was administered in Columbus, OH (n= 43); Seattle, WA (n= 41) and Boston, MA (n= 40). An interactive interface allowed raters to move a slider to answer questions. Rater reliability was assessed for each variable. We found that, in general, raters were reliable (K = 0. 5 - 0. 8). Survey location was not significant except for the finding that the West coast accepted a broader smile (1. 5 mm buccal corridor) than the Midwest and East coasts where the buccal corridor wa...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: The {{primary purpose}} of dose-banding for cancer {{chemotherapy}} is to reduce patient waiting times, but dose-banding also has additional benefits, such as reduced drug wastage, reduced stress for staff, and prospective quality control of infusions. However, the uptake of dose-banding seems fairly low. Possible reasons for this are a reluctance to use dose-banding for clinical reasons {{or a lack of}} awareness. Despite the seemingly minor change from established practice of dose preparation, dose-banding has the potential to alter patient chemotherapy exposure. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate prescribers' awareness of dose-banding and their opinions on the scope and limitations of dose-banding in the context of UK chemotherapy services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This survey was performed throughout the UK by use of a postal questionnaire, which was validated before national distribution to 1104 oncologists and haematologists. The questionnaire contained both quantitative and qualitative elements. A database was created for data entry and analysis. RESULTS: The response from prescribers was encouraging for a postal questionnaire, with a 35 % response rate (387 responses). Many were aware of the concept of dose-banding (> 80 %) and were also supportive of the system. The weakness around body surface area-based dosing was a commonly discussed topic. However, opinions on which is the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviation</b> from the prescribed dose with dose-banding were controversial, and there was a concern about the lack of evidence to support the use of dose-banding. The views on whether carboplatin and targeted therapies should be dose-banded were also divided. CONCLUSIONS: There was general support for dose-banding, but concerns about the lack of an evidence base could be a barrier to the wider introduction of the system. Consequently, more clinical studies are required to justify the safety and efficacy of dose-banding, and also to evaluate whether dose-banding is acceptable within clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|A report {{proposes a}} method of {{utilizing}} solar-radiation pressure to keep the axis of rotation of a small spin-stabilized spacecraft pointed approximately (typically, within an angle of 10 deg to 20 deg) toward the Sun. Axisymmetry is not required. Simple tilted planar vanes would {{be attached to the}} outer surface of the body, so that the resulting spacecraft would vaguely resemble a rotary fan, windmill, or propeller. The vanes would be painted black for absorption of Solar radiation. A theoretical analysis based on principles of geometric optics and mechanics has shown that torques produced by Solar-radiation pressure would cause the axis of rotation to precess toward Sun-pointing. The required vane size would be a function of the angular momentum of the spacecraft and the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> angular <b>deviation</b> from Sun-pointing. The analysis also shows that the torques produced by the vanes would slowly despin the spacecraft [...] an effect that could be counteracted by adding specularly reflecting "spin-up" vanes...|$|R
40|$|Master thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{effect on}} {{accuracy}} {{of reducing the}} number of experiments in the series has been investigated on isochoric, constant temperature nucleation experiments. In addition, data from two other nucleation studies have been analyzed. The experiments were conducted in two autoclave high pressure cells with similar construction but different overall dimensions. Two different gas mixtures were used: SNG- 2 and SNG- 7. Experimental conditions such as pressure (90 bar) and cooling rate (6. 0 C/h) were kept constant for all the experiments. Three experimental series at different temperatures have been conducted on each cell, which allowed estimation of activation energy of gas hydrate nucleation by means of the Arrhenius equation through the Arrhenius plot. The radius of the critical size nuclei was determined once the activation energy was estimated. Two different techniques were utilized in order to estimate nucleation rate of hydrate nucleation, namely a best-fit method included in the graphical program tool KaleidaGraph and penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for two-parameter exponential distribution. Two maximum deviation levels of 20 % and 30 % from estimated value obtained with the maximum number of parallels included were set as test criteria evaluating the minimum number of parallels required to determine particular parameter. Based on the results of statistical analysis of the experimental data in the present study the minimum number of experiments to obtain a representative value of nucleation rate estimate can be proposed to be not less than several tens to provide accuracy within 20 - 30 %. To make some conclusions about the exact number, analysis of a series with more parallels is required. For the conducted experiments acceptable accuracies were obtained for estimation of nuclei size even though the number of parallels was reduced to 6 for the large cell experiments. However, there was not found clear relationship between number of parallels and fit of Ln J as function of 1 /T to a straight line. The set accuracy limit that determines <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>deviation</b> in a parameter estimate showed great influence on the required number of parallels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the joint optimization of electric vehicle (EV) and home energy scheduling. Our {{objective is to}} minimize the total electricity cost while considering user com-fort preference. We take both household occupancy and EV travel patterns into account. The novel contributions of this paper lie in the exploitation of EVs as dynamic storage facility as well as de-tailed modeling of user comfort preference, thermal dynamics, EV travel, and customer occupancy patterns in a concrete optimiza-tion framework. Extensive numerical results are presented to illus-trate {{the efficacy of the}} proposed design. Specifically, we show that the proposed design can achieve significant saving in electricity cost, allow more flexibility in setting the tradeoff between cost and user comfort, and enable to reduce energy demand during peak hours. We also demonstrate the benefits of applying the proposed framework to a residential community compared to optimization of individual household separately.

40|$|CAD {{systems have}} greatly {{affected}} {{the way which}} engineers perform their function. Computers have simplified and eliminated many of repetitious tasks and the gap between computer models and physical products has significantly shortened. These tools have stimulated the impetus for product development but the manufacturing processes still depends on human skills which ultimately reduce errors and produce better products. Complex shapes representing the patient’s anatomy are widely applied, namely in computer-assisted surgery and manufacturing of customized implants. These type of models represent a challenge for the reverse engineering processes and are not comparable {{with the demands of}} regular geometric models. In order to create a replica, data is processed in a series of steps that transforms the initial data obtained from the physical model into a three dimensional digital model. Most commonly it is necessary to include filtering, segmentation, mesh smoothing and surface generation. These steps can strongly affect the accuracy of the model. It is therefore necessary to find a compromise between the finest accuracy and <b>maximum</b> <b>deviation</b> <b>acceptable</b> to reduce computer processing time and achieve the best model. This study shows an iterative and alternating process to produce more accurate complex geometry models...|$|R

Six male indus-trial workers performed 42 variations of lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling, and carrying tasks. Lifting boxes without handles produced consistent decreases (me-dian, 16 %) in <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weights {{when compared with}} lifting boxes with handles. Lifting with extended horizontal reach (approximately 48 cm) pro-duced consistent decreases (median, 48 %) in <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weights when compared with lifting close to the body (approximately 17 cm). No significant heart rate or oxygen consumption differences occurred in either of these variables. No significant differences in <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weight of carry were observed among box sizes; however, the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> force of pulling was lower for longer (15. 2 m) pulling tasks.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the effects of handles, shape of the container, and dimensions of the container on <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weight of lift using a psychophysi-cal methodology. Ten male college students were required to lift six different boxes with handles, six without handles, and three different mailbags from the floor to a bench height (76 em), using a free-style lifting technique. The six boxes varied in length and width, and the three mailbags varied in diameter and length. Statistical analysis showed that the <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weights for mailbags and boxes without handles were lower than those for boxes with handles. The <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weight significantly increased with an increase in dimensions of the mailbag. Among all the container characteristics studied, handles were found to have the most profound effect on <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weight. It is concluded that the recommendations for <b>maximum</b> <b>acceptable</b> weight of the load based on boxes with handles need to be adjusted when applied to boxes without handles or to some other types of containers...|$|R

The quantifiers provide a univocal expression of the condition corresponding to a geometrical product requirement. This opens a wide area for research in tolerance analysis.
