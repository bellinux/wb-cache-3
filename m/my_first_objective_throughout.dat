40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{has been}} adopted to become a {{greatest}} tool for plant genetic engineering. Since Agrobacteria predominantly integrate single copy of the transgene into the nuclear genome, the transgene expression is relatively low. In contrast, transgene expression from chloroplasts allows high expression. Therefore, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> {{was to develop a}} new method of chloroplast transformation by modifying Agrobacterium genetics. I attempted to transform tobacco chloroplasts by Agrobacterium carrying the VirD 2 protein with inactivated nuclear localization signals (NLSs) fused to a chloroplast transit peptide. However, the transformation of tobacco chloroplasts was unsuccessful. It suggested that the transit peptide was overridden by a novel cryptic NLS of VirD 2. My second objective was to determine a novel NLS in VirD 2. I discovered the novel NLS in VirD 2 by subcellular localization analyses of fusion proteins (fragment of VirD 2 -green fluorescent protein) in plant cells.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I claim that libertarianism {{is a view}} that should once again be {{considered}} as a plausible possibility within the free will debate. Earlier versions of libertarianism needed unscientific notions such as noumenal selves or non-occurrent causes and were therefore discarded due to our current knowledge of science. However, philosopher Robert Kane has developed an account of libertarianism that appears to make a libertarian notion of free will compatible with science. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> is to clarify this account of libertarianism. Many objections have been raised against Kane, but only a few philosophers have tried to constructively reject his account of libertarianism. In this thesis I explain two strong objections that have been raised against libertarianism by famous philosopher and compatibilist Daniel Dennett. However, I claim that these objections are not sufficient to reject libertarianism as a whole and I conclude that therefore more work has to be done to abandon libertarianism altogether...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{addition}} to thematic maps, remote sensing provides estimates of area in different thematic categories. Areal estimates are frequently used for resource inventories, management planning, and assessment analyses. Ms-classification causes bias in these statistical areal estimates. For example, if {{a small percentage}} of a common cover type is misclassified as a rare cover type, then the area occupied by the rare type can be severely overestimated. Many categories are rare in detailed classification systems. I present an informal method to anticipate the approximate mag-nitude of this bias in statistical areal estimates, before a remote sensing study is conducted. If the anticipated magnitude i s unacceptable, then statistical calibration methods should be used to produce unbiased areal estimates. I then discuss existing statistical methods that calibrate for misclassification bias with a sample of reference plots. INTRODUCTION X) would be used if X and Y are acreages, where T is the total R EMOTELY SENSED AREAL ESTIMATES are typically treated as unbiased estimates of the true area for each cover type in a study area.

40|$|Urbanization {{is known}} to have a {{negative}} impact on biodiversity. However, it is possible to increase bird species richness in cities through local actions such as increasing vegetation density and diversity. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to compare bird density and diversity on the island of Montreal among four urban habitat types: low-density and medium-density residential sectors, and residential and natural parks. A second objective was to determine the presence of bird species assemblages within these four urban habitats and a third was to explore associative relationships among six mainly shrub-nesting bird species and the vegetation they use. Point counts were conducted in each of 103 locations. Environmental variables measured consisted of the type (coniferous versus deciduous), density and height of vegetation within each 1 ha sector. Results revealed a decrease in bird abundance from medium-density residential habitats, residential park, low density residential habitats to natural parks and an increase in diversity from medium density residential habitats, low density residential habitats, residential parks to natural parks. Bird assemblages were determined through correspondence analysis. Most bird species were associated with at least one type of urban habitat. Associations between bird species and vegetation were measured through canonical correspondence analysis.

40|$|Wetlands {{occurring}} {{on natural}} river floodplains typically have more dynamic hydrology, because of influences from the river, than man-made wetlands or {{those associated with}} reclaimed minelands. For wetland-associated species, fluctuating water levels can affect patch availability, connectivity and potentially habitat quality, and therefore drive metapopulation dynamics. Differences in hydrology between wetland complexes could change food webs and consequently the trophic diversity of the communities occupying these areas. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> {{was to assess the}} spatial and temporal variation in occupancy and turnover rates of a semi-aquatic small mammal at 2 hydrologically distinct wetland complexes over 3 years in southern Illinois. My second objective was to determine spatio-temporal variation in the trophic structure of small mammals at 2 wetland complexes (floodplain and mineland) in southern Illinois. 	To address <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective,</b> I live-trapped marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) during 2011 - 2013 at 9 wetland patches on the Mississippi River floodplain and 14 patches at a reclaimed mineland. I used multi-season occupancy modeling to estimate initial occupancy, detection, colonization and extinction rates. Catch per unit effort differed markedly between the 2 sites (27 captures/ 1, 000 trap-nights at the floodplain site vs. 8 at the mining site). Estimates of detection probability increased with an increase in effort (number of traps per night per wetland patch). Occupancy probability was similar between sites and positively related to patch size. Patch colonization probability at both sites was related negatively to total rainfall 3 weeks prior to trapping. In addition, the variation in colonization probability among years, was different between sites, with colonization in 2013 being much lower at the mining site than at the floodplain. An increase in total rainfall 3 months prior to trapping led to a substantial increase in extinction probability on the floodplain, but not at the mining site. Differences in metapopulation dynamics and relative abundance between the 2 sites can be attributed to differences in hydrology and habitat quality. Although rice rats were present at the mining site in much lower numbers than at the floodplain site, these less-natural wetland complexes might serve as valuable refuges for species occurring in increasingly fragmented landscapes. For my second objective, I collected hair samples from 6 species of small mammals (n = 416) occurring at these wetland complexes. I analyzed C and N stable isotopes for 3 mammal taxa (Oryzomys palustris, Peromyscus spp,, Microtus ochragaster) to compare diet between species, sites, and, times. Food sources (vegetation and invertebrates) were collected at each site to form the isotopic baseline. Using stable isotope mixing models, I found no seasonal difference in diet composition, but signatures varied between sites.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a sequel to}} Working Paper No. 3131, "Hypotheses of Sticky Wages and Prices". <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> is to re-examine the {{historical}} record of prices and wages. What changes in their behavior are indicated by the data and {{how can they be}} explained? Next, the models that imply that price flexibility may be destabilizing are identified and assessed. This requires in particular an analysis of the role of changes in interest rates and price expectations. Money wages and prices in general had a predominantly pro cyclical pattern of movement before World War II, at least during the major fluctuations, but no declines in the more recent business contractions. Real wages never conformed closely to business cycles but most of their weak reactions were procyclical. Depending on the underlying condition and sources of the shifts in the economy, the departures from flexibility mayor may not be destabilizing. The main contrast, though, is between the stabilizing potential of flexible relative prices and the destabilizing potential of major general price movements. Major deflations of the past had strong and adverse expectational and distributional effects. So had the recent inflation as it accelerated and grew increasingly volatile. But moderate fluctuations in the price level or the rate of inflation are not necessarily detrimental to the growth in real economic activity. ...|$|R

This thesis investigated two possible causes for children’s poor innovation. Until now, research has presented tool innovation tasks solely within heavily structured, pedagogical environments. Hence, <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> {{was to investigate}} the potential constraining influence of pedagogy on children’s innovation. Second to this, I investigated whether providing children with more information about the affordances of task materials (i. e. malleability) would facilitate their innovative performance. Fifty-two children aged between 3. 5 - to 5. 5 -years were presented with innovation problems. These tasks were presented either within a pedagogical environment or a non-pedagogical environment. Moreover, prior to being given these tasks, half of the children watched a demonstration, which highlighted the affordances of task materials and their use. Children’s performance was then analysed according to whether they modified the task materials, innovated a tool, and/or achieved success on the task. Pedagogy did not constrain children’s performance. Rather, pedagogy was found to increase children’s success, and to a lesser degree, their frequency of innovation. No effect of pedagogy on children’s modification was evident. Secondly, as predicted, providing more information about the affordances of task materials improved children’s modification, success, and to a marginal extent, their frequency of innovation. These results are interpreted according to the theory of natural pedagogy and the argument that tool innovation is an inherently ill-structured problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{the initial}} scoping phase of this {{research}} project, the main question I used for guidance was “to what extent and how did the Manhattan Project impact New Mexico and New Mexicans?” <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> {{was to assess the}} magnitude of the state’s transformation before addressing the other questions that soon ensued from this original reflection. A brief historical review of the state’s transformation will introduce these questions, and comparing pre-World War II and post-Cold War New Mexico will justify the term “revolutionized” I used above. This dissertation retraces the story of this scientific colonization {{from the point of view}} of those who have often been cast aside to the margins of official histories: the local people. In the 1940 s, local Pueblo Indians, Hispanic farmers, Mexican immigrants, and Anglo ranchers extensively relied on agro-pastoral activities for sustenance and lived on the fringe of industrialized America. Many of these locals’ lives were drastically altered by the development of the nuclear economy. The current socio-economic, demographic, and environmental situation of New Mexico is considerably correlated to the history of the Manhattan Project. In fact, the arrival of atomic science during the course of the Second World War revolutionized this remote, generally ignored land in the American West, and resulted in the development of a federally-sponsored nuclear and high-technology complex.

40|$|There is a {{prima facie}} {{incompatibility}} between a law conception of ethics, in which law concepts (e. g. ought, rule, action) are basic, and a virtue conception of ethics, in which virtue concepts (e. g. character trait, ideal, agent) are basic. However, both conceptions contain {{elements that are}} needed for an adequate ethical account. Aquinas's conception of ethics is of interest, because it combines virtue and law components within a broadly Aristotelian account. I argue that Aquinas's virtue-and-law ethical conception is not ad hoc, but emerges from, expresses, and is grounded normatively, rationally, and motivationally in his general conception of practical thought. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> in the thesis is to explicate and defend an interpretation of Aquinas's understanding of practical thought as the rational determination of general good into particular action.

The main aim of my thesis was to identify any evidence of early disease processes (respiratory or vascular) in children born preterm. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to investigate the association between preterm birth and markers of vascular disease in childhood using data from Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), and to review the literature reporting on arterial stiffness and/or endothelial dysfunction in preterm-born children. In my second project I conducted a systematic review of the literature with the objective to answer the question: Do survivors of preterm birth have reduced cardiorespiratory exercise capacity? My final project was to set up a cross-sectional study of children in Wales to test if lower gestational age at birth is associated with increased respiratory symptoms, admission rates to hospital and inhaler use for respiratory disease; independent of atopy. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> research project, using data from ALSPAC, noted an association between gestational age and SBP but not with measures of vascular function in childhood suggesting that alternative mechanisms may be responsible for increased SBP in preterm-born children. These results were supported by the findings of the seventeen articles identified by my systematic review. In my second project, a systematic review of the literature, I noted that despite marked deficits in lung spirometry, preterm-born children have only marginally decreased VO 2 max, which is unlikely to be of great clinical significance.

It was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> to determine the site from which the sample was taken. With {{the help of}} drs. B. Beerenhout and the Bureau of Monuments and Archaeology (BMA) of Amsterdam I {{came to the conclusion that}} the sample must have been taken from an excavation at the Nieuwendijk, Amsterdam in the year 1979. It turned out a biology student named Pauline Vos-Kelp took samples from the Nieuwendijk 1979 excavation for here PhD program. It was clear the sample I possessed was not taken care by Vos-Kelp so I could precede with the determination of fish remains that the sample contained. 	Documentation from the BMA made clear Vos-Kelp took only samples from the earliest medieval phase of human habitation of Amsterdam (13 th to 14 th century AD), so this gave me a dating of more or less the same age for the sample. During these first periods Amsterdam was plagued by flooding, so the earliest inhabitants were forced to construct levels of elevation at the place where their houses were located. Determination of the fish remains from my sample gave some major indications that the sample was taken from one of those earliest levels of elevations.

I want to see what, if anything, a raw citation count says about prestige or reputation. For example, what types of cases are cited? Are they followed, not followed, or part of a dissent or concurrence? Are cases expanding {{the rights of the}} criminally accused cited frequently by sister courts? The normative literature associates prestige with expanding the rights of criminal suspects using state constitutions.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY In {{this thesis}} I examine non-trading and trading period returns and their {{differences}} for globally traded equity index, interest rate and commodity futures. I decompose the continuous price pattern of futures into Night and Day returns, thus close-to-open and open-to-close returns. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> {{is to determine}} the differences between Night and Day returns. Second, I study whether seasonal return anomalies and patterns presented in previous literature hold also during non-trading periods, thus when markets are closed. The anomalies include a day-of-the-week and weekend effect, January effect and holiday effect. DATA A data sample includes 17 futures whose underlying assets present three different asset classes: equity indices, interest rates and commodities. Data is gathered from Bloomberg and price source for each future is their primary trading exchange. The sample consists of open and close prices for over 15 years from 1997 to 2012. In total, the time period includes nearly 4 000 trading days and in total 64 428 future day observations. RESULTS I find non-trading and trading period price patterns to differ significantly. I report negative Day returns for equity index and commodity futures during the sample period. According to the study the premiums are earned solely during the Night time when markets are closed. Additionally, the volatility of Night returns is lower than volatility of Day returns. The results thus imply that there is no reward of bearing higher risk in daytime volatility. In consistence, Day time returns for interest rate futures are positive and Night returns negative. My findings supports the results of previous literature which argue that non-trading period returns outperform day returns in equity markets in the past decade. In contribution to previous literature I broaden the results across asset classes and internationally...|$|R

Anglers on the Platte River are also harvest oriented. Little {{is known about the}} effects anglers have on channel catfish {{population}} dynamics in the lower Platte River. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine if there were effects of angling on channel catfish at two high use fishing areas in the lower Platte River. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to evaluate differences in relative abundance, size structure, condition, age structure, growth, and mortality between two high use areas (near Fremont and Louisville, NE). I also used a robust design capture-mark-recapture study to estimate density and abundance of channel catfish 3 ̆e 200 mm within a 10 -km stretch of the Platte River at each sampling site. The second objective was to assess the 5 year standardized monitoring data for spatial and temporal differences in relative abundance, size structure, condition, age structure, growth, and mortality across two river reaches and three river segments. Channel catfish at Fremont displayed lower size structure, slower growth, and were more abundant compared to channel catfish at Louisville. Population characteristics displayed considerable variation throughout the Platte River in the last five years. However, channel catfish sampled between the Loup River Power Canal and the Elkhorn River confluence were more abundant, grew slower, and had a lower size structure compared to channel catfish above and below that segment. Key factors influencing differences in channel catfish population characteristics may be due to hydrology (e. g., flow modifications caused by the Loup River Power Canal, irrigation withdrawals, and precipitation amounts) and the resulting changes to other abiotic factors (e. g., water temperature extremes, ice flow), angler exploitation, predation, habitat characteristics, and tributary inflows.

40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Climate {{change may}} result in a change in the tree species present within forests. The Missouri Central Hardwood Region {{represents}} one area where these changes may occur. Due to the natural diversity of species and economic value of this area, it is beneficial to understand how climate change might affect trees currently present. Computer models (a human creation to help understand real world systems in a simplified manner) can be used to study the impact of climate change on forests. My objectives were to 1) understand how different forest impact models studying climate change compared to each other, 2) determine whether climate change or current timber harvest practices was more likely to change the characteristics of the forest, and 3) analyze land management alternatives to determine which was best at creating beneficial qualities for forests under climate change. For <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective,</b> I used a species distribution model and a process model, two models that use different analysis approaches, to assess climate change impacts on tree species, and compared the results. On a broad level, both models agreed, but when looking at the study area at smaller resolution, the models did not agree as well. For my second objective, I coupled a process model and forest landscape model. Although results showed there was variation based on species regarding whether climate or harvest had the greater impact, both usually had significant impacts on tree species. Results for my third objective indicated that multiple management approaches are necessary to manage future forests in a beneficial manner. My results have implications for future forest sustainability. Uncertainty exists regarding climate change's full impact, but with proper forest management and research these challenges can be reduced...|$|R

Tropical coral reefs stand out {{as one of the most}} diverse ecosystems on Earth, but patterns of niche partitioning among coral reef organisms are poorly understood. Herbivorous coral reef fishes are frequently considered to perform one of the most critical ecosystem processes on coral reefs, the removal of algal and detrital material from the reef substratum. However, while several classification schemes have previously been employed to characterize the functional role of different herbivores, detailed holistic investigations of niche differences among herbivore species are rare. Therefore, in this thesis, I use social, morphological, behavioural, and environmental factors to disentangle the functional niches of herbivorous fishes on coral reefs. One of the most prominent social systems in animals is the association between two individuals, commonly termed a 'pair'. However, given that sexual reproduction in higher animals commonly requires the association between two partners, reproductive connotations frequently override the social-ecological benefits that a partner can provide and thus, the potential effects of pairing on an animal's functional niche. In teleost fishes, pairing is common but little is known about the potential drivers and consequences of this behaviour. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective,</b> therefore, was to quantify the extent of pair-formation in coral reef fishes and to examine potential ecological/reproductive correlates of pair-formation. Of a total of 1, 981 species of Indo-Pacific reef fishes, 341 (17. 2...|$|R
40|$|The grow {{in power}} of {{computers}} and the enormous amount of data available from experiments lead {{in the last years}} to the birth of new methodologies to treat data analysis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as neural network are now commonly used by scientist all over the world but, although wide spread, are currently not fully understood. This situation requires a study of the proprieties of the algorithm used in each specific case. In this thesis I tried to look after the techniques used in the analysis of the Bs->Ds*pi decay, using data from the LHCb experiment operated at the LHC, CERN in order to investigate an enhancement of the performance of the classification of the events. The Bs->Ds*pi channel is used as control for the Bs->KDs* channel which is hoped to be useful for a new/independent measurement of the angle gamma from the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa matrix. The large amount of variables that define this decay process make it difficult to separate Background from Signal because both populate complicated regions in a large multidimensional space. The AI approach is mandatory to find where {{the main part of the}} Signal lies. To obtain these results an AI technique is trained with a mixture of real data and Monte-Carlo simulations and, once fully trained, the algorithm can be applied to additional data to enhance the Signal component. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> in this thesis was to take the actual ROOT based machine learning algorithm used at LHCb and try to boost its performances by changing how the training is done; later I tried to compare different ROOT based methods to see which one had the best performances.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the overarching hypothesis that uphill and downhill walking are far more challenging than level walking for old adults and thus represent critical barriers to their independence and quality of life. In a series of five experiments/analyses, I studied the muscular actions and biomechanics of uphill and downhill walking in young and old adults to understand the factors that underlie the loss of uphill and downhill walking ability with age. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to understand how advanced age affects the muscular actions of uphill and downhill walking. In <b>my</b> <b>first</b> two studies, I determined which muscle recruitment strategies young adults employ to walk uphill and downhill across a range of speeds and also showed that: 1) a disproportionate recruitment of hip vs. ankle muscles leads to gluteus maximus (a hip extensor) activity approaching the maximum isometric capacity of old adults at steep uphill grades and 2) neural changes with advanced age contribute notably more than muscle weakness to this reliance on hip muscles. My second objective was to understand how advanced age affects the biomechanics of uphill and downhill walking. In my third study, I discovered that, in contrast to level walking and akin to a 4 -wheel drive automobile, both the leading and trailing legs of young adults contribute progressively more to power generation with steeper uphill grade and to power absorption with steeper downhill grade. In my fourth study, I found that old adults exhibit impaired trailing leg propulsive function compared to young adults walking at the same speed during both level and uphill walking. Old adults compensate by performing greater positive work than young adults during the subsequent single support phase. Finally, in my fifth study, I used motion analysis and inverse dynamics techniques to quantify ankle, knee, and hip joint kinetics (moments and powers) and gained joint-level insights into the age-related muscular limitations restricting uphill walking ability in old adults. Overall, my findings point to specific targets (e. g., propulsive forces) for biomechanical interventions that might improve the uphill and downhill walking ability of old adults, and thus enhance their quality of life...|$|R

Johannesburg, May 2014. Conservation has led to African elephants (Loxodonta africana) being reintroduced to small game reserves. However, only {{a few studies have}} been done on how elephants react to their new environment after a translocation. Dinokeng Game Reserve introduced a herd of 10 elephants (Loxodonta Africana) in October 2011. Using Global Positioning System collar locations of one female elephant, I aimed to determine whether an elephant’s exploration resulted in an expansion of its home range as the elephant settled in its new environment. Secondly, I aimed to determine how the use of resources and conditions in an elephant’s environment changed from release {{to the end of the}} study period. To achieve <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective,</b> I calculated the elephant’s daily distance movement distances and home ranges over 16 -day and seasonal periods. I used logistic regression to assess the habitat selection of the elephant over the study period. The results of the research demonstrated that the elephant slowly explored its new environment, which resulted in an expansion of its home range over time. However, it took almost two years before the elephant displayed signs of settling in its home range. The elephant used habitats further away from buildings, closer to fence boundaries and water sources, with low elevation and high greenness at the start of the study. Over time, the elephant’s habitat selection was no longer constrained by buildings and it demonstrated stronger evidence of using habitats with lower elevation towards the end of the study period. The findings suggest that elephants do not necessarily explore extensively before finding an area to remain in, and it may take longer than a year for them to settle. Furthermore, human settlements seem to limit elephant’s habitat selection a translocation, but this influence decreases as the elephant settles in its new environment...|$|R

The first theoretical part defines leisure time, what it consists of, who is involved in organizing it (non-governmental non-profit organizations, educational institutions, facilities for the disadvantaged) and who participates in it. The second part describesnon-governmental non-profit organizationsoperating in the town of České Budějovice and the typology of primary schools. A quantitative survey, a questioning method and a questionnaire created by me were all used in order to collect data for the practical part. The target group was represented by pupils of 4 th and 5 th grades of the primary and special primary schools in České Budějovice. Furthermore, the analysis of the researched schools? websites was carried out. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to find out leisure activities of primary school pupils as well as of special primary schools pupils, particularly during their first five grades. Having evaluated questionnaires I found out that students of both types of schools prefer sports in their free time as well as getting ready for school and listening to music. This is reflected in their choice of after-school activities, where sports activities dominate. My second objective was to determine the current supply of leisure activities for the first five grades of primary and special primary schools. The collection of data was carried out at four primary schools as well as at four special primary schools in České Budějovice. Analysing the websitesof the mentioned schools I discovered that the supply of after-school activities is sufficient and the pupils make use of them. The last objective was to compare the realised after-school activities for the first five grades of primary and special primary schools. The research showed that the results in individual types of schools are not substantially different. The conclusion of the thesis offers my advice to teachers to keep mentioning leisure activitiesduring the lessons and regular meetings with parents. The results can help to extend the supply of leisure activities in the mentions schools...|$|R
40|$|Petroleum-based {{plastics}} and synthetic fertilizers are commonplace in container-crop production, {{and their use}} raises concerns about the sustainability of plants produced in containers. Bioplastic materials have been developed as replacements that are more sustainable, but their use has been limited to date. Using materials made from composites of soy-based [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] ingredients and commercially-available bioplastics, we fabricated containers and pelletized fertilizers to understand nutrient-release characteristics of soy-based bioplastic composites while producing plants in container-crop production. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to evaluate the growth and mineral nutritional status of a common greenhouse species [marigold (Tagetes patula L.) ] grown in biocontainers that were manufactured with composite bioplastics containing various amounts of a soy-based biopolymer (soy bioplastic) and poly(lactic) acid (PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). My second objective was to evaluate the usage of soy-bioplastic composites that have been pelletized {{for use as a}} biologically-based (bio-based) fertilizer while growing three greenhouse-grown ornamental species [marigold, snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus L.), and cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum Mill.) ]. Plants produced in soy-bioplastic composite containers had similar or higher shoot dry mass, as well as nutrient concentration and content, depending on the amount of fertilizer applied. When comparing plants in 50 % soy bioplastic- 50 % PLA containers with plants produced in petroleum-plastic containers, nearly five times as much fertilizer was needed to ensure comparable growth for plants in petroleum-plastic containers. This represents around an 80 % reduction in fertilizer needed to produce quality plants in soy-based composite biocontainers. Plants grown with a standard amounts of fertilizer, regardless of fertilizer source, showed similar growth or slightly less growth when fertilized with pelletized soy-bioplastic composites. A point of excess was reached when using any pelletized soy-bioplastic composites at concentrations higher than would normally be applied. In general, soy-based bioplastic composites show potential to replace a portion of the petroleum plastic and synthetic fertilizer used extensively throughout the horticulture industry, but more evaluations should focus on improving performance of bioplastics for use in container-crop production...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Plant PathologyKaren A. GarrettLate blight of potato, {{caused by}} Phytophthora infestans, is a pernicious disease of {{potatoes}} worldwide. This disease causes yield losses {{as a result}} of foliar and tuber damage. Many models exist to predict late blight risk for control purposes with-in season but rely upon fine-scale weather data collected in hourly, or finer, increments. This is a major constraint when working with disease prediction models for areas of the world where hourly weather data is not available or is unreliable. Weather or climate summary datasets are often available as monthly summaries. These provide a partial solution to this problem with global data at large time-steps (e. g., monthly). Difficulties arise when attempting to use these forms of data in small temporal scale models. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to develop new approaches for application of disease forecast models to coarser resolution weather data sets. I created metamodels based on daily and monthly weather values which adapt an existing potato late blight model for use with these coarser forms of data using generalized additive models. The daily and monthly weather metamodels have R-squared values of 0. 62 and 0. 78 respectively. These new models were used to map global late blight risk under current and climate change scenarios resistant and susceptible varieties. Changes in global disease risk for locations where wild potato species are indigenous, and disease risk for countries where chronic malnutrition is a problem were evaluated. Under the climate change scenario selected for use, A 1 B, future global late blight severity decreases. The risk patterns do not show major changes, areas of high risk remain high relative to areas of low risk with rather slight increases or decreases relative to previous years. Areas of higher wild potato species richness experience slightly increased blight risk, while areas of lower species richness experience a slight decline in risk...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Olive ridley {{sea turtles}} (Lepidochelys olivacea) present an {{interesting}} {{case study of}} the conservation of wildlife species that aggregate in high densities and have served as resources for human consumption. Ridleys exhibit synchronized mass-nesting behavior, during events called "arribadas," where thousands of females lay eggs together in a small area over the span of a few consecutive nights. Some of the largest arribadas occur at La Escobilla, Mexico, with over a million nests estimated per season. These aggregations have made olive ridleys vulnerable to negative impacts from harvest and density-dependent influences on nest success. There are many interconnected determinants of nest success, including intraspecific competition for space, temperature, and predation. Nest destruction by conspecifics is an apparent potential impact of high density nesting, as later-arriving turtles often dig up previously laid nests. Nest destruction is the main scientific argument for "sustainable" egg harvest, since local communities could utilize eggs otherwise destroyed as an economic resource. In 2009 at La Escobilla, I explored 1) the historical context of harvest and community members' current perceptions of turtles through 12 semi-structured interviews with key informants; 2) nest destruction rates during arribadas through a field study to quantify nesting behavior. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> {{was to understand the}} shifting human-turtle relationship and how it informs current community dynamics and future conservation and research at arribada beaches. Historical research and interviews indicated that many local residents are familiar with turtle behavior and agree on the importance of conservation efforts for turtles and the local community. Nevertheless, residents struggle for economic stability within what has largely been an externally-imposed protectionist framework. Future efforts should integrate long-term employment with local involvement in research, conservation, and non-consumptive use. The second objective of my project was to quantify nesting activity and investigate the relationship between nest densities and nest destruction. Nesting behavior of 1293 turtles was observed in 26 sample plots during two consecutive arribadas. Cumulative nest densities estimated over two arribadas ranged from around 1 to 8 nests/m². The odds of a turtle digging up eggs increase 21...|$|R
40|$|Retinol (vitamin A) and its active metabolite, all-trans {{retinoic acid}}, signal through nuclear retinoic acid and retinoid X {{receptor}} (RAR/RXR) heterodimers. These complexes regulate {{the expression of}} genes involved in developmental processes such as limb development. In excess, retinoids are potent teratogens and cause marked reductive effects on the developing limb. The goal of this thesis was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying retinoid-induced limb dysmorphogenesis. Specifically, using an in vitro limb culture system, I examined the involvement of one RAR isoform, RARgamma, in mediating retinoid insult. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> was to examine how limbs deficient in RARgamma responded to exogenous retinoid exposure. I showed that RARgamma-null limbs (on an RARalpha 1 -null background) exhibited less severe limb defects following retinoid insult when compared to their wild-type counterparts. Additionally, the absence of RARgamma abolished the retinoid-induced misregulation of genes important for chondrogenesis (Sox 9 and Col 2 a 1) and limb outgrowth (Meis- 1 and - 2). The next objective set out to determine how pharmacological activation of RARgamma affected limb development. The RARgamma-selective agonist (BMS- 189961) caused limb dysmorphology (namely, effects on cartilage) that was comparable to pan-RAR activation with all-trans retinoic acid. A chondrogenesis-focused gene array analysis identified Mgp and Gdf 10 as two RARgamma-responsive genes that may mediate retinoid-induced limb insult. Subsequently, I assessed the functional involvement of Mgp in mediating retinoid teratogenicity. Limbs were treated with all- trans retinoic acid and warfarin (an inhibitor of MGP); warfarin co-treatment rescued limbs from retinoid-induced insult. My final objective {{was to determine the}} importance of Gdf 10 in mediating limb development. Recombinant human Gdf 10 -soaked beads were implanted into distal limb structures; ectopic overexpression of Gdf 10 in the web (but not the digital ray) resulted in marked proximal limb malformations. Collectively, these studies have illustrated the importance of RARgamma in retinoid teratology and have identified several potential mechanisms by which retinoids cause limb defects...|$|R

This essay examines the determinants of the demand for public job training programs in Illinois. <b>My</b> <b>first</b> <b>objective</b> is to determine which personal characteristics influence support for an increase in spending on publicly provided job training programs for the unemployed across various income groups in Illinois. In particular, I empirically test for a U-shaped relationship between income and the demand for publicly-provided job training. My second objective is to examine the role of local economic conditions in determining the demand for job training programs. I use data from the 1995 Illinois Policy Survey supplemented with county- and regional-level data (including the unemployment rate, manufacturing employment, population density, and poverty rate). I do not find a U-shaped relationship between income and the demand for job training. However, I find that regional economic conditions, particularly the unemployment rate, the poverty rate, and population density, significantly influence the demand for job training programs in Illinois. In contrast, I find county-level economic conditions are not very influential. Essay 2. The purpose of this essay is to examine the impact of chronic health conditions on asset accumulation and retirement. Compared to a healthy worker, a person with a chronic health condition throughout his or her working life may have had reduced labor force participation and may have built a smaller portfolio of assets. Because this individual will have lower asset income than a healthy person, he or she will be less likely to retire, other things equal. Thus, chronic poor health may lead to opposing effects on the labor supply of the elderly. In my empirical analysis, I use data on adults aged 51 [...] 61 from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to study asset accumulation and retirement behavior of the chronically ill. I find that for 90 % of individuals with chronic health problems, asset accumulation is sufficiently reduced to delay retirement. The needs of this group have not been addressed by researchers or policy makers discussing critical issues surrounding poor health and retirement...|$|R
