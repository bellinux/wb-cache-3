25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was felt}} sharply in New England, though the date recorded {{for the event}} was 26 January 1663, as New England was using the Julian calendar at the time. A church record entry made by Reverend S. Danforth from Roxbury, Massachusetts (~ 600km from the CSZ) indicated the initial shock was felt around 6 pm that evening and several more shocks followed the next morning. On the shores of Massachusetts Bay, the tops of chimneys were broken on houses and pewter (a <b>malleable</b> <b>metal</b> alloy) was jarred from shelves. This level of damage {{is consistent with a}} modified Mercalli intensity of VI though this may have been because the early colonials had the capability of producing only relatively weak mortar. Using this MMI value and the distance from the epicenter one can estimate the magnitude of the earthquake using published intensity-attenuation relations. In a June 2011 report on the earthquake that was published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, John E. Ebel, a professor and researcher at Boston College, used these known relations that apply to earthquakes in northeastern North America and determined the magnitude to be 7.3 – 7.9.|$|E

50|$|A foil is a {{very thin}} sheet of metal, usually made by {{hammering}} or rolling. Foils are most easily made with <b>malleable</b> <b>metals,</b> such as aluminium, copper, tin, and gold. Foils usually bend under their own weight and can be torn easily. The more <b>malleable</b> a <b>metal,</b> the thinner foil {{can be made with}} it. For example, aluminium foil is usually about 1/1000 inch (0.03 mm), whereas gold (more malleable than aluminium) can be made into foil only a few atoms thick, called gold leaf. Extremely thin foil is called metal leaf. Leaf tears very easily and must be picked up with special brushes.|$|R

500|$|Tin, for example, has two allotropes: tetragonal [...] "white" [...] β-tin and cubic [...] "grey" [...] α-tin. White tin {{is a very}} shiny, ductile and <b>malleable</b> <b>metal.</b> It is {{the stable}} form at or above room {{temperature}} and has an electrical conductivity of 9.17 × 104S·cm−1 (~1/6th that of copper).

Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalized, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak.

2500|$|For joining complex {{injection}} molded thermoplastic parts, {{ultrasonic welding}} equipment {{can be easily}} customized to fit the exact specifications of the parts being welded. The parts are sandwiched between a fixed shaped nest (anvil) and a sonotrode (horn) connected to a transducer, and a ~20 kHz low-amplitude acoustic vibration is emitted. (Note: Common frequencies used in ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics are 15kHz, 20kHz, 30kHz, 35kHz, 40kHz and 70kHz). When welding plastics, the interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the melting process. One of the materials usually has a spiked energy director which contacts the second plastic part. The ultrasonic energy melts the point contact between the parts, creating a joint. This process is a good automated alternative to glue, screws or snap-fit designs. [...] It is typically used with small parts (e.g. cell phones, consumer electronics, disposable medical tools, toys, etc.) {{but it can be}} used on parts as large as a small automotive instrument cluster. Ultrasonics {{can also be used to}} weld metals, but are typically limited to small welds of thin, <b>malleable</b> <b>metals,</b> e.g. aluminum, copper, nickel. [...] Ultrasonics would not be used in welding the chassis of an automobile or in welding pieces of a bicycle together, due to the power levels required.|$|R

40|$|AbstractUltrasonic welding offers {{ability to}} weld thin layers of <b>malleable</b> <b>metals</b> at low {{temperature}} and low power consumption. During ultrasonic welding, intensive material interactions occur {{due to the}} severe plastic deformation (SPD) and frictional heat generation, {{which leads to the}} microstructural change. Different grain microstructures have been observed after different ultrasonic welding conditions. Theory of the microstructural evolution was for the first time hypothesized as three regimes, namely SPD, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and grain growth according to the material thermomechanical loading conditions. A novel metallo-thermo-mechanically coupled model was developed to model the temperature-dependent mechanical deformation and microstructural evolution during the ultrasonic spot welding process. The numerical analysis was carried out with a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element model using DEFORM 11. 0. The material constitutive model considered cyclic plasticity, thermal softening and acoustic softening. Dynamic recrystallization and grain growth kinetics laws were applied to simulate the microstructural evolution under different welding time durations. The simulation results demonstrated that the essential characteristics of the deformation field and microstructure evolution during ultrasonic welding were well captured by the metallo-thermo-mechanically coupled model. The numerical framework developed in this study {{has been shown to be}} a powerful tool to optimize the ultrasonic welding process for its mechanical properties and microstructures...|$|R

50|$|When a {{material}} {{has reached the}} limit of its strength, it usually has the option of either deformation or fracture. A naturally <b>malleable</b> <b>metal</b> can be made stronger by impeding the mechanisms of plastic deformation (reducing grain size, precipitation hardening, work hardening, etc.), {{but if this is}} taken to an extreme, fracture becomes the more likely outcome, and the material can become brittle.

50|$|This silvery, <b>malleable</b> other <b>metal</b> is {{not easily}} {{oxidized}} in air and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion. The firstalloy, used in large scale since 3000 BC, was bronze, an alloy of tin and copper. After 600 BC pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85-90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony and lead, was used for tableware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century. In modern times tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin/lead soft solders, typically containing 60% or more of tin. Another large application for tin is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of its low toxicity, tin-plated metal is also used for food packaging, giving the name to tin cans, which are made mostly of steel.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} behaviour of <b>malleable</b> <b>metals</b> in tumbling mills. Much of the work focused on lead: shots, flattened shots and fragments were ground in three different laboratory mills. Testwork with fragments was repeated {{in the presence of a}} brittle and harder mineral phase (95 % silica, 5 % lead) and for copper (100 % copper). The transfer of particles across size classes and the loss of weight because of smearing on the mill shell and grinding media were measured. Microhardness tests confirmed that lead did not work-harden during grinding. The transfer across size classes was modelled with various first order differential equations describing flattening, folding, cold-welding and actual breakage. Model parameters were estimated using a least-square minimization criterion. When more than one model was fitted to a given data set, the one whose phenomenological basis was closest to the dominant transfer mechanisms observed almost always yielded the best data fit. The dominant mechanism was very dependent on the type of metal ground, its particle size and shape, the grinding intensity generated by the tumbling mill and the presence of a hard, brittle phase. Flattening, responsible for the transfer to coarser size classes, generally dominated over folding, the mechanism accountable for the transfer to finer size classes (other than breakage). Breakage was favoured over flattening and folding when grinding finer and softer particles,in a high impact environment, or in the presence of a hard, brittle mineral phase. Loss of weight due to smearing significantly increased when grinding a softer mineral in a mill with a rough inner shell, or when particle breakage took place. A methodology based on the Laboratory Knelson Concentrator was developed and tested to estimate the breakage function and gravity recoverability of gold flakes. Progeny from the breakage of gold particles was shown to be highly gravity recoverable, more than 90 % above 0. 025 mm. The breakage function was non-normalizable, with a large b$ sb{ rm i+ 1,i}$ component, because of folding...|$|R
