Herbivores with physical problems are isolated in the facility to be checked by the vets. One of the corners of the enclosure is chosen mainly to keep visitors away from the treated animals. Kraals have been created in the enclosures of spotted deer, blackbuck, sambar, nilghai, barking deer, hog deer, brow-antlered deer, <b>moufflon</b> and bison. To make the animals get accustomed to the kraal, the feed is kept inside the premises. Apart from treating animals, the kraal also acts as a place for isolating animals in rut. For example, during mating season, males often fight with each other leading to problems for the veterinarians. To overcome this, the males are kept in kraals in isolation from other males. Kraals also help research scholars in observing and recording the movement and other activities of the animal, thus helping with studying their behavioural pattern.|$|E

The genotypes of 801 sheep representing 10 different breeds and crossbreds were analysed using real-time PCR allele discrimination method. The combination of point mutations of the three codons (136, 154 and 171) created twelve different genotypes in the PrP locus classified into five categories of risk. The highest frequency for the ARR/ARR genotype was characteristic of the Pogórze and Berrichon du Cher breeds (72. 22 % and 63. 25 %, respectively).

40|$|Bronchiolo-alveolar {{carcinoma}} {{has been}} described in man and in several animal species, including cattle, dogs, opossums, goats and sheep. In sheep, a bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma, known as ovine pulmonary carcinoma (OPC), is caused by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), an exogenous type D retrovirus. In the mid- 1980 s, a severe {{outbreak of a disease}} resembling OPC was described in captive Sardinian <b>moufflon</b> (Ovis musimon). In the present study, the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of nucleic acids extracted from archival material established that JSRV was associated with OPC in affected <b>moufflon.</b> JSRV was detected in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical and in-situ PCR demonstrated that in the lungs, JSRV proviral DNA was localized in transformed and untransformed type II pneumocytes and in the alveolar macrophages.

40|$|A pool of scrapie-infected sheep brains {{was used}} to spike mix-tures of porcine bone and intestine. These were {{processed}} in pilot-scale facsimiles of 12 rendering procedures that were in use within the European Union in 1991, and three that were not. Meat and bone meal, and tallow, were produced from the rendered tissues. Suspensions of all the meat and bone meal samples, {{and two of the}} tallow samples were assayed in mice for scrapie infectivity. Neither of the tallow samples had any detectable infectivity but the meat and bone meal samples were positive, except for those produced by processes involv-ing exposure to hyperbaric steam. In addition, greaves were produced from the scrapie-spiked raw materials by an atypi-cal low-temperature process and subjected to solvent extrac-tion with hot heptane. The treated greaves were then exposed to steam to drive off residual solvent. Although the starting titre of infectivity in these greaves was low, there appeared to be no reduction in infectivity {{as a result of the}} treatments with hot heptane and steam. However, there was no detectable infectivity in the meat and bone meal prepared from the greaves produced by the atypical low-temperature process after it had been exposed to hyperbaric steam. SCRAPIE is a fatal neurological disease that affects sheep and goats (and occasionally <b>moufflon)</b> in many parts of the world, and it has been endemic for at least two centuries among sheep in Great Britain and some of the countries of western Europe (Parry 1983). The disease is caused by an unconventional transmissible agent that is uncharacterised but has unusual properties, including a high resistance to inactivation (Taylor and others 1994). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a scrapie-like disease of cat-tle, the first sporadic cases of which are suspected to have occurred in England in 1985 (Wells and others 1987).

40|$|Ovine {{pulmonary}} adenocarcinoma is a contagious {{viral disease}} of sheep {{that results in}} pulmonary neoplasia in some animals. The economic impact can be significant: up to 80 % of the flock can be lost upon first exposure to the virus, with continuing losses that may {{be as high as}} 20 % each year in some flocks. Excluding this disease from a flock is difficult, in part because no diagnostic test can detect animals in the preclinical stage. No effective treatment or vaccine is available, and eradication is challenging. Currently, ovine pulmonary adenomatosis exists in most sheep-raising areas of the world, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia. Iceland is the only country to have successfully eradicated this disease. Etiology Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma results from infection by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), which is also known as the pulmonary adenomatosis virus. This virus {{is a member of the}} genus Betaretrovirus in the Retroviridae. Species Affected Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma mainly affects domesticated sheep (Ovis aries). Sardinian <b>moufflon</b> (Ovis musimon, a species of wild sheep) can also become ill, and a few cases have been reported in domesticated goats. Geographic Distribution Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be found in sheep-raising countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This disease does not occur in Australia or New Zealand. It has been eradicated from Iceland. Transmission Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be transmitted by the respiratory route, probably via aerosols or droplets. Infectious virus occurs in the respiratory exudates of infected sheep. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus can be found in tumors, lung fluids, peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs; before tumors develop, the virus is detected in lymphoreticular cells. Horizontal transmission has been demonstrated among sheep of all ages, but neonates seem to be particularly susceptible to infection. There is no evidence that in utero transmission is significant in the epidemiology of this disease; however, recent studies suggest that JSRV might be spread in milk or colostrum. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus does not survive for long periods in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Scrapie is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease, {{caused by}} a prion, that affects sheep and occasionally goats. In sheep, the animal’s genotype strongly influences the incidence of disease. Genetically susceptible sheep do not become ill for several years; however, scrapie is progressive and fatal once the symptoms develop. Typically, scrapie results in production losses and an annual mortality rate of 3 - 5 % in a flock; in severely affected flocks, the annual mortality rate can reach 20 %. The presence of this disease can result in trade sanctions, and many countries are conducting control or eradication programs. As a result of scrapie surveillance, an atypical form of this disease has recently been detected in many countries in Europe, {{as well as in}} the United States. This novel form of scrapie, which was first reported from Norway in 1998, is called Nor 98. Nor 98 scrapie can occur in sheep that are genetically resistant to classical scrapie. The tissue distribution of the Nor 98 prion differs from that of the classical prion protein, and some testing protocols must be modified to detect this form. Other atypical forms of scrapie have also been found in some countries. Etiology Scrapie is a member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unconventional disease agents. These agents are resistant to the treatments that ordinarily destroy bacteria, spores, viruses and fungi. They are generally thought to be prions, although a minority opinion suggests that TSEs may be caused by virinos or retroviruses. Prions are infectious proteins that seem to replicate by converting a normal cellular protein into copies of the prion. This cellular protein, which is called PrPc, is found on the surface of neurons. The scrapie prion, which is a pathogenic isoform of PrPc, is designated PrPSc. Strain variations occur in the scrapie prion. Atypical scrapie prions including the Nor 98 agent have also been found. Species Affected Scrapie affects sheep, goats, and <b>moufflon</b> (Ovis musimon). Rats, mice, hamsters, monkeys and a variety of other laboratory and wild animals can be infected experimentally. The Nor 98 form of scrapie has been reported in sheep and goats...|$|E
