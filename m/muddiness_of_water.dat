The stream was running strong, and I kept under water, swimming down with it as hard as I possibly could. When I came up I glanced back at the tree I had quitted. The lions were gathered on the bank, roaring loudly and lashing their tails with every sign of excitement, looking at the water where they had seen me disappear. I have not the least doubt but that they would have jumped in after me, had I not dived I took this in at a glance, and then went under again, and so continued diving until I was sure that I was beyond the sight of the lions; then I made for the bank as quickly as possible.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{introduces}} a concept called task muddiness as a metric for higher intelligence. Task muddiness {{is meant to}} be inclusive and expendable in nature. The intelligence required to execute a task is measured by the composite <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> the task described by multiple muddiness factors. The composite muddiness explains why many challenging tasks are muddy and why autonomous mental development is necessary for muddy tasks. It facilitates better understanding of intelligence, what the human adult mind can do, and how to build a machine to acquire higher intelligence. The task-muddiness indicates a major reason why a higher biological mind is autonomously developed from autonomous, simple-tocomplex experience. The paper also discusses some key concepts that are necessary for understanding the mind and intelligence, such as intelligence metrics, the mode a task is conveyed to the task executor, a human and a machine being a joint task performer in the traditional artificial intelligence (AI), a developmental agent (human or machine) being a sole task performer, and the need for autonomy in tasknonexplicit learning...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide the best for their kids, parents make great efforts to build up a {{greenhouse}} for the "healthy" development of their offspring. Over-parenting and helicopter parenting are emerging parenting practices that intrude into family life. Over-protection, over-nurturance, over-involvement and "hovering" have become more and more popular in raising kids. This paper reviews the concepts related to "over-parenting" as well as its impacts on adolescent psychosocial development. The review shows that "over-parenting" and "helicopter parenting" adversely influence adolescents' psychosocial development. Conceptual gaps in the literature are identified, which include the <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> the concepts of "over-parenting," lack of a developmental perspective in the conceptualization, inattention to cultural and contextual diversity, and failure to explore the family dynamics and paternal roles in overprotected families. The methodological gaps of a lack of longitudinal and qualitative studies in this area and problems of using a single informant perspective are highlighted. Finally, future directions on research and practice are suggested. Department of Applied Social Sciences 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcm...|$|R

True it is Qui bene distinguit bene docet; yet fastidiousness is a wretched travelling companion; and the best guide to which, in matters of taste, we can entrust ourselves, is a disposition to be pleased. For example, if a traveller be among the Alps, let him surrender up his mind to the fury of the gigantic torrents, and take delight in the contemplation of their almost irresistible violence, without complaining of the monotony of their foaming course, or being disgusted with the <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> the water--apparent even where it is violently agitated.

60|$|I {{waited for}} her reappearance. It was one peculiarity, {{distinguishing}} Zenobia from most of her sex, that she needed for her moral well-being, and never would forego, {{a large amount of}} physical exercise. At Blithedale, no inclemency <b>of</b> sky or <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> earth had ever impeded her daily walks. Here in town, she probably preferred to tread the extent of the two drawing-rooms, and measure out the miles by spaces of forty feet, rather than bedraggle her skirts over the sloppy pavements. Accordingly, in about the time requisite to pass through the arch of the sliding-doors to the front window, and to return upon her steps, there she stood again, between the festoons of the crimson curtains. But another personage was now added to the scene. Behind Zenobia appeared that face which I had first encountered in the wood-path; the man who had passed, side by side with her, in such mysterious familiarity and estrangement, beneath my vine curtained hermitage in the tall pine-tree. It was Westervelt. And though he was looking closely over her shoulder, it still seemed to me, as on the former occasion, that Zenobia repelled him,--that, perchance, they mutually repelled each other, by some incompatibility of their spheres.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, as he {{sat there}} under the rain, he {{made up his mind}} with a {{clearness}} that certainly had in it nothing <b>of</b> that <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> mind of which he had often accused himself. Indeed, the intellect of this man was essentially clear. It was simply his memory that would play him tricks,--his memory as to things which at the moment were not important to him. The fact that the dean had given him money was very important, and he remembered it well. But the amount of the money, and its form, at a moment in which he had flattered himself that he might have strength to leave it unused, had not been important to him. Now, he resolved that he would go to Dr. Tempest, and that he would tell Dr. Tempest that there was no occasion for any further inquiry. He would submit to the bishop, let the bishop's decision be what it might. Things were different since the day on which he had refused Mr. Thumble admission to his pulpit. At that time people believed him to be innocent, and he so believed of himself. Now, people believed him to be guilty, and it could not be right that a man held in such slight esteem should exercise the functions of a parish priest, let his own opinion of himself be what it might. He would submit himself, and go anywhere,--to the galleys or the workhouse, if they wished it. As for his wife and children, they would, he said to himself, be better without him than with him. The world would never be so hard to a woman or to children as it had been to him.|$|R
50|$|Stage wash in {{professional}} audio is unwanted sound entering a microphone on stage during a concert. Stage wash {{can come from}} the main public address system, from monitor loudspeakers, from instrument amplifiers such as for guitars and keyboards, and from loud instruments such as drums. The effects of stage wash in an overall mix may include a sense <b>of</b> <b>muddiness</b> and lack <b>of</b> detail, as other sounds modulate the desired sound. High-pass filters on mixing consoles can help reduce problems with stage wash by greatly attenuating low frequencies. Other methods of combating stage wash include using hyper-cardioid microphones, exchanging monitor loudspeakers for in-ear monitors, putting instrument amplifiers offstage or in isolation boxes, isolating drum bleed with drum glass and gobos, and employing directional methods and models in the subwoofers and main loudspeaker system.|$|R

60|$|The reader must not, {{from any}} {{testimony}} of mine, contract a dislike towards our slumberous stream. In {{the light of}} a calm and golden sunset it becomes lovely beyond expression; the more lovely for the quietude that so well accords with the hour, when even the wind, after blustering all day long, usually hushes itself to rest. Each tree and rock and every blade of grass is distinctly imaged, and, however unsightly in reality, assumes ideal beauty in the reflection. The minutest things of earth and the broad aspect of the firmament are pictured equally without effort and with the same felicity of success. All the sky glows downward at our feet; the rich clouds float through the unruffled bosom of the stream like heavenly thoughts through a peaceful heart. We will not, then, malign our river as gross and impure while it can glorify itself with so adequate a picture of the heaven that broods above it; or, if we remember its tawny hue and the <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> its bed, let it be a symbol that the earthiest human soul has an infinite spiritual capacity and may contain the better world within its depths.

I am perhaps setting. I am myself inclined to think so, and, like a day that has been admired as a fine one, the light of it sets down amid mists and storms.

This would be nothing, providing that I could count on these two books having a sale equal to their predecessors; but as they do not deserve the same countenance, they will not and cannot have such a share of favour, and I have only to {{hope that they will}} not involve the Waverley, which are now selling 30,000 volumes a month, in their displeasure.

6000|$|To Elizabeth-Jane {{the time}} was a most triumphant one. The freedom she experienced, the indulgence with which she was treated, went beyond her expectations. The reposeful, easy, {{affluent}} life to which her mother's marriage had introduced her was, in truth, {{the beginning of a}} great change in Elizabeth. She found she could have nice personal possessions and ornaments for the asking, and, as the mediaeval saying puts it, [...] "Take, have, and keep, are pleasant words." [...] With peace of mind came development, and with development beauty. Knowledge--the result of great natural insight--she did not lack; learning, accomplishment--those, alas, she had not; but as the winter and spring passed by her thin face and figure filled out in rounder and softer curves; the lines and contractions upon her young brow went away; the <b>muddiness</b> <b>of</b> skin which she had looked upon as her lot by nature departed with a change to abundance of good things, and a bloom came upon her cheek. Perhaps, too, her grey, thoughtful eyes revealed an arch gaiety sometimes; but this was infrequent; the sort of wisdom which looked from their pupils did not readily keep company with these lighter moods. Like all people who have known rough times, light-heartedness seemed to her too irrational and inconsequent to be indulged in except as a reckless dram now and then; for she had been too early habituated to anxious reasoning to drop the habit suddenly. She felt none of those ups and downs of spirit which beset so many people without cause; never--to paraphrase a recent poet--never a gloom in Elizabeth-Jane's soul but she well knew how it came there; and her present cheerfulness was fairly proportionate to her solid guarantees for the same.|$|R
