5000|$|In 1906, Paul Otlet and Robert Goldschmidt {{proposed}} the livre microphotographique {{as a way}} to alleviate the cost and space limitations imposed by the codex format. [...] Otlet’s overarching goal was to create a World Center Library of Juridical, Social and Cultural Documentation, and he saw microfiche as way to offer a stable and durable format that was inexpensive, easy to use, easy to reproduce, and extremely compact. In 1925, the team spoke of a massive library where each volume existed as <b>master</b> <b>negatives</b> and positives, and where items were printed on demand for interested patrons.|$|R

In the earliest days the <b>negative</b> <b>master</b> was used as a mold to press records sold to the public, but as demand for mass production of records grew, another step was added to the process.|$|R
