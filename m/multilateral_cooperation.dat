5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of <b>multilateral</b> <b>cooperation</b> following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

40|$|This article puts {{forward a}} number of {{arguments}} why trade openness might promote <b>multilateral</b> environmental <b>cooperation.</b> Most of these arguments are grounded in the substantive self-interest of the trading country. It tests the proposition using a range of proxy variables for general trade openness as well as specific export interests. The article examines whether countries open to trade {{are more likely to}} have signed three recent multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and {{are more likely to have}} ratified early on another three agreements with quasi-universal membership. After controlling for income, political freedom and population size, the empirical estimations find some weak evidence in favour of a possible synergy between trade openness and <b>multilateral</b> environmental <b>cooperation.</b> World Trade Organisation membership as well as general export openness go hand in hand with greater willingness to participate in <b>multilateral</b> environmental <b>cooperation</b> in some cases. However, whether specific trade interests promote or hinder <b>multilateral</b> environmental <b>cooperation</b> depends on whether the relevant agreement is likely to threaten or accommodate the interests of exporting countries.

Furthermore, in a repeated game of tariff <b>cooperation,</b> <b>multilateral</b> free trade is easier to sustain under MFN punishments relative to discriminatory ones. This conclusion holds even when tariff discrimination {{takes the form of}} bilateral trade agreements.

Cuba is obliged to make payments in cash and in advance, and is precluded from obtaining credit funding, even from private sources.

Cuba cannot use its own merchant fleet for transporting these goods, but has {{to make use of}} vessels from third countries, primarily the United States. Payments are made through banks in third countries, since direct banking relationships are prohibited. The Cuban delegation concluded that restrictions on importing medical products were [...] "so extensive that they make such imports virtually impossible". The World Health organization/PAHO and UNFPA concurred that it was impossible for Cuba to purchase equipment, medicines and laboratory materials produced by the United States or covered by United States patents, even though those products were purchased through <b>multilateral</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Cuba was not able to purchase the isotope I-125 that is used to treat eye cancer in children.

While a cost benefit analysis of these interests explain institutional design at a specific point in time it offers an incomplete picture of institutional development over time.
