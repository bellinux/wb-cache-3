Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin.

The purpose is to discern which <b>of</b> the stated <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> enables an acquiring company in better hedging the risk of adverse selection that arises due to the information asymmetry {{on the part of the}} acquiring company regarding the true value of assets of the target company. It has been found that <b>of</b> the three <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment,</b> earnouts provide best hedge to the acquiring companies for minimizing the risk of adverse selection in cross border acquisitions. The reason being earnouts enable an acquiring company resolve the problem of over-valuation and that of non-performance by making part payment contingent on the ex post performance of the target company as well as by retaining target company’s managers respectively. The paper recommends earnouts as a valuable strategy for the acquiring companies from India as well as other emerging markets for their future global acquisitions as these companies usually end up overpaying the target companies due to lack of expertise in crossborder acquisitions.

This is a neglected research area, but not totally ignored. Early research compared cash, cheque and credit card payment modes and concluded that credit card use equates with increased spending. Whether the change is due to access of credit or the absence of cash is not wholly ascertained. The absence of cash implies that the physicality <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> may have a bearing on purchase decisions. Both <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> lack ‘transparency’.
