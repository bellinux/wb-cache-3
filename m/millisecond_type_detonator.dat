50|$|An IED {{has five}} {{components:}} a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED {{designed for use}} against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a shaped charge that creates an explosively formed penetrator.

50|$|The EBW and the slapper {{detonator}} are the safest known <b>types</b> of <b>detonators,</b> {{as only a}} very high-current fast-rise pulse can successfully trigger them. However, they require a bulky power source for the current surges required. The extremely short rise times are usually achieved by discharging a low-inductance, high-capacitance, high-voltage capacitor (e.g., oil-filled, Mylar-foil, or ceramic) through a suitable switch (spark gap, thyratron, krytron, etc.) into the bridge wire. A very rough approximation for the capacitor is a rating of 5 kilovolts and 1 microfarad, and the peak current ranges between 500 and 1000 amperes. The high voltage may be generated using a Marx generator. Low-impedance capacitors and low-impedance coaxial cables are required to achieve the necessary current rise rate.|$|R

5000|$|This <b>type</b> of <b>{{detonator}}</b> {{was invented}} in the 1940s {{as part of the}} Manhattan project to develop nuclear weapons. The design goal was to produce a detonator which acted very rapidly and predictably. Both Match and Solid Pack type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation. Explosive bridgewire or EBW detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, [...]04 inch long, [...]0016 diameter, (1 mm long, 0.04 mm diameter). Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high firing current that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating. That electrical driven explosion then fires the detonator's initiator explosive (usually PETN).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results of induced stress measurement in damaged regions around a test tunnel excavated by smooth blasting. The blasting design was for a test tunnel excavation 8 m 2 in cross section, with an advance per round of 2. 5 m. Five rounds were performed by two <b>types</b> of <b>detonators,</b> each with a large-hole cut and perimeter holes in a 0. 4 m spacing. One is electronic detonators (EDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the right half, the other is conventional pyrotechnical long period delay detonators of 0. 25 deci second interval (PDs) which were used in the holes on the perimeter of the left half. In order to compare the delay accuracy of two detonators, a series of stress measurement was performed from the tunnel wall. It was made clear that EDs had little influence on remaining rock and surface, and PDs generated a damaged region. The damaged region generated by PDs was within 1 m from the tunnel surface and vertical stress hardly acted on the damaged region. ...|$|R

It uses a vertical spindle, dry grinding technique to decrease grinding time of some diallyl phthalate (DAP) detonator heads with wire inserts and to eliminate the problem of error in repeatability which is characteristic of the manual grinding process. The semiautomatic grinder is essentially air-operated with electrical control and was primarily designed using standard components for ease of manufacture and maintenance. As development of the semiautomatic grinder progressed, DAP detonator heads with wire inserts ground using the manual surface grinder were evaluated along with the same <b>type</b> of <b>detonator</b> heads ground using the semiautomatiac grinder.

40|$|Nickel {{hydrazine}} nitrate is {{an energetic}} coordination compound having explosive properties in between that of primary and secondary. This compound {{was used to}} develop a new <b>type</b> of <b>detonator</b> by replacing the sensitive primary explosive, lead azide in conventional detonators and keeping RDX (cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) as the output secondary explosive. The detonator consists of three regions, viz., initiation, deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), and output. The initiation and the electrical rating of 1 A/ 1 W no-fire were achieved using a suitable squib. The DDT and the output were taken care of, by pressing requisite quantities of Nickel hydrazine nitrate and RDX, respectively at required densities in a stainless steel stem channel. The detonator assembly involves crimping the squib and the stem channel in a stainless steel housing and applying a suitable resin at the crimped-end for leak tightness. The output was assessed from the dent depth on aluminium plate, volume expansion on lead block, and by achieving veloctiy of detonation of 8200 m/s in mild detonating cords, containing 0. 95 g/m of RDX, which indicates full-order detonation. The detonators were tested at system level and found to perform satisfactorily...|$|R
5000|$|The mortar {{could be}} fired {{in one of}} two ways: either {{electrically}} or manually (by the pull of a lanyard). And each method had its own <b>type</b> of <b>detonator</b> (electrical or friction). Electrical firing required first that the crew attach a wire to the electrical detonator, which protruded from the breech block. Second, the crew had to connect the firing cable coming out of the pit floor to the carriage of the individual mortar, out in the pit. Third, the circuit switch (usually located {{on the wall of the}} pit near the data booth) leading to the individual mortar had to be thrown into the closed (firing) position. Finally, the firing magneto, which was mounted on a special [...] "shoe", often on the wall of the pit near the data booth, had to be cranked up and then released, sending the firing current out to the pit. Depending on the switch settings, the mortars in a given pit could be fired one at a time or all together. Lanyard firing had fewer fail-safe features, and was accomplished by a crewman who stood well behind the breech and pulled smartly on the lanyard to fire the individual mortar.|$|R
