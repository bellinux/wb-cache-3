40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} demands on many <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> outside the centre(s) {{of scientific knowledge}} production to publish their research in international scholarly journals, the support for such academic writing for publication is uneven at best. Existing English for research publication purposes (ERPP) instruction typically aims to aid <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> in achieving genre-based expectations and/or navigating the submission and review process, but it often {{does not address the}} politics of English-language knowledge production. In this paper, informed by an empirical case study and a theory building perspective, we address the need for a sustained program of courses/workshops for <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> in the (semi-) periphery and propose a means of operationalizing a critical-pragmatic approach to such course/workshop content. Our empirically-driven model is informed by the results of a recent case study investigation into an intensive ERPP intervention designed to address multilingual Spanish-speaking L 1 scholars’ challenges with writing research articles for publication in indexed (Web of Science) international scientific journals. Our model lays the groundwork for a more critical approach to ERPP pedagogy, one that attempts to attend more fully to the needs of <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> within an asymmetrical market of global knowledge production...|$|E
40|$|Failure {{to publish}} {{articles}} in the dominant Anglophone scientific journals has implications for <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> ’ future careers and for the global dissemination of scientific knowledge. Despite {{the importance of this}} topic, there have been few studies of the perceptions of <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> engaged in this process. In an effort to close this gap, an online questionnaire was emailed to 153 German-L 1 scholars at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland. The 46 respondents ranked 'writing reader-friendly texts ' as their number one problem in writing scientific publications in English, followed by 'using correct grammar'. Reader-friendliness was defined by the majority of the respondents as 'writing in a clear and simple style'. The questionnaire also revealed some interesting differences between the views of novice and more experienced scholars regarding the role of different sources of feedback in helping them overcome these problems. The results from the questionnaire will be explored in more detail in follow-up interviews...|$|E

In addition, multilingualism concerns what people do with language, not what languages do to people. Yet research focus remains on multilinguals' languages, as if languages existed despite their users. This book redresses these paradoxes. <b>Multilingual</b> <b>scholars,</b> teachers and speech-language clinicians from Europe, Asia, Australia and the US contribute the first studies dedicated to multilingual norms, those found in real-life multilingual development, assessment and use.

Drawing on text, ethnographic, and corpus {{data from a}} longitudinal study in four national contexts, we argue that citation practices vary significantly along geolinguistic lines – that is, {{in terms of who}} gets cited, where and by whom – and that such differences are highly consequential. We argue that <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> face particularly difficult decisions which can in part be understood as a tension between the politics of knowledge building and knowledge measuring.

We discuss the differential value attached to publications for different communities and how such value is sustained through the rewards systems in which scholars work. We offer brief profiles of three scholars from the study to illustrate how they negotiate academic and professional interests.

Evidence from a longitudinal “text-ethnographic” study exploring how 50 psychology and education scholars in southern and central Europe {{are responding to}} such pressure indicates that individual linguistic and rhetorical competence alone are usually insufficient for securing publication in English-medium journals. Rather, scholars’ accounts demonstrate that participation in academic research networks functions as a key resource for publishing. This article examines the importance of networks and tracks how scholars gain access to and participate in them. We present ‘network histories’ that map out the network participation of four scholars, foregrounding several core dimensions: local and transnational, formal and informal, strong and weak, durable and temporary. Our findings suggest that strong, local, durable networks are crucial to enabling scholars’ participation in transnational networks, which support their publishing in both English and local languages. Findings contribute directly to our understandings about academic publishing in a global context and to broader debates about the efficacy of initiatives for increasing research collaboration such as those sponsored by the EU Framework Programmes. We conclude by briefly considering implications for supporting multilingual scholars’ publication and programmes aimed at increasing collaboration...|$|E

Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 2014, 14 : 72 - 83. Research publication in the international arena, is crucial for <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> in most disciplinary areas. For many, among them Spanish scholars, it still represents a considerable hurdle. The findings we report here {{are part of a}} wider research project involving a large online survey of scholars at five universities and research institutions in Spain.

The present paper compares the results for scholars in History and Psychology. Through analysis of quantitative and comment data, we show how the motivations of these scholars with regard to research publication in the two languages work together with the strategies and resources available to them to determine language selection. We also review their experience of training in research writing and their willingness to pursue further training. Although the two groups of scholars differ in terms of attitudes to publication in English, they share a willingness to negotiate the challenges presented by institutional constraints, making strategic decisions about the choice of language in which to publish and their own language development...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that English as the language of international scholarship represents a more complex picture in the {{humanities and social sciences}} (HSS) than in science and engineering, with <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> in the HSS often negotiating international engagement and local commitment by publishing both in English and their first language. However, the tension in the negotiation is likely to grow with the continuous push toward the globalization of the academia which is having an enormous impact upon the academics in research universities. Following up on an earlier study with mainland Chinese HSS scholars (Flowerdew & Li, 2009), in the present interview-based study we aim to find out how their counterparts in Hong Kong perceive the implications of international publication versus local publication. The findings of the study indicate that the privilege attached to publishing in internationally indexed journals stands out as a leading factor orienting the Hong Kong scholars toward writing in English and employing various strategies to facilitate successful publication. However, there is also clear resistance toward this assessment-driven publication regime and some participants, apart from publishing mainly in English, also publish in Chinese for the purpose of serving their target audiences at the local/regional level. We end by calling for efforts to widen the regional impact of the existing locally-published journals and to enhance collaboration in developing regional databases that are competitive at the international level. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Software {{is often}} {{developed}} with an implicit bias that people only speak one language, and that language should be English. Reference management software is no different. Scholars often have {{sources of information}} in multiple languages, and properly citing them creates a set of additional rules to remember and challenges for software to overcome to properly document {{the nature of the}} source materials. Different scholarly journals may have different expectations for how to format non-English sources. The demands can also vary based on the actual language of the source. The use of reference management software is well documented, but the nature of non-English sources and how they need to be handled have rarely been considered. I conducted a survey with 182 participants across disciplines to discover how they keep track of and manage their non-English sources for their English language publications. Multilingual researchers have unique challenges that have not been investigated in depth, nor are they a monolithic group who have a universal set of needs. Uncovering these issues shows that multilingual researchers shows that reference management software cannot accommodate multilingual matters such as saving the vernacular text as well as a transliteration and/or translation. There is however one instance of reference management software that does accommodate for these special needs, yet based on the sample from my study, is almost entirely unknown in the field. Other challenges to the adoption and effective use of multilingual reference management software include how scholars perceive the capabilities of the various software options, their own personal habits which are very difficult to change, if they even need to be changed, and the learning curve of the software itself. Looking at these issues together, I would like to show what the concerns and challenges of <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> are, what are the potential software solutions, and how, even if you yourself are not a multilingual librarian, can still support faculty, students, and other researchers with an interest in adopting software for their multilingual research needs...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} nonnative English speaking (NNES) {{faculty and students}} in engineering respond to language variation and how that response influences their teaching and learning of academic writing. Using grounded theory approach to analyzing data gathered from multiple rounds of interview, writing samples, informal discussions, and class observation among ten participants, the study draws on and responds to two related bodies of scholarship in composition studies and writing in the disciplines (WID). Contrary to claims in much of current scholarship on engineering writing, {{the findings of this}} study show that in spite of subscribing to views about language and writing that writing scholars consider problematic (as illustrated in chapter two), engineering faculty use a range of effective practices for teaching writing. Some of these practices include letting students use writing for different contexts and purposes, providing feedback, and integrating writing as a means of academic and professional development. Thus, the study argues that WID research and programs should recognize and build on best practices on the ground before confronting the problematic views. The findings also clearly show that because NNES engineering faculty and students subscribe to their discipline 2 ̆ 7 s discourse about the transparency of language, transience of learning to write, and universality of standard academic English (as demonstrated in chapter three), they typically reject any language variation, through which current scholarship expects that they, as multilingual individuals, resourcefully negotiate meaning. Consequently, in chapter four, the study proposes that in order to promote more complex understanding and practice of language and writing in engineering, writing programs should first understand the dynamics of how <b>multilingual</b> <b>scholars</b> exercise power and agency in their disciplines and professions through prevailing monolingual policies and practices. The study concludes by using the theoretical framework of chapter four in order to recommend a number of practical strategies toward building effective WID programs (in chapter five). WID literature that has started responding to the monolingual dynamics of the discipline is briefly reviewed, and suggestions are made for further study on how to confront the monolingual myths that affect academic and professional communication in engineering...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{ground-breaking}} research {{in the study of}} languages in doctoral education. It argues for democratizing the production and dissemination of original contributions to knowledge through activating and mobilizing multilingual Higher Degree Researchers’ (HDRs) capabilities for theorizing through them using their full linguistic repertoire. This paper contributes to this study’s development of post-monolingual research methodology which provides a theoretic-pedagogical framework for multilingual HDRs (a) to use their full linguistic repertoire in their research; (b) to develop their capabilities for theorizing and (c) to construct potentially valuable theoretical tools using metaphors, images, concepts and modes of critique. This paper is based on a longitudinal program of collaborative research whereby monolingual Anglophone and multilingual HDRs jointly developed their capabilities for theorizing through producing Anglo-Chinese analytical tools, and the associated pedagogies for using their languages in doctoral research. This longitudinal research program has been undertaken in the field of doctoral education to further a defining feature of democracy, namely linguistic diversity. This research has been conducted with the aims of promoting the multilingualism of Australian universities and activating linguistic communities of scholars to use their full linguistic repertoire in their research. The main finding arising from this program of research has been the development of post-monolingual research methodology which (a) uses the divergences within and between languages to undertake theorizing and (b) in co-existence with the tensions posed by monolingualism, especially the insistence on using extant theories available in only one language. Doctoral pedagogies of intellectual/racial equality provide multilingual HDRs with insights into the debates about the geopolitics governing the use of languages in the production and dissemination of theoretical knowledge and the capabilities for theorizing. Often, from an English-only monolingual mindset, difference and divergence are seen as a recipe for deficits and dissonance. However, this paper challenges such mistaken beliefs by showing that multilingual HDRs can deepen and extend their capabilities for theorizing by using their own linguistic repertoires. Post-monolingual research methodology is to be of enormous benefit to <b>multilingual</b> researchers and <b>scholars</b> engaged in intellectual labor in predominantly English-only monolingual universities...|$|R
