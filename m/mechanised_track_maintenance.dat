40|$|It is {{believed}} that there is merit in researching how the management of <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> is organized in the United Kingdom, in particular by Network Rail, and then evaluating how this {{can be applied to}} the benefit of Indonesian Railways. The purpose of this research was expected to provide recommendations for management improvement of <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> by researching the <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> management system in Network Rail. This research study is based on secondary data. The analysis was conducted by using comparison method which compares the British Railways management and Indonesia railway management related to <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> management. The <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> management system was studied by using Network Rail. The results were compared with <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> management system in Indonesia. The comparison will provide the data differences that evaluated so the problem can be identified. The final result of this analysis was the identification of problems and improvisation that can be done for the development of <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> management in Indonesia. Several management issues have been mapped to several groups: finance management, structure organization, and asset management. From the problems that have been mapped, some improvements are recommended as monopolist authority restriction, maintenance system contract extension, re-structuring organization hierarchy, business plan consideration, track monitoring strategy arrangement, and condition based maintenance strategy adoption...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. {{railroad}} companies spend {{billions of}} dollars every year on railroad <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{in order to ensure}} safety and operational efficiency of their railroad networks. Besides maintenance costs, other costs such as train accident costs, train and shipment delay costs and rolling stock maintenance costs are also closely related to <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities. Optimizing the <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> process on the extensive railroad networks is a very complex problem with major cost implications. Currently, the decision making process for <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> planning is largely manual and primarily relies on the knowledge and judgment of experts. There is considerable potential to improve the process by using operations research techniques to develop solutions to the optimization problems on <b>track</b> <b>maintenance.</b> In this dissertation study, we propose a range of mathematical models and solution algorithms for three network-level scheduling problems on track maintenance: track inspection scheduling problem (TISP), production team scheduling problem (PTSP) and job-to-project clustering problem (JTPCP). TISP involves a set of inspection teams which travel over the railroad network to identify track defects. It is a large-scale routing and scheduling problem where thousands of tasks are t...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of railway <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> planning is concerned with reducing the irregularities in the measured track geometry to maintain safety against derailment and ride quality standards. To increase productivity, various <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> planning tools {{have been developed to}} assist engineers with this task, however these have traditionally only considered the track in isolation. This paper describes a new off-line tool VIM (VAMPIRE Interaction Manager) for assisting with railway <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> in which the dynamic behaviour of railway vehicles is also considered. Using vehicle response data from VAMPIRE ® (railway vehicle dynamics simulation software), track locations exhibiting the greatest risk of derailment can be identified and <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> prioritised accordingly. By considering the vehicle and track as a system problems can be identified that would not normally be apparent by considering the track geometry alone. <b>Track</b> <b>maintenance</b> can be planned in a more systematic manner leading to greater passenger safety and reduced operating costs. Simulated vehicle response data, used by the new tool, can be generated for user specified running conditions. Vehicle type, wheel/rail contact and running speed can be varied, allowing risk assessments to be produced for current and future vehicles using predetermined exceedence thresholds. In addition to its use by <b>track</b> <b>maintenance</b> engineers, this tool can also be used by vehicle manufacturers to assess derailment risk and offers the potential to assess ride performance, track forces and other vehicle/track interaction issues of new vehicle designs...|$|R
