40|$|Nowadays, {{a lot of}} {{development}} of Web applications use prototyping approach such as throw-away prototyping and evolutionary prototyping. In order to fulfill the users' requirements, developers need {{to communicate with the}} users, therefore prototyping is widely used in software development to assist these developers. As we develop Web application and release them as a number of versions or releases of prototype, it constantly requires changes to evolve and meet users' specific requirements. Thus, prototyping approach may cause more maintenance cost to be incurred due to scope creep during software development. In addition, it provides the challenges to a maintenance team who is mostly not the actual development team, to manage and track maintenance process of such Web applications. This paper proposes a user-centered technique for managing and tracking <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> in a Web application. We anticipate that the proposed technique can assist maintainers to manage and track modification of a Web application in more effective and efficient manner by capturing, classifying and validating the enhancement requests, problem report and <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> directly from the users during the prototyping process itself. This in turn will avoid unexpected <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> once we release the Web application and to allow the tracing of both enhancement and problem report during prototyping and <b>modification</b> <b>requests</b> and problem report during maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Software {{evolution}} {{refers to}} the process of adapting software systems to <b>modification</b> <b>request</b> caused by requirements and technology changes that occur after the initial system delivery. Prior to implementing a requirements change, decision-makers must determine if a <b>modification</b> <b>request</b> is feasible and the cost associated with it. Traditional modification analysis approaches have focused mainly on the analysis of source code to determine the potential impact of a change. In this research, we present a novel approach to support modification analysis early in the software evolution lifecycle thus allowing management, who are not necessarily familiar with the detailed system implementation, to determine the impact associated with a <b>modification</b> <b>request.</b> In our research we develop several analysis techniques to support the system evolution at the requirements level, namely impact analysis at the requirements level, prediction of regression testing effort, feature interaction analysis including detecting potential bad smells of the requirements, in order to provide support for improving the comprehensibility and maintainability of requirements. In our approach, we combine Use Case Maps, as a notation to model requirements, with Formal Concept Analysis in order to explore the applicability of Formal Concept Analysis during modification analysis at the requirements level. We implemented a proof of concept tool and several case studies are presented to demonstrate the applicability of our methodology...|$|R

In this paper, we contribute a pluggable framework to anticipate coordination requirements based on change scope prediction, supporting interchangeable change scope prediction algorithms either solely based on architecture or co-change patterns. Using <b>modifications</b> <b>requests</b> from eleven releases of the open source Hadoop project, we evaluate our approach by comparing predicted coordination requirements with actual bug tracker communications. In our evaluation, we obtain an average precision of 68 % and recall of 48 % in accurately predicting coordination requirements, showing that this approach has the potential to assist managers in anticipating problematic coordination when performing software modifications.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} Russian {{policy regarding}} prospective U. S. {{decisions on the}} deployment of a limited National Missile Defense (NMD) system. Russia's critical position on U. S.

Russia's responses to date-attempts to influence international opinion and the policies of foreign governments against U. S. NMD-reflect these concerns and the limits of Russia's economic and military power. Russia's apparent strategy is threefold: to engage in sharp rhetoric with the United States about NMD, while not crossing the line of an embarrassing showdownto capitalize on America's unwillingness to assert its predominance in world affairsand to persuade the West to subsidize the Russian economy in order to allay its own fears of instability in Russia. Russia's options are to accept the ABM Treaty <b>modifications</b> <b>requested</b> by the United States and thereby legitimize U. S. NMD under the treaty or to refuse such modifications, in which case Washington may exercise its legal option to withdraw from the treaty. In either case, Russia will seek to charge America a high political price for pursuing NMD. Russia's nuclear arsenal and potential for political upheaval suggest that it is in the U.

40|$|Abstract Background Clinical trials {{throughout}} the world must be evaluated by research ethics committees. No one has yet attempted to clearly quantify {{at the national level}} the activity of ethics committees and describe the characteristics of the protocols submitted. The objectives of this study were to describe 1) the workload and the activity of Research Ethics Committees in France, and 2) the characteristics of protocols approved on a nation-wide basis. Methods Retrospective cohort of 976 protocols approved by a representative sample of 25 / 48 of French Research Ethics Committees in 1994. Protocols characteristics (design, study size, investigator), number of revisions requested by the ethics committee before approval, time to approval and number of amendments after approval were collected for each protocol by trained research assistant using the committee's files and archives. Results Thirty-one percent of protocols were approved with no <b>modifications</b> <b>requested</b> in 16 days (95 % CI: 14 – 17). The number of revisions requested by the committee, and amendments submitted by the investigator was on average respectively 39 (95 % CI: 25 – 53) and 37 (95 % CI: 27 – 46), per committee and per year. When revisions were requested, the main reasons were related to information to the patient (28 %) and consent modalities (18 %). Drugs were the object of research in 68 % of the protocols examined. The majority of the research was national (80 %) with a predominance of single-centre studies. Workload per protocol has been estimated at twelve and half hours on average for administrative support and at eleven and half hours for expertise.
