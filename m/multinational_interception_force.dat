2500|$|Luttwak's defence-in-depth {{hypothesis}} {{appears to}} rely on two basic features: (a) deepened fortified border zones: [...] "It became necessary to build forts capable of sustained resistance, and these fortifications had {{to be built in}} depth, in order to protect internal lines of communication. Instead of a thin perimeter line on the edges of provincial territory, broad zones of military control had to be created..." [...] "The thin line of auxiliary 'forts' and legionary 'fortresses' was gradually replaced by a much broader network of small fortified hard-points (in the hands of) scattered groups of static limitanei..." [...] The hypothesis thus predicts the establishment of fortifications well into the interior of border provinces, rather than just a string of bases right on the border line; (b) the use of the comitatus praesentales (imperial escort armies) as <b>interception</b> <b>forces</b> to deal with incursions. In this regard, it is to be noted that Luttwak terminates his analysis in 350, before the establishment of the regional comitatus.
