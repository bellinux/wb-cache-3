25|$|On {{the night}} of the crash, Saint-Donat villagers {{remember}} hearing the noise of a large aircraft passing overhead and moments later an impact. Jos Gaudet, then on duty in fire tower number four at Archambault lake did see the light emitted by the burning wreckage on top of the mountain but thought of it as the reflection of the sun on a moist rocky slope. On the morning of the crash Gaudet and Georges Moore took a boat around lake Archambault to look for signs of wreckage such as oil slicks or debris, believing that the aircraft had fallen in the water. Later on, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> went to the town hall to alert the military authorities but his claim was dismissed as being implausible.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Vincent Canby called Moonraker [...] "one {{of the most}} buoyant Bond films of all. Almost {{everyone}} connected with the movie is in top form, even <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore.</b> Here he's as ageless, resourceful, and graceful as the character he inhabits." [...] Canby subsequently said the film was, alongside Goldfinger, {{the best of the}} series.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Mark Melton Moore, {{the brother}} of real-life victim Polly Ann Moore, took Pierce to court for $1.3 million for invading his privacy. He claimed his sister, who was portrayed as [...] "Emma Lou Cook" [...] in the film, was {{depicted}} [...] "as {{a high school dropout}} and a woman with loose and low morals; when in fact none of such was true." [...] In real life, Polly Ann Moore graduated high school at the age of 16. The court denied his claim in 1979. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> filed again in 1980 to the Texas Supreme Court. The Sixth Court of Civil Appeals in Texarkana agreed again that the film's producers did not invade his privacy and that he was not entitled to any money.|$|E

Our study used 47 randomly selected clusters of 40 households each. In his critique, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> did not note that our survey sample included 12,801 people living in 47 clusters, which is the equivalent to a survey of 3,700 randomly selected individuals.

2500|$|In 1934, Mrs. Talcott again {{followed}} Moore when he relocated Heaven City to a 362-acre farm in Mukwonago, Wisconsin. [...] Mrs. Talcott {{stayed at}} Moore's side {{until his death}} in 1963 at age 82. [...] In 1977, The Milwaukee Journal published a feature story on Mrs. Talcott, who, at age 95, was still living at Heaven City. [...] Mrs. Talcott told the newspaper, [...] "Mr. Moore was a teacher of metaphysics ... <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> was a wizard with people. [...] He knew the workings of the mind."

50|$|Aziz and {{the women}} explore the caves. In the first cave, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Moore</b> is {{overcome}} with claustrophobia. But worse than the claustrophobia is the echo.

50|$|The initial {{exploration}} of the caves shows that those included in the party should be limited when <b>Mrs</b> <b>Moore</b> suffers from claustrophobia and the noise from the large entourage echoes exponentially inside the caves. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Moore</b> encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their {{exploration of}} the caves alone with just one guide.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{with deep}} regret {{that we have}} to record the death, at the age of 87, of Mr James Moore, who, on May 31, 1868, won the first cycle race ever held – a 25-kilometre event at Ville de St Cloud... The part that James Moore played in the history of cycle racing, while of brief duration, was {{historically}} of the greatest importance. Between 1873 and 1877 he won five international championships and smashed short-distance records galore. All these races, including the championship of the world races at the Molineux [...] Grounds, Wolverhampton, in 1874, were ridden on a graceful old Ordinary. <b>Mr</b> <b>Moore</b> retained an interest in cycling until his death.

2500|$|Talcott's {{complaint}} against {{the leader of}} a [...] "love cult" [...] drew coverage in newspapers across the country, with Talcott billed as the [...] "nemesis of the love cult," [...] and the [...] "leader of the famous 'husband's rebellion.'" [...] At the resumed hearing on August 22, Judge John Henderson heard testimony from several witnesses. [...] Hattie Cartwright testified that Moore was a fake healer, noting that he claimed to be [...] "greater than Christ" [...] and {{to have the ability to}} raise the dead, yet he [...] "couldn't raise hair on his own bald spot." [...] Another witness testified that his wife referred to Moore as [...] "my master." [...] Mrs. Talcott's sister testified as to the hold Moore held over her sister:"Mrs. Talcott and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> and I went to lunch at the Hamilton club. [...] He informed me it was only a courtesy when people talked to you to look them in the eyes. [...] I said to myself right then, 'hypnotism.' [...] My sister sat as a broken flower. [...] I'll never forget how she looked." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{conflict}} between Moore and DC Comics {{was the subject}} of an article in The New York Times on 12 March 2006, five days before the US release. In the New York Times article, Silver stated that about 20years prior to the film's release, he met with Moore and Dave Gibbons when Silver acquired the film rights to V For Vendetta and Watchmen. Silver stated, [...] "Alan was odd, but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this. I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today, not realising that he wouldn't." [...] Moore did not deny this meeting or Silver's characterisation of Moore at that meeting, nor did Moore state that he advised Silver of his change of opinion in those approximately 20years. The New York Times article also interviewed David Lloyd about Moore's reaction to the film's production, stating, [...] "Mr. Lloyd, the illustrator of V for Vendetta, also found it difficult to sympathise with Mr. Moore's protests. When he and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> sold their film rights to the comic book, Mr. Lloyd said: [...] "We didn't do it innocently. Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the Dead Sea Scrolls." ...|$|E

6000|$|We are {{far from}} {{thinking}} of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Moore</b> as Lord Byron either did or does; not so degradingly as his Lordship did in 1810; not so extravagantly as he does in 1813.
