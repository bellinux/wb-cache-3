5|$|Various {{methods were}} used to build mottes. Where a natural hill could be used, scarping could produce a motte without the need to create an {{artificial}} <b>mound,</b> but more commonly much of the motte {{would have to be}} constructed by hand. Four methods existed for building a <b>mound</b> and a tower: the <b>mound</b> could either be built first, and a tower placed on top of it; the tower could alternatively be built on the original ground surface and then buried within the mound; the tower could potentially be built on the original ground surface and then partially buried within the <b>mound,</b> the buried part forming a cellar beneath; or the tower could be built first, and the <b>mound</b> added later.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, <b>Mound</b> Builders erected a large Indian <b>Mound</b> at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) {{from the head of}} the Ohio. The Indian <b>Mound,</b> a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.|$|E

The Norton <b>Mounds</b> site covers {{approximately}} 55 acres and is currently closed to the public. The Norton <b>Mounds</b> were once {{part of a more}} extensive grouping of <b>mounds</b> that included the Converse <b>Mounds</b> (20KT2), a grouping of nearly thirty <b>mounds</b> near what is today downtown Grand Rapids. The Converse <b>Mounds</b> were razed in the nineteenth century as Grand Rapids expanded, and no trace remains of them today.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of large, truncated earthwork pyramid <b>mounds,</b> or platform <b>mounds.</b> Such <b>mounds</b> were usually square, rectangular, or occasionally circular.

50|$|Most {{unusual is}} the {{proximity}} of the <b>mounds</b> to each other — while many groups of <b>mounds</b> are known in Ohio, they are not typically connected at the base as these two <b>mounds</b> are; only the Arledge <b>Mounds</b> and the McMurray <b>Mounds,</b> which straddled the border between Franklin and Madison counties, are known to have been conjoined. Although these <b>mounds</b> have not been excavated, archaeologists have proposed that they were built by the Adena culture, who are known to have built the McMurray <b>Mounds.</b>|$|R

It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the <b>mound</b> above the pass and a round earth platform upon the <b>mound</b> may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E

50|$|While these <b>mounds</b> {{are perhaps}} not as famous as burial <b>mounds,</b> like their European analogs, Native American <b>mounds</b> {{also have a}} variety of other uses. While some prehistoric cultures, like the Adena culture, used <b>mounds</b> {{preferentially}} for burial, others used <b>mounds</b> for other ritual and sacred acts, as well as for secular functions. The platform <b>mounds</b> of the Mississippian culture, for example, may have supported temples, the houses of chiefs, council houses, and may have also acted as a platform for public speaking. Other <b>mounds</b> would have been part of defensive walls to protect a certain area. The Hopewell culture used <b>mounds</b> as markers of complex astronomical alignments related to ceremonies.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to various Mainland {{sites such as}} Knowes of Trotty, Kirbuster Hill and the impressive Plumcake <b>Mound</b> near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday, Warness on Eday, the remains of two houses on Holm of Faray, and a burnt <b>mound</b> and farmstead on Auskerry.|$|E
5|$|Interest {{continued}} in {{the origins of the}} castle, which for a period were forgotten. Local medieval tradition suggested that the <b>mound</b> had been made by the devil, after he completed the dykes at Narborough and Newmarket, but by the Victorian period academics had concluded that the <b>mound</b> was either of Celtic or Norman origin, with late Victorian scholars correctly concluding that the Norman period was the most likely. Other traditions claimed that the <b>mound</b> covered a palace filled with treasure, or six silver bells from Thetford Priory. Archaeological investigations into Red Castle by G. Knocker between 1957–58, and during the early 1960s by R. R. Clarke and Barbara Green revealed the design and date of this castle site.|$|E

50|$|Earthen <b>mounds,</b> {{including}} circular and horseshoe-shaped <b>mounds,</b> {{are found}} in Japan away from the estuaries that supported shell <b>mounds.</b> Evidence of pit houses in and adjacent to circular and horseshoe-shaped earthen <b>mounds</b> has been cited {{as evidence that the}} <b>mounds</b> resulted from normal settlements rather than construction for ceremonial purposes. Repeated construction of pit houses would have left dirt piled up around a village. This explanation of the development of <b>mounds</b> as a result of digging pit houses has been extended to also explain circular and horeshoe-shaped shell <b>mounds.</b> There are few earthen ring or horseshoe-shaped <b>mounds</b> in the United States, but Woodland period rings in the United States incorporated more soil into the rings, blurring the distinction between earthen and shell rings.|$|R
40|$|Student paper, EEB 4839, 2010 We {{explored}} {{qualitative and}} quantitative approaches to evaluate {{the impact of the}} plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius) <b>mounds</b> on the plant community.

We categorized <b>mounds</b> as ―new,‖ ―abandoned,‖ or ―old,‖ measured the width of the abandoned <b>mounds,</b> and noted the different plant species present on the <b>mounds</b> and the control plots. Our results indicated that species richness is significantly increased on and near gopher <b>mounds,</b> and overall, gopher <b>mounds</b> significantly alter local plant community.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the impact of termite <b>mounds</b> on the {{vegetation}} of mopane (Colophospermum mopane) savanna in Northwestern Namibia. This area is a part of a mopane zone with a high distribution of termite <b>mounds.</b> Much previous research on termite <b>mounds</b> has been conducted in humid tropical areas. Such studies have found termite <b>mounds</b> to have high fertility and thus to be a key factor in vegetation dynamics. Few studies, however, have focused on the relationship between termite <b>mounds</b> and vegetation in arid or semi-arid areas, and the impact of the <b>mounds</b> on savanna vegetation remains unclear. In the area where I conducted research, almost all termite <b>mounds</b> were found together with trees. The composition of tree species on the <b>mounds</b> reflected the composition in the surrounding vegetation, but Combretum spp. dominated slightly more than other species. The rate of withered trees, especially Terminalia prunioides, was higher on the <b>mounds</b> than on the ground. Moreover, termite <b>mounds</b> were extracted as one of the parameters of tree withering from a statistical model analysis using a generalized linear model (GLM). As a result of this study, termite <b>mounds</b> appeared to act as negative factors in vegetation growth on or near the <b>mounds.</b> The <b>mounds</b> should, therefore, be taken into account as one of the factors that disturb vegetation dynamics in mopane savanna...|$|R

5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a <b>mound.</b> Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a <b>mound</b> and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest <b>mound</b> to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
