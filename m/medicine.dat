40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} current use of {{conventional}} and complementary <b>medicines</b> in Australians aged ≥ 50 years. Design, setting and participants: Cross-sectional postal survey {{sent to a}} random sample of 4500 Australians aged ≥ 50 years between June 2009 and February 2010. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of <b>medicines</b> use, reasons for <b>medicines</b> use and sources of <b>medicines.</b> Results: Response rate was 37. 3 %. <b>Medicines</b> use was very common; 87. 1 % of participants took one or more <b>medicines</b> and 43. 3 % took five or more in the previous 24 hours. Complementary <b>medicines</b> were used by 46. 3 % of participants, 87. 4 % of whom used both conventional and complementary <b>medicines.</b> The most commonly used <b>medicines</b> were antihypertensive agents (43. 2 % of participants), natural marine and animal products including fish oil and glucosamine (32. 4 %) and lipid-lowering agents (30. 4 %). Doctors recommended 79. 3 % of all <b>medicines</b> and 93. 0 % of conventional <b>medicines.</b> Pharmacists commonly recommended occasional <b>medicines</b> (ie, as needed), while friends, family and media most often influenced use of complementary <b>medicines.</b> Conclusions: The use of multiple <b>medicines</b> is common and higher than reported in the 1995 National Health Survey. Today, much <b>medicines</b> use is to prevent future disease by influencing risk factors. High levels of polypharmacy highlight the need to support the safe and effective use of <b>medicines</b> in the community.

Methods: The concordance between generic <b>medicines</b> {{listed in the}} WMLEM 2009 (standard reference list) and the LPLEM 2006 (comparator list) was evaluated. Results: The total number of Basic Essential <b>Medicines</b> (BEMs) listed on the WMLEM 2009 was 347. The total number of generic <b>medicines</b> listed on the LPLEM was 584. Although the LPLEM has more listed <b>medicines,</b> only 270 (77. 6 %) of BEMs from the WMLEM were listed as available. However, 25 of the 77 missing <b>medicines</b> were deemed to have appropriate alternatives. A total of 52 <b>medicines</b> from the WMLEM 2009 were therefore missing from the LPLEM. Discrepancies compared to the WMLEM 2009 were identified in 15 out of 29 therapeutic sections. The highest discrepancy rate from the WMLEM 2009 was in the anti-infective section (35 missing <b>medicines).</b> Missing BEMs were noted in many subclassifications of the anti-infective <b>medicines</b> section, but omissions were particularly prevalent in the antibacterial <b>medicines</b> subsection (11 missing <b>medicines).</b> Antituberculosis medications had the highest discrepancy rate for antibacterial BEMs with one-third of the single <b>medicines</b> recommended by the WHO in the WMLEM 2009 not listed on the LPLEM.
