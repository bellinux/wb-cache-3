This would be a {{significant}} drop in sales from his debut album, whose 147,000 units are {{more than twice as}} much as the sequel.

2500|$|Following his conversion, Miller's Deist friends soon {{challenged}} him {{to justify his}} newfound faith. He did so by examining the Bible closely, declaring to one friend [...] "If he would give <b>me</b> <b>time,</b> I would harmonize all these apparent contradictions to my own satisfaction, or I will be a Deist still." [...] Miller commenced with Genesis 1:1, studying each verse and not moving on until he felt the meaning was clear. In this way he became convinced firstly, that postmillennialism was unbiblical; and secondly, that the time of Christ's Second Coming was revealed in Bible prophecy.|$|E

He was educated at Keble College, Oxford, reading Diplomacy and Social Studies, {{which he described}} as [...] "a course that allowed <b>me</b> <b>time</b> to play cricket in my third year". He played for Oxford University 1990–1993, captaining in the Varsity Match in 1993 and scoring 115 and 53 not out. During this time Gallian frequently opened both the batting and the bowling, though his medium-paced bowling has since only been used in partnership-breaking capacities. Gallian began his first-class career at Lancashire and his innings of 312 was the highest score at Old Trafford.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{confirmed}} in April 2012 that Bianca, Carol and Bianca's children would depart Albert Square later that month for six months. Explaining her temporary departure, Palmer said, [...] "I'm only taking time off now {{because this is}} when the kids' holidays are. When I re-signed my contract I said, 'I love EastEnders, but I love my kids more'. Listen, I can imagine staying in the show till I'm in my 60s, but it's a full-on job. If they hadn't been prepared to give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> off, I'd have had to choose the kids." [...] Bianca left the show on 27 April 2012 when she {{was sent back to}} prison for attempting to steal from the market before returning 27 November of that year.|$|E
2500|$|Closing out 2013, B.O.A.T.S. II: <b>Me</b> <b>Time</b> {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Albums of the Year" [...] lists by major publications. The album was ranked at number 30 on Spins list of the 50 best albums of 2013. Complex positioned it at number 29, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "overall, the album is surprisingly creative, jumping from cabana bounce like [...] "Feds Watching" [...] to the widescreen blockbuster [...] "I Do It" [...] to the New Orleans throwback [...] "Used 2" [...] to ratchet noir like [...] "Livin'" [...] with Iamsu!. It's tough to imagine 2 Chainz making a particularly ambitious record. His entire style is, after all, firmly middlebrow: never pretentious, but nor is it especially interested in the populist vanguard. While the ideal 2 Chainz album {{would probably be a}} hits compilation, B.O.A.T.S. II: <b>Me</b> <b>Time</b> is probably the next best thing: a consistent, front-to-back listen that celebrates a very particular aspect of hip-hop as a craft." [...] Rolling Stone positioned in at number 11 on their list of the best hip hop albums of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "2 Chainz was inescapable this year, cresting on a string of show-stealing features and an impactful 2012 debut. On his follow-up, trap's reigning king expanded his domain: the Pharrell-produced [...] "Feds Watching" [...] evoked late-1970s car-chase melodrama as a soundbed for 2 Chainz' luxury raps, and album cuts explored a breadth of topics from fallen homies ("Live and Learn") to on-demand sextapes ("Netflix"). The man's chains still glisten on the cover, but his charisma shone the brightest." [...] The album was ranked at number 21 on XXLs list of the best albums of 2013.|$|E

2500|$|B.O.A.T.S. II: <b>Me</b> <b>Time</b> {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 16 reviews. Jordan Sargent of Spin said, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II ups the production values {{like a true}} sequel should. Whereas his last album felt at times like a mixtape in expensive packaging, the beats here are full and gleaming with the fruits of success." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said [...] "his second LP further displays his knack for playfully hollering about money like he's the first guy who ever had so much paper he couldn't fold it. He tries on some new looks here but nothing slows down the self-described Black Unicorn's scene-chewing charisma." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Garnder evoked that [...] "2 Chainz wraps his gritty flow in bright, crisp arrangements. And he's not afraid to wax lyrical now and then, notably on the pining, lushly orchestrated [...] "Black Unicorn"." [...] Dan Rys of XXL stated, [...] "while the album is billed as the continuation of his first record, last year’s No. 1-debuting Based on a T.R.U. Story, Chainz also branches out a bit {{in a way that}} makes the album feel like he’s bringing at least some new records to the table while remaining stylistically consistent." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now said, [...] "Sonically, B.O.A.T.S. II is slightly more adventurous than its predecessor thanks to Pharrell’s funky summer jam [...] "Feds Watching" [...] and the EDM-influenced [...] "Netflix", a Diplo-Fergie tag team. 2 Chainz likes to offset the raunchy with the heartfelt, but when the tone shifts to earnestly autobiographical, he sounds derivative." [...] Paul Cantor of Vibe stated, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II: <b>Me</b> <b>Time</b> really does what it set out to do—prove that 2 Chainz, while occasionally unfocused, is more than a guy who just makes trap music. Make no mistake, there’s a lot of that here, and he’s almost got that formula down to science." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, after 2 Chainz has {{completed}} his concert tour, {{in support of}} his debut album Based on a T.R.U. Story (2012), he would head back to the studio to begin working on his second album. In November 2012, Epps revealed, that he was three songs deep into his second studio album. The album's estimated turn into the label date, which was set to be released in April 2013. In February 2013, while 2 Chainz and Pharrell Williams were recording for his first single, titled [...] "Feds Watching", Epps announced that he was halfway completed with his second album. On May 23, 2013, 2 Chainz announced that he was no longer be doing any features for the time being, and his second studio album will be released on September 10, 2013. On June 15, Epps announced the title as B.O.A.T.S. II: <b>Me</b> <b>Time.</b> [...] "B.O.A.T.S." [...] is a backronym for [...] "Based on a T.R.U. Story".|$|E
2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", {{but it was}} something he looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility on my shoulders is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains why he was so tired." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1784, when Penniman was 24, she {{was living}} {{with her mother and}} step-father, Mr. Wall, in Westminster. He was {{probably}} attempting to recover some of the lost possessions of the family. But Brush’s vast acres had been sequestered to the state; even his library and furniture had been scattered. Gen. Ethan Allen, who had frequent occasion to visit Westminster, fell a victim to Penniman's charms. Gen. Allen was at this time a widower of 47, with three or four children. On February 16th, Gen. Allen entered Margaret’s apartment, and found Penniman in a morning gown, standing on a chair, arranging china on the shelves of a china-closet. After a few words of greeting, he said to her, “Fanny, if we are ever to be married, now is the time, for I am on my way to Arlington." [...] “Very well,” she replied, “if you will give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> to get my josie.” In a very short time she was ready, and together they entered the breakfast-room where a group of judges were sitting. Chief-Justice Robinson was asked by Allen to perform the ceremony. To Robinson’s astonished question “When?” the answer was “Now.” The judge suggested that {{it was a matter of}} importance which required due consideration, to which Allen replied, implying that with such a bride long consideration was unnecessary. The ceremony was performed, interrupted at one point by Allen, who when called upon to promise “agreeable to the law of God,” exclaimed after a glance out the window, [...] "The law of God as written in the Book of Nature? Yes, go on." [...] The ceremony concluded, the bride’s trunk and guitar-case were placed in the sleigh and they left for their home in Arlington.|$|E
2500|$|Julian Benbow of The Boston Globe said, [...] "Whether it’s his horn-laced lead single, [...] "Feds Watching", with Pharrell or the warped, taunting [...] "Where U Been" [...] {{manufactured}} by Mike Will Made It, {{he knows what}} hits sound like. And the only fingerprint mentor Kanye West left was the cover art. The advice he gave 2 Chainz was that with a bottomless well of charisma, {{it was time to}} stand on his own, and he’s right." [...] Kyle Kramer of Pitchfork stated, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II is an album that feels happy just to exist, a rejection of the modern idea that album releases are serious events and all the tracks that sound like they were fun to make get relegated to bonus cuts or mixtapes." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "2 Chainz is still a punch-line rapper at heart, but B.O.A.T.S. II adds some Bootsy Collins charisma and ambitious ringleader style to his discography." [...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews.com stated, [...] "On [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time" [...] he's put a lot more thought and effort into the construction and execution of an album. Instead of constantly rapping about spending money, he's spending a bit of [...] "Me Time" [...] and the end result is welcome progression." [...] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! stated, [...] "One thing's for certain: by the end of <b>Me</b> <b>Time,</b> the down-to-Earth, around-the-block-and-back 2 Chainz bores." [...] Omar Burgess of HipHopDX said, [...] "By now, most fans should know that 2 Chainz isn’t interested in providing the type of lyricism offered by emcees like Big Boi or Jay Electronica. Either way, this time around, his formula—catchy hooks, spit-take worthy one-liners and danceable, top-40 production—suffers from either overexposure or a lack of innovation." ...|$|E
