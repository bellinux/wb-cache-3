5|$|In 1976, Shulgin was {{introduced}} to MDMA by {{a student in the}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>chemistry</b> group he advised at San Francisco State University. MDMA had been synthesized in 1912 by Merck and patented in 1912 as an intermediate of another synthesis in order to block competitors, but was never explored in its own right. Shulgin went on to develop a new synthesis method, and in 1976, introduced the chemical to Leo Zeff, a psychologist from Oakland, California. Zeff used the substance in his practice in small doses as an aid to talk therapy. Zeff introduced the substance to hundreds of psychologists and lay therapists around the nation, including Ann (born Laura Ann Gotlieb), whom Alexander Shulgin met in 1979, and married in 1981. It was her fourth marriage, and she had had four children.|$|E

25|$|Max Jaffe was a {{distinguished}} 19th-century German biochemist, pathologist, pharmacologist, and professor. He {{was born on}} July 25, 1841, in what was formerly Grünberg, Silesia and is now Zielona Góra, Poland. While attending medical school at the University of Berlin, he studied under Ludwig Traube and Wilhelm Kühne. Afterward, he worked as an assistant in a medical clinic in Königsberg. There, he co-authored a paper on putrid sputum with Ernst Viktor von Leyden {{that led to the}} discovery of certain characteristic putrid processes in the lungs. After earning his degree in internal medicine, he served in the Franco-Prussian War and was decorated with the Iron Cross Second Class. The title of Extraordinary Professor of <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Chemistry</b> was awarded to him in 1872 and the following year he became the first Ordinary Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Königsberg. He was promoted to director of the Laboratory for Medical Chemistry and Experimental Pharmacology in 1878 and {{became a member of the}} Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina in 1882.

500|$|The {{compound}} {{thought to}} be responsible for the toxicity of raw L.torminosus is the pungent-tasting [...] velleral present at a concentration of 0.16mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a breakdown product of stearyl-velutinal. Broken lactifers—specialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex—leak the precursor chemicals whose breakdown products act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type sesquiterpene lactone 15-hydroxyblenninA is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various Lactarius species, such as blenninA in L.deliciosus and L.blennius, and lactarorufinN in Lactarius rufus. Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to defend against predation, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in <b>medicinal</b> <b>chemistry.</b>|$|E
