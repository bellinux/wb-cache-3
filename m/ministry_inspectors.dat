50|$|On September 11, 1991, {{the mine}} was opened to great local fanfare, but {{immediately}} problems began to surface, when multiple roof collapses occurred {{within the first}} few months. Two {{months prior to the}} opening, MLA Bernie Boudreau wrote to Nova Scotia Labour Minister Leroy Legere, asking why the mine was using potentially dangerous mining methods not approved for coal mining. The Labour Ministry gave Curragh Inc. a special permit to use these methods to tunnel until they reached the coal seam, but not actually mine coal. Legere was not aware that the company continued to use these methods, three months after the mine opened. Accusations were made by mine workers of company cutbacks in safety training and equipment and of negligent and outright criminal behaviour toward safety inspections. Miners complained about working in deep coal dust. In November 1991, coal miner Carl Guptill made safety complaints to Labour <b>Ministry</b> <b>inspectors,</b> but they were not investigated, and he was fired in January 1992 for making his claims.|$|E
5000|$|When Crawley arrives, Fritton {{takes her}} around the school: she finds the fourth form girls using the science lab to make gin, which Flash Harry (George Cole) sells for them; and the sixth form girls {{learning}} about French wine regions from the geography mistress. Florrie (Jill Braidwood), the school snoop, hears Arabella tell her father about a trial run {{the next day and}} after teasing the fourth form girls about what she has heard, is forced to tell them about the trial. The next morning Arab Boy goes through the trial run timed by the trainer, by Arabella with some other sixth form girls, and by a hidden group of fourth form girls. Now both the sixth and fourth form girls need to find out the weight of that day's jockey, stable boy Albert Faning (Michael Ripper): the sixth form girls have Amanda (Belinda Lee) seduce him to get his weight, while the fourth form girls calculate it. The result is that Arab Boy is sure to win the race. The fourth form girls ask Harry to place a bet for them on Arab Boy but, he tells them, they won't make much with the little more than £3 they have, even at the 10-1 odds. So, the girls ask Fatima if they can borrow her pocket money for the bet. Fritton is told by the bookkeeper that they have £400 in the bank and are £4000 in debt. When Fatima, accompanied by four girls, asks for the £100 that Fritton is holding for her, the girls explain that they want to place a bet on Arab Boy, who is a sure winner at 10-1 odds; Fritton doesn't give Fatima the money, but does get an idea. She summons Harry, who tells her that he places bets for the girls, and asks him to bet the school's remaining £400 on Arab Boy in order to win the £4000 needed to cover the school's debt. Arabella tells her father the disastrous news of Arab Boy's strength and suggests they [...] "nobble" [...] the horse, but Clarence rejects that idea. Arabella suggests he give it some thought and, should he change his mind, come to St Trinian's the next day, ostensibly for the field hockey match. Crawley and some of the sixth form girls are setting up the net for the match, when the girls run off. Crawley chases them and finds them, with two men and Miss Drownder, having a [...] "French lunch", as she later reports to Fritton. Fritton explains that she need not worry: the men are former <b>ministry</b> <b>inspectors</b> Eric Rowbottom-Smith (Guy Middleton), now the school's gardener, and Wilfred Woodley (Arthur Howard), the new fencing master. Before the match starts Arabella, with some of the field hockey team members, meets with Clarence and his partner Benny (Sidney James). They opt for Arabella's plan to [...] "borrow" [...] the horse until the race is over, which is overheard by Florrie, who is tortured by the fourth form girls for this information. When Crawley goes back to the match, Harry goes to Fritton with a letter he has stolen, which proves that Crawley is really Sgt. Gates. The next morning, with the stable boy's collusion, the horse theft is carried out - almost; in fact, the fourth form girls have taken him. Clarence and Benny are told by their henchman that when they went to get the horse, it was not at the stable. Fritton sees Maudie (Marigold Russell) riding Arab Boy up the stairs, and goes to the fourth form dorm to investigate. She finds the girls, Harry, and Arab Boy and insists they get the horse out of the school before dawn, when Fatima will pretend to find and return him. She gets the girls to promise to carry out this plan.|$|E

They had {{conducted}} plan excavation at important sites at Omani Dibba (large Bronze Age corridor tombs) and at al-Saffah (Early Iron Age (EIA) foundry site), the latter some 45 km east of the border to Abu Dhabi emirate in Mintiqah al-Dhahirah. The object of my visit (16. ‒ 20. 04. 2014) was to do first recording of the fascinating finds from al-Saffah. Of the numerous (667 registered) finds mostly in copper alloy from that site, I photographed, drew, and otherwise recorded 143, in order to judge {{the amount of time}} needed for the cataloguing. By May 2015, some 220 artefacts had been documented. Maurizio Tosi (Muscat) and Francesco Genchi (Bari) kindly provided me the site report and a first database of the finds. In 2014 the ministry had one third of the metal finds restored, which now can be drawn, photographed and otherwise studied. The site is of EIA date, to judge from the finds and radiocarbon dates. I took the opportunity together with <b>ministry</b> <b>inspectors</b> to visit the undocumented Samad Late Iron Age (LIA) settlement sites of al-ʿAtqiyah/J. Ṣunsunah and al-ʿAtqiyah/J. Nejd. Such are quite rare. A further visit from 03. ‒ 13. 12. 2014 allowed a long-desired opportunity to begin documenting other such sites at Ibrāʾ I 0052; Wadi Maḥram/Qariyat al-Saiḥ; al-Moyassar M 34, M 4304; Samad al-Shān S 01; S 07, SX; Ṭīwī/al-Jurayf tw 0002. Four selected LIA sites are described. Negar Abdali (Heidelberg) recorded key al-Saffah artefacts with a 3 D scanner curated in the new National Museum in Muscat. This project goes by the name of the Heidelberg University ‒ Ministry of Heritage and Culture Virtual Museum Project. Most interesting is the occurrence of the finds in {{what appears to be a}} single-period context. Never before have we had a context like this one. Artefacts of EIA and a few of pre EIA date evidently were taken as a source for metal production. Numerous new artefact classes occurred. Moreover, a large selection of miniature votive weapons occurred...|$|E
