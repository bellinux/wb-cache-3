[...] They were married [...] on 4 December 1933, after which they settled into a cottage at Strand-on-the-Green on the western edges of London.

Vienna was suggested by his friend Vernon Morris {{as a place to}} spend six months and train to be an eye surgeon. Doyle, however, found it too difficult to understand the German medical terms at the classes in Vienna and quickly quit his studies there. For the rest of his two-month stay in Vienna, he pursued other activities, such as ice skating with his wife Louisa and drinking with Brinsley Richards of the London Times. He also wrote The Doings of Raffles Haw. After visiting Venice and Milan, he spent a few days in Paris observing Edmund Landolt, an expert on diseases of the eye.

5000|$|Radermacher {{was born}} in The Hague, Holland. He was {{an officer of the}} Dutch East India Company (VOC) in Batavia (Jakarta) as well as a talented naturalist. Born into an {{influential}} Dutch family, his father was Jacob Cornelis Radermacher (1700-1748), who was treasurer-general to the prince. His uncle and his nephew were members of the Board of Directors of the VOC. In 1757, then only sixteen years old, he had traveled to Indonesian to work as a merchant for the VOC. On 21 May 1761 Jacob married Margaretha Sophia Verijssel. In 1762 Radermacher created a Freemasonic circle in Batavia becoming the first Freemasonic lodge in Asia. In 1763 he returned to Holland to continue his studies, and graduated in law at Harderwijk. After graduation on 13 June 1766 he established himself as a lawyer in Arnhem. After a short time, Radermacher made the decision to return to Batavia. On 20 December 1766 with his wife Margaretha and two sons Frans Reinier and Johannes Cornelis, they boarded the ship Tulpenburg bound for Indonesia. His youngest son, Johannes Cornelis, still an infant, died within one <b>month</b> <b>of</b> their <b>departure.</b> By 1776, Radermacher was promoted by the VOC to title of [...] "Extra-Ordinair Council of India".|$|R
5000|$|On his {{retirement}} the Guardian newspaper commented:- [...] "If {{he has a}} public profile at all it is because Byford came to symbolise the apparent excesses of top executive pay at the corporation. There he was, grey man with a job for life, half a million pounds in salary and, {{because he had been}} at the BBC so long without ever leaving, an uncapped two-thirds final salary pension entitlement and no obvious market rate comparator to justify such riches. It was very easy to put the question, as even many lower ranking BBC staff did - who else would pay Mark Byford £500,000 and for what? - knowing there was no very good answer." [...] However, the remainder of that article, written by media commentator, Steve Hewlett, suggested that his presence might be missed greatly at the Corporation. [...] "He made things happen and by common consent brought a firm moral sense to everything he did, rising above his own particular interests." [...] It went on to highlight how he was a stabilising influence on Director General, Mark Thompson.That opinion appeared highly prophetic {{in the light of the}} two major Newsnight scandals - concerning Sir Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine respectively - which engulfed the BBC within 18 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> Byford's <b>departure.</b> Both <b>of</b> those incidents led to widespread adverse criticism of high level management of journalism within the BBC and were surrounded by suggestions that the Director General of the day was not sufficiently informed about issues highly significant for the reputation of the Corporation.|$|R

50|$|Shah Jahan {{was finally}} roused {{to this new}} danger. He marched rapidly to the Deccan in 1635 and reached Daulatabad after {{crossing}} the Narmada on 4 January 1636. He decided to close in on Shahaji from all directions simultaneously and assigned definite tasks to his generals, putting Aurangzeb with the general execution of the measures determined upon. The sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda were forced into co-operation with the Moghals under a threat of complete extinction. Shahaji had collected under him 12,000 troops and he now started raiding Moghal territory moving between Junnar and Sangamner with the fort of Mahuli as {{the headquarters of the}} puppet Nizam Shah. Shaista Khan pursued Shahaji through Junnar and Sangamner. In the meanwhile the Bijapuris, finding resistance to the Moghals difficult, accepted the Moghal terms and deserted Shahaji. Qutb Shah of Golkonda was also coerced into submission; it was now left to Shahaji to bear the whole brunt of the relentless war with the Moghals. In the treaty with Bijapur, Adil Shah agreed to pay the Moghals 20 lakhs pagodas a year and, in return, received the south and south-east portions of the Nizamshahi dominions. This treaty sealed Shahaji's fate who was now cut off from the outer world and hemmed in at the fort of Mahuli. Adil Shah discreetly stepped in to save Shahaji from utter ruin and informed the emperor of his willingness to take away from Shahaji the five forts which he still held. Shah Jahan agreed to this proposal from Adil Shah and left for Agra on 11 July 1636 entrusting the conduct of the remaining campaign to his general Khan Zaman, his son Aurangzeb and Adil Shah. Within three <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> Shah Jahan, Shahaji came to his last grasp. At last he submitted, gave up his pretended king and with the consent of Shah Jahan entered the Bijapur service. The kingdom of Ahmadnagar was thus at an end. The subah seat was transferred to Daulatabad in 1636.|$|R
