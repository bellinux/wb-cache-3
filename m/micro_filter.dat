40|$|As the {{development}} of microelectronic technology, flat-panel microdisplay has become a reality. The microdisplay can be applied on both the projection display and personal viewer systems. The advantage of microdisplay are high resolution, high integration, high bandwidth and very low power consumption. The conventional microdisplay is a monochrome display. In order to achieve full color, color-separation prism and three panels are used for projection display, and color sequential technique is used for personal viewer. The former requires a very precise alignment of three panels. The latter requires a high data refresh rate and limits the resolution of microdisplay. In this thesis, I applied <b>micro</b> color <b>filters</b> on microdisplay to achieve full color. This technology was compatible with microelectronic technology. The line width of <b>micro</b> color <b>filter</b> can be as fine as 3 μm.

Current gasoline and gas production from fossil fuels are not sustainable since these sources are non-renewable and the combustion of these fuels {{will lead to the}} emissions of pollutant gases. Various alternatives of renewable energies and technologies have emerged to counteract the alarming global warming problem and also the scarcity of our primary sources of energy. One of these alternatives is through the production of renewable fuels from agricultural sources such as hydrogen (H 2) from biomass. This paper highlights the conversion of biomass to H 2 via catalytic gasification process. Twelve types of biomass have been characterized and pre-treated. Palm kernel shell (PKS) is found to be the most suitable biomass for the gasification process. In addition the research also covers the development of catalyst to effectively elevate the H 2 production and reduces tar formation. The catalytic activity of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts has been performed in a high-throughput micro reactor (HTMR) system. It is found that both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts show favourable performances to produce H 2 in a range of 68 - 70 vol% via steam gasification of PKS.

40|$|Ag-Cu BIMETALLIC NANOPARTICLE SYNTHESIS AND PROPERTIES Ziye Xiong, PhD University of Pittsburgh, 2017 Silver(Ag) -Copper(Cu) {{bimetallic}} nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by {{chemical reduction}} {{with the assistance}} of a microwave reactor. Considering the difference in redox potential of Ag(I) and Cu(II), the effect of heating method was compared using ‘one-pot’ and ‘two-pot’ synthesis of Ag-Cu shell-core and Ag-Cu core-shell nanoparticles. One-pot synthesis naturally results in Ag-Cu core-shell nanoparticles since silver has the higher redox potential than copper. In the two-pot synthesis of Ag-Cu core-shell nanoparticles, the effect of the heating conditions was compared. At the highest reaction temperature (175 ◦C), the galvanic reaction by which silver reduction occurred through the oxidation copper metal, was suppressed and higher Cu/Ag phase ratios could be achieved. Nanoparticles properties were examined in the following areas: (i) nanoparticle solubil- ity and antibacterial effects, (ii) sintering behavior and electrical conductivity of nanoparticle films. Enhanced antibacterial effects were observed for mixtures of Ag and Cu nanoparticles against planktonic M. smegmatis silver resistant mutants as well as the wild type when compared to the antibacterial effects of pure Ag or Cu NPs alone. However, solubility tests in deionized water, showed that very low Ag ion concentrations resulted when copper was present either in bimetallic nanoparticles or in mixtures of Ag and Cu NPs. This was attributed to a galvanic effect that suppressed the oxidation of silver. The deposition of nanoparticles on surfaces was studied in terms of the ability of the deposited nanoparticles to inhibit the growth the biofilm. Printed silver nanoparticle dots deposited on microfilters exhibited significant antibacterial effect in inhibiting the growth of biofilm over the whole <b>micro</b> <b>filter</b> surface. Increasing the areal coverage of the dots or their size decreased the number and the size of bacterial colonies. Finally, the sintering behavior of Ag–Cu shell core nanoparticles proved superior to that of Cu nanoparticles and to mixture of silver and copper nanoparticles. This resulted in higher electrical conductivity in the nanoparticle films sintered at lower temperature. This is thought to be due to the higher fraction of Ag-Ag particle contacts...|$|E
40|$|Malfunction due to solid {{particle}} contamination can be separated into two types. Type I malfunctions involve large particles (> 150 micron), most often {{the remnants of}} manufacturing, and generally lead to early life repairs. Type II contamination includes much smaller particles (< 50 micron), {{most of which are}} either generated wear debris, or particles ground up from larger Type I debris. These Type II particles are responsible for erratic valve performance, poor cooling and lubrication, and the accelerated degradation of Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF), all of which promote transmission mid-life failures. This paper focuses on Type II contamination only. Hydraulic system cleanliness has a significant impact on shift timing, feel and general transmission durability. In order to manage the system cleanliness, a uniform repeatable measurement system must be available. Further, the effects of operating conditions must be known and considered. Once operating effects are accounted for, and reliable measurement techniques can be applied, improvements in system cleanliness may be developed and evaluated in a methodical manner.

Trend Micro claimed that Barracuda's use of ClamAV infringed on a software patent owned by Trend <b>Micro</b> for <b>filtering</b> viruses on an Internet gateway. [...] On May 19, 2011, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Final Rejection in the reexamination of Trend Micro's U.S. patent 5,623,600.|$|R
40|$|Supplying clean {{drinking}} {{water to the}} flood victim is the major problem during the flood seas on due to the heavy weight of the water which {{makes it hard for}} supplying enough clean {{drinking water}} to the victims. In this project, we develop a mobile water system for flood prone area which is called Ultra <b>Micro</b> Bamboo <b>Filter</b> (UMBF). The flow rate of this system is 5. 56 mL/s and the system have weight of 14 kg and dimension of 42 cm length, 82 cm height and 28 cm width. Ultra <b>Micro</b> Bamboo <b>Filter</b> (UMBF) was designed to be mobile and to filter out flood water to drink able water for flood victims. The UMBF consist of 5 parts which are fabricated into an arrangement of sand filter, ceramic filter, activated carbon, hollow fiber and the UV. Each of the parts was screwed to an aluminum which has been shaped to fit to a bag and pipes were used to connect all the parts so that water flows from one to another. Every parts have their own function where the sand filter were used to removes suspended particles such as leaves, twigs, or large, NanoAg + Carbon block are used to remove sediment, improve taste and odor reduction, the ceramic filter and hollow fiber were used to filter out the dangerous bacteri a and pathogen, and the UV is used to kill pathogen ic bacteria. In this project, water was collected from the drain besides Block T in Universiti Malaysia Pahang. The water was then poured directly into the first part where it flows throughout the UMBF according to the arrangements of the parts. The results of this project shows that the bacteria such as E. Coli and total Coliform were absent after the water were treated. Furthermore, the total suspended solid reduce from 42 mg/L to 1 mg/L, Nitrate-nitrogen was reduce from 13. 4 mg/L to 8. 1 mg/L, the color, iron and zinc were not detected which was from 25 HU, 0. 27 mg/L, and 0. 0001 1 mg/L after the water was treated with UMBF. All the parameter tested complies with the drinking Water standard asset by Ministry of Health Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} limits include {{blank value}} uncertainties and represent calm sea conditions; strong wave action can ncrease the values p to factors of 2, the limit for 1 -butene can increase to 5. 2 and Linnenbom [• 4]. All {{materials in contact}} with the samples were glass and stainless teel. Only exceptions were the valves and the glass metal connections which had PTFE seals, as well as the stainless teel filter holder (Sartorius, 130 mm diameter). Glass <b>micro</b> fibre <b>filters</b> (Whatman GF/ C, pore size 1. 2 Ilm) were used to avoid phytoplankton entering the system. The filter was carefully purged and then used for up to 5 sampling cycles. The sea water was supplied continuously by a stainless teel rotary pump. The sea water inlet was at 11 m depth, 0. 5 m below the hull of the ship. The carrier and purge gases (He, H 2 and N 2) were of 5. 0 quality or better and additionally cleaned by passing them through a molecular sieve and charcoal trap at 200 K...|$|R

Therefore, a {{study has been}} carried out in order to show its filtration performance (pressure drop and filtration efficiency) in respect to different boundary conditions (volume flow, temperature). Experiments showed high particle retention rates after a short time, depending on the hole diameter. By applying micro sieves with an average pore diameter of 8 Mym, a retention rate of more than 99 % could be obtained after 90 - 160 seconds.
