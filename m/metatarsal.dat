5|$|These {{traits are}} {{probably}} neotenic, which similarly characterizes traits {{found in many}} other aquatic tetrapods. While Tanystropheus is likely also neotenic, it does not approach Dinocephalosaurus in the extremity of this condition. Several other peculiar traits {{are present in the}} feet of Dinocephalosaurus. Unlike Tanystropheus and most other protorosaurs, the fifth <b>metatarsal</b> of Dinocephalosaurus is simple and straight instead of hooked. Tanystropheus merely has a fifth <b>metatarsal</b> which is mildly thickened at the top end, and it additionally possesses a long phalanx on the fifth digit that acts not unlike another <b>metatarsal.</b> On the third digit of the foot, there are four phalanges but none of them appear to be the terminal claw, which suggests that Dinocephalosaurus had a higher-than-average count of at least five phalanges in the third digit.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus sibiricus was {{described}} in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin {{on the basis of}} a bone, later identified as a partial fourth <b>metatarsal,</b> from the Early Cretaceous of Buryatia, Russia. It was transferred to Chilantaisaurus in 1990, but is now considered a nomen dubium indeterminate beyond Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth <b>metatarsal</b> (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E
50|$|Those for {{the first}} and second <b>metatarsals</b> are the strongest; the second and third <b>metatarsals</b> are joined by oblique bands to the first cuneiform; the fourth and fifth <b>metatarsals</b> are {{connected}} by a few fibers to the cuboid.|$|R
30|$|It {{is usually}} {{necessary}} to ‘capture’ the 1 st and 5 th <b>metatarsals</b> with crossed wires. The wires are passed obliquely and often pick up neighbouring <b>metatarsals</b> as well. The crossed arrangement {{helps keep the}} transverse arch of the foot, without forcibly flattening it as would be needed if only one wire is used between the <b>metatarsals.</b> If half pins are used, {{they need to be}} of smaller diameter than in the tibia and inserted into the 1 st and 5 th <b>metatarsals</b> as indicated.|$|R
30|$|Foot breadth: This was {{measured}} as the transverse distance (Fig.  2) between {{the most prominent}} point on the medial side of the <b>metatarsals</b> (metatarsal–tibiale) and the most prominent point on the lateral side of the <b>metatarsals</b> (metatarsal–fibulare).|$|R
5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a <b>metatarsal</b> bone in his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed an unfamiliar growth {{on one of his}} testicles. The medical team quickly did tests to check for testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E
5|$|The <b>metatarsal</b> of the Callao Man, {{reliably}} dated by uranium-series {{dating to}} 67,000 {{years ago is}} the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date. This distinction previously belonged to the Tabon Man of Palawan, carbon-dated to around 26,500 years ago. Negritos were also among the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, but their first settlement in the Philippines has not been reliably dated.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third <b>metatarsal</b> has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third <b>metatarsal</b> carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second <b>metatarsal,</b> causing a tighter connection.|$|E

5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third <b>metatarsal</b> connected to a groove in the side of the second <b>metatarsal.</b> The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{days after}} his OHL return, Hodgson {{suffered}} another injury, breaking a toe on his right foot while blocking a shot against the Sudbury Wolves. Initial X-rays came up negative and he continued playing for nine more games before a second X-ray revealed a hairline fracture {{in one of his}} right <b>metatarsal</b> bones. Missing the Battalion's final five regular season games, he finished the campaign with eight goals and 20 points over 13 contests. Despite missing the majority of the season, he was voted as the smartest player in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year in the OHL coaches poll.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{suffered}} a suspected broken <b>metatarsal</b> in September 2007, {{and made his}} return for Wigan in a 2–0 defeat to Arsenal in November. He picked up an ankle injury during Wigan's 5–3 victory against Blackburn in December 2007. On 14 April 2008, Heskey scored a 90th minute equalising goal against Chelsea, which damaged their hopes of winning the Premier League. He went on to score Wigan's equaliser against Tottenham in the following match {{to give them a}} 1–1 draw, which proved to be his last goal of 2007–08, which he finished with 4 goals in 30 appearances.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 2012, Kane joined Premier League team Norwich City on a season-long loan, {{making his}} debut as a {{substitute}} against West Ham United. Kane suffered an injury, breaking a <b>metatarsal</b> bone, in the League Cup tie against Doncaster Rovers in only his second appearance. The 19-year-old underwent his rehabilitation at Tottenham but returned to action for Norwich on 29 December 2012, coming off the bench at half time as Norwich lost 3–4 to Manchester City. However, with Tottenham having been unable to add to their attacking options during the January transfer window, they opted to recall Kane on 1 February 2013, four months before he was due to return.|$|E
5|$|The Bears opened rookie minicamp at the Walter Payton Center on March 10, and {{concluded}} on May 12. A total of 59 players participated, {{which includes the}} six draft picks, nine of the ten undrafted free agents (Mark Harrison {{was going to be}} signed, but failed his physical as he was recovering from a broken fifth <b>metatarsal),</b> kicker Austin Signor, ten veteran players, and 33 tryout players. Following minicamp, on May 13, the Bears signed receiver Demetrius Fields, defensive tackles Corvey Irvin and Christian Tupou, and cornerback Maurice Jones, while releasing Dom DeCicco and LeQuan Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club {{would have been able to}} break the <b>metatarsal</b> bones of large theropods.|$|E

5|$|During Manchester United's 2–1 {{win against}} Arsenal on 22 January, Nani {{sustained}} a foot injury from a tackle by Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny in the 75th minute {{and was replaced}} by Ashley Young. After a scan on Nani's foot, he was feared to have suffered a <b>metatarsal</b> injury, thus not being able to play for two months. Nani returned to football on 15 April at United's match against Aston Villa as a substitute, replacing Young on the left wing. He scored a goal in stoppage time (93rd minute) with a low shot past Villa goalkeeper Shay Given from Jonny Evans' through-ball assist, resulting in a 4–0 win over Villa. Nani then followed this with another goal when chipping Tim Howard at his near post in a 4–4 draw at Old Trafford against Everton.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large <b>metatarsal</b> (cannon) and small <b>metatarsal</b> (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Cau et al. reconsidered {{the ecology}} of Balaur again in their reevaluation of its phylogenetic position, arguing that if Balaur was an avialan, it would be phylogenetically {{bracketed}} by taxa {{known to have been}} herbivorous, such as Sapeornis and Jeholornis. This suggests a non-hypercarnivorous lifestyle to be a more parsimonious conclusion and supports Cau's initial interpretations of its specializations. This is also indicated by the reduced third finger, the lack of a gynglymoid lower articulation of the second <b>metatarsal</b> and the rather small and moderately recurved second toe claw. Balaur had a broad pelvis, a broad foot, a large first toe, and broad lower ends of the metatarsals relative to the articulation surfaces; such a combination can in the remainder of the Theropoda only be found with the herbivorous Therizinosauridae.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present a neglected, unclassifiable case that {{involved}} a central type polydactyl adult with 7 toes and <b>metatarsals,</b> 4 cuneiforms and 1 cuboid. A 22 year-old male soldier with a right polydactyl was referred to our hospital. He suffered from the need of excessively wide-shoes and occasional shoe irritation. He was evaluated with plain radiography and 3 D tomography. The patient had central-type polydactyl with 7 toes and <b>metatarsals,</b> and 4 cuneiforms and 1 cuboid. Ankles and hind feet were completely normal. All toes were capable of tendon flexion and extension. His medical and family history was unremarkable. We planned to excise the excessive toes and <b>metatarsals,</b> but the patient denied the surgery. We present a very rare case with a central polydactyl having 7 toes and <b>metatarsals,</b> 4 cuneiforms and 1 cuboid. The striking point in our case was that he was a neglected, unclassifiable case.

40|$|AbstractWdr 5 is developmentally {{expressed}} in osteoblasts and {{is required for}} osteoblast differentiation. Mice overexpressing Wdr 5 {{under the control of}} the mouse α(1) I collagen promoter (Col I-Wdr 5) display accelerated osteoblast differentiation as well as accelerated chondrocyte differentiation, suggesting that overexpression of Wdr 5 in osteoblasts affects chondrocyte differentiation. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which overexpression of Wdr 5 in the perichondrium regulates chondrocyte differentiation, studies were undertaken using skeletal elements and cultured <b>metatarsals</b> isolated from wild-type and Col I-Wdr 5 embryos. FGF 18 mRNA levels were decreased in Col I-Wdr 5 humeri. Furthermore, local delivery of FGF 18 to the bone collar of ex vivo cultures of <b>metatarsals</b> attenuated the chondrocyte phenotype of the Col I-Wdr 5 <b>metatarsals.</b> Impairing local FGF action in wild-type <b>metatarsals</b> resulted in a chondrocyte phenotype analogous to that of Col I-Wdr 5 <b>metatarsals</b> implicating impaired FGF action as the cause of the phenotype observed. The expression of Twist- 1, which regulates chondrocyte differentiation, was increased in Col I-Wdr 5 humeri. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that Wdr 5 is recruited to the Twist- 1 promoter. These findings support a model in which overexpression of Wdr 5 in the perichondrium promotes chondrocyte differentiation by modulating the expression of Twist- 1 and FGF 18...|$|R

5|$|Originally, Michael Raath (1972) {{described}} Vulcanodon {{not as a}} sauropod but as an advanced, specialized prosauropod, possibly of {{the family}} Melanorosauridae. According to Raath, the sauropod-like limb proportions have been independently evolved in Vulcanodon and sauropods (convergent evolution). He argued that primitive features of the pelvis {{as well as the}} knife-shaped teeth preclude a classification within the Sauropoda. The teeth, however, are now known to belong to a theropod. Arthur Cruickshank (1975) was the first to show that Vulcanodon was indeed a sauropod, arguing that the fifth <b>metatarsal</b> bone was equally long as the remaining metatarsals, a condition seen in other sauropods but not in prosauropods. Today, Vulcanodon is universally accepted {{to be one of the}} most basal (primitive) members of Sauropoda.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was transversely flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth <b>metatarsal</b> was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth <b>metatarsal</b> was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{negotiations}} with Spain's Atlético Madrid, Mendes arranged Costa's transfer for €1.5million and 50% of the player's rights in December 2006, but he remained on loan at Braga {{until the end}} of the season.
