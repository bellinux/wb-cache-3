5|$|Storms began causing damage {{early in}} the morning on July 10, 1989. A tornado briefly touched down in Ogdensburg, New York at 5AM, {{injuring}} one person. Hail up to 1 in (25mm) wide, wind gusts over 50mph (60km/h), and many reports of wind damage were reported in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts before noon. Severe weather is an unusual occurrence in the morning, and the activity only increased in severity towards the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within a dreamscape, hunter Bobby Singer (Beaver) {{searches}} {{around an}} old house and is suddenly attacked by a woman (Elizabeth Marleau). A maid tries to no avail to wake him up in his motel room. Meanwhile, Dean Winchester (Ackles) finds his brother Sam (Padalecki) drinking at a bar in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> When Dean questions him about it, a drunken Sam admits that he is upset {{about not being able}} to save Dean from his demonic pact, which left him only a year to live. What bothers Sam even more is that Dean, who has little self-worth, is not even concerned about his fate. Their conversation is interrupted by a call from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|At Minqar Qaim, the {{division}} was {{to hold and}} delay the advance of the Panzer Army Africa {{for as long as}} it could while remaining intact. By the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> of 27 June, {{the division}} had been encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. Panzer units approached a number of the 2nd New Zealand Division's positions, including the 20th Battalion's sector on the northern side of the Minqar Qaim escarpment, and were successfully beaten off. The New Zealanders broke out that evening with the 4th Brigade breaching the German lines and the 20th Battalion on the northern flank of the chosen withdrawal route. During the action at Minqar Qaim and the subsequent breakout, the battalion's casualties were light, with thirteen men killed and it reached the El Alamein line by 28 June.|$|E
60|$|The boys {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that Glutts and Werner, accompanied possibly by Codfish, must have visited the Lodge some time in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>afternoon.</b> Evidently <b>the</b> marauders had been afraid that the bungalow's occupants might return at any moment, for they had worked with great speed.|$|R

5|$|The 2/14th Battalion {{had been}} {{dispatched}} from Myola on foot on 25 August, with orders {{to relieve the}} 39th. A company reached their position at Isurava in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> on 26 August, while others deployed to Alola and Templeton's Crossing. However, the 39th was forced to remain in location while the 2/14th's companies moved into position one by one, as several times the Japanese threatened {{to break through the}} perimeter. It was not until last light on 27 August that the 39th moved into a reserve location to the rear of Isurava. Throughout the day, heavy close quarters fighting had taken place around Isurava, while on the right flank hand-to-hand fighting had seen both the Australians and Japanese assume cautious defensive postures. Probing attacks continued around Isurava that night as the Japanese sought to test the Australian defences for weaknesses amidst a heavy torrential downpour.|$|E
25|$|That said, {{on being}} inserted, Atherton (85) and Stewart (118) set a superb {{base for the}} innings, batting through to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> session and adding 171 for the first wicket. Stewart and Ramprakash added a further 52, but the middle order were unable to build on this and {{although}} several batsmen got starts, the tourists {{had to rely on}} Russell's 38 to shepherd the tail to a defendable total. Winston (3–76) and Kenny Benjamin (2–74) did the damage to the batsmen, while Ambrose helped himself to four more wickets from Hick, Russell and the tail.|$|E
25|$|Hampshire's veteran wicketkeeper Nic Pothas {{made his}} way to a four-hour 135, his twelfth {{first-class}} century, after Jason Lewry, James Kirtley and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan had reduced Hampshire to 102 for 6 in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> session on the first day. Pothas was well supported by Zimbabwean Sean Ervine, who made 69, and the pair added 191 in three hours before Naved-ul-Hasan broke through with the last ball of the day, having Ervine caught by Ian Ward. Hampshire slumped to 309 on the morning of day two, and solid contributions from the entire batting order - bar number three Michael Yardy who made a duck - lifted Sussex to a slender seven-run lead amid Ervine's swing bowling, which yielded five wickets for 73. However, Mushtaq Ahmed got the early breakthrough for Sussex, and James Kirtley ripped out two quick wickets as Hampshire folded to 22 for 3 overnight.|$|E
6000|$|The red squaw staid all the forenoon, {{and toward}} <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>afternoon</b> she went away, [...] O {{my mother was}} loth to have her go away, [...] All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a month, [...] She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer, [...] But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.|$|R
60|$|IT WAS just in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> merry, mellow <b>afternoon</b> {{that they}} ushered us to dinner, {{underneath}} a green shelter of palm boughs; open all round, and so low at the eaves that we stooped to enter.|$|R
60|$|And <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next <b>afternoon</b> saw {{despair and}} mutiny on her smoking deck. The current had accelerated, {{the wind had}} slackened, and the Pyrenees had sagged off to the west. The lookout sighted Barclay de Tolley to the eastward, barely visible from the masthead, and vainly and for hours the PYRENEES tried to beat up to it. Ever, like a mirage, the cocoanut trees hovered on the horizon, visible only from the masthead. From the deck they were hidden by <b>the</b> bulge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|R
25|$|Wisden {{identified}} the third Test as featuring the best cricket {{of the three}} matches, partially due to the better weather. For the third time, England won the toss and batted, and were led by a century from Fry and a half-century from the captain, R. E. Foster. Although England made a respectable total, their batting was criticised for being inconsistent, and the South African bowling praised as being difficult. Due to rain breaks, England batted until the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{on the second day}} to reach their 295. When South Africa came in to bat, the conditions were difficult as the pitch was drying, but partially due to some inaccurate bowling from Blythe, the batsmen were able to score runs. Tip Snooke top-scored with 63 runs, while Nourse, Jimmy Sinclair and William Shalders all scored twenty or more. Blythe bowled far better on the final morning to dismiss South Africa for 178, leaving England a 117-run lead.|$|E
500|$|Just as {{the vanguard}} entered Arsuf in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> the Hospitaller crossbowmen {{to the rear}} were having to load and fire walking backwards. [...] Inevitably they lost cohesion, and the enemy was quick to take {{advantage}} of this opportunity, moving into any gap wielding their swords and maces. [...] For the Crusaders, the Battle of Arsuf had now entered a critical stage. [...] Garnier de Nablus repeatedly pleaded with Richard to be allowed to attack. [...] He was refused, the Master was ordered to maintain position and await the signal for a general assault, six clear trumpet blasts. Richard knew that the charge of his knights needed to be reserved until the Ayyubid army was fully committed, closely engaged, and the Saracens' horses had begun to tire. Goaded beyond endurance, the Master and another knight, Baldwin de [...] Carron, thrust their way through their own infantry and charged into the Saracen ranks with a cry of “St. George!”; they were then followed by the rest of the Hospitaller knights. Moved by this example, the French knights of the corps immediately preceding the Hospitallers also charged.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival the Wagner family departed for an extended stay in Venice. To accommodate the large party of children, servants and expected guests they took a spacious apartment in the Palazzo Vendramin Calergi, overlooking the Grand Canal. The principal concern during the autumn and winter months was Wagner's declining health; his heart spasms had become so frequent that on 16 November 1882 Cosima recorded: [...] "Today {{he did not have a}} spasm!". Cosima's journal entry for 12 February 1883—the last she was to make—records Wagner reading Fouqué's novel Undine, and playing the Rhinemaidens' lament from Das Rheingold on the piano. However, an underlying cause of domestic friction may have surfaced concerning Carrie Pringle, an English soprano from the Parsifal cast who was rumoured to be having an affair with Wagner. According to Isolde, recalling the occasion much later, the Pringle suspicions led to a furious row between Cosima and Wagner on the morning of 13 February. There is no solid evidence of an affair between Wagner and Pringle, nor is Isolde's story of a row supported by any other testimony. At around noon on that day, Wagner suffered a fatal heart attack, and died in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b>|$|E

60|$|It was towards <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next <b>afternoon</b> when Carrie Denham leaned upon <b>the</b> rails <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little path outside <b>the</b> grey walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{garden at}} Barrock-holme. From {{where she stood}} {{she could see the}} {{narrower}} and unprotected way along which she had ventured with Leland a few weeks earlier, and she could not help remembering his quiet glance of interrogation when he had come upon it suddenly. She and Jimmy had often crossed that somewhat perilous ledge in their younger days, the more often, in fact, because it had been forbidden to them. Though it was, of course, new to Leland, he had displayed no hesitation when once she had made her wishes plain. This had pleased her at the time, since it suggested that he understood her resolution was equal to his own; but now she brushed the recollection aside, for just then she felt she almost hated him.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no longer}} any fierceness in the sunshine, and the day was {{cloudless}} and pleasantly cool when Carrie Leland and Eveline Annersly strolled through the harvest field at <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> aspect <b>of</b> things had changed since the morning Leland had fallen from his binder, for, {{though there was a}} little breeze, the wheat no longer rolled before it in rippling waves. It stood piled in long rows of sheaves that gleamed with bronze and gold in a great sweep of ochre-tinted stubble, beyond which the prairie stretched back, dusty white, to <b>the</b> cold blueness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern horizon.|$|R
500|$|Early in World War II, the Conte di Cavour and {{her sister}} {{took part in the}} Battle of Calabria (also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo) on 9 July 1940.

60|$|They were {{mounted in}} a few minutes, and after a hard ride the party broke up at dawn, {{dispersing}} so that each member of it could make independent search and inquiries at the scattered homesteads. Meeting places and means of communication were arranged; but Flora and her father rode together, pushing on steadily southward over the vast gray plain. Little was said except when they called at some outlying farm, but Grant now and then glanced at the girl's set face with keenly scrutinizing eyes. In <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scorching <b>afternoon</b> he suggested that she should await his return at a homestead in the distance, but was not surprised when she uncompromisingly refused. They {{spent the night at}} a small ranch, borrowed fresh horses in the morning, and set out again; but they found no trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fugitives during the day, and it was evening when Edgar and Grierson joined them, as arranged, at a lonely farm. The two men rode in wearily on jaded horses, and Flora, who was the first to notice their approach, went out to meet them.|$|R

60|$|MY boy had not a {{great deal}} to do with schools after his docile childhood. When he began to run wild with the other boys he {{preferred}} their savage freedom; and he got out of going to school by most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> devices they used. He had never quite the hardihood to play truant, but he was subject to sudden attacks of sickness, which came on about school-time and went off towards <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forenoon or <b>afternoon</b> in a very strange manner. I suppose that such complaints are unknown at the present time, but the Young People's fathers can tell them how much suffering they used to cause among boys.

50|$|Low-carbohydrate diet and/or {{frequent}} small split meals is <b>the</b> first treatment <b>of</b> this condition. <b>The</b> first {{important point}} is to add small meals at <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> when glycemia would start to decrease. If adequate composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meal is found, the fall in blood glucose is thus prevented. Patients should avoid rapidly absorbable sugars and thus avoid popular soft drinks rich in glucose or sucrose. They should also be cautious with drinks associating sugar and alcohol, mainly in the fasting state.|$|R
