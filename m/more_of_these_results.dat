The mechanical response of tissue engineering scaffolds is one of the factors determining their use in applications such as cartilage and bone repair. The relationship between the structural and intrinsic mechanical properties of the scaffolds was the object of this study, with the ultimate aim of understanding the stiffness of the substrate that adhered cells experience, and its link to the bulk mechanical properties. Freeze-dried type I collagen porous scaffolds made with varying slurry concentrations and pore sizes were tested in a viscoelastic framework by macroindentation. Membranes made up of stacks of pore walls were indented using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy. It was found that the bulk scaffold mechanical response varied with collagen concentration in the slurry consistent with previous studies on <b>these</b> materials.

40|$|The {{computation}} of {{the number}} of arbitrary functions in the general solution is briefly reviewed. The results are used to study normal systems and their symmetry reduction. We discuss the treatment of gauge systems, especially the analysis of gauge fixing conditions. As examples the Yang-Mills equations with the Lorentz gauge and Einstein's vacuum field equations with harmonic coordinates are considered. 1. Introduction If one can not determine the general solution of an equation, as it is usually the case with differential equations, one wants to know at least the dimension of the solution space. This is, however, not trivial for systems, especially if they are overdetermined. It turns out, that involution [10] provides the key. We showed in a recent paper [13], how to compute the number of arbitrary functions and their arity for closed representations of the general solution of an involutive system.

As a consequence of this research, we have today very powerful techniques for synthesis targeting area and testability; and to a lesser extent, circuit speed.

Low power circuits are emerging as an important application domain, and synthesis for low power is demanding attention.

Although the importance of obstruction was recognized since the original description by Teare and Brock, its exact cause and methods for its relief are still being hotly debated. We believe that a rational approach to solving these issues depends on thorough understanding of the specific structure and functions of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) in health and disease. There is now compelling evidence that the LVOT performs a series of vital sophisticated functions which are mediated by the design characteristics, structure, and biological properties of its component parts and that dysregu-lation <b>of</b> one or <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> functions <b>results</b> in obstruction and other abnormalities.
