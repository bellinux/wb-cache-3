40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} factors in developing pharmaceutical drug substances and products is ensuring that the analytical test methods used to analyze pharmaceutical products should generate valid and meaningful data in terms of reliability, accuracy and precision, regardless of whether it is intended for acceptance, release, stability or pharmacokinetic studies. Validation of an analytical method is a process that provides documented evidence that an analytical test method performs in an appropriate manner for the purposes for which it was intended. Method validation is a process used to confirm that the analytical procedure employed for a specific test is suitable for its intended use. Results from method validation can be used to judge the quality, reliability and consistence of analytical results; it {{is an integral part of}} any good analytical nalytical practices. The USP has published the specific guidance for method validation for compound evaluation. USP defines the steps for validation as accuracy, precision, linearity, ruggedness, robustness.

40|$|MRI {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) {{studies of}} white matter integrity in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia have consistently shown involvement of frontal and temporal white matter, corresponding to regional loss of cortical volume. Volumetric imaging has a suboptimal sensitivity as a diagnostic tool and thus {{we wanted to}} explore if DTI is a better method to discriminate patients and controls than volumetric imaging. We examined the anterior cingulum bundle in 14 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and 22 healthy controls using deterministic <b>manual</b> <b>diffusion</b> tensor tractography, and compared DTI parameters with two measures of cortical atrophy, VBM and cortical thickness, of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Statistically significant changes between patients and controls were detected in all DTI parameters, with large effect sizes. ROC-AUC was for the best DTI parameters: 0. 92 (fractional anisotropy) to 0. 97 (radial diffusivity), 0. 82 for the best cortical parameter, VBM of the ACC. Results from the AUC were confirmed with binary logistic regression analysis including demographic variables, but only for fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. Ability to classify patient/nonpatient status was significantly better for mean diffusivity vs. VBM (p = 0. 031), and borderline significant for fractional anisotropy vs. VBM (p = 0. 062). The results indicate that DTI could offer advantages {{in comparison with the}} assessment of cortical volume in differentiating patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and controls...|$|E
40|$|Aim: to {{evaluate}} the performance of Vitek 2 compact machine (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04. 02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patients. Methods: a comparison study {{to evaluate}} Vitek 2 compact machine (Biomerieux Inc. ver 04. 02, France) in reference to manual methods for susceptibility test for Candida resistance among HIV/AIDS patient was done. Categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek 2 machine was calculated using predefined criteria. Time to susceptibility result for automated and manual methods were measured. Results: there were 137 Candida isolates comprising eight Candida species with C. albicans and C. glabrata as the first (56. 2 %) and second (15. 3 %) most common species, respectively. For fluconazole drug, among the C. albicans, 2. 6 % was found resistant on manual disc diffusion methods and no resistant was determined by Vitek 2 machine; whereas 100 % C. krusei was identified as resistant on both methods. Resistant patterns for C. glabrata to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B were 52. 4 %, 23. 8 %, 23. 8 % vs. 9. 5 %, 9. 5 %, 4. 8 % respectively between <b>manual</b> <b>diffusion</b> disc methods and Vitek 2 machine. Time to susceptibility result for automated methods compared to Vitex 2 machine was shorter for all Candida species. Conclusion: {{there is a good}} categorical agreement between manual disc diffusion and Vitek 2 machine, except for C. glabrata for measuring the antifungal resistant. Time to susceptibility result for automated methods is shorter for all Candida species...|$|E
40|$|Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual is the nick-name of an Algerian Facebooker (the short {{version is}} Psychodynamic) who posted {{the cover of}} the {{original}} edition of the PDM as a portrait, has six friends, loves the Real Madrid among the football clubs, and is formally engaged. At the same time, the PDM is the most inter-esting diagnostic proposal from the fields of psy-chology and psychoanalysis. It is also a <b>manual</b> with good <b>diffusion</b> if, as Paul Stepansky stated, „to achieve commercial success of this order, the “psychoanalytic” appellation must be diluted to “psychodynamic”, and the psychodynamic “terms” and “concepts” offered in a user-friendly format intended to broaden rather than supplant other diagnostic frameworks. This is the very formula that has made the recently self-published Psycho-dynamic Diagnostic Manual, collectively authored by an “Alliance of Psychoanalytic Organizations,” a stunning success, with sales, as of March, 2008, of over 20, 000 copies‟ (Stepansky, 2009, p. 66). The aim of this short paper is to illustrate the PDM‟s fortune in North America and Europe. In looking toward a second edition of the PDM, we believe it appropriate to make some observations about the penetration and diffusion of the PDM in different professional and cultural contexts...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: For rapid growing drug {{resistance}} among pathogenic microorganisms, {{it is essential}} to find new compounds with antimicrobial activity. Medicinal herbs application in traditional treatment for thousand years, make this natural compound to the best choice for antimicrobial studies. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the antimicrobial activity of Artemisia against some important pathogenic bacteria. Material and Method: In the present study, antimicrobial activity of ethanolic and methanolic extracts of A. santonica against four pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. A. santonica dry powder was extracted with ethanol and methanol solvents in maceration method. Assessment of antimicrobial efficacies of extracts and MIC were conducted by disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>manual</b> and macro broth dilution method, respectively. Results: Both ethanolic and methanolic extracts could inhibit microorganism in this test. Staphylococcus aureus with MIC= 1. 56 mg/ml indicates more sensitive to the Artemisia. In addition, Bacillus cereus showed medium sensitivity. E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa became involved in less sensitivity to the A. santonica extracts. Conclusion: The result of this study confirmed that A. santonica extracts were the best inhibitory effect on S. aureus. Then it can be concluded that by using herbal plant against antibiotics some antibiotic resistant problem can be resolved...|$|R
