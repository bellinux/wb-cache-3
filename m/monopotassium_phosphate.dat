40|$|In {{the cell}} of Hansenula anomala it is {{possible}} to recognize two types of in-clusions: lipoid inclusions and volutin granules. They are considered to be reserve materials. This may be said of volutin, which disappears in old cultures, but the evidence for the reserve function of the fatty inclusions rests chiefly on their quantitative sensitivity to the composition of the environment. Hansenula anomala is especially suitable for studying the functions of in-clusions, since it seems not to require nutrilites and grows readily in a medium of the following composition: ammonium sulfate, 0. 2 g; glucose, 0. 2 g; an equi-molar mixture of <b>monopotassium</b> and dipotassium <b>phosphate,</b> 0. 23 g; and distilled water, 100 ml.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the response of mung-bean cultivated in inceptisol fertilized with different sources and levels of phosphorus and its correlation with the extraction of P from the soil using the extractor Mehlich- 1. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse belonging to the Federal Rural University of Semiarid (UFERSA) Mossoro-RN, {{in the period of}} 15 / 09 / 2000 to 20 / 10 / 2000, using a variety of mung-bean 'Green Mungo'.

The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 2 x 5 with four replications. The source and P levels provided changes in height and levels of phosphorus in plant and soil and exchangeable potassium in soil. The extractor Mehlich- 1 has a greater capacity for recovery of phosphorus from the soil fertilized with phosphoric acid.

50|$|<b>Monopotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (MKP) is {{an example}} of a {{buffering}} agent. It has a mildly acidic reaction; when applied as a fertilizer with urea or diammonium phosphate, it minimizes pH fluctuations which can cause nitrogen loss and simultaneously provides potassium nutrient.|$|E
5000|$|DKDP {{is closely}} related to <b>monopotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> or KDP or KH2PO4. Replacement of {{hydrogen}} by deuterium in DKDP lowers the frequency of O-H vibrations and their overtones (high-order harmonics). Absorption of light by those overtones is detrimental for the infrared lasers, which DKDP and KDP crystals are used for. Consequently, despite higher cost, DKDP is more popular than KDP.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monopotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{can exist}} in several polymorphs. At room {{temperature}} it forms paraelectric crystals with tetragonal symmetry. Upon cooling to −150 °C it transforms to a ferroelectric phase of orthorhombic symmetry, and the transition temperature shifts up to −50 °C to when hydrogen {{is replaced by}} deuterium. Heating to 190 °C changes its structure to monoclinic. When heated further, MKP decomposes, by loss of water, to potassium metaphosphate, KPO3, at 400 °C (752 °F).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mono{{potassium}}</b> <b>phosphate,</b> MKP, (also potassium dihydrogenphosphate, KDP, or monobasic potassium phosphate), KH2PO4, is a {{soluble salt}} of potassium and the dihydrogen phosphate ion {{which is used}} as a fertilizer, a food additive and a fungicide. It is a source of phosphorus and potassium. It is also a buffering agent. When used in fertilizer mixtures with urea and ammonium phosphates, it minimizes escape of ammonia by keeping the pH at a relatively low level.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{potassium}} fertilizer is potassium chloride (muriate of potash). Other inorganic potassium fertilizers include potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, and <b>monopotassium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Potassium-rich treatments suitable for organic farming include feeding with home-made comfrey liquid, adding seaweed meal, composted bracken, and compost rich in decayed banana peels. Wood ash also has high potassium content. Adequate moisture is necessary for effective potassium uptake; low soil water reduces K uptake by plant roots. Liming acidic soils can increase potassium retention in some soils by reducing leaching; practices that increase soil organic matter can also increase potassium retention.|$|E

40|$|Summary 	Apple scab, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Venturia inaequalis, is a significant disease in regions of California characterized by spring precipitation. Disease control is typically attained with periodic application of fungicides. We conducted a field experiment near Camino, California to test the effects of several registered and experimental fungicides on control of scab in mature Red Delicious apple trees. In late spring 2009, following four applications (from green tip into post-bloom), we evaluated disease incidence and severity (lesion density). High disease incidence (> 95 %) and high lesion density (> 12 lesions/fruit) on untreated and water-treated fruits suggested significant disease pressure during the preceding months. Generally, fruits and leaves treated with kresoxim-methyl or mancozeb + flutriafol showed the lowest incidence and severity of disease. Flutriafol (used alone) was moderately effective; tea tree oil, parafinnic oil and <b>monopotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (fertilizer) showed little to no ability to control scab...|$|E

The mobile phase composed of solvent A (methanol) and solvent B (solution consisting 0. 02  mmol/l <b>monopotassium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and 0. 025  mmol/l sodium hydroxide) was at a flow rate of 1. 0  ml/min. The samples were detected and quantified at 237  nm using an ultraviolet absorbance detector. Calibration curves of all analytes from 0. 5 to 3. 5  μg/ml were good linearity (r ≥  0. 9990) and recovery was greater than 99. 5 % for each analyte. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and quantification (LOQ) of this analytical method were 10  ng/ml and 25  ng/ml for all impurities, respectively. The stress studies indicated that the degradation products could not interfere with the detection of ilaprazole and its related impurities and the assay can thus be considered stability-indicating. The method precisions were in the range of 0. 41 – 1. 21 while the instrument precisions were in the range of 0. 38 – 0. 95 in terms of peak area RSD% for all impurities, respectively.
