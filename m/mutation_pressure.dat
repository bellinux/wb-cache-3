40|$|Background: When {{there are}} no strand-specific biases in {{mutation}} and selection rates (that is, in the substitution rates) between the two strands of DNA, the average nucleotide composition is theoretically expected to be A = T and G = C within each strand.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{theory of}} directional <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> proposed in 1962 explained the wide variation of DNA base composition observed among different bacteria and its small heterogeneity within individual bacterial species. The theory {{was based on}} the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of neutrality of directional <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> against selection. Newly defined parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants were discovered.

The significant genome size diversity among organisms (more than 200000 -fold among eukaryotes) bears no relationship to organismal complexity and both the origins and reasons for the clearly non-random distribution of this variation remain unclear. Several theories have been proposed to explain this ` C-value enigma ' (heretofore known as the ` C-value paradox '), each of which can be described as either a ` <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> ' or ` optimal DNA ' theory. <b>Mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> theories consider the large portion of non-coding DNA in eukaryotic genomes as either ` junk ' or ` selfish ' DNA and are important primarily in considerations of the origin of secondary DNA. Optimal DNA theories di#er from <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> theories by emphasizing the strong link between DNA content and cell and nuclear volumes. While <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> theories generally explain this association with cell size as coincidental, the nucleoskeletal theory proposes a coevolutionary interaction between nuclear and cell volume, with DNA content adjusted adaptively following shifts in cell size. Each of these approaches to the C-value enigma is problematic {{for a variety of reasons}} and the preponderance of the available evidence instead favours the nucleotypic theory which postulates a causal link between bulk DNA amount and cell volume.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} model escape from adaptive conflict (EAC) posits that adaptive {{conflict between the}} old and an emerging new function within a single gene could drive the fixation of gene duplication, where each duplicate can freely optimize one of the functions. Although EAC has been suggested as a common process in functional evolution, definitive cases of neofunctionalization under EAC are lacking, and the molecular mechanisms leading to functional innovation are not well-understood. We report here clear experimental evidence for EAC-driven evolution of type III antifreeze protein gene from an old sialic acid synthase (SAS) gene in an Antarctic zoarcid fish. We found that an SAS gene, having both sialic acid synthase and rudimentary ice-binding activities, became duplicated. In one duplicate, the N-terminal SAS domain was deleted and replaced with a nascent signal peptide, removing pleiotropic structural conflict between SAS and ice-binding functions and allowing rapid optimization of the C-terminal domain to become a secreted protein capable of noncolligative freezing-point depression.

Analysis of compositional features and codon usage pattern of SPANX genes in human has contributed to explore the molecular biology of this gene. In our current study, we have retrieved the sequences of different variants of SPANX gene from NCBI using accession number and a perl script was used to analyze the nucleotide composition and the parameters for codon usage bias. Results: Our results showed that codon usage bias is low as measured by codon bias index (CBI) and most of the GC ending codons were positively correlated with GC bias as indicated by GC 3. That <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> and natural selection affect the codon usage pattern were revealed by correspondence analysis (COA) and neutrality plot. Moreover, the neutrality plot further suggested that the role of natural selection is higher than <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> on SPANX genes.

40|$|Mutation is the {{ultimate}} source of the genetic variation—including genetic variation for mutation rate itself—that fuels evolution. Selection to increase the genomic mutation rate, driven by selective sweeps of beneficial mutations, can be strong and rapid where genetic linkage is present, as evidenced by numerous observations in experimental microbial populations. Selection to decrease the mutation rate, in contrast, is expected to depend on avoidance of mutational load and act over a longer time scale. In keeping with this latter expectation, there have been relatively few experimental observations {{of the evolution of}} reduced genomic mutation rates. Here, I report the rapid evolution of reduced mutation rates in hypermutable E. coli populations propagated at extremely small effective size—a circumstance under which selection is generally minimized. I hypothesize that high deleterious <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> can strengthen indirect selection favoring lower mutation rates in these populations, and find both phenotypic and genotypic evidence to support this hypothesis.

40|$|Abstract Background Any DNA {{sequence}} {{is a result}} of compromise between the selection and <b>mutation</b> <b>pressures</b> exerted on it during evolution. It is difficult to estimate the relative influence of each of these pressures on the rate of accumulation of substitutions. However, it is important to discriminate between the effect of mutations, and the effect of selection, when studying the phylogenic relations between taxa. Results We have tested in computer simulations, and analytically, the available substitution matrices for many genomes, and we have found that DNA strands in equilibrium under mutational pressure have unique feature: the fraction of each type of nucleotide is linearly dependent on the time needed for substitution of half of nucleotides of a given type, with a correlation coefficient close to 1. Substitution matrices found for sequences under selection pressure do not have this property. A substitution matrix for the leading strand of the Borrelia burgdorferi genome, having reached equilibrium in computer simulation, gives a DNA sequence with nucleotide composition and asymmetry corresponding precisely to the third positions in codons of protein coding genes located on the leading strand. Conclusions Parameters of mutational pressure allow us to count DNA composition in equilibrium with this mutational pressure. Comparing any real DNA sequence with the sequence in equilibrium it is possible to estimate the distance between these sequences, which {{could be used as a}} measure of the selection pressure. Furthermore, the parameters of the mutational pressure enable direct estimation of the relative mutation rates in any DNA sequence in the studied genome. </p...|$|R

Using a simple evolutionary model, we show that 1 st position sites are less constrained by selection than 2 nd position sites, and therefore that the frequencies of bases at 1 st position are more responsive to <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> than those at 2 nd position. We define a similarity measure between amino acids that {{is a function of}} 8 measured physical properties. We define a proximity measure for each amino acid, which is the average similarity between an amino acid and all others that are accessible via single point mutations in the genetic code. We also define a responsiveness for each amino acid, which measures how rapidly an amino acid frequency changes as a result of <b>mutation</b> <b>pressure</b> acting on the base frequencies. There is a strong correlation between responsiveness and proximity, and both these quantities are also correlated with the mutability of amino acids estimated from the mtREV substitution rate matrix. We also consider the variation of base frequencies between strands and between genes on a strand.

40|$|Abstract Background Analysis of {{molecular}} evolutionary patterns of different genes within metabolic pathways {{allows us to}} determine whether these genes are subject to equivalent evolutionary forces and how natural selection shapes the evolution of proteins in an interacting system. Although previous studies found that upstream genes in the pathway evolved more slowly than downstream genes, the correlation between evolutionary rate and position of the genes in metabolic pathways {{as well as its}} implications in molecular evolution are still less understood. Results We sequenced and characterized 7 core structural genes of the gibberellin biosynthetic pathway from 8 representative species of the rice tribe (Oryzeae) to address alternative hypotheses regarding evolutionary rates and patterns of metabolic pathway genes. We have detected significant rate heterogeneity among 7 GA pathway genes for both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites. Such rate variation is mostly likely attributed to differences of selection intensity rather than differential <b>mutation</b> <b>pressures</b> on the genes. Unlike previous argument that downstream genes in metabolic pathways would evolve more slowly than upstream genes, the downstream genes in the GA pathway did not exhibited the elevated substitution rate and instead, the genes that encode either the enzyme at the branch point (GA 20 ox) or enzymes catalyzing multiple steps (KO, KAO and GA 3 ox) in the pathway had the lowest evolutionary rates due to strong purifying selection. Our branch and codon models failed to detect signature of positive selection for any lineage and codon of the GA pathway genes. Conclusion This study suggests that significant heterogeneity of evolutionary rate of the GA pathway genes is mainly ascribed to differential constraint relaxation rather than the positive selection and supports the pathway flux theory that predicts that natural selection primarily targets enzymes that have the greatest control on fluxes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{bacterial}} chromosomes exhibit asymmetry of base composition {{with respect}} to leading vs. lagging strands (GC and AT skews). These skews reflect mainly those in protein coding sequences, which are driven by asymmetric <b>mutation</b> <b>pressures</b> during replication and transcription (notably asymmetric cytosine deamination) plus subsequent selection for preferred structures, signals, amino acid or codons. The transcription-associated effects but not the replication-associated effects contribute to the overall skews through the uneven distribution of the coding sequences on the leading and lagging strands. Results Analysis of 185 representative bacterial chromosomes showed diverse and characteristic patterns of skews among different clades. The base composition skews in the coding sequences were used to derive quantitatively the effect of replication-driven mutation plus subsequent selection ('replication-associated pressure', RAP), {{and the effect of}} transcription-driven mutation plus subsequent selection at translation level ('transcription-associate pressure', TAP). While different clades exhibit distinct patterns of RAP and TAP, RAP is absent or nearly absent in some bacteria, but TAP is present in all. The selection pressure at the translation level is evident in all bacteria based on the analysis of the skews at the three codon positions. Contribution of asymmetric cytosine deamination was found to be weak to TAP in most phyla, and strong to RAP in all the Proteobacteria but weak in most of the Firmicutes. This possibly reflects the differences in their chromosomal replication machineries. A strong negative correlation between TAP and G+C content and between TAP and chromosomal size were also revealed. Conclusion The study reveals the diverse mutation and selection forces associated with replication and transcription in various groups of bacteria that shape the distinct patterns of base composition skews in the chromosomes during evolution. Some closely relative species with distinct base composition parameters are uncovered in this study, which also provides opportunities for comparative bioinformatic and genetic investigations to uncover the underlying principles for mutation and selection. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Due {{to their}} {{bi-directional}} replication machinery starting {{from a single}} finite origin, bacterial genomes show characteristic nucleotide compositional bias between the two replichores, which can be visualised through GC skew or (C-G) /(C+G). Although this polarisation is used for computational prediction of replication origins in many bacterial genomes, the degree of GC skew visibility varies widely among different species, necessitating a quantitative measurement of GC skew strength {{in order to provide}} confidence measures for GC skew-based predictions of replication origins. Results Here we discuss a quantitative index for the measurement of GC skew strength, named the generalised GC skew index (gGCSI), which is applicable to genomes of any length, including bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. We demonstrate that gGCSI is independent of the window size and can thus be used to compare genomes with different sizes, such as bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. It can suggest the existence of different replication mechanisms in archaea and of rolling-circle replication in plasmids. Correlation of gGCSI values between plasmids and their corresponding host chromosomes suggests that within the same strain, these replicons have reproduced using the same replication machinery and thus exhibit similar strengths of replication strand skew. Conclusions gGCSI can be applied to genomes of any length and thus allows comparative study of replication-related <b>mutation</b> and selection <b>pressures</b> in genomes of different lengths such as bacterial chromosomes and plasmids.

The total deaths were about 24 per cent, less than the July average for the previous 14 years...|$|R
40|$|The C- 824 T single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism in the promoter region of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene {{has been associated with}} hypertension. It is well documented that African South Africans exhibit a higher prevalence of hypertension than Caucasians. However, the possible role of this mutation on 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP) has not been investigated in African South Africans. Blood samples of 409 South Africans were screened for the <b>mutation.</b> Ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> and lifestyle factors were also measured. Africans had higher incidence of hypertension and higher occurrence of the mutation. However, the contribution of the tyrosine hydroxylase C- 824 T {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism to hypertension could not be confirmed in our cohort. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, network {{analysis}} attracted {{the interest of}} analysts in exploring topological shapes, properties and features of real-world netowrks. Knowledge of the network properties allows to analyse {{the characteristics of the}} network function. For instance, the topology of a social network affects the spread of information and its stability. A point of interest is the assessment of robustness and resistance of networks after nodes deletion. Suitable metrics can be used to characterize global network sensitivity and vulnerability to local changes. In our study we use the Bienenstock & Bonacich (2004) network robustness measure as a fitness function and look for subsets of the original network whose deletion most affects the network connectivity. The problem can be described as to find the smallest set of nodes whose deletion has the highest impact on the efficiency criterion. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are powerful heuristics for attacking NP-hard problems. In a very general way, a GA mimics the principles of natural selection (crossover, <b>mutation,</b> selective <b>pressure)</b> to solve problems. Because GA implements other optimization methods to help finding good starting points, we can then use traditional optimization techniques to refine solution. An application to innovative networks is provided...|$|R
