[...] Bakke focused not just on the economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it. [...] As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject. [...] He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like [...] "I'd rather be dead and buried" [...] and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, [...] "I would hide <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground and pound the earth." [...] The 2004 Encyclopedia of the Great Depression states that Bakke's New Haven study stands [...] "as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being" [...] and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, [...] "Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work." [...] Alice O'Connor, {{a professor of history at}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in 2010 that, [...] "Seventy years later, the study's analysis still resonates".|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am an unlucky devil,' growled Hughie. 'The {{best thing}} I {{can do is}} to go to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn't tell any one. I shouldn't dare show <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Row.' ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I was played out, {{and gave up}} hope. The {{schooner}} was still two hundred feet away. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, and I was watching him maneuver for another attempt, when I saw a brown body pass between us. It was Otoo.|$|R
6000|$|The deep grass {{moved and}} whispered And bowed and brushed <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> It whispered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunshine: [...] "The winter comes apace." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{was called}} upon, {{and in a}} few brief words {{substantiated}} his story: indeed <b>my</b> <b>face</b> did that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sight of all men.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} speak. The thought that I {{had brought him}} to this {{in spite of his}} desire to be friendly, {{overwhelmed}} me. I could only seize his hand, bury <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bed-clothes, and sob.|$|E

60|$|If I had {{not been}} angry clear through at that cub I might have let go. He {{ploughed}} <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dirt, and almost jerked my arms off. Suddenly the strain lessened. I got up, {{to see that the}} old hunter had hold of the other rope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanin' that we're {{to go back}} {{in search}} of Jacob?" [...] I asked, feeling for the moment as if it would be {{impossible}} for me to voluntarily turn <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the enemy, now that I was no longer animated by the fever of battle.|$|E

60|$|Right {{opposite}} Petrarch's birth-house--and it {{must have}} been the well whence the water was drawn that first bathed him--is a well which Boccaccio has introduced into one of his stories. It is surrounded with a stone curb, octagonal in shape, and evidently as ancient as Boccaccio's time. It has a wooden cover, through which is a square opening, and looking down I saw <b>my</b> own <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water far beneath.|$|R

6000|$|All, all, he read, ay, {{even the}} indifference, [...] The vain talk, vainer silence, hope and dream. He {{questioned}} me: [...] "What seek'st thou then instead?"

60|$|Suddenly {{from behind}} I heard a tumult of howls, and sharp, {{piercing}} barks--much {{the sound that}} a pack of wolves raises when in full cry.

6000|$|... "What a {{creature}} is mortal man! He pines for {{things which are}} not of his gift and treats the bounties of Providence lightly. No matter, no matter.

6000|$|... "I {{have never}} looked in a mirror," [...] she wrote. [...] "I never {{knew there was}} such a thing until after mother died, and I read about it in a book.

6000|$|The {{reporters have}} just left. I'll see them next, and last time, from the scaffold, ere the hangman hides <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black cap. They {{will be looking}} curiously sick. Queer young fellows. Some show {{that they have been}} drinking. Two or three look sick with foreknowledge of what they have to witness. It seems easier to be hanged than to look on. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|My plan succeeded. I had not resumed the {{appearance}} {{of attention to the}} preacher for five minutes, when the same voice whispered, [...] "Listen, but do not look back."

6000|$|... "SHE {{reminded}} me. While I {{was looking}} at her, while she {{was very close to}} me, it came over my mind suddenly that we were like each other! Her face was pale and thin and weary--but the sight of it startled me, {{as if it had been}} the sight of <b>my</b> own <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glass after a long illness.

60|$|HIGGINS. Just {{the other}} way about. She threw <b>my</b> {{slippers}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> She behaved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most outrageous way.
