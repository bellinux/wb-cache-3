40|$|Abstract. Some terrible {{disasters}} of aircrafts {{were caused}} by inadequate lubrication or interruption of lubricant delivery of the gas turbine engine <b>mainshaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> This paper introduces {{the design of the}} test equipment, performs the experiments of failure performance for 51306 coated bearings to respond to oil interruption under the actual situation. The main failure performance of test coated bearings has been demonstrated to be the cage damage of the test coated bearing. The failure mechanism model of the damaged cage of test coated bearings under oil interruption condition is established for the failure analysis of damage cages. The failure mechanism of the damaged cages is revealed. The main reason for the damages of test coated bearing cages under lubricant interruption condition is that the perpendicular component force acted on the cage increases continually to go with the increase of the friction force between the balls and the cage due to inadequate lubrication until the cage is broken...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear rate in conical thrust bearings, which is {{responsible}} for field failures of stepper motors in optical disk drives (ODD). These bearings support the stepper motor worm shaft and consist of a steel ball supported in a polymer conical <b>bearing</b> <b>cup.</b> The tribological behaviors of polymers used in bearing application has been addressed by using Archard's wear model, a well known classical model for fretting wear in the literature. However, these studies were for planar bearing surfaces and other geometries, not for the conical geometry addressed in this study. Tests were designed and implemented to study the wear rate of the conical <b>bearing</b> <b>cups</b> at with different load levels. The tribological behavior of Delrin in conical thrust bearing applications has been characterized, by quantifying the wear factors used in the modified Archard's model. Distinct reduction of wear rate is observed due to formation of a polymer transfer film on the steel ball. The variability of the wear properties is explored through replication of the test conditions. Destructive physical analysis is conducted to gain insight into the fundamental wear mechanisms as a part of this study. The results of the wear tests are used to develop a life model of the stepper motor as a case study, to demonstrate an application of this approach. The life model is used to study the effect of variability in the initial axial bearing preload (due to manufacturing tolerances), on the wear rate and life of the stepper motor...|$|R

Thus the stack height of the stem becomes important. The steerer tube of the fork must be cut to length such that it leaves at least enough of the steerer tube protruding above the headset for the stem to clamp on to; if the steerer tube is cut longer than the stem, then spacers are used {{to fill the gap}} between the stem and the conical compression washer.

Results indicate that hang-up of the cartridge due to bearing heating is a serious problem especially if poor lubrication of the bearing occurs and that race growth due to axial load can contribute to cartridge lock-up.

The rollers of the bearing had failed by flaking, a form of fatigue failure. Analysis shows that the most probable reason for the premature flaking in the bearing could be excessive axial load. The failure pattern and the aircraft behaviour during take-off roll strongly support this conclusion. However, the possibility of excessive axial load on the port main wheel needs to be examined...|$|R
