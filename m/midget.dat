5|$|Andretti raced <b>midget</b> {{cars from}} 1961 to 1963. He started racing 3/4 (sized) <b>midget</b> {{cars in the}} American Three Quarter <b>Midget</b> Racing Association in the winter {{to be seen by}} {{full-sized}} <b>midget</b> car owners. He raced in over one hundred events in 1963. Andretti won three feature races at two different tracks on Labor Day in 1963. He won an afternoon feature at Flemington, New Jersey, and swept twin features at Hatfield, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The main {{flaw in the}} Japanese plans {{was the use of}} <b>midget</b> {{submarines}} for {{the primary}} attack. <b>Midget</b> submarines were originally intended to operate during fleet actions: they would be released from modified seaplane carriers to run amok through the enemy fleet. This concept went out of favour as changing Japanese naval thinking and experience led to recognition that naval warfare would centre around carrier-supported aerial combat. As a result, the <b>midget</b> program's focus changed to the infiltration of enemy harbours, where they would attack vessels at anchor. This concept failed completely during the attack on Pearl Harbor, where the midgets had no effect, and tying up 11 large submarines for six weeks in support of further <b>midget</b> submarine attacks on Sydney and Diego Suarez proved a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|After playing AAA <b>midget</b> {{with the}} Strathmore Bisons of the Foothills Bisons Hockey Association, Raymond began a two-year Junior A {{career with the}} Camrose Kodiaks of the AJHL in 2003–04.

Bertram also played <b>midget</b> with Raymond and went on to be a Chicago Blackhawks draft pick, three selections after him.|$|E

5|$|As per the {{operation}} plan, the five mother submarines waited off Port Hacking on the nights of 1 and 2 June for the <b>midget</b> submarines to return. FRUMEL picked up wireless traffic between the five submarines, leading the RAAF to task three Lockheed Hudsons and two Bristol Beauforts with finding {{the source of}} the communications. They were unsuccessful. On 3 June, Sasaki abandoned hope of recovering the <b>midget</b> submarines, and the submarines dispersed on their secondary missions.|$|E
5|$|Eberle played novice with Hockey Regina's tier-1 Kings and amassed 216 goals over sixty {{games in}} 1999–2000. He {{went on to}} play Bantam AAA for the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, as a fourteen-year-old. After being {{selected}} by his hometown major junior team, the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL), in the seventh round (126th overall) of the 2005 WHL Bantam Draft, Eberle joined the <b>midget</b> ranks with the Calgary Buffaloes of the Alberta <b>Midget</b> Hockey League (AMHL). He won a bronze medal with the Buffaloes at the 2006 Mac's <b>Midget</b> Hockey Tournament, scoring two goals in the bronze-medal game against the Prince Albert Mintos. He helped his team qualify for the 2006 Telus Cup national <b>midget</b> championship, where the Buffaloes lost a 5–4 triple-overtime game in the final against the Mintos.

5000|$|Rice {{was born}} George J. Viola. When he started racing, he drove sprint cars, not <b>midgets.</b> When {{he heard about}} <b>midgets</b> he wanted to try them but his sprint car club at that time don't permit drivers to compete in other series. Viola took the last name of his friend Charlie Rice to become [...] "George Rice". When his younger brother, John, decided to race <b>midgets</b> also, he took the name Johnny Rice and the pair {{became known as the}} [...] "Rice Brothers".|$|R
50|$|He won the 1974 and 1976 {{national}} USAC sprint car championships. He was {{the first}} driver to win the two USAC championships - <b>midgets</b> and sprint cars. He has wins in three USAC divisions - <b>midgets,</b> sprints and Silver Crown (formerly known as Dirt Cars).|$|R
5|$|In late May {{and early}} June 1942, during World War II, {{submarines}} {{belonging to the}} Imperial Japanese Navy {{made a series of}} attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. On the night of 31 May – 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki-class <b>midget</b> submarines, each with a two-member crew, entered Sydney Harbour, avoided the partially constructed Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net, and attempted to sink Allied warships. Two of the <b>midget</b> submarines were detected and attacked before they could successfully engage any Allied vessels, and the crews scuttled their boats and killed themselves. These submarines were later recovered by the Allies. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser , but instead sank the converted ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors. This <b>midget</b> submarine's fate was unknown until 2006, when amateur scuba divers discovered the wreck off Sydney's northern beaches.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, the {{failures}} at Sydney Harbour and Diego Suarez {{demonstrated that the}} improvements to the <b>midget</b> submarines made after Pearl Harbor had not increased the overall impact of the <b>midget</b> program. The modifications had various effects. The ability to man and deploy the midgets while the mother ships were submerged prevented the Army coastal radars from detecting the mother submarines. However, the midgets were still difficult to control, unstable, and prone to surfacing or diving uncontrollably. These manoeuvrability issues contributed to M-14s entanglement in the anti-submarine net, and the repeated detection of M-21 and M-24.|$|E
5|$|Schenn played minor hockey in his {{hometown}} of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He played AAA <b>midget</b> hockey for the Saskatoon Contacts.

5|$|The Japanese Navy used five Ko-hyoteki-class <b>midget</b> {{submarines}} in {{an unsuccessful}} operation against US battleships during {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor. The navy hoped that upgrades to the submarines, intensified crew training, and {{the selection of a}} less well defended target would lead to better results and an increased chance of the crews of the midgets to return alive from their mission. Therefore, on 16 December 1941, the navy initiated plans for a second <b>midget</b> submarine operation.|$|E

5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated {{back to when}} Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of water}} on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's <b>midget</b> sidekick Dink. The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a <b>midget</b> named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler. Doink and Lawler then introduced many more midgets over the following weeks. An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.|$|E
