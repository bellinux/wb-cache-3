40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} support the {{optimization}} of mortarless brick linings of steel producing furnaces it is proposed in this paper to investigate only the compressibility of dry refractory joints. To this end, optical measurements based on the Digital Image Correlation method were carried out during compression of <b>Magnesia-Carbon</b> <b>brick</b> samples with dry joints. The second main objective is to assess {{the accuracy of the}} secant linearization schemes (the classical secant procedure and its modified extension) to reproduce the reference local and global behaviour of refractory mortarless linings accounting for the identified inelastic convex powerlaw behaviour of the Magnesia-Carbon dry joint. The reference nonlinear solution is obtained by means of finite elements method. Under normal compressive loading, unlike for usual (concave) power-law viscoplastic composites for which the secant schemes are known to provide too stiff results, {{it was found that the}} modified secant scheme leads to good overall predictions. The classical secant procedure underestimates the reference local and overall behaviour. To improve the latter result, an empirical improved secant formulation was proposed and implemented. It leads to better estimates at local and global levels...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluates commercially {{available}} magnesia–chromite, <b>magnesia–carbon</b> and magnesia–doloma <b>bricks</b> {{for their use}} in a Vacuum Oxygen Decarburisation ladle. The corrosion behaviour of these bricks by stainless steelmaking slags is, therefore, investigated through crucible tests in a vacuum induction furnace at elevated temperatures (1650 and 1750 1 C) and low oxygen partial pressures (5. 3 and 3. 0 1011 atm). The results reveal that <b>magnesia–carbon</b> <b>bricks</b> are severely corroded due to the high dissolution of MgO, while magnesia–chromite and magnesia–doloma refractories exhibit an excellent corrosion resistance. The MgO enrichment in the slag {{is believed to be}} the reason of the low wear rate of the MgO–doloma refractories. Rebonded and direct-bonded MgO–chromite refractories show similar corrosion resistance against the slags because of the ‘secondary chromite inactivation’. Decreasing the slag basicity enhances the dissolution of MgO into the slag, thereby increasing the corrosion of the magnesia-based refractories. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo support {{optimisation}} of refractory masonry structures compressibility of dry joints of <b>magnesia-carbon</b> and magnesia-chromite <b>bricks</b> {{have been}} investigated. Laboratory scale tests and finite element modelling have been performed. Measurements done in {{wide temperature range}} {{have shown that the}} exponential form of the joint closure curve results from gradual closure of initially non-parallel surfaces. The stress needed to close the joint was found to be proportional to the material stiffness. Temperature influences the joint closure by changing the stiffness of material and by reducing the initial joint gap due to thermal expansion...|$|R

Refractory ceramic linings of high temperature furnaces are often built with bricks. Brick chemical composition and geometry are selected regarding the service conditions and the lining structure [1].
