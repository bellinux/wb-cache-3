5|$|It now {{dawned on}} the Privy Council {{that it had}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake. Led by the Earl of Arundel and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council {{publicly}} proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himself—as he had been commanded to do by {{a letter from the}} Council. William Paget and the Earl of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who followed him to the scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in Wyatt's rebellion.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Hunte was run out for 79, after what {{at the time}} was a record second wicket stand for West Indies against Australia of 163, but Kanhai went on to his second hundred of the match, 115. Worrell made 53 and Alexander was 87 not out at the {{declaration}} on 432-6, made at a rate of 59 runs per 100 balls. This left Australia a mammoth 461 to win, which subsequent events suggested might have been over-cautious. Australia <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> start, ending the day on 32-3, with defeat looking likely. First McDonald was run out, and then Hall had both Favell and Simpson caught by Alexander behind the stumps.|$|E
25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> error {{by placing a}} cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, {{all he could do was}} contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E

500|$|Jimmy Burns, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} the Financial Times, speculated that it was plausible that [...] "MI6's senior management realised they had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake in recruiting someone who thought that espionage was just one big adventure." [...] He concluded, however, that the book [...] "left me with {{the feeling that the}} spooks in Whitehall could have avoided a great deal of adverse publicity by agreeing to Tomlinson's original proposal: an employment tribunal held in camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake, no more movies. I hate this business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I probably even know about".|$|E
500|$|Jacobs knew of a Chelsea socialite, a 37-year-old divorcé called Nicky Byrne, {{and when}} encountering {{him at a}} friend's {{cocktail}} party offered him the project, saying that [...] "Brian [...] has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mess out of this [...]" [...] Byrne, who has {{said he had been}} [...] "sitting around doing nothing for half of 1963" [...] was an ex-Horse Guard trooper and amateur racing driver. He had also previously been involved in music publishing, clothes design, theatre production, managing the Condor club in London, and was also known as being a {{part of a group of}} people who called themselves [...] "The King's Road Rats". He had not had any previous experience of merchandising or managing a large business.|$|E

500|$|Ramsey was vilified by {{the fans}} and press after the semi-final, with one Spurs {{director}} saying: [...] "Ramsey stupidly gave the goal away. He could have easily kicked {{the ball out of}} play." [...] Ramsey was publicly contrite—"I can only say I am terribly sorry", he told the Daily Express—but in the Spurs dressing room he analysed the move that had led to Mudie's goal and attempted to identify others as being at fault. This notwithstanding, [...] "for all his reluctance to accept the blame in front of his colleagues, Alf knew he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> error," [...] McKinstry writes. The error haunted him profoundly. It began to be speculated during the 1953–54 season that he might return to Southampton, who had been relegated to the Third Division South, in a role combining playing duties with coaching. He was not yet finished as a Spurs player, though; indeed in 1954, after Burgess left to join Swansea Town, he was appointed club captain.|$|E
500|$|The new {{publisher}} scrapped Vanderbilt's editorial policy, {{and began}} a campaign against vice. The Los Angeles police chief, James E. Davis, had a hands-off policy {{when it came to}} vice and organized crime. Most local reporters valued the perks given to them by the police, and did nothing to push the issue. [...] After Boddy began a crusade against crime and corruption, he weathered harassment by police and politicians, circulation rose, and the paper was soon showing a profit. Boddy also streamlined operations and stabilized the paper's management. During the first six years of Boddy's ownership, the Daily News maintained a conservative editorial policy. By 1932, Boddy had dropped the word [...] "Illustrated" [...] from the name of the paper. He was a personal supporter of Herbert Hoover's bid for reelection. Los Angeles newspaper owners met and decided that, with all newspaper owners supporting Hoover, one paper had to support Democratic candidate and New York governor Franklin Roosevelt, and Boddy and the Daily News volunteered for the job. The day after the election, which saw Roosevelt elected, Boddy turned to his city editor and said of the voters: [...] "They have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake. I helped them do it. But damn it, I had to make a living." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Destitute Asylums (usually {{known as}} Benevolent Asylums or [...] for the destitute) were {{institutions}} established throughout the colonies of Australia in the 19th century to house deserted and destitute men, {{women and children}} not able to support themselves. Low employment prospects, poor conditions in the sleeping quarters and the adjoining workhouse and few hopes of finding a husband or some means of support <b>made</b> for <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> and prolonged experience behind {{the walls of the}} asylum.|$|R

5000|$|In 1978, Hall was {{appointed}} Ireland's national film censor. During his period as censor {{he was known}} for his strict application of Irish censorship and his defence of family values. Among the films banned by him was Monty Python's Life of Brian, which he described as [...] "offensive to Christians and to Jews as well, because it <b>made</b> them appear <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> load of gobshites".|$|R
2500|$|On {{the same}} day, Elizabeth Edwards {{released}} a statement that first appeared on the liberal blog, The Daily Kos. The statement said that, in 2006, [...] "John had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake," [...] though {{she went on to}} praise her husband for [...] "courage in the face of shame." [...] She also said that she hoped people would watch the interview that aired later that night on the ABC News late-night program, Nightline, in which her husband admitted the affair to Woodruff. She did, in her statement, criticize the claims that her husband fathered a child as an [...] "absurd lie in a tabloid publication." [...] Elizabeth Edwards' seemingly willing participation in the efforts to cover up the affair have also been called into question. [...] "I think she's complicit," [...] said Brad Crone, a Raleigh-based Democratic consultant. [...] "Obviously, she knew. While she's the victim, she clearly didn't {{stand in the way of}} the cover-up." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} {{widespread}} speculation, based on Riggs' unusually poor play and {{large number of}} unforced errors, that Riggs had purposely lost the match {{in order to win}} large sums of money that he had bet against himself, as a way to pay off his gambling debts. ESPN's Outside the Lines on August 25, 2013 featured {{a man who had been}} silent for 40 years who said he heard several members of the mafia talking about Riggs throwing the match in exchange for cancelling his gambling debt to the mob. On the other hand, the article says Riggs' close friend and estate executor Lornie Kuhle vehemently denied he was ever in debt to the mob or received a payoff from them. The article also quotes Riggs' son who claims his father felt he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake and was depressed for six months following the match. Riggs wanted a rematch but not King. He considered suing her as a rematch had been part of the contract. King and Riggs would appear together spoofing their rivalry less than two months after the match on an episode of The Odd Couple (titled [...] "The Pig Who Came To Dinner") and they became good friends.|$|E
2500|$|Originally from Chicago, Illinois, Lewis {{had several}} run-ins {{with the law}} during the 1880s and early 90s. In 1880, Lewis was arrested for the {{shooting}} of Boston thief Billy Flynn in Detroit but was acquitted by a jury who ruled he had acted in self-defense. He later made the acquaintance of Gen. John A. Logan and, one night while dining {{with him at the}} Fifth Avenue Hotel, a hotel detective informed Logan of Lewis's identity. Logan scoffed at the detective's claim and remarked [...] "Why sir, that man is one of my best friends. You have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake here". Lewis excused himself after borrowing $500 from him and disappeared. He similarly befriended Charles Francis Adams and lured the elderly man into a Boston Common banco game where he and his friends swindled him out of several thousand dollars. Later in Philadelphia, he represented himself to Samuel J. Randall as the son of banker A.J. Drexel. He was apparently so convincing that, when the actual son of Drexel called on the house by chance, Ramsden believed the young man was the impostor and threw him out of his home. He and another noted banco man, [...] "Western Sam", spent an entire summer in Long Branch, New Jersey where they conned over $100,000 from residents. 3 May 1896 ...|$|E
60|$|On the way I {{passed through}} Sir Charles Warren's camp, and there found {{a gang of}} prisoners--forty-eight of them--all in a row almost the same number that the Boers had taken in the {{armoured}} train.

5000|$|One of {{the last}} Ward Bond episodes, [...] "The River Crossing", {{broadcast}} in December 1960, offer some insights. Reference is <b>made</b> to <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> accident that occurred to a wagon in one of Adams's wagon trains five years earlier, and Adams reminds Wooster that they have crossed this spot {{at least a dozen}} times before, which suggests they had worked together on wagon trains for at least a dozen years. A cloudburst forces about fifty wagons to wait {{on one side of the}} river and this is spoken of as [...] "half the train", suggesting the entire wagon train has about a hundred wagons (only about twelve ever appeared on the screen at once).|$|R

2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished kids, who were begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant I handed a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes glaring at me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring into my eyes and squawking her horrible song. She plainly expected me to be surprised that she could sing in Russian.

The Red Baron, who {{believed}} in his younger brother's victory award, considered Ball [...] "by far the best English flying man". Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, [...] "I see they have given him the V.C.

Unfortunately, this didn't sit well with Harlock as he felt it was a betrayal of what he believed in. He also saw in this the hypocrisy of the Gaia Sanction. Enraged, Harlock broke rank, opened fire on the immigrants, and turned his guns upon his own fleet. With only the Arcadia now under his command, the ship was badly damaged, Tochiro seemingly killed, and they were being boarded. In a high-risk gamble for survival and protection of the Earth, Harlock asked Miime (Nibelung observer and engineer of his ship) to unleash dark matter upon the Earth to protect it from humanity.
