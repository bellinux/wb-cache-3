The company had returned to modest profitability, new markets were cultivated, and employment had risen to some 35 permanent workers, with 50 at work during the busy summer season. In May 1986, Healy took an optimistic approach to the challenges that Hibernia faced, noting that “although the growth has not been spectacular, it has been very steady, and that tells me I’m getting repeat business, which is the key to the whole thing.” [...] Yet dark clouds remained on the horizon. While contract brewing had aided the Hibernia bottom line considerably, periodic difficulties arose in the area as well, including the loss of production for the Vienna Brewing Company in June 1986 to the Joseph Huber Brewing Company (Monroe, Wisconsin) and an open controversy over Hibernia <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> Treaty <b>Beer,</b> for resort owners and vacation business groups opposed to recognition of off-reservation harvest rights (including spearfishing) held by Native American Ojibwe in Wisconsin.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{providing}} fundamental information con ern ing the manufacture, composition, and consumption of the major Kenyan traditional fermented beverages. In Chapter 1, the reader is introduced to Kenya, its population and climate, and several aspects of its agriculture underlying this study. Chapter 2 offers {{an overview of the}} major fermented beverages con sumed in Kenya. A distinction is made between traditional and foreign fermented beverages. Both groups <b>of</b> products include <b>beers</b> and wines, as well as spirits. The traditional fermented beverages play an important role, particularly in the rural daily life, they are cheap and are usually prepared from locally available ingre dients such as honey, maize, millets or palm-sap. Their age-old manufacturing techniques are known through oral tradition and are often quite primitive. The final products are obtained by way of uncontrolled fermentations, and are mostly consumed in a stage of active fermentation. Except for the spirits, the traditional fermented beverages have only a short shelf-life since excessive souring soon renders them unacceptable. Most foreign fermented beverages have been introduced into Kenya during the period of colonial administration; nowadays, a number are manufactured locally, on a large industrial scale. In Chapter 3, mention is made of recent measures taken by the Kenyan Government to curb alcoholism through prohibition and clo sure <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> halls, and to increase productivity. These measures tend to favour the illegal trade in traditional fermented bever agesand,in particular, the consumption of illicit traditional spirit of dubious quality. The aims of the ensuing study are formulated in Chapter 4, and include providing insight in the consumption of the major Kenyan traditional fermented beverages, their nutritive value, and their possible harmfulness to health. Furthermore, a study will be made of ways of improving upon the quality and shelf-life of a selected traditional <b>beer</b> <b>of</b> superior nutritive value. In Chapter 5, an estimate is made of the total consumption of alcoholic beverages in Kenya. It is shown that the traditional fermented beverages represent a major proportion of the total con sumption of alcohol. This is not surprising since the traditional products are relatively cheap and can be afforded by the majority of the Kenyan public. In the same chapter, it is observed that the consumption of alco hol in Kenya is moderate, compared with other countries. The nutrient content of selected traditional and foreign beverages is compared in Chapter 6. It is concluded that the traditional beer Busaa has the highest nutritive value, particularly when considering its protein, vitamin B 2 , and niacin contents. The nutritive value of the traditional spirit Chang'aa is the least. The consumption of Chang'aa occupies a major proportion of the total quantity of alcohol consumed in Kenya. The chemical composition of this spirit is studied in some further detail in Chapter 7. In particular, the fusel oil content of Chang'aa is studied, as well as the effect of ingredients and distilling techniques on its occurrence in this spirit. In Chapters 8, 9, and 10 several aspects <b>of</b> the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the traditional <b>beer</b> Busaa are dealt with. In Chapter 8, some microbiological aspects <b>of</b> the traditional <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> this <b>beer</b> are discussed. In particular, attention is given to the dominant yeasts and bacteria, involved in the stages of fermentation and subsequent spoilage. In Chapter 9, experimental work is described, aimed at the development of a process for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> bottled and preserved Busaa. The malt used as ingredient for Busaa is usually obtained from finger millet. In most other African countries however, sorghum is used for such purpose. Although sorghum is easily available in Kenya as well, the Busaa brewers nevertheless prefer the use of finger millet malt for the brewing of Busaa. In Chapter 10 therefore, the germination characteristics and the brewing potential of finger millet and sorghum are compared. Barley is also included in this comparative study, since it is grown in Kenya as ingredient for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> foreign lager <b>beers.</b> In Chapter 11, the major findings from the study are discussed, and conclusions and recommendations are formulated with regard to a possible control of the consumption of traditional fermented beverages. On the one hand, these are aimed at a reduction and subsequent gradual abolishment of home-brewing of traditional fermented beverages. On the other hand, the consumption of cheap traditional fermented beverages of high nutritive value such as Busaa, is advocated to be allowed to continue off-licence on a restricted scale. Such products should offer a cheap, high-grade substitute for other, less appropriate, products which would eventually be phased out. It is finally observed that an upgrading of the quality and shelf-life of the former beverages would facilitate an adjustment of the present consumption pattern...|$|R

40|$|The use of more concentrated, {{so-called}} high-gravity and very-high-gravity (VHG) brewer's worts for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> has {{economic and}} environmental advantages. However, many current strains of brewer's yeasts ferment VHG worts slowly and incompletely, leaving undesirably large amounts of maltose and especially maltotriose in the final beers. α-Glucosides are transported into Saccharomyces yeasts by several transporters, including Agt 1, {{which is a good}} carrier of both maltose and maltotriose. The AGT 1 genes of brewer's ale yeast strains encode functional transporters, but the AGT 1 genes of the lager strains studied contain a premature stop codon and do not encode functional transporters. In the present work, one or more copies of the AGT 1 gene of a lager strain were repaired with DNA sequence from an ale strain and put under the control of a constitutive promoter. Compared to the untransformed strain, the transformants with repaired AGT 1 had higher maltose transport activity, especially after growth on glucose (which represses endogenous α-glucoside transporter genes) and higher ratios of maltotriose transport activity to maltose transport activity. They fermented VHG (24 ° Plato) wort faster and more completely, producing beers containing more ethanol and less residual maltose and maltotriose.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{technological}} process of brewing beer, describes the raw materials needed for its production, and points out the useful and harmful substances contained in beer as biogenic amines (BA). Furthermore, there are described the issues of biogenic amines in food and primarily in beer, which is a histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and tryptamine. In the practical section BA was determined in lager bottom-fermented beers from local microbreweries and large industrial breweries. Beer is according to legislation considered as a safe food containing a variety of healthful nutrients such as B vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, soluble fiber and polyphenolic merged, which have anticarcinogenic, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. On the other hand, in beer we can find harmful substances such as alcohol, heavy metals, N-nitrosamines, aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, nitrates and biogenic amines. In {{the second part of}} the research are summarized the issues of BA in certain foods and beverages, their chemical structure, the way how they are created and their negative effects on the human body. BA are natural, biologically active substances that are essential for the human organism. Their excessive amount in beer is toxic for the human organism. Ethanol contained in the beer decreases the activity of the enzyme monoamine oxidase, and this leads to reduced degradation of BA. Intoxication of BA can cause headaches, vomiting, hypertension, allergic reactions, rashes and even loss of consciousness, therefore, should be the content of these substances monitored. In the practical part of this theses the samples of bottom-fermented beers were analyzed. The first group of samples included unfiltred and unpsaterized beers from microbreweries. In the second group there were filtered and pasteurized beers from large breweries. HPLC determined BA in beer (histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine and tryptamine). The resulting values indicate that the domestic beers contain biogenic amines in very small concentrations, thus satisfy the legislative standarts. The results were also compared between the two groups of samples. These samples showed that the beer from microbreweries is not contaminated as originally was expected.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> malt and <b>beer</b> {{requires}} {{large amounts}} of electrical and thermal energy which is nowadays mainly based on fossil fuels. In State of the Art breweries 7. 5 – 11. 5 kWhel [1] and 16. 7 – 33. 3 kWhth [1, 2] per hl <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> are needed (reference: final energy demand) and the annual output of medium to large sized breweries may easily exceed one million hl. The entire process heat demand of the thermally driven processes in breweries and malting plants can be met with heat at a temperature of between 25 and 105 °C on process level [3, 4]. This enables the integration of solar thermal energy supplied by conventional, non- concentrating solar thermal collector technologies such as flat-plate or evacuated tube collectors. In fact, providing thermal energy by means of solar thermal systems is mostly energy efficient if the energy from the sun is converted into heat and supplied to the process at minimum required temperature level (referred to as solar integration on process level). With this regard and {{in the framework of}} a European Union-funded demonstration project, three large-scale solar thermal systems (each with an installed thermal peak capacity ≥ 1 MWth) are being realized. The focus of the project is to demonstrate the integration of large scale solar thermal systems on process level for different applications (mashing, pasteurization <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> drying <b>of</b> green malt) at process temperatures below 80 °C.

A avaliaÃÃo da composiÃÃo quÃmica, digestibilidade in vitro e degradabilidade in situ do RUC in natura e ensilado demonstraram que o material pode ser caracterizado como alimento volumoso com potencial de uso na alimentaÃÃo de ruminantesThe {{high cost of}} feed for ruminants is a limiting factor for increasing productivity, boosting the search for alternative sources of food {{in order to minimize}} production costs. The breweryâs waste (BW) deserves prominence in this situation, because it has high nutritional quality and great potential for livestock production. The BW {{is the result of the}} initial processing <b>of</b> the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>beers,</b> however the limitations to effective use of the RUC in animal feed are mainly related with storage and high humidity of the material, hindering the transport and storage. The ensiling of the BW is presented as an efficient alternative in the preservation of the material, paying attention to the quality of the material after the process of anaerobic fermentation. The nutritional evaluation of the BW is of fundamental importance for achieving efficiency in the diets, optimize productive performance and reduce costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate methods of conservation aerobic and anaerobic of breweryâs waste, performing microbiological testing and evaluating the quality of silage fermentation, chemical composition, as well the digestibility in vitro and degradability in situ breweryâs waste in natura and ensiled. The conservation of the breweryâs waste packaged under aerobic conditions was not appropriate because the strong development of filamentous fungi and yeasts; however the storage under anaerobic conditions proved to be an efficient conservation process. The ensilage breweryâs waste preserved nutritional quality of the material. The evaluation of chemical composition, in vitro digestibility and in situ degradability of in natura and ensiled BW showed that the material can be characterized as roughage feed with potential use in ruminant fee...|$|R
