50|$|Finger core construction: Finger core {{engineered}} wood floors {{are made of}} small pieces of milled timber that run perpendicular to the top layer (lamella) of wood. They can be 2-ply or 3-ply, depending on their intended use. If it is three ply, the third ply is often plywood that runs parallel to the lamella. Stability is gained through the grains running perpendicular to each other, and the expansion and contraction of wood is reduced and relegated to the <b>middle</b> <b>ply,</b> stopping the floor from gapping or cupping.|$|E
50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications. Liquid packages are normally heat sealed.|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} {{trials of}} stratified three-layered fine paper, of sulphate pulp, {{were performed to}} investigate if stratified fine fraction or fibres from birch can improve the properties of a paper compared to a reference sheet. All trials had five different scenarios and each scenario was calendered with different linear load. All sheets had a grammage of 80 g/m 2. In the first trial, the paper contained birch, pine and filler of calciumcarbonate (marble), and was manufactured with the pilot paper machine XPM and the stratified headbox Formator at RCF (Stora Enso Research Center in Falun). The furnish consisted of 75 % birch and 25 % pine. The second trial contained coated sheets with paper from trial one as the base paper. The coating slip contained calciumcarbonate and clay and the amount was approximately 10 - 12 g/m 2. The third trial, also with birch and pine but without filler, was performed at STFI (Skogsindustrins Tekniska Forskningsinstitut in Stockholm) with the laboratory scaled paper machine StratEx and the stratified headbox AQ-vanes. The furnish consisted of 75 % birch and 25 % pine, except for one scenario which contained of 75 % pine and 25 % birch. The last trial contained fractionated pulp of birch and pine and was performed at STFI. 50 % was fine fraction and 50 % was coarse fraction. This test does not show any clear benefits of making stratified sheets of birch and pine {{when it comes to}} properties such as bending stiffness, tensile index and surface smoothness. The retention can be improved with birch in the surface plies. It is possible that the formation can be improved with birch in the surface plies and pine in the <b>middle</b> <b>ply.</b> It is also possible that fine fraction in the surface plies and coarse fraction in the <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> can improve both surface smoothness and bending stiffness. The results in this test are shown with confidence intervals which points out the difficulties of analysing sheets manufactured with a pilot paper machine or a laboratory scaled paper machine...|$|E
40|$|Existing micromechanical {{theories}} and experimental studies {{are not able}} to explain why mechanically identical laminates fail under different loading stresses. A transverse crack in transverse plies is the source of more severs failure modes of the laminate. Starting from an interfacial crack between a fiber and its surrounding matrix somewhere inside the laminate, the crack extends normal to loading direction, kink into the matrix, connects to neighboring kinked cracks, and forms a crack through the whole thickness of the lamina forming a transverse crack. Cracks in the transverse plies appear more repeatedly in the <b>middle</b> <b>plies</b> of [02 / 902]s more than [0 / 90] 2 s. Explanation of this dictates a synergy between micromechanics and composite manufacturing process concepts. ...|$|R

30|$|In this example, {{the impact}} energy of 7.35  J was {{selected}} to simulate the damage evolution process in the cross-ply laminate since 90 ° matrix cracking was the main damage mode expected with crack induced delamination (the impact energy is too low to cause fibre breakage). Matrix cracking was initially formed in the bottom 90 ° ply with few cracks found in the <b>middle</b> 90 ° <b>plies,</b> in Fig. 7 a. As the impactor further contacted the composite laminate the surface indentation was formed with a bending crack, appearing on the top 0 ° surface ply due to concentrated compressive load, while complete cracks through {{the thickness of the}} 90 ° layers were developed accompanied by delamination at the 0 / 90 interfaces, in Fig. 7 b. As the impact event progressed, the growth rate of cracks in the middle and bottom 90 ° plies was found to decrease, while the projectile rebound occurred, in Fig. 7 c. The simulation showed that cracks started to close once the complete rebound was reached, in Fig. 7 d with extensive delamination that matched the detected result by X-ray radiography.|$|R
30|$|Comparison {{of crack}} {{formation}} in laminates of different thicknesses indicates that crack initiation at the coupon edges occur at lower strains in thicker laminates. Both crack propagation in {{the width direction}} {{and the rate of}} new crack formation is slower in the thicker laminates, {{as can be seen in}} the X-Ray images of Figs.  13 and 14 performed for [03 / 7536 / 03] and [03 / 7524 / 03] laminates. A possible reason for this phenomenon is also because the ERR associated with the cracks occurrence in the laminate become bigger as the <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> becomes thicker. This causes the cracks to form at lower stress and strain and decreases the rate of new crack formation in the thicker laminates. For laminates with different off-axis ply angle, decrease from 90 o to 45 o makes crack formation more effort demanding. For example, in Fig.  15, none of the edge cracks propagated entirely through the coupon width. Similar results were obtained for CFRP [2] laminates.|$|E
40|$|Microfibrillated celluloses (MFCs), {{produced}} by various pre-treatments of a fully bleached birch kraft pulp, were evaluated as strength enhancers in test sheets representing the <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> of paperboard. The furnish consisted of hydrogen peroxide bleached high temperature spruce chemithermomechanical pulp (HT-CTMP), MFC and a retention system containing cationic starch and an anionic silica sol. The MFC was prepared via a mechanical treatment in a colloid mill after pretreatment with Fenton's reagent, monocomponent endoglucanase or acidic hydrogen peroxide. Addition of 5 % MFC, produced with Fenton pre-treatment, resulted in improved HT-CTMP properties {{with respect to}} increased tensile index (similar to 35 %), z-directional strength (similar to 50 %), tensile stiffness index (similar to 25 %) compared to HT-CTMP test sheets prepared without MFC addition. The strength improvement was linearly correlated to {{the density of the}} tests sheet, to the surface area (BET) and to the surface charge of the enzymatic or chemically pre-treated MFCs...|$|E
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Figs. 21, 22 and 23, for all {{laminate}} layups and materials, {{the differences}} in stiffness reduction of the thin and thick laminates can be seen quite distinctively, when higher stiffness reduction is observed in the thicker laminates with the same off-axis ply orientation. At the same time, laminates with 0 o outer ply and the same thickness show a marginal effect of the <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> orientation on the normalized Young’s modulus, e.g., compare laminates with 24 mid-ply laminae and different orientations (upper curves) in Figs.  21 a-c or 8 -laminae layups in Fig.  22. In Fig.  22 a experimental data for an additional CFRP[2] laminate with layup [−[*] 15 / 7512 /−[*] 15] is also included. It can be seen that rotation of the cross-ply [0 / 9012 / 0] by 15 o leads to dramatic differences in the normalized stiffness reduction rates. Much smaller differences are predicted analytically for rotation of GFRP [03 / 9024 / 03] by - 15 o to form [−[*] 153 / 7524 /−[*] 153], as shown in Fig.  23 a, b, however, as described above, this laminate failed after just one crack has formed within the observation zone (Fig.  18).|$|E
40|$|The {{creasing}} and folding {{behavior of}} three paperboards {{have been studied}} both experimentally and numerically. Creasing and folding studies were performed on strips in both the machine direction and the cross machine direction. A finite element model that mimicked the experimental creasing and folding setup was developed, and the creasing and folding behavior could be well predicted for all three paperboards. An experimental characterization scheme consisting of three experiments was proposed, and was shown to be sufficient to predict the creasing and folding behavior. For the whole paperboard the shear strength profiles in the through thickness direction was determined with the notched shear test. Each ply was laid free by grinding, and density measurements and in-plane tension tests were performed on the bottom, <b>middle</b> and top <b>plies</b> of each paperboard. Instead of assuming uniform properties in each ply, the shear strength profiles were used to map the measured properties in the through thickness direction. Numerical simulations were performed when the ply and interface properties of the paperboards were altered to follow different shear strength profiles. This was done in order to mimic different production strategies. It was shown that the interface strengths mainly influenced the folding behavior. Whereas altered the ply properties affected the creasing force needed. QC 20130815 </p...|$|R
40|$|Three-ply FeCrAlY/Al 2 O 3 {{composites}} and FeCrAlY matrix-only {{samples were}} cyclically oxidized at 1000 C and 1100 C {{for up to}} 1000 1 -hr cycles. Fiber ends were exposed {{at the ends of}} the composite samples. Following cyclic oxidation, cracks running parallel to and perpendicular to the fibers were observed on the large surface of the composite. In addition, there was evidence of increased scale damage and spallation around the exposed fiber ends, particularly around the <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> fibers. This damage was more pronounced at the higher temperature. The exposed fiber ends showed cracking between fibers in the outer plies, occasionally with Fe and Cr-rich oxides growing out of the cracks. Large gaps developed at the fiber/matrix interface around many of the fibers, especially those in the outer plies. Oxygen penetrated many of these gaps resulting in significant oxide formation at the fiber/matrix interface far within the composite sample. Around several fibers, the matrix was also internally oxidized showing Al 2 O 3 precipitates in a radial band around the fibers. The results show that these composites have poor cyclic oxidation resistance due to the CTE mismatch and inadequate fiber/matrix bond strength at temperatures of 1000 C and above...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} to use acidic hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence}} of ferrous ions (Fenton’s reagent) as a pre-treatment when producing microfibrillar cellulose (MFC) from a fully bleached birch (Betula verucosa) kraft pulp was investigated and the properties of the produced MFC was compared to the properties of a MFC produced with enzymatic pre-treatment with a monocomponent endoglucanase (FiberCare® R). The mechanical treatment to MFC was performed in a laboratory colloid mill or in a pilot high-pressure homogeniser and the pre-treated pulps as well as the produced MFCs were chemically and morphologically characterised. Additionally, the MFCs produced in the colloid mill were evaluated as strength enhancers in test sheets representing the <b>middle</b> <b>ply</b> of paperboard. From the chemical characterisation, it was concluded that the Fenton pre-treatment caused a decrease in the degree of polymerisation (DP) and an increase in both carboxyl- and carbonyl groups. The increase in carbonyl groups could not be explained by the formation of new reducing end groups due to depolymerisation which indicates that carbonyl groups are introduced along the cellulose chain. The enzymatic pre-treatment as performed in this study caused less impact on the cellulosic material, i. e. resulted in a pulp with a higher DP and a much lower amount of carbonyl- and carboxylic groups compared with the Fenton pre-treated pulps. In the subsequent mechanical treatment in a colloid mill, the Fenton pre-treated pulps were easier to process mechanically i. e. reached a higher specific surface area and a higher surface charge at a given mechanical treatment time compared to enzymatic pre-treated pulps and pulps not subjected to any pre-treatment. These findings were confirmed when MFCs were produced by homogenisation at high pressure in multiple passes; the birch kraft pulp was either pre-treated with Fenton’s reagent or the combined mechanic and enzymatic pre-treatment methodology used at the Centre Technique du Papier (CTP, France). By size fractionation, rheological measurements and scanning electron microscopy, it was revealed that Fenton pre-treatment resulted in MFC suspension containing a significantly higher proportion of small sized material (< 0. 2 mm). When the MFCs were evaluated as strength enhancers in test sheets produced from a furnish consisting of a spruce (Picea abies) chemithermomechanical pulp, MFC and a retention system containing cationic starch and an anionic silica sol, Fenton pre-treated MFCs increased the strength properties more than the enzymatic pre-treated MFCs. Addition of 5 wt% Fenton pre-treated MFC resulted in an increase in z-directional strength of about 50 %, an increase in tensile stiffness index of about 25 % and an increase in tensile index of 35 % compared to test sheets prepared without MFC addition. The {{potential to}} use acidic hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of}} ferrous ions (Fenton’s reagent) as a pre-treatment when producing microfibrillar cellulose (MFC) from a bleached birch kraft pulp was investigated and the properties of the produced MFC was compared to the properties of a MFC produced with enzymatic pre-treatment.

30|$|Intralaminar damage {{behavior}} {{and its effects}} on the mechanical properties of several angle-ply FRP laminates were investigated. CFRP and GFRP laminates with fiber configuration of [θ_m/σ_n]s were used in this study. In order to study the damage {{behavior and}} its effects, the laminates were loaded monotonically and cyclically and cracks observations were carried out. In some angle-ply laminates, artificial cracks method were used before the laminates were monotonically loaded, so that higher crack densities could be attained. From monotonic tensile tests, it can be understood that as the middle off-axis ply becomes thicker, the Young’s modulus and maximum tensile stress of the laminates decreases. On the other hand, the differences in off-axis orientations have marginal effects on the stiffness and strength of a laminate. From the cyclic loading results, for CFRP laminates of the same thickness, changes in the off-axis angle from 90 o to 45 o, earlier cracking initiation and observed nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves were recorded. Changes in the transverse strain, which reflect the effective Poisson’s ratio of the laminate, were larger in laminates with off-axis angle 45 o than in laminates with off-axis angle 90 o. For CFRP laminates, it can be observed that first cracks mostly formed and accumulated at free edges. Crack propagation rates in the width direction were dependent on the thickness of the <b>middle</b> <b>ply.</b> In contrast to CFRP laminates, cracks in GFRP laminates formed instantaneously propagating in the width direction. Stiffness in laminates with the thicker off-axis plies reduced more. The experimental data and predictions of the variational analysis are found in good agreement for the Young’s modulus of the cracked laminate. Based on these results, we hope that in future work, we can study laminates of higher practical imprtance. The comparison of both experimental result and analytical result demonstrated the ability of the approaches to accurately predict the effect of transverse cracking on the stiffness of the laminates, independently on their layups. Systematic analysis of residual strains due to increasing crack density will be addressed in future publications.|$|E
