25|$|A {{colposcope}} is used {{to identify}} visible clues suggestive of abnormal tissue. It functions as a lighted binocular or <b>monocular</b> <b>microscope</b> to magnify {{the view of the}} cervix, vagina, and vulvar surface. Low magnification (2× to 6×) may be used to obtain a general impression of the surface architecture. 8x to 25x magnification are utilized to evaluate the vagina and cervix. High magnification together with green filter is often used to identify certain vascular patterns that may indicate the presence of more advanced pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions. Acetic acid solution and iodine solution (Lugol's or Schiller's) are applied to the surface to improve visualization of abnormal areas.|$|E

In 1921, in the University of Stockholm, he built the first surgical <b>microscope,</b> a modified <b>monocular</b> Brinell-Leitz <b>microscope.</b> At first he used it for operations in animals. In November of the same year he used it to operate on a patient with chronic otitis who had a labyrinthine fistula. Nylen's microscope was soon replaced by a binocular microscope, developed in 1922 by his colleague Gunnar Holmgren (1875-1954).|$|R
40|$|Although attractive, the {{microbial}} pathogenesis theory for atherosclerosis remains unproven. Over the last century, microbiologists have invoked fulfillment of Koch's postulates to determine pathogen causality. Certainly a multifactorial disease process such as atherosclerosis unlikely will {{be due to}} a single microbial agent, an agent when transferred to another host, will always induce atherosclerosis. Conflicting epidemiological data also do not support a single causative agent. However, as presented here, considerable in vitro, animal, and human epidemiological data support the plausibility that infectious agents can promote a proinflammatory, procoagulant and proatherogenic environment in the vessel wall. Microbial genes and molecules can catalyze these processes and foil normal cellular events. But, must intact microbes enter the vessel wall or can microbial molecules incite immune responses from afar? A new focus on pathogen-induced auto-immunity toward vasculature has been presented. For example, microbes contain molecules that mimic host cellular components (55). An immune response to a pathogen may cross react with vessel wall cellular structures. This immune response enhanced by infection may lead to high levels of cross reacting auto-antibodies or auto-aggressive T-cells. Epstein has championed the concept of pathogen burden in support of this auto-immune theory (56). Individuals infected with multiple pathogens such as HSV- 1, HSV- 2, CMV, Helicobacter pylori, and Hepatitis A, have high C-reative protein levels (markers of inflammation) and the greatest relative risk for coronary artery disease (57). Thus, pathogens might contribute to the atherosclerotic process by promoting inflammatory responses. It is this author's view that microbes and inflammation do {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (58). Infection may contribute to the process promoting vessel wall injury initiated by oxidized lipids, smoking derived oxidants, hypertensive shear or diabetes glyoxidized molecules. Inflammation and immune reactions in response to infection can exacerbate and act synergistically with all of the aforementioned vasculotoxic moieties. Continued investigations in the 21 st century will determine if vaccines, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents or immunosuppressants will alter the picture the early 19 th century pathologists observed under their <b>monocular</b> <b>microscopes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Malaria {{microscopy}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{is often}} restricted by access to light microscopes. To address this gap, a novel portable inverted <b>monocular</b> <b>microscope,</b> the Newton Nm 1, {{was designed and}} is now commercially available. Its diagnostic performance was assessed in a blinded-slide trial at × 1000 (oil) of Giemsa-stained thick blood films against a conventional microscope as undertaken by four Ugandan Ministry of Health technicians. With the Newton Nm 1, diagnostic performance was: sensitivity 93 · 5 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 78 · 6 – 99 · 2 %), specificity 100 · 0 % (95 % CI 82 · 4 – 100 · 0 %), positive predictive value 100 · 0 % (95 % CI 88 · 1 – 100 · 0 %) and negative predictive value 90 · 5 % (95 % CI 69 · 6 – 98 · 8 %). Discordance was due to a systematic error underestimating parasitaemia by ∼ 45 %; when counting Plasmodium parasites against 200 white blood cells, blood films with low parasitaemia (i. e. < 100 μL− 1 of blood) could be overlooked and misclassified. By contrast, specificity was excellent with no false positives encountered. Whilst proven useful, especially in resource-poor environments, it is still unclear how we can ensure the uptake of the Newton Nm 1 within sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|In microtomy, faults of {{the cutting}} edge are an obvious and avoidable source of artifact. The purpose of this {{communication}} is to describe a simple apparatus for viewing and marking {{the cutting edge}} of the glass knives which are used in seetioning for electron microscopy (1, 2). The apparatus consists of a <b>monocular</b> <b>microscope</b> with base, arm, body tube, coarse and fine adjustments, an annular incident light objective lens, and a mechanical stage that has been modified to hold a glass knife. The apparatus is illustrated in Text-fig. 1. The advantage of the annular incident light illumination is that rough surfaces reflect light into the objective and appear bright; an effect opposite to that obtained when strictly vertical illumination is used. A facet without faults appears as a narrow, white line in a dark field, while a faulty or dirty edge is a speckled, widened, or fissured white line. Three different knives are shown in Figs. 1 to 3. We have found a 50 × objective lens combined with a 15 × eyepiece satisfactory for discriminating between cutting edges. The glass knife is mounted vertically between a rigid pillar and thumb screw allowing adjustment of the angle of viewing. This vertical mounting together with the length of the objective lens make it necessary to increase the usual working distance between the objective lens and the mechanical stage. To that end a block was placed in the arm of the microscope above the mechanical stage. * This investigation was supported by Researc...|$|E
