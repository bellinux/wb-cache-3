Additionally it is shown the reactive power provision from the onshore wind farms. The closest one to the <b>main</b> <b>busbar</b> is providing reactive power for attempting to fulfill the grid operator requirement of Q[*]=[*] 0 {{at the point of}} common coupling (interconnection with the external grid). Furthermore, the remaining wind farms within the distribution grid are set to control the voltage via providing or absorbing reactive power in the so called cosφ(P) control for decentralized energy resources.|$|E
40|$|All {{electric}} ship alternators {{are connected}} to a <b>main</b> <b>busbar</b> which feeds all shipboard electric loads. To fulfill power quality requirements of the resulting electrical system, high-performance control of busbar voltage and frequency is needed. Such a task is not of easy accomplishment, due {{to the complexity of}} shipboard power station (generators are many and differ by sizes, prime movers, control systems, etc.) and to the intrinsic weakness of the shipboard grid. In this frame, a key power quality issue is voltage control. This paper presents an innovative shipboard voltage and VAR integrated regulator (WIRE). The WIRE controls <b>main</b> <b>busbar</b> voltage and jointly optimizes the reactive power generated by each alternator. It is designed to be interfaced with onboard automation and to realize the integrated management of all reactive power sources (rotating, capacitive, static). Furthermore it satisfies naval requirements as redundancy and fast commissioning...|$|E
40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is {{equipped}} with 1232 main superconducting dipole magnets, 474 superconducting quadrupole magnets and more than 7400 superconducting corrector magnets that are distributed around the eight sectors of the accelerator. Each of the magnets is powered via superconducting power cables, the so-called <b>main</b> <b>busbars</b> for the <b>main</b> magnets and auxiliary busbars for the corrector magnets. Within the main magnets, the field produced by the superconducting busbars is shielded by the magnet's iron yoke. However, in the numerous magnet interconnections, the busbars are magnetically unshielded {{with respect to the}} beam pipes and produce parasitic fields that can affect the beam. Extensive analyses have been carried out in the past to assess the field quality of the individual magnets and its influence on the two counter-rotating beams. However, no detailed evaluation of the influence of the parasitic fields of the <b>main</b> and auxiliary <b>busbars</b> and their effect on beam optics had been performed so far. In this report, the integrated field perturbation resulting from parasitic fields is calculated and effects on some beam dynamics parameters are estimated...|$|R

Among TIA-607-B’s list of metallic components {{in need of}} bonding are racks, enclosures, ladders, surge protectors, cable trays, routers, switches and patch panels.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of All Electric Ship (AES) design, {{increasing}} importance is assigned to simulation tools. Shipyards adopt simulation tools to solve design problems and achieve improved efficiency and relevant cost savings in the electrical systems. The calculation of harmonic pollution {{is one of these}} design problems. The paper proposes a simplified approach for modeling the very sophisticated MV plant of an all-electric cruise-liner. Having assumed reasoned simplifying hypotheses, the MV plant has been simulated using EMTDC-PSCAD, software commonly used for the simulation of earth power systems. The main outcome is the high accordance of the results of a simulated measurement of Total Harmonic Distortion of Voltage (THDv) on the vessel <b>main</b> MV <b>busbar,</b> with the experimental data taken from real measurements carried out on board. This validates the proposed approach for this kind of design problem...|$|R
40|$|Power {{quality is}} a key issue in island, {{shipboard}} integrated electric power systems (IEPS). However, it is not of easy accomplishment, due {{to the complexity of}} shipboard power station (generators are many and differ by sizes, prime movers, control systems, etc.) and to the intrinsic weakness of the shipboard grid. This paper presents a new approach for controlling voltage and reactive power generated in the power station of an all electric ship (AES). A shipboard voltage and VAr integrated regulator (WIRE) is proposed. The WIRE is aimed at controlling alternators voltage, <b>main</b> <b>busbar</b> voltage and jointly optimizing the reactive power generated by each alternator. WIRE project reunions into an integrated device the most advanced control functions presently implemented in smartest land power stations. WIRE is also endowed with an embedded power-station/IEPS real-time simulator, suitable for performing factory functional, diagnostic and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. The paper will show how WIRE can improve power quality into an AES, while respecting marine constraints like: reduced room availability, redundancy, reliability, optimal and safe utilization of generators, fast commissioning, diagnostics...|$|E
40|$|Power Quality (PQ) {{disturbances}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important concerns of the network operators and customers during the delivery of power. Voltage dip {{is one of the}} PQ disturbances which is caused by different factors but mainly by the unpredictable faults occurring at different parts of the electrical network. Dips originating at some parts of the network may propagate {{to other parts of the}} network causing huge financial losses to industrial and commercial customers. Knowing the maximal fault impedance beyond which dips are not detected by the monitoring equipment is very helpful for the grid operator. This paper mainly focuses on the influence of critical impedance or distance, which is measured from a point of common coupling (PCC) at the <b>main</b> <b>busbar</b> next to the HV/MV transformer to the fault point, to the monitoring of dips. A typical Dutch MV network is analyzed and mathematical models are developed with different fault types. Taking the different grounding techniques into account, simulations are performed using MATLAB. For industrial customers connected to the same PCC, the critical distances corresponding to each fault types are evaluated and compared. Based on computer simulations, the dips missed by the monitoring device placed at the most appropriate location are thoroughly discussed. The influence of different system groundings on the phase and line voltage dips are also explained in this paper. Moreover, the transfer of dips from MV to LV network and the impact of the critical distance with each fault to the transfer of dips are briefly explaine...|$|E
40|$|Major {{part of this}} master thesis {{deals with}} impact of plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) on the power system. First {{a brief review of}} the technical challenges in the power system due to mass introduction of the PHEVs in the transmission sector is given. Then the Master thesis shows on an analysis of the overloading effects of PHEVs on the distribution system with normal charging and quick charging of PHEVs for an IEEE 13 -node distribution test system using power flow analysis. The results of the study on the IEEE 13 -node distribution test system show that introduction of PHEVs in the transportation sector will lead to overloading of distribution system and cause voltage problems at the end-users. Then the impact of PHEVs is tested on a real distribution network in Gothenburg. Two areas have been selected one commercial and one residential area. In the 400 V network, there is a few numbers of overloaded line due to PHEVs charging while the under voltage effect on the end users is negligible providing that voltage of <b>main</b> <b>busbar</b> set higher than 1 pu which is the real case. In the real sample 10 kV network in the Gothenburg, where, there are number of 10 to 0. 4 kV substations that are supplying vehicles with required charging power besides their regular daily load, over loading of line is observed at peak load. Then maximum possible vehicles that can be charged without any violations in a reliable manner is calculated both for residential and commercial areas. The Master thesis also analyzes the effects of PHEVs in the transmission system, using one test transmission network (10 -Bus transmission system) and the Nordic 32 -bus test system. The study results show that the overloading problem is not prominent. Introduction specific penetration of vehicles leads to under voltage in the 10 -Bus transmission test system, while one interesting and important result happens in the Nordic 32 -bus test system and that is PHEVs may lead to over voltages in some buses in the transmission system which requires the voltage control measures. PHEVs would also lead to increased number of network violations in the contingency analysis. The Master thesis also analyzes maximization of the DGs penetration in the existing distribution networks. First a brief review of voltage rise effect in the networks equipped with DGs is given. Then this effect is simulated on the modified IEEE 13 -Nodes test system and finally one nonlinear programming with GAMS is presented to maximize DGs penetration in the lightly load distribution network with Power curtailment as a solution to mitigate over voltage...|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{inconsistent}} {{nature of}} the wave impedance for various power apparatuses and the reflection and refraction characteristics of their interconnection points, the fault transients contain abundant information about the fault location and type. By correct analysis and the full utilization of such information {{it is possible to}} construct ultra high speed and highly sensitive AC, DC and <b>busbar</b> <b>main</b> protection. In addition faulty line selection for neutral non-effective earth systems using transient characteristics offers high sensitivity and reliability that is not influenced by the ways of neutral compensation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of a wind farm connected to a 38 kV system at a weak point on the network. It examines reactive power control to resolve the voltage rise issue with increasing generation from the wind farm. The paper considers reactive power control using three methods and compares each method in terms of power losses on the system. The 3 methods are reactive power control from the wind turbine directly, a STATCOM connected to the <b>main</b> 20 kV <b>busbar</b> and a STATCOM connected to the 38 kV busbar. The three solutions are modelled and the power loss impacts are investigated and compared. The objective {{of this study is to}} establish which solution is the most optimum to minimise power losses at the wind farm. Finally an economic analysis is carried out to see the impact on each of the reactive power control method on the overall revenues generated from the wind farm over a 25 year period...|$|R
30|$|The {{current of}} TCC loop or OCS-R loop is {{inversely}} proportional to the loop impedance. From the above analysis about the wave impedance, it can be inferred that the TCC loop impedance will be {{much smaller than the}} OCS-R loop impedance and the current in TCC will be larger. Moreover, if OCS-R loop is imputed to TCC loop side, the imputed impedance modulus value of OCS-R loop will be the square of its turn ratio. For example, when the TT primary voltage is 35  kV, its turn ratio would be no less than 10 if the chosen OCS voltage does not exceed 3.5  kV, and the impedance modulus value of TCC loop will be less than 1  % of the impedance modulus value of OCS-R loop imputed to TCC loop side. The OCS-R loop between two nearest TTs can be called short loop (the i-th segment in Fig.  2). And the parallel connection of the TCC loop and the OCS-R loop from the short loop to the <b>main</b> traction <b>busbar</b> can be called long loop (from the 1 st to the (i −  1)th segments in Fig.  2). If so, the short loop will take the train load while the OCS on the long loop will hardly bear any burden for power supply (less than 1  %). The TCC on the long loop will bear almost all power supply burden (larger than 99  %). That is, the OCS on the short loop is mainly responsible for the power supply of the train in the current segment, and the TCC on the long loop is responsible for the power supply of the entire traction network.|$|R
