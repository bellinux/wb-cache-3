5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E

Does it <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say that something is mentally 70% Frederick? A possible solution to this dilemma is that of open individualism.|$|E
25|$|A theodicy, on {{the other}} hand, is a more ambitious attempt to provide a {{plausible}} justification {{for the existence of}} evil. A theodicy attempts to answer the evidential problem of evil. Richard Swinburne maintains that it does not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> assume there are greater goods, unless we know what they are, i.e., we have a successful theodicy.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other. This means that one experiences {{the presence of}} God through one’s relation to other people. To know God is to know what must be done, so it does not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of God as what God is, but rather what God commands.|$|E

25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and the Master both try {{to appeal}} to Azal but for {{opposite}} reasons. The huge, devil-like figure decides to give his power to the Master, and fires electricity at the Doctor to kill him. However, Jo, steps {{in front of the}} Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. This act of self-sacrifice does not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> Azal, and sends him into a confused rage. The Doctor tells everyone to flee the Church. With Bok also rendered motionless, Azal erupts and the whole Church is blown up. The Master tries to escape but is captured by the UNIT troops and taken away. The Doctor, Jo, Miss Hawthorne and the UNIT team join the villagers in their May Day celebrations.|$|E
25|$|GGYC {{also argued}} that the rules that should apply to the race must be the SNG rules that were in force when GGYC filed its challenge. Otherwise, said GGYC, SNG could {{arbitrarily}} change the rules {{so as to make}} it impossible for the challenger to win. For example, said GGYC, the modified rules could specify that the challenger would have to race while dragging an anchor. According to GGYC, it did not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> envisage that the rules could be changed after the challenge was issued, since the challenger based its challenge on SNG's rules {{at the time of the}} challenge. GGYC also challenged certain provisions of the agreement between ISAF and SNG, in particular concerning the powers of the jury.|$|E

25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E
25|$|Progressive Jargon Aphasia is a fluent or {{receptive}} aphasia {{in which the}} patient's speech is incomprehensible, but appears to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact syntax and grammar, but the patient has problems with the selection of nouns. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with sounds. As such, patients with jargon aphasia often use neologisms, and may perseverate {{if they try to}} replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, {{but it will not}} <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.|$|E

Too Pure's co-owner Richard Roberts stated that upon hearing Seefeel's demo [...] "there was no obvious song for radio, {{but in my}} opinion it felt good. As we viewed ourselves as an experimental label that didn't want to be tied to a sound or a scene, it seemed to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> release something with the band."

500|$|The {{completion}} {{date for the}} project, dubbed [...] "the largest public works project ever done {{in the town of}} Irondequoit" [...] by then-Town Supervisor Mary Ellen Heyman, was pushed back several times. It was originally set for May 2010, but was subsequently pushed back to late August or early September. It was finally completed in October 2010 with the installation of a decorative ship mast structure at the Durand Boulevard roundabout. Following the project's completion, NY590 was truncated to Titus Avenue and ownership and maintenance of Sea Breeze Drive was transferred to the town of Irondequoit. According to New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) official Rick Papaj, the state turned Sea Breeze Drive over to the town because the portion of NY590 north of Titus Avenue had low traffic volumes and was situated in a residential area. Papaj added, [...] " [...] didn't <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> (<b>to</b> us) anymore. 590 effectively ends at Route104." ...|$|E
