40|$|Abstract. Trading {{surveillance}} systems {{screen and}} detect anomalous trades of equity, bonds, <b>mortgage</b> <b>certificates</b> among others. This is to satisfy federal trading regulations {{as well as}} to prevent crimes, such as insider trading and money laundry. Most existing trading surveillance systems are based on hand-coded expert-rules. Such systems are known to result in long developing process and extremely high “false positive” rates. We participate in co-developing a data mining based automatic trading surveillance system for one of the biggest banks in the US. The challenge of this task is to handle very skewed positive classes (< 0. 01 %) as well as very large volume of data (millions of records and hundreds of features). The combination of very skewed distribution and huge data volume poses new challenge for data mining; previous work addresses these issues separately, and existing solutions are rather complicated and not very straightforward to implement. In this paper, we propose a simple systematic approach to mine “very skewed distribution in very large volume of data”. ...|$|R

Modern land markets involve a complex and dynamic range of activities, processes and opportunities and are impacted upon by a whole new range of restrictions and responsibilities now being imposed on land. They are continually evolving, primarily in response to economic energy and sustainable development objectives. They are also being driven by information and communications technologies. While modern land markets offer almost unlimited opportunities for cadastral systems to expand their relevance and usefulness, one commodity in particular - land information - has the ability of transforming the way both governments and the private sector in modern economies do business. The e-land administration concept as part of e-government initiatives is now being replaced by iLand – a new vision for spatially enabled land information. While the original purpose of cadastres was essential and useful in facilitating simple land trading to support expanding economies, and modern land markets with their complex commodities offer potential opportunities to take another leap forward, it is the land information derived from the cadastre that has the potential to transform the way modern societies function. It has the potential of transforming how tax is collected, how health services are delivered, how the environment and our cities are managed, how we respond to emergencies and terrorism, how wars are fought and how elections are run. Linked to such transformational technologies such as Google Earth and Microsoft's Virtual Earth, cadastral information has the potential for spatially enabling government (and society). 17 - 22 OctoberOpen Acces...|$|R
