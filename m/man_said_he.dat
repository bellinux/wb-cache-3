25|$|In 2009 in Sabaki Village, Malindi District, Kenya, a male {{farm manager}} was {{reportedly}} attacked after stepping on a 13-ft python, the exact species {{of which was}} not determined. After an hour's struggle, he was reportedly dragged up a tree, but then rescued by police and villagers after {{he was able to}} call for help on his mobile phone. The snake was reportedly captured by police, but had escaped and disappeared by the next day. The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> bit the snake's tail while he was being attacked and was injured on his lower lip because the tip of the tail was sharp.|$|E
25|$|The police {{initially}} {{identified the}} 18-year-old brother-in-law of Chérif Kouachi, a French Muslim student of North African descent and unknown nationality, {{as a third}} suspect in the shooting, accused of driving the getaway car. He was {{believed to have been}} living in Charleville-Mézières, about 200km northeast of Paris near the border with Belgium. He turned himself in at a Charleville-Mézières police station early in the morning on 8 January 2015. The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was in class {{at the time of the}} shooting, and that he rarely saw Chérif Kouachi. Many of his classmates said that he was at school in Charleville-Mézières during the attack. After holding him for about 50 hours, police said that he was not being charged at that time.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2007, The Vachons {{were back in the}} US. At a February 17 show for Grapple Masters Wrestling in Bristol, Vermont, The Vachons were supposed to appear for the show's opening promo. When the team was introduced, however, their rivals The Hellraisers come out instead. The Hellraisers began picking on a fan in the crowd, Albert, but then invited him to join them in the ring. They continued talking to Albert until the young <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was a fan of The Vachons causing The Hellraisers to attack him. The Vachons then ran to the ring to chase off The Hellraisers setting up two singles matches between the four wrestlers later that night. The match series ended in a tie with Hellraiser Misery defeating Damien Vachon in a Tables match and Pierre Vachon winning a Thumbtacks match against Hellraiser Pain. Both teams were scheduled to meet in a Dog Collar match for the GMW Tag Team Championship on March 10.|$|E
60|$|The <b>men</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> lived {{round the}} corner of Forecastle-square, {{opposite}} the Liberty Pole; because his cook-house was right behind the foremast, and very near the quarters occupied by themselves.|$|R
50|$|Sica Hollow once {{protected}} many peaceful Indian camps. Its trees {{blocked the}} North Wind. But, a stranger named Hand came. He scared the females of the tribe. The old <b>men</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would leave come spring.|$|R
6000|$|King Romance {{was wounded}} deep, All his knights were dead and gone, All his court was fallen on sleep, In a vale of Avalon! Nay, <b>men</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> will not come, Any night or any morn. Nay, his puissant voice is dumb, Silent his enchanted horn! ...|$|R
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E
500|$|Beginning at 12:58a.m. {{local time}} (19:58 UTC), Abbottabad {{resident}} Sohaib Athar sent {{a series of}} tweets starting with [...] "Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event)." [...] By 1:44a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39a.m. Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as American special forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, [...] "I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto {{to turn off the}} lights and stay inside." [...] Another <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed. The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field. A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army. [...] "There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured", he said. [...] "There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound." [...] Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service, went out {{around the time of the}} raid and apparently included the military academy. Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout. One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack, several passers-by stood over Rigby's body {{to protect him}} from further injury. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, a cub scout leader from Cornwall, disembarked from a passing bus with the {{intention}} of rendering first aid, after she saw what she thought was a road accident. On discovering that the victim was dead she engaged one of the assailants in conversation. The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was responsible for killing the man on the ground – a British soldier who the attacker claimed had [...] "killed Muslims in Iraq and in Afghanistan".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because he was drill-Naik and the {{recruits}} {{were to be}} drilled. I myself told him so,' said the Subadar-Major. 'He was a well-conducted <b>man.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could wait.' ...|$|R

60|$|Naturally, another gentleman present {{told about}} another drunken <b>man.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> reeled toward home late at night; {{made a mistake}} and entered the wrong gate; thought he saw a dog on the stoop; and it was--an iron one.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, {{a lawyer}} named Robert Tarbox (who, in August 1975, was disbarred by the California Supreme Court {{for failure to}} pay some clients) {{said that in the}} early 1970s a {{merchant}} mariner walked into his office and confessed to him that he was the Zodiac Killer. The seemingly lucid seaman (whose name Tarbox would not reveal due to confidentiality) described his crimes briefly but persuasively enough to convince Tarbox. The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was trying to stop himself from his [...] "opportunistic" [...] murder spree but never returned to see Tarbox again. Tarbox took out a full-page ad in the Vallejo Times-Herald that he claimed would clear the name of Arthur Leigh Allen as a killer, his only reason for revealing the story thirty years after the fact. Robert Graysmith, {{the author of several books}} on Zodiac, said Tarbox's story was [...] "entirely plausible".|$|E
2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> did not know if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be well for me. I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
60|$|The merciless <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{thought it}} was the {{situation}} of the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; the <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> was to {{take them}} to Harker's Hotel. It's a second-rate hotel not far from the railway station." ...|$|R
60|$|In a whining {{voice the}} <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> could not eat without {{vomiting}} {{and that he}} had pains here and pains there.|$|R
5000|$|According to Historia Augusta, [...] "he was of such size, so Cordus reports, that <b>men</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{was eight}} foot, six inches (c. 2.5 metres) in height". It {{is very likely}} however {{that this is one}} of the many 'tall tales' in the Historia Augusta, and is {{immediately}} suspect due to its citation of [...] "Cordus", one of the several fictitious authorities the work cites.|$|R
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would, {{and just}} then the gong went and they trooped down, leaving me alone on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't know,' says he, 'but I expect they're some o' {{the other}} {{boarders}}. The <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had other boarders when I {{spoke to him}} about takin' us.' ...|$|E
60|$|In the old Yukon days it {{had been}} different. Bonds didn't go. A <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had so much, and even in a poker game his {{appeasement}} was accepted.|$|E
5000|$|The carnage of {{that battle}} was so horrific (over 20,000 men had {{died at the}} end of the day) that farmers are said to still dig up skulls from the fields today, as {{described}} in the poem After Blenheim, written by Robert Southey, which tells about children finding the skull of one of the [...] "... many thousand <b>men,</b> <b>said</b> <b>he,</b> Were slain in that great victory." ...|$|R

500|$|Manning is a Christian. At age 13, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I {{committed}} {{my life to}} Christ, {{and that}} faith has been most important to me ever since."

[...] <b>Manning</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> prays every night and before games and added, [...] "I hope (and pray) I don't do too many things that displease Him before I get to Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." ...|$|R
60|$|The unseen <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was; and {{in another}} minute Leland, who rode on, swung himself down at the {{homestead}} door. Gallwey, who had apparently heard him coming, ran out.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he rose with some {{difficulty}} and bade them adieu. Arthur went {{with him to the}} desk and proffered his assistance, but the young <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> needed nothing but rest.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harmer {{walked away}} leaving the old sailor with the solicitor, who had, from the instant when the <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{had been present}} at the accident, {{regarded}} him with the most lively interest.|$|E
60|$|Pony <b>said</b> <b>he</b> didn't {{know whether}} {{he would like to}} be quite so big; and then the circus <b>man</b> <b>said</b> perhaps <b>he</b> would rather go for an India-rubber man; that was what they called the contortionists in those days.|$|R
50|$|In the {{engagement}} with the two Turkish ships, Aubrey first boarded the Kitabi, which surrendered, then jumped across to the nearby Torgud. One of his <b>men</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> had boarded like Nelson, referring to Horatio Nelson {{at the battle of}} St. Vincent, who took two Spanish ships, jumping from the San Nicolas to the San Josef. Jack Aubrey's model in his naval career has always been Lord Nelson.|$|R

60|$|Harry (With force). Look here, they fairly {{drove me}} out. Poor mother nagged {{at me for}} being idle, and the old <b>man</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would cut my soul out of my body rather than {{let me go to}} sea.|$|E
