40|$|This report {{describes}} the diagnostic, <b>morbid,</b> <b>anatomical</b> and histopathological features of pyelocalyceal cysts with hydrotic nephritis of the kidney in a 3 -year-old boy, and discusses the pathogenesis. Calyceal cysts {{gave rise to}} a ‘large blue cystic lobulated kidney’ with microscopic changes in nephrons identifiable as ‘hydrotic nephritic glomerulosclerosis’. Pelvic and calyceal cysts were identifiable by location, number, arrangement, and <b>morbid</b> <b>anatomical</b> and microscopic features of their lining walls. Such cysts may develop due to partial or complete obliterate adhesions at the uretero-pelvic and pyelocalyceal junctions. Patent calyceo-tubulonephric junctions in such cases may give rise to hydrotic nephritis. Pyelocalyceal cystic disease with hydrotic nephritis of the kidney needs to be distinguished from megacalycosis and hydronephrosis and deserves recognition. Observations in this case may provide the basis for future classifications of cystic renal diseases...|$|R

40|$|Purposes: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} anatomical changes (hard druses, soft druses, hyperpigmentation, new vessels, detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, hypopigmentation and chorioretinal atrophy) and light sensitivity in patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD); analyze macular sensitivity in areas with no <b>anatomical</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with ARMD and compared them to the control group in order to detect {{if there was any}} functional lesion in areas with no anatomical changes. Methods: A cross-sectional, comparative, descriptive and analytic, study was performed. The case group consisted of 31 subjects with ARMD aged-between 51 and 88 years. The control group consisted of 31 "healthy" subjects, without ARMD aged between 61 and 80 years. The groups were matched for gender and age. We performed static macular perimetry, red-red, using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Results of macular perimetry were correlated with the anatomic lesion identified in the same site by infrared laser and color photographs. Results: Areas with new vessels or atrophy showed a significantly different sensitivity in relation to areas without <b>anatomical</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with ARMD. There was significant functional loss in areas with no <b>anatomical</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with ARMD in relation to the control group. Conclusions: Areas with new vessels or atrophy could be distinct factors for worsening of the localized macular sensitivity. There might be functional loss even-in areas with no apparent anatomical changes in ARMD patients...|$|R

From a <b>morbid</b> <b>anatomical</b> study, they concluded that osteitis fibrosa was the outstanding pathological change in the bones, and attributed this to *osteoclastic activity caused by excessive parathyroid function.

40|$|The <b>morbid</b> <b>anatomical</b> {{factors in}} the {{production}} of right heart hypertrophy and failure in emphysema have been reviewed with reference to 44 cases studied by standard histological methods and by post-mortem pulmonary arteriography. The most important factors in raising the pulmonary vascular resistance in these cases are considered to be vascular deformity and pressure by the emphysematous spaces on the adjacent branches of the pulmonary artery. Precapillary bronchopulmonary arterial anastomoses may be of importance in those cases where areas of localized bronchiectasis are present. Intimal fibrosis of the pulmonary arterioles, destruction of the pulmonary vascular bed, and thromboembolic phenomena were thought to be of only minor importance {{in the production of}} cor pulmonale in emphysema...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjective:To {{assess the}} {{evolution}} and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in the finger joints using anatomical changes on standard radiographs. Methods:Data obtained from 85 patients {{enrolled in a}} prospective study were used to evaluate systems to score the morbidity and the progression of the disease over 3 years. Posteroanterior (PA) radiographs of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints were obtained at entry and after 3 years. Assessment of the progression of OA over time is based on: (1) the increase in incidence of OA in previously normal joints during the study period, (2) {{the changes in the}} OA-associated features (osteophyte growth, loss of joint space, subchondral cysts or sclerosis) in the pathological finger joints (<b>anatomical</b> <b>lesion</b> progression score system), and (3) the recognition of consecutive anatomical phases in the course of ‘erosive’ OA (anatomical phase progression score system). Results:Almost 80 % of the distal IP and 50 % of the proximal IP were affected at study entry. In approximately 40 % of the patients, the classical picture of OA of the IP joints was complicated by manifest erosive changes, which were followed by a repair phenomenon in the 'eroded' finger joints. MCP were less affected and showed the non-erosive picture of OA. Numbers of affected DIP, PIP and MCP joints per patient at entry did not differ from those after 3 years of follow-up. Two systems to score the progression of OA (<b>anatomical</b> <b>lesion</b> and <b>anatomical</b> phase progression score system) showed definite progression within 3 years of follow-up, especially in the IP joints. Since changes in both non-erosive and erosive joints were recorded by the <b>anatomical</b> <b>lesion</b> progression system, it was found much more sensitive to change than the anatomical phase progression system which principally recorded the progression through the destructive phases of erosive OA. The results of both progression score systems correlated well. Conclusion:Conventional radiographs can be used to assess the morbidity and progression of hand OA. The existence of non-erosive and erosive forms of OA of the finger joints necessitates the use of two scoring systems: the <b>anatomical</b> <b>lesion</b> progression score system and the anatomical phase progression score system...|$|R

It is by studying these lesions at necropsy that information will be gained concerning some of the lesions probably present in patients surviving with a neurological deficit but it must be remembered that the severity and frequency of the lesions in cases coming to necropsy will not necessarily be the same as in these surviving though the nature of the lesions will probably be very similar...|$|R
