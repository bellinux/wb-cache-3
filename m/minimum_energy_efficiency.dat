Although the energy in the wastewater has been successfully utilized to condition buildings in other countries, it is barely utilized in the United States, until recently. In 2013, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science at Denver, the United States implemented a unique heat pump system that utilizes recycled wastewater from a municipal water system to cool and heat its 13, 000 m 2 new addition. This recycled water heat pump (RWHP) system uses seven 105 kW (cooling capacity) modular water-to-water heat pumps (WWHPs). Each WWHP uses R- 410 A refrigerant, has two compressors, and can independently provide either 52 Â°C hot water (HW) or 7 Â°C chilled water (CHW) to the building. This paper presents performance characterization results of this RWHP system {{based on the measured}} data from December 2014 through August 2015.
