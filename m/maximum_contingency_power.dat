The loss of one pole of the dc system would therefore require an increase of 50 percent in the transmitted power on the remaining pole for a period of time up to 4 hours.

Second, the paper develops a theoretical model to integrate individual- and group-level creativity particularly for service organizations. Design/methodology/approachThis paper provides a comprehensive, albeit non-inclusive, review of research on creativity and innovation in organizations. The review reveals that hospitality research on creativity and innovation has not matched the new advances in management research, particularly the multilevel nature of creativity and the outcomes of creativity. Thus, to advance research in hospitality, this paper proposes a multilevel model of creativity based on a strategic <b>contingency</b> <b>power</b> theory. This model examines how individual- and group-level uncertainties hinder creativity. Moreover, the model also considers several uncertainty coping strategies and examines individual- and group-level outcomes of creativity. FindingsThe proposed theoretical model integrates individual- and group-level uncertainty determinants of creativity and yields a multilevel approach to creativity. Several testable hypotheses are proposed. Research limitations/implicationsThis paper highlights the strategic <b>contingency</b> <b>power</b> approach between individual- and group-level uncertainties in creativity. Uncertainty coping practices that alleviate the negative effects of uncertainties on creativity will be useful to managers and service organizations.

In this paper, a counterpropagation neural network (CPNN) is proposed to solve power flow problem under different loading/contingency conditions for computing bus voltage magnitudes and angles of the power system. The counterpropagation network uses a different mapping strategy namely counterpropagation and provides a practical approach for implementing a pattern mapping task, since learning is fast in this network. The composition of the input variables for the proposed neural network has been selected to emulate the solution process of a conventional power flow program.

Instability problem in power systems have {{become one of the}} most important concerns in the power industry which lead to blackouts. Power disruption and individual power outage one of the major problem affect the economy of the country. If the exchanges were not controlled, some lines located on particular paths may become overloaded or congested. Plus, uncontrollable reactive power losses results to instability to maintain the voltage at all the buses around the nominal value lead to voltage collapse. It is important to have high efficiency, maximum reliability, and security in design and operation of power system. Recent development of power electronics introduces the use of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) controllers in power systems. FACTS controllers are capable of controlling the network condition in a very fast manner and this feature of FACTS can be exploited to improve the stability of a power system. The aim of this project is to study the effect of Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) to mitigate contingencies in transmission line by locating TCSC at the most sensitive line thru reactive power loss sensitivity indices approach.

30|$|Voltage {{collapse}} usually {{occurs in}} heavy load power systems. A heavy load power system {{subject to a}} failure or disturbance undergoes voltage collapse if post-disturbance equilibrium voltages are below acceptable limits. The voltage collapse is generally initiated by either load variations or contingencies and is characterized by high reactive power demand and high reactive power loss in transmission network and shortage of fast-acting reactive reserves [1]. The fast reactive sources are generators, synchronous condensers, and power electronics-based flexible dynamic voltage restorer. Adequate reactive power reserve is expected to maintain system integrity during post contingency operation when considering random failures. As a well-established ancillary service, the reactive power support and the voltage control {{play a vital role}} in power system operation. The impact of reactive power on system stability and security has been well investigated [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. During a <b>contingency,</b> the real <b>power</b> component of line loading does not change significantly, whereas the reactive power flow can change dramatically [2]. The reason is that the bus voltage drop due to a component failure reduces the reactive power generation from the charging of line and shunt capacitors. Therefore, sufficient reactive reserve should be available to meet the reactive power requirement following a <b>contingency.</b> Reactive <b>power</b> which can be delivered in a power system depends on its network configuration, operating condition, and locations of reactive power sources.
