40|$|Background: Breast milk is {{important}} for the overall well-being of infants. Al-though lactation is relatively robust in the face of poor nutrition, the implication of poor nutrition on non-nutritive factors in breast milk is inconclusive. Objective: This study was designed to find associations between nutritional and immune factors in maternal blood and breast milk with the aim to improve the needed public and indi-vidual strategies for a healthy infant. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted on 61 lactating Nigerian women aged 23 - 40 years within the first 3 months postpar-tum. Anthropometric measurements were obtained while nutritional factors (total protein, albumin) and immunoglobulin classes (IgG, A and M) were estimated by Biuret, Bromocresol green and single radial immunodiffusion methods respectively in maternal plasma and breast milk. Results: Most (73. 5 %) of the lactating mothers had normal mean body mass index (i. e. not under weight nor obese) and the mean levels of plasma total protein, albumin, IgG, IgA and IgM were within normal refer-ence ranges in these mothers. Nutritional and immunological indices increase in the plasma with length of lactation but decrease in breast milk with lactation. There were no correlation between BMI, plasma <b>indices</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>indices</b> in these lactating mothers.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the relations between DGVs and several milk traits important for both the nutritional value and processability of milk. This is a new approach and can be used to increase the knowledge on how genomic selection can be used in practice. Morning milk samples from Swedish Holstein cows were analyzed for milk composition and technological properties. DGVs were received for each cow for milk, protein and fat yield, <b>milk</b> <b>index,</b> udder health, Nordic total merit and a quota was calculated between fat and milk yield as well as protein and milk yield. The results show that linear correlations exist (P< 0 · 10) between the studied DGVs and contents and yields of parameters in the protein (P= 0 · 002 - 0 · 097), fat (P= 0 · 024 - 0 · 055) and mineral profiles (P= 0 · 001 - 0 · 099) as well as for cheese characteristics (P= 0 · 004 - 0 · 065), thus making it possible to obtain detailed information on milk traits that are not registered in the milk recording scheme.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} profitability of milk production over several years in a herd of about 100 cows, taking into account changes in the housig system from the tethering to free stall in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative. The study considered costs and income obtained from milk production and assessed profitability of this direction of agricultural activity. The profit being an equivalent of net income was adopted as the final financial result. Among <b>milk</b> productivity <b>indexes</b> the following were calculated: cost of direct production of 1 l milk, total production cost of 1 l milk, profit generated by 1 l milk, profit per 1 cow and per 1 milking cow, the ratio of sale price to production cost of 1 l milk and production profitability index. The above mentioned parameters of milk production efficiency were calculated for the analysed years and for the period of tethering and free stall housing. Level of profitability of milk production in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative was varied, which was conditioned by decreasing production costs and the price of its sales each year. The most advantageous values of <b>milk</b> production profitability <b>index</b> were recorded in 2001 and 2005. With free stall housing system of cows milk production increased increasing the cost of its production at the same time. The main factors causing a reduction of milk production profitability in the free stall system in comparison to the tethering system were connected with significantly higher expenditure on fodder (mainly ready-purchased). The transition from the tethering management system to the free stall system resulted in relatively high values of <b>milk</b> production efficiency <b>indexes</b> at simultaneous reduction of labour consumption and considerable improvement of animal welfare...|$|R

Also to investigate the effects of rainy and dry seasons on the productive and reproductive performance of desert goats. Hence, the experiment was undertaken to evaluate the effects of supplemented feed with three different levels of energy and isonitrogenous protein(A,B,C) compared to unsupplemented feed group (D) on kids performance (birth weight, weaning weight, post-weaning weight and mortality), productive performance (milk yield, lactation period, <b>milk</b> composition and <b>indices</b> of doe productivity) and reproductive performance (kidding interval, gestation length, litter size, post-partum anestrus and puberty). Experiment was also undertaken {{to determine the effect}} of season mainly rainy and dry periods on kids performance, productive performance and reproductive performance. Kid's performance analysis demonstrated that the birth weight, weaning weight, post-weaning weight and kid's mortality percentage was positively affected by feeding supplemented groups; high energy (A), medium energy (B) and low energy (C) compared with unsupplemented group (D). Exception with kid's mortality, kid's performance differed significantly (P< 0. 05). Supplemented feed group containing higher energy (A) secured the highest values compared with unsupplemented group (D). Also, the effect of season (rainy and dry) analysis on the kid's performance was demonstrated. Rainy season compared with dry season differed significantly (P< 0. 05). Kid's performance of those kidded on rainy season had secured the highest values compared with kid's borned on dry season. XII Reproductive performance of the experimental goats analysis demonstrated that the gestation yield, kidding interval, litter size, post partum anestrus and puberty was affected by feed supplemented groups; high energy (A), medium energy (B) and low energy (C) compared with unsupplemented group (D). Exception with litter size, reproductive performance of experimental goats differed significantly (P< 0. 05). Supplemented feed group containing higher energy (A) secured the superior values compared with unsupplemented group (D). The effect of season on reproductive performance was also analyzed. Reproductive performance of experimental goats differed significantly (P< 0. 05). Reproductive performance of experimental goats on rainy season secured the superior values compared with dry season. Productive performance of the experimental goat's analysis demonstrated that the milk yield, lactation period, indices of doe productivity and milk composition was affected by supplemented feed groups compared with unsupplemented group. Productive performance of experimental goats significantly differed (P< 0. 05). Supplemented feed groups (A, B and C) had the higher values compared with unsupplemented group (D). Also, the effect of season on productive performance of experimental goats differed significantly (P< 0. 05). Productive performance of experimental goats on rainy season secured higher values compared with dry season. Therefore, it is concluded that feeding supplemented groups; high energy (A), medium energy (B) and low energy (C) compared with unsupplemented group increased birth weight, weaning weight, postweaning weight, <b>milk</b> yield, <b>indices</b> of doe productivity, lactation period and milk composition.

The <b>milk</b> per ton <b>index</b> has now been modified to use new NRC recommend-ations (National Research Council, 2001) for calculating energy (Schwab and Shaver, 2001), and an easy to use Excel 5. 0 spreadsheet called Milk 2000 has been developed. MILK 2000 uses forage analyses (crude protein, NDF, in vitro NDF digestibility, starch (corn silage only), and non-fiber carbohydrate) to estimate energy content using a modification of the NRC (2001) summative approach and DM intake from NDF (Mertens, 1987) and in vitro NDF digestibility (Oba and Allen, 1999) to predict milk production per ton of forage DM. In MILK 2000, the intake of energy from forage for a 1350 lb. milking cow consuming a 30 % NDF diet is calculated and the cow’s maintenance energy requirement (proportioned according to the percentage of forage in the diet) is then subtracted from energy intake to provide {{an estimate of the}} energy available from forage for conversion to milk (NRC, 1989).

All mares received an identical balanced ration, except for the source of supplementary Se: one group received organic Se (Se yeast) and the other group received inorganic Se (sodium selenite), fed to deliver 0. 3 mg/kg supplementary Se based on total ration dry matter. Mares received the experimental diet from 2 months before estimated due date until 1 month after foaling. Source of Se did not affect Se concentrations in maternal plasma, red blood cells, colostrum, or milk. At 1 month of age, foals from mares fed organic Se had higher red blood cell Se concentration than foals from mares fed inorganic Se (P <. 05). Measures of immunity included serum immunoglobulin G concentration, lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A, and relative cytokine gene expression of stimulated lymphocytes (interferon gamma IFNγ], interleukin IL]- 2, IL- 5, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFα]) and neutrophils (IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 12, TNFα).

The primary objective of conservation of a breed is to reduce the loss of the original genetic variation (Lacy et al., 1995). Conservation program is used to ensure that inbreeding and the effective population size is within reasonable limits (FAO, 2007). There are, in theory, three types of conservation: in situ, ex situ in vivo and ex situ (FAO, 2006). The best way to con-serve a breed is to use a combination of conservation methods (FAO, 1998; Oldenbroek, 2007). In this study, animals consisting of 75 - 100 % SLB were considered as descending from earlier Swedish Friesian. Based on data from the Swedish Dairy Association and the Central data-base of animals (cattle), CDB, the result was that there are 296 such cows, spread over 114 herds. Most herds are in Skåne, Västra Götaland and Jönköping County. The average kinship, for those individuals with 75 - 100 % SLB (born 2000 - 2007), was 0. 032 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0. 0257. The average kinship of cows with 100 % SLB (born 2000 - 2007) was higher, at 0. 172 with an SD of 0. 0489. The average kinship ranged between 0. 0035 and 0. 0855 for animals with 75 - 100 % SLB and between 0. 0172 and 0. 2270 for the animals with 100 % SLB. When breeding values of the SLB and Holstein population were compared it showed that Holstein, in particular, has better <b>milk</b> <b>index,</b> body, legs and udders than SLB, whereas SLB has better meat index, female fertility, and higher resistance to other diseases. There are several cows of SLB that you can consider using in the future SLB-breeding be-cause they are less related {{to the rest of the}} individuals than the average. Since many of the SLB-cows contains genes from Holstein these figures should be interpreted with caution and one should carefully check the cows’ relationships and share of SLB so that not too many animals with Holstein genes are crossed in. The conservation of the SLB-breed is of great interest for the farmers having the breed. Inter-views with farmers showed that they believe that SLB is a tolerant breed with good calving characteristics and provide more meat at slaughter. They feel that their work is an uphill struggle, however, especially in selecting breeding bulls, because there is not much genetic material available. In order to get a functional breeding many of the farmers think that the breed needs an own association with its own record. They also think that they may qualify for compensation and that a breeding plan needs to be established. The main responsibility should be with SJV. It was also found that there are associations that are interested in doing an inventory and thus start a conservation program for SLB...|$|R
40|$|Milk fat is {{the major}} source of energy for breastfed infants; it also {{supplies}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) essential for the development of brain, retina, and other organs. Maternal nutritional status is critical for the newborn, and little information exists regarding the PUFA status of vulnerable populations living in Southern regions. We studied the relationship between maternal nourishment and milk fatty acid composition. Mother nutritional status (normal, overweight or obese) was estimated on the body mass <b>index.</b> <b>Milk</b> protein, total lipid, and fatty acid composition were determined. Milk protein was not affected by mother’s nutritional status. In obese mothers an increase in lipid content, linoleic acid, total n- 6 and total polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed comparing to the other groups. 							Disregarding the nutritional status, the ratio n- 6 /n- 3 fatty acids was very high and the 22 : 6 n- 3 content was very low, when compared with those of mothers from other countries.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, the {{emphasis}} on the health of dairy cows has changed from an individual to a herd level. In this scenario, the role played by the recording system and its interpretation by veterinarians has gained primordial importance. The records of productive and reproductive performance and of sanitary status from a southern Brazilian dairy cattle herd have been presented and discussed. The period of study was 2000 - 2009. Mean values per lactation period were 349 D 8436 M 290 F 275 P 201 SCS (D: days in lactation, M: kg of milk yield, F: kg of fat, P: kg of protein and SCS: somatic cell score in 1000 cells/ml of <b>milk).</b> Major <b>indexes</b> of reproductive efficiency included age at first calving (31 months), services per conception (2. 1), intercalving interval (428 days), calving to conception interval (146 days), mean annual rates of parturitions (76. 2 %), fetal losses (9. 8 - 19. 0 %), and stillbirths (3. 6 %), apart of voluntary waiting period (94 days). Main information on sanitary status of the herd was associated with the mean prevalence of common disorders of dairy cattle such as anaplasmosis (29. 8 %), mastitis (27. 8 %), digital diseases (26. 3 %), ovarian cysts (21. 3 %), placental retention (19. 7 %), postpartum uterine infections (10. 6 %), and calf diarrhea (23. 7 %) and pneumonia (16. 8 %), among others. In addition, culling reasons (low reproductive performance [56. 3 %] and udder/mastitis problems [33. 6 %]), causes of cattle deaths (anaplasmosis [16. 4 %] and leukosis [11. 4]), and the impact of cattle diseases such as tuberculosis, leukosis, and neosporosis on the herd have also been presented and succinctly discussed.

When 25 patient with vertebral fractures compared with 19 patients without fracture,only patient’s age showed statistically significant difference between groups (p= 0. 035). Of the 5 risk factors chosen (age, L 2 -L 4 BMD, L 2 -L 4 T score, body weight < 57 kg, milk consumption before age 50) only patient’s age was found to be statistically important in estimating vertebral fracture risk (p= 0. 032).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to study the effects of changes in feeding {{frequency}} of TMR (2 – 1 – 2 times a day) on milk yield and milk composition, feed and nutrient consumption, selected parameters of rumen liquid and rumination intensity (length and number of rumination periods). No significant differences in performance, rumen fluid indices and rate of rumination were detected. Similarly, differences in dry matter intake (819. 2 g/head/day) were non-significant (P> 0. 05). Results of the periodical experiment with 13 dairy cows fed once a day ad libitum during the winter season have shown that in stables with adequate conditions (capacity of feeding troughs, availability of feeds etc.) TMR to dairy cows may be fed once a day during the winter season without any unfavourable impact either on performance or health state of dairy cows, and the same milk yield as with feeding twice-a-day can be obtained.

40|$|Considerable differencesexist among {{prices for}} {{purebred}} dairy bull services. Much of this variation in prices {{can be explained}} by differences in heritable production and offspring physical traits. The specific values associated with individual heritable traits in dairy bull semen are estimated. A total performance index, a production transmitting ability type <b>index,</b> <b>milk</b> production, fat and protein content, production reliability, and certain udder and physical type traits were significant semen price determinants. A major component of technological change in milk production has been genetic improvement. Over the last 20 years, milk yield has increased roughly one percent per year. About half of this gain has been attributed to genetic improvement (Legates and Warwick). Genetic selection is important in determining both cow productivity and milk quality. Factors that affect herd injury vulnerability, disease susceptibility,feed efficiency,and reproduction are also important genetic considerations (Dentine et a 1.; Rogers et al.). Use of artificial insemination (AI) affects the rate of genetic progress. The annual rate of genetic improve-ment from using AI is roughly 70 percent greater than non-Al bulls in the typical dairy herd (Everett and Pearson). The objectivesof this study are to estimate market values of different genetic attributes that sires convey and {{to determine whether or not}} composite indexes of individual traits are suffi-cient price guides relative to examining all of the individual traits.

40|$|The {{levels of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in human <b>milk</b> provide an <b>index</b> of {{exposure}} of the mother to these compounds and enable the intake by the breast-fed child to be estimated. For valid comparisons between different studies, concentrations should be expressed on a milk fat basis. In a recently completed UNEP/WHO pilot project on monitoring of organochlorine compounds in human milk in ten countries, great {{emphasis was placed on}} analytical quality assurance. To obtain comparable data, a common procedure, that of Sawyer, was adopted for quantitation of PCBs, using Aroclor 1260 as standard. In addition, certain criteria (e. g., age and parity) were established for selection of the mothers to be sampled. In contrast to the situation with p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, the levels of PCBs in human milk fat were higher in the European countries and Japan than in China, India and Mexico. In fact, PCBs were not detected in human milk in the latter three countries. Although PCBs were detected in some samples in the USA, the median level was below the limit of detection of the method used there (1 mg/kg fat). The median PCB levels reported from Belgium, Israel, Japan and Yugoslavia were 0. 81, 0. 45, 0. 35 and 0. 63 mg/kg fat, respectively. Higher median levels were reported from Sweden and the Federal Republic of Germany (0. 97 and 2. 1 mg/kg fat, respectively). The German samples were not analyzed by the Sawyer method...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the {{sensitivity and specificity}} of results of initial and repeated milk ELISAs (at 6 - or 12 -month intervals) to detect cows that were shedding Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (ie, were infectious) and to evaluate factors influencing {{the probability that the}} results of a repeated milk ELISA would be positive for an infectious cow if the results of the initial milk ELISA were negative. Design—Prospective cohort study. Animals— 3, 145 dairy cows from 32 herds. Procedures—Herds from the 3 Maritime provinces in Canada (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia), participating in a Dairy Herd Improvement program, and that had undergone a prior Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis awareness project were selected for the study. Sample collection occurred between April 2009 and March 2011 with milk and fecal samples collected from all lactating cows in study herds every 6 months. Herds completing < 3 herd visits with collection of individual cow fecal or milk samples, within this sampling timeframe, were excluded from analyses. Fecal samples were cultured in liquid medium and a cow was defined as infectious if ≥ 1 sample was culture positive (reference test). A <b>milk</b> ELISA (<b>index</b> test) was completed with a commercial kit, following manufacturer's instructions. Results—For a 6 -month test interval, sensitivities of the milk ELISA to detect infectious cows were 22. 0 % and 32. 6 % for initial and combined initial and repeated tests (parallel interpretation), respectively. Specificity of the initial ELISA was 99. 6 % and was 99. 2 % for combined tests. For a 12 -month test interval, sensitivities of the milk ELISA to detect infectious cows were 25. 6 % and 45. 3 % for initial and combined initial and repeated tests (parallel interpretation), respectively. Specificity of the initial ELISA was 99. 6 % and was 98. 9 % for combined tests. In infectious cows, magnitude of the initial negative ELISA result was a positive predictor for a positive repeated ELISA result. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results of a repeated milk ELISA improved detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis infectious cows, with minimal loss of specificity. A 12 -month test interval provided a greater increase in sensitivity, relative to an initial test, than did a 6 -month interval. Infectious cows with an initial negative milk ELISA result close to the cutoff for a positive test {{were more likely to have}} positive results on a repeated ELISA. Repeated testing improved detection of infectious cows and reduced risk of misclassification compared with a single ELISA result...|$|R
40|$|With {{regard to}} human health aspects of milk fat, {{increasing}} the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in milk is an important selection objective. The cow¿s diet has an influence on the degree of unsaturation, but literature suggests that genetics also plays a role. To estimate genetic variation in milk fatty acid unsaturation <b>indices,</b> <b>milk</b> fatty acid composition of 1, 933 Dutch Holstein Friesian heifers was measured and unsaturation indices were calculated. An unsaturation index represents the concentration of the unsaturated product proportional to the sum of the unsaturated product and the saturated substrate. Intraherd heritabilities were moderate, ranging from 0. 23 ± 0. 07 for conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) index to 0. 46 ± 0. 09 for C 16 index. We genotyped the cows for the SCD 1 A 293 V and DGAT 1 K 232 A polymorphisms, which are known to alter milk fatty acid composition. Both genes explain part of the genetic variation in unsaturation indices. The SCD 1 V allele is associated with lower C 10, C 12, and C 14 indices, and with higher C 16, C 18, and CLA indices in comparison to the SCD 1 A allele, with no differences in total unsaturation index. In comparison to the DGAT 1 K allele, the DGAT 1 A allele is associated with lower C 10, C 12, C 14, and C 16 indices and with higher C 18, CLA, and total indices. We conclude that selective breeding can contribute to higher unsaturation indices, and that selective breeding can capitalize on genotypic information of both the SCD 1 A 293 V and the DGAT 1 K 232 A polymorphis...|$|R
40|$|A {{reaction}} norm {{approach was}} used to estimate trends for days open (DO) with a model that indirectly accounted for heat stress. Data included 3. 4 million first-parity records of DO of US Holsteins. A fixed effect model included herd-year, month of calving within region (MOC), age class, and regression on 305 -d <b>milk</b> yield. An <b>index</b> calculated from the standardized solutions to MOC derived from the fixed effect model {{was treated as a}} proxy for an index on heat stress (SI). The lowest index for any region was set to zero. The highest index was 1. 00 for the Southeast, 0. 56 for the Northeast, 0. 54 for the Midwest, 0. 33 for the Northwest, and 0. 42 for the Southwest. In all regions except the Northwest, the highest DO and the corresponding highest indices were in March-April. Compared with the fixed model, the reaction norm model also included the effect of an animal and a random regression on the SI; the 2 animal solutions are subsequently referred to as an intercept and a slope. Genetic trends were calculated for cows and sires separately. For cows, the trend for the intercept was - 0. 1 d/yr, whereas the trend for the slope was 1 d/yr. For sires, the same trends were - 0. 3 and 1. 5, respectively. Official proofs were used to characterize the 100 top and 100 bottom bulls with at least 50 daughters for the intercept and the slope. Compared with the top bulls, the bottom bulls for the intercept gave 56 kg more milk and their type performance index was higher by 212 points. For the slope, the same numbers were - 435 kg and - 242 points, respectively. Trends for seasonal changes of days open are unfavorable...|$|R
