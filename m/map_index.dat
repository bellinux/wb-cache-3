40|$|Background & Aims: MUTYH-associated {{polyposis}} (MAP) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder caused by mutations in the MUTYH gene. Patients with MAP are at extremely {{high risk of}} colorectal cancer, but the risks of colorectal and other cancers in heterozygous carriers of a single MUTYH mutation are uncertain. We performed a retrospective study of cancer incidence and causes of death among obligate MUTYH heterozygote individuals. Methods: <b>MAP</b> <b>index</b> cases were identified from polyposis registers in Germany, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Cancer incidence, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality {{data were collected from}} 347 parents of unrelated <b>MAP</b> <b>index</b> cases and the spouses of 3 index cases who were also found to be heterozygous for single MUTYH mutations. These data were compared with appropriate national sex-, age-, and period-specific population data to obtain standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Results: There was a 2 -fold increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer among parents of MAP cases, compared with the general population (SIR, 2. 12; 95...|$|E
