25|$|The {{reactions}} {{are due to}} collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more crowded the molecules are, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to collide and react with one another. Thus, {{an increase in the}} concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).|$|E
25|$|Genetic linkage is the {{tendency}} of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other {{are unlikely to be}} separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more linked than markers that are far apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly unlinked.|$|E
25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{to be satisfied with}} life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this {{has come to be known}} as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{investigative tool}} at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people {{to determine if}} they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E
500|$|Unlike normal gameplay, {{where all}} {{character}} and background graphics are two-dimensional (2D), combat is rendered entirely in 3D. Wild Arms uses a turn-based battle {{system in which}} the player inputs commands at the start of each round designating which actions take place. The order in which each character and enemy performs these actions is based on their [...] "response" [...] (RES) statistic, which denotes how quickly a particular character can act. [...] The higher a character's response, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to act before an enemy. The player has the option every round to either use a restorative item from their inventory, use a special skill, run from combat, or attack. Enemy units are defeated when their hit points, a numerical representation of their vitality, reaches zero. Hit points can be reduced by attacking an enemy, either with standard attacks or spells.|$|E

The theme of that year’s day was ″Tobacco-free youth″; therefore, this initiative was especially meant to target advertising efforts aimed at youth. [...] According to the WHO, the tobacco industry must replace older quitting or dying smokers with younger consumers. [...] Because of this, marketing strategies are commonly observed in places that will attract youth such as movies, the Internet, billboards, and magazines. [...] Studies have shown that the more youth are exposed to tobacco advertising, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to smoke.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{indicates}} that the more corporal punishment children receive, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. Children who are spanked more as {{children are more likely}} as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general. A number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with [...] "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors. While these associations do not prove causation, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. According to research, corporal punishment of children predicts weaker internalisation of values such as empathy, altruism, and resistance to temptation. According to researcher Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba, it should therefore not be surprising that corporal punishment [...] "consistently predicts increased levels of antisocial behavior [...] as well as dating violence".|$|E
2500|$|Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba {{writes that}} {{a number of studies have}} found {{physical}} punishment to be associated with [...] "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors. According to Elizabeth Gershoff at the University of Michigan, the more that children are physically punished, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. In countries where physical punishment of children is perceived as being more culturally accepted, it is less strongly associated with increased aggression; however, physical punishment has been found to predict some increase in child aggression regardless of culture. While these associations do not prove causality, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. In examining several longitudinal studies that investigated the path from disciplinary spanking to aggression in children from preschool age through adolescence, Gershoff concluded: [...] "Spanking consistently predicted increases in children's aggression over time, regardless of how aggressive children were when the spanking occurred". similar results were found by Catherine Taylor at Tulane University in 2010. Family violence researcher Murray A. Straus argues, [...] "There are many reasons this evidence has been ignored. One of the most important is the belief that spanking is more effective than nonviolent discipline and is, therefore, sometimes necessary, despite the risk of harmful side effects".|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1990s, the Brazilian {{pharmaceutical}} company Hebron {{announced plans to}} market a low-dose gossypol pill called Nofertil, but the pill never came to market.

40|$|When given a choice, how {{do people}} decide which {{physician}} to select? Although significant {{research has demonstrated that}} how people actually feel (their “actual affect”) influences their health care preferences, how people ideally want to feel (their “ideal affect”) may play an even greater role. Specifically, we predicted that people trust physicians whose affective characteristics match their ideal affect, which leads people to prefer those physicians more. Consistent with this prediction, the more participants wanted to feel high arousal positive states on average ([ideal HAP]; e. g., excited), the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to select a HAP-focused physician. Similarly, the more people wanted to feel low arousal positive states on average ([ideal LAP]; e. g., calm), the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to select a LAP-focused physician. Also as predicted, these links were mediated by perceived physician trustworthiness. Notably, while participants’ ideal affect predicted physician preference, actual affect (how much people actually felt HAP and LAP on average) did not. These findings suggest that people base even serious decisions on how they want to feel and highlight the importance of considering ideal affect in models of decision making, person perception, and patient physician communication...|$|R

2500|$|Hanson {{repeatedly}} accused President Barack Obama {{of engaging}} in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Russia. Hanson argues that Vladimir Putin is the embodiment of [...] "eternal Russia", an aggressively expansionist and anti-Western nation whose people are innately anti-democratic. In a 2012 column titled [...] "History Never Quite Ends", Hanson wrote: [...] "From the czars to the Soviet Communists to Vladimir Putin's cronies, {{there is something about}} constitutional government and liberal rule that bothers Mother Russia. The more that progressive outsiders seek to lecture or reform Russians, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to bristle and push back with left-wing or right-wing nationalist strongmen. At present, we do not know whether there will be a Czar Vladimir, Comrade Putin, or Putin Inc. in charge, but we fear it does not matter much". Hanson depicts modern Russia in unflattering terms as [...] "...a disaster of a declining population, corruption, authoritarianism, a warped economy, and a high rate of alcoholism." [...] Precisely because Russia is so weak, Hanson claims that Putin is driven to aggression against his neighbors with the overwhelmingly support of the Russian people {{out of a sense of}} hurt pride and a desire to make Russia great again. In 2014, Hanson called Putin [...] "evil", writing: [...] "Putin is almost Milton's Satan—as if, in his seductive evil, he yearns for clarity, perhaps even a smackdown, if not just for himself, for us as well. He is not the better man than Obama but, again like Milton's Satan, the more interesting, if only because he reminds of us of our own limitations." [...] In a 2015 column, Hanson wrote about what he views as the aims of Russian foreign policy that: [...] "Russian president Vladimir Putin thinks he can reconstitute the empire of the czars and the later Soviet Union. American [...] "reset" [...] diplomacy green-lighted his annexation of the Crimea and his occupation of areas of Ukraine.

5000|$|The TARA is a {{computer-based}} technique.

Hence, if both truth-tellers and liars complete the TARA accurately as stipulated, then the former will complete it more quickly than the latter, all else being equal.|$|E
