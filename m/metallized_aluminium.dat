40|$|A {{reduction}} in thickness of barrier laminated film systems generally {{leads to a}} quality decrease of the resulting packaging materials' functional properties. Especially for food packaging applications, adequate oxygen and water barrier properties are indispensable. The focus {{of this study was}} therefore the development of thin film systems using <b>metallized</b> <b>aluminium</b> or ethyl vinyl alcohol barrier laminates with low oxygen and water vapour transmission properties. Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate and biaxially oriented polypropylene aluminium-coated thin film laminates as well as corresponding ethyl vinyl alcohol film systems could be successfully produced with oxygen transmission rates of < 0. 5 cm³(STP) /(m² d bar) and water barrier values of < 0. 1 g/(m² d). It could be confirmed that the film thickness of these materials within the range of the investigated dimensions does not have an influence on the barrier properties. In fact, the parameters of the production process influence the functional properties of the film systems and must therefore be adapted. Machinability of these excellent thin film systems requires further investigation on packaging lines before they can be transferred to packaging application...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePolyethylene terephtalate (PET) <b>metallized</b> with <b>aluminium</b> by {{physical}} vapour deposition was investigated through classical physical chemistry techniques and mechanical characterization. The amount of aluminium altered the amount of crystallinity of the PET substrate, but appeared unrelated to the mechanical properties obtained with regular tensile test. In contrast, the essential work of fracture (EWF), as obtained with Cotterell tests, permitted to better discriminate the perforation resistance. It is shown that {{increasing the amount of}} crystallinity within the PET linearly reduced the EWF...|$|R
50|$|Chaff, {{originally}} called Window by the British and Düppel by the Second World War era German Luftwaffe (from the Berlin suburb {{where it}} was first developed), is a radar countermeasure in which aircraft or other targets spread a cloud of small, thin pieces of <b>aluminium,</b> <b>metallized</b> glass fibre or plastic, which either appears as a cluster of primary targets on radar screens or swamps the screen with multiple returns.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{exceptional}} mechanical and optical properties, dielectric silicon nitride (SiN) micromembrane resonators {{have become the}} centerpiece of many optomechanical experiments. Efficient capacitive coupling of the membrane to an electrical system would facilitate exciting hybrid optoelectromechanical devices. However, capacitive coupling of such dielectric membranes is rather weak. Here we add a single layer of graphene on SiN micromembranes and compare electromechanical coupling and mechanical properties to bare dielectric membranes and to membranes <b>metallized</b> with an <b>aluminium</b> layer. The electrostatic coupling of graphene coated membranes {{is found to be}} equal to a perfectly conductive membrane. Our results show that a single layer of graphene substantially enhances the electromechanical capacitive coupling without significantly adding mass, decreasing the superior mechanical quality factor or affecting the optical properties of SiN micromembrane resonators...|$|R
40|$|The use of sputter {{deposited}} TiW (15 / 85 w. t. %) as {{a direct}} contact material to p+ silicon is evaluated. The effect on the contact resistance of different pst-implant activation conditions, e. g. rapid thermal processing and conventional furnace annealing in dry or wet ambients, has been studied. For comparison parallell measurements were done on identically processed wafers <b>metallized</b> with <b>aluminium.</b> The resulting dopant profiles were determined by spreading resistance profiling (SRP). Schottky barrier height measurements were performed on n-type Mers metallized with TiW or Al. The respective values were ΦBn= 0. 55 eV and ΦBn= 0. 8 eV. The results from contact resistance and SRP measurements show that a high surface carrier concentration is {{necessary in order to}} achieve a low contact resistance. This effect was more pronounced for the material with the higher barrier height to p+ silicon i. e. TiW was found to be more sensitive to a small variation in the boron surface carrier concentration. Despite of this it was observed that given a high surface carrier concentration, after RTP, the performance of TiW contacts to p+ silicon surpassed that of Al. In case of a direct Al-Si contact, silicon precipitation occurs in the contact hole thereby reducing the effective contact area. This will cause an increase in the resistance of contacts which becomes more pronounced for small dimensions. With TiW, silicon precipitation is avoided...|$|R
40|$|Bag-in-box {{system is}} a {{convenient}} packaging system for wine. Its barrier to oxygen relies, in many cases, in an <b>aluminium</b> <b>metallized</b> polyester film laminated between two polyethylene (PE) layers as the inner bag. One on the most frequently observed system failures is the ingress of wine into {{the gap between the}} layers of the double bag. This study aimed at verifying if that influences the barrier of the system to oxygen. The results showed that the contact of wine with this barrier layer, although through a PE layer, promotes the demetallization and consequent loss of barrier properties. The type of wine, in particular its volatile acidity, and the temperatures were two variables assessed. Results showed that wine with higher acidity and stored at higher temperatures tend to yield a higher increase in oxygen transmission rate of the film...|$|R
40|$|Interdigitated metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) Schottky diode photodetectors {{based on}} silicon-on-insulator-substrates (SOI) have {{attracted}} research {{interest in the}} past years due to their high-speed compatibility at longer wavelengths with GaAs-based MSM PD's. This paper presents DC and transient characteristics of SOI MSM PD's with different top Si layer dopings and thicknesses (0. 2 µm, 0. 5 µm, 1 µm, 2 µm and 4 µm). The detectors with metal finger width and spacing of 2 – 3 µm and active areas of 100 × 100 µm 2 were fabricated by using conventional optical lithography and lift-off technique. For the p-type detectors the Schottky electrode metallization consisted of Ti/Au (60 / 130 nm), whereas the n-type detectors were <b>metallized</b> with <b>aluminium</b> (100 nm). I–V characteristics have been measured showing a low dark current. C–V measurements exhibit a small saturation capacitance. The speed of the detectors was investigated with a double heterostructure (DH) laser at a wavelength of 850 nm, a single heterostructure (SH) laser at 910 nm and a Ti : Sapphire laser at 800 nm. At the wavelength of 850 nm the risetime for the 0. 5 µm top Si layer detector was 70 ps (bias-voltage 10 V), corresponding to 3 dB bandwidth of 5 GHz. For the detectors with thicker active top layers the bandwidths were slightly smaller, {{but also in the}} GHz-region. The results indicate that the photocarriers generated beneath the thin photoactive top Si layer deep in the bulk are isolated through the buried SiO 2 -layer. High speed for Si-based detectors may thus be achieved even at a long wavelength. The photoresponsivity has also been measured showing that reasonable efficiency is achievable for SOI detectors...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) films have been <b>metallized</b> by <b>aluminium</b> evaporation {{in two different}} sets of experimental conditions. In the first set, aluminium layers of 100 nm thickness were deposited at a constant deposition rate (10 angstrom s- 1) for different residual pressures varying from 1 Pa to 10 (- 4) Pa and, in the second set, the residual pressure was kept constant (2. 6 x 10 (- 3) Pa), while the deposition rate was varied from 5 angstrom s- 1 to 40 angstrom s- 1. The adherence between the aluminium layers and the PET film was measured by means of scratch and peel tests. The critical load and the peel strength exhibit a maximum at about 10 (- 2) Pa when the deposition rate is kept constant. The microstructure of the aluminium layers, mainly the mean grain size, was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiles through the aluminium layers were performed {{in order to provide}} the chemical information, mainly aluminium layer oxidation. Concerning the TEM results, the grain size increases when the residual pressure is decreased and also when the deposition rate is increased. The SIMS depth profiles show different levels for aluminium oxidation at the surface, in the bulk of the layers and at the interface, all increasing for high residual gas pressure and for low deposition rates. From these results, it appears that the oxygen content at the Al-PET interface plays a critical role in the microstructure owing to its influence on the nucleation and on the growth of the aluminium layers. It also influences the adhesion between aluminium and PET for which an optimum oxygen amount seems to be required...|$|R

40|$|Third {{key word}} here Fourth key word here (10 -pt type/ 12 -pt leading) Aluminium metallizers have {{a row of}} {{resistance}} heated evaporation boats sited beneath a chilled deposition drum. Each boat has aluminium wire fed into it that forms a molten pool from which the aluminium evaporates. This process has low material efficiency {{and there is a}} significant ongoing cost in replacing the evaporation boats after every 12 – 15 hours deposition time. As metallizers get ever wider the number of boats required increases pro rata. Some polymer producers are looking at metallizing mill rolls of widths in the range 6 m – 12 m. To metallize at this width they would like to change from the large number of evaporation boats to a single full width slot source. Slot sources are not new having been used for many years for the deposition of zinc and other low temperature metals & alloys. More recently they have been developed for the deposition of polymers such as for organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) [1]. Potentially slot sources can deliver improved deposition uniformity and higher material efficiency with reduced power consumption. However the opportunities to gain the benefits from slot sources for <b>aluminium</b> <b>metallizing</b> will only be achieved if some materials and process problems can be overcome. In this paper I will highlight the benefits that are on offer and the current limitations...|$|R
