5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} {{overpricing}} {{is also an}} important consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> meeting their commitments to sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may fall in value {{on the first day of}} trading. If so, the stock may lose its marketability and hence even more of its value. This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The book The Dance of Change states {{there are}} many reasons why an {{organization}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> in transforming itself into a learning organization. The first is that an organization does not have enough time. Employees and management may have other issues that take priority over trying to change the culture of their organization. The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. For an organization to be able to change, it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces. As a solution, a mentor or coach who is well versed in the learning organization concept may be necessary.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to lack of}} suction, {{an infant}} with a cleft <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> feeding. An infant with a cleft palate will have greater success feeding in a more upright position. Gravity will help prevent milk from coming through the baby's nose if he/she has cleft palate. Gravity feeding can be {{accomplished}} by using specialized equipment, such as the Haberman Feeder, or by using a combination of nipples and bottle inserts like the one shown, is commonly used with other infants. A large hole, crosscut, or slit in the nipple, a protruding nipple and rhythmically squeezing the bottle insert can result in controllable flow to the infant without the stigma caused by specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|People with ORS misinterpret the {{behavior}} of others {{to be related to}} the imagined odor (thoughts of reference). In one review, ideas of reference were present in 74% of cases. Usually, these involve misinterpretations of comments, gestures and actions of other people such that it is believed that an offensive smell from the individual is being referred to. These thoughts of reference are more pronounced in social situations which the individual with ORS may find stressful, such as public transport, crowded lift, workplace, classroom, etc. Example behaviors which are misinterpreted include coughing, sneezing, turning of the head, opening a window, facial expressions, sniffing, touching nose, scratching head, gestures, moving away, avoiding the person, whistling. Commonly, when being in proximity to others who are talking among themselves, persons with ORS will be convinced that the conversation is about his or her odor. Even the actions of animals (e.g. barking of dogs) can be interpreted as referential to an odor. Persons with ORS <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss {{among the}} aged {{community}} lessens elders' ability {{to compensate for}} other age related social and/or physical problems. Communication problems of elderly adults can be greatly impacted by mechanical problems such as: the translation of ideas into linguistic representation or expression, the perception of linguistic stimuli or the derivation of an idea from a given unit of disclosure. Changes in these mechanical problems {{are more important than}} changes in linguistic knowledge. The main goal of hearing aids is to improve communication and quality of life, not just to restore hearing. Presbycusis {{is an example of a}} hearing deficit that cannot be corrected by hearing aids. Presbycusis, the alteration of hearing sensitivity associated with normal hearing loss, is caused by the decreased amount of hair cells of the inner ear. This is normally caused by long periods of distressing noise that diminish the hair cells which with increasing age will not grow back. Presbycusis and other such hearing-related problems promote social withdrawal, as individuals begin to lose touch with the world around them. Hearing loss among the aged community lessens elders' ability to compensate for other age-related social and/or physical problems. This impairment can cause elders to lose touch of social skills because they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> keeping up with fast-paced or hearing different pitched voices in conversation.|$|E

50|$|The {{discrepancies}} are understandable {{given that}} the obituary was would {{have been written by}} one of Richard's children and not himself. Richard also suffered from senility in his final years so he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> recollecting the facts perfectly. Additionally, the oldest of Richard's children would have been in their 70s themselves so their own recollections would be questionable due to the passage of time. Nevertheless, the obituary provides rich biographical information that can be largely substantiated by the records of the day.|$|R
500|$|The {{prognosis}} for epilepsy due to trauma {{is worse than}} that for epilepsy of undetermined cause. [...] People with PTE {{are thought to have}} shorter life expectancies than people with brain injury who do not suffer from seizures. Compared to people with similar structural brain injuries but without PTE, people with PTE take longer to recover from the injury, have more cognitive and motor problems, and perform worse at everyday tasks. [...] This finding may suggest that PTE is an indicator of a more severe brain injury, rather than a complication that itself worsens outcome. PTE has also been found to be associated with worse social and functional outcomes but not to worsen patients' rehabilitation or ability to return to work. However, people with PTE <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> finding employment if they admit to having seizures, especially if their work involves operating heavy machinery.|$|E

According to an op-ed article in The New York Times, {{one issue that}} Stivers and Kilroy have both been vocal about is the prospective repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides direct election of United States Senators. [...] Stivers had backpedaled on his support of the repeal after Kilroy made an issue of his stance. [...] The race {{is one of the}} most closely watched in the United States House of Representatives elections, 2010, and it will include a third party candidate. [...] The Republican Party has marked it as one of their targeted races according to a U.S. News & World Report article.

2500|$|However, similar {{conflicts}} {{exist between}} other countries. Visitors with passport stamp of such countries <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> {{to enter the}} other countries. Germany allows its citizens to hold several German passports (two or three, in extreme cases up to ten) to circumvent such travel restrictions. However, these additional passports are valid only for a maximum of six years, even if the [...] "main passport" [...] is valid for ten years. Holding a German passport and a foreign passport at the same time, that is, dual citizenship, is restricted under the current German nationality law. Germany allows dual citizenship with other EU countries and Switzerland; dual citizenship with other countries is possible with special permission or if obtained at birth. Dual citizenship is also routinely granted when the other citizenship cannot be renounced or renunciation would be practically impossible.|$|E
2500|$|ADCP {{is often}} {{characterized}} by slow, uncontrolled {{movements of the}} extremities and trunk. Small, rapid, random and repetitive, uncontrolled movements known as chorea may also occur. Involuntary movements often increase during periods of emotional stress or excitement and disappear when the patient is sleeping or distracted. Patients experience difficulty in maintaining posture and balance when sitting, standing, and walking due to these involuntary movements and fluctuations in muscle tone. Coordinated activities such as reaching and grasping may also be challenging. [...] Muscles of the face and tongue can be affected, causing involuntary facial grimaces, expressions, and drooling. Speech and language disorders, known as dysarthria, are common in athetoid CP patients. In addition, ADCP patients <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> eating. [...] Hearing loss is a common co-occurring condition, and visual disabilities {{can be associated with}} Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. [...] Squinting and uncontrollable eye movements may be initial signs and symptoms. Children with these disabilities rely heavily on visual stimulation, especially those who are also affected by sensory deafness.|$|E
2500|$|Certain ceratioids rely on parabiotic reproduction. Free-living {{males and}} unparasitized females in these species never have fully {{developed}} gonads. Thus, males never mature without attaching to a female, and die if they cannot find one. [...] At birth, male ceratioids are already equipped with extremely well-developed olfactory organs that detect scents in the water. Males of some species also develop large, highly specialized eyes that may aid in identifying mates in dark environments. The male ceratioid lives solely {{to find and}} mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female anglerfish, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, growth of the alimentary canals of some males becomes stunted, preventing them from feeding. Some taxa have jaws that are never suitable or effective for prey capture. These features mean the male must quickly find a female anglerfish to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male to detect the pheromones that signal the proximity of a female anglerfish.|$|E

2500|$|Dysfunctions in the {{prefrontal cortex}} and {{amygdala}} {{regions of the}} brain {{have been associated with}} specific learning impairments in psychopathy. Since the 1980s, scientists have linked traumatic brain injury, including damage to these regions, with violent and psychopathic behavior. Patients with damage in such areas resembled [...] "psychopathic individuals" [...] whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex may also impair stimulus-reinforced learning in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their uncinate fasciculus—white matter connecting the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. There is evidence from DT-MRI, of breakdowns in the white matter connections between these two important areas.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a number}} of cases, {{multiple}} kanji were assigned to cover a single Japanese word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. For instance, the word , naosu, when written , means [...] "to heal an illness or sickness". When written [...] it means [...] "to fix or correct something". Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Differences of opinion among reference works is not uncommon; one dictionary may say the kanji are equivalent, while another dictionary may draw distinctions of use. As a result, native speakers of the language <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> knowing which kanji to use and resort to personal preference or by writing the word in hiragana. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as もと moto, which has at least five different kanji: , and , the first three of which have only very subtle differences. Another notable example is sakazuki [...] "sake cup", which may be spelt as at least five different kanji: , and of these, the first two are common – formally [...] is a small cup and [...] a large cup.|$|E
