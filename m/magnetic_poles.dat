5|$|The {{positions}} of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> can be defined {{in at least two}} ways: locally or globally.|$|E
5|$|While the North and South <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> {{are usually}} {{located near the}} {{geographic}} poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Poles</b> relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles,</b> and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E

By comparison, Earth has a south <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> near its north geographic pole and a north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> near its south pole.|$|R
5000|$|All magnets {{have two}} poles, where {{the lines of}} {{magnetic}} flux enter and emerge. By analogy with the Earth's magnetic field, these are called the magnet's [...] "north" [...] and [...] "south" [...] poles. The convention in early compasses was to call {{the end of the}} needle pointing to the Earth's North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> the [...] "north pole" [...] (or [...] "north-seeking pole") and the other end the [...] "south pole" [...] (the names are often abbreviated to [...] "N" [...] and [...] "S"). Because opposite poles attract, this definition means that the Earth's North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> is actually a <b>magnetic</b> south <b>pole</b> and the Earth's South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> is a <b>magnetic</b> north <b>pole.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{the ancient}} {{magnetic}} field was oriented similar to today's field (North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> near the Geographic North Pole) the strata retain a normal polarity. If the {{data indicate that}} the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> was near the Geographic South Pole, the strata exhibit reversed polarity.|$|R
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the Jovian <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|All runways {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a more durable {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last runway to be resurfaced. This runway is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is runway 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are runways 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short runway suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between the two sets of parallel runways was runway 14/32, which has been decommissioned. Runways 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The runways were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical shift in the planet's <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{a typical}} compass, a luopan does not {{point to the}} north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> of Earth. The needle of a luopan points to the south <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> (it does not point to the {{geographic}} south pole). The Chinese word for compass translates to “pointing-south needle.” ...|$|R
25|$|A {{geomagnetic}} storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, {{and bring the}} aurora to lower latitudes. It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000km away from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole.</b> The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole,</b> so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.|$|R
5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red glows in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (the green glows in the same image) have also been observed.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E
5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E
500|$|One way {{to define}} a pole is as {{a point where the}} {{magnetic}} field is vertical. This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90° (downwards) at the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> and -90° (upwards) at the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to [...] per year have been observed for the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> Over the last 180 years, the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to [...] from Resolute Bay in 2001. The magnetic equator is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).|$|R

5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E

25|$|A set of {{positively}} charged electromagnet coils {{arranged in a}} polyhedron. The most common arrangement is a six sided cube. The six <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> are pointing {{in the same direction}} toward the center. The magnetic field vanishes at the center by symmetry, creating a null point.|$|E
25|$|Skeptics {{suggest that}} the palaeomagnetic data could be {{corrupted}} if Earth's ancient magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the rate of cooling of Earth's core, {{it is possible that}} during the Proterozoic, the magnetic field did not approximate a simple dipolar distribution, with north and south <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around {{the same time as the}} Gaskiers glaciation.|$|E

25|$|Associated with solar flares is {{a release}} of high-energy protons. These {{particles}} can hit the Earth within 15 minutes to 2 hours of the solar flare. The protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the Earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> increasing the ionization of the D and E layers. PCA's typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days, {{with an average of}} around 24 to 36 hours. Coronal mass ejections can also release energetic protons that enhance D-region absorption in the polar regions.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, some {{theoretical}} physics models predict {{the existence of}} these magnetic monopoles. Paul Dirac observed in 1931 that, because electricity and magnetism show a certain symmetry, just as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge, isolated South or North <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> should be observable. Using quantum theory Dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist, then one could explain the quantization of electric charge—that is, why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron.|$|E
30|$|The north <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>pole</b> {{velocity}} {{has more}} than doubled in the last 30 years. This observation, together with the decrease in the Earth’s magnetic dipole intensity over the last century has raised the concern of a possible approaching polarity reversal. We show that this rapid variation is in fact to be expected, and will not affect the dipolar field as a whole, but only the north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole.</b> We demonstrate how this rapid displacement of the north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> is made possible by the horizontal field morphology. This rapid variation of north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> position does not imply any important modification of the core processes associated with field generation. The north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> position being very sensitive to small as well as rapid variations of the field, we show that it can very effectively be used as a passive tracer (or indicator) of field variations. Indeed, its velocity over the last century very accurately indicates the geomagnetic impulses (or jerks) that were so far observed only in observatory data.|$|R
