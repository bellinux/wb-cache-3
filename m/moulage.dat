50|$|Towne {{worked for}} the anatomist Dr. Hilton and for Addison. Addison taught materia medica, and had need for wax <b>moulages</b> of diseases. Smallpox is contagious, so the {{students}} would be shown wax models rather than the real thing. Towne made eight <b>moulages</b> of variola, the smallpox - six days before eruption, five days, four days, three days, two days, the day before, the day of eruption and two days after. He also made three <b>moulages</b> of vaccinia, the cowpox.|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 20 th century the Dental Institute of the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Berlin possessed a large {{collection}} of <b>moulages</b> and wax models. They were mainly produced and used {{up to the}} 1920 s. Today there are only 50 pieces still existing, which are located at the Berlin Medical Historical Museum of the Charité. The objective was to find out all the missing information such as people involved, the origin, historic use, the shown disease patterns and the historical and today’s therapy methods, and to store these information in the database of the museum and to generate a catalog which allows the use as exhibits in the museum and further research. An examination of the models made in many cases a diagnosis possible. In order to collect the missing information an extensive research in historic and contemporary literature and other historical sources was carried out. As introduction of the thesis the use of wax generally and especially in dentistry and the development from anatomical models to the <b>moulages</b> are described. Further, {{a survey of the}} current state of research of <b>moulages</b> and wax models showed that especially dental <b>moulages</b> are rarely known and scientifically described. Therefore further research was needed. As first results of the research four Berlin collections which were used for education and advanced training of dentists and surgeons were found. There was an intensive cooperation between the institutions owning these collections and the dental clinic, especially in the field of jaw and face injuries. Probably these collections can be considered as an example for the use of models in the research and teaching of the dental clinic. The three departments of the dental clinic, dental surgery, restorative and prosthetic dentistry had each own collections of wax models and <b>moulages,</b> which were mainly developed by the heads of the departments since 1907. This development of the collections with the persons especially involved and the focus of each collection is described for each department. In particular the prosthetic department headed by Hermann Schroeder was using models and especially <b>moulages.</b> At this time quite a number of companies and mouleurs were producing wax models and <b>moulages.</b> In many cases the manufacturers of the models could be identified. The detailed results of the research and examination of the objects are presented in chapters for each kind of model: anatomical, pathological models and <b>moulages.</b> There are 13 anatomical models, mainly representing the cranial nerves in the head and face area. Further there are seven showcases with pathologic tooth models, mainly from the field of restorative dentistry. Among the <b>moulages</b> there are as a dental specialty six <b>moulages</b> of the jaw, representing mucosal diseases and the problems around erupting wisdom teeth. The 24 facial <b>moulages</b> show predominantly serious injuries of the maxillofacial area and their surgical or prosthetic therapy. For particular therapy methods, which were leadingly developed in the dental clinic and are shown by the <b>moulages,</b> a detailed description is given. Further models and <b>moulages</b> were found in literature and other sources, which do not exist anymore but were originally part of the collections. From this, an estimation of the original total number of the dental clinic collection was possible...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Towne made just over a {{thousand}} <b>moulages</b> for Guy's hospital, eight hundred under the direction of Addison including cases of skin disease, and anatomical preparations from dissections made by John Hilton.

50|$|Towne {{was paid}} a huge retainer, {{as well as}} a large sum for each <b>moulage.</b> Consequently, he {{remained}} loyal to Guy's hospital. Additional work involved the making of a marble bust of Cooper - who was now Sir Astley Cooper - and of other members of staff.|$|E
50|$|In 1859, {{the medical}} school at Guy's fell on hard times.It was {{suggested}} that the hospital museum should be closed to save money. That would automatically have spelled the end of Towne's career. Fortunately, the museum with its wax models continued - but in reduced circumstances. Ever loyal, Towne refused to make models for other British hospitals. His fame had spread, however, so that he made about two hundred additional <b>moulages</b> for faraway places such as India and the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} wax models is ancient. Wax {{anatomical}} models were first made by Gaetano Giulio Zummo (1656-1701) who first worked in Naples, then Florence, and finally Paris, {{where he was}} granted monopoly right by Louis XIV. Later, Jules Baretta (1834-1923) made more than 2000 wax models in Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, where more than 4000 wax models were collected. While wax models were being made, he made pleasant conversations with the patients, sang songs or at times played the piano. <b>Moulages</b> were made {{for the education of}} dermatologists around the world, but were eventually replaced by color slides.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Pedicle screws provide rigid {{fixation}} for instabilities in the lumbar and lumbosacral spine. Anatomical {{consideration and}} potential risk of neurologic complications {{are the reasons}} to hesitate using pedicle screws in the thoracic spine. Twenty <b>moulages</b> similar to human vertebrae were instrumented with Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) system pedicle screw by intratransverse process, extrapedicular and intrapedicular methods and pullout strength was measured. There was statistically significant difference between three techniques. By increasing the length of screw in any method, pullout strength increased. Average pullout strength in extrapedicular technique was less than two other techniques in dynamic state. The strongest technique for screw placement was intratransverse process technique. It seems that intratransverse process technique is safe for posterior fixation of spine...|$|R
50|$|Another trend, as {{seen on the}} {{official}} website, is that Norev has acquired or re-introduced several venerable old diecast brands, including the French CIJ name and Provence <b>Moulage.</b> In 2008, Norev also reintroduced the Spot-On brand once made by Tri-Ang in Northern Ireland. This was a bit odd since Spot-On did not at all have a French flavor in its offerings. Whereas CIJ focuses on trucks and industrial models and Norev on more everyday French cars with some racing versions, the angle of Provence <b>Moulage</b> {{seems to be on}} French historical and concept vehicles of more upscale model pricing. Also in 2008, under the auspices of CIJ, it was announced that the historic brand of JRD would also be launched, but as of 2011, no new JRD models seem to have been produced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{modeling}} {{of the soft}} parts of dissections, teaching illustrations of anatomy, was first practised at Florence during the Renaissance. The practice of <b>moulage,</b> or the depiction of human anatomy and different diseases taken from directly casting from the body using (in the early period) gelatine moulds, later alginate or silicone moulds, used wax as its primary material (later {{to be replaced by}} latex and rubber). Some moulages were directly cast from the bodies of diseased subjects, others from healthy subjects to which disease features( [...] blisters, sores, growths, rashes) were skilfully applied with wax and pigments. During the 19th century, <b>moulage</b> evolved into to three-dimensional, realistic representations of diseased parts of the human body. These can be seen in many European medical museums, notably the Spitzner collection currently in Brussels, the Charite Hospital museum in Berlin and the Gordon Museum of Pathology at Guy's Hospital in London UK. A comprehensive book monograph on moulages is [...] "Diseases in Wax: the History of Medical Moulage" [...] by Thomas Schnalke (Author) the director of the Charite Museum and Kathy Spatschek (Translator). In the 19th century <b>moulage</b> was taken of medical patients for educational purposes. The prepared model was painted to mimic the original disease. Nowadays anatomicals model are an important instrument of education of human anatomy in department of anatomy and biological sciences in medical schools.|$|E

50|$|The Palace's {{basement}} {{houses the}} Gypsothèque de Strasbourg, {{also known as}} Musée des <b>moulages</b> (plaster cast museum). This classical cast collection was initiated with {{the founding of the}} Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität in 1872 by Adolf Michaelis, a distinguished classical scholar and art history pioneer. Next to casts of works like Harmodius and Aristogeiton, Apollo Belvedere, Aphrodite of Cnidus and the metopes of the Parthenon, the museum also displays casts of works by Antoine Bourdelle. The collection is the second largest cast collection in France and the largest university cast collection of France. The collections were moved into the Palace's basement in 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, and have stayed there since, although plans have periodically been made to move them into a separate building.|$|R
40|$|I {{will prepare}} {{a new chapter}} and draft another for my second book. “Flowers of Evil, Corporeal Waxworks: Orientalist Curiosity Cabinets,” enlists {{research}} materials I garnered from archives such as the Bibliothèque Nationale Française and the Musée de <b>Moulages</b> at the Hôpital Saint Louis, including medical treatises and images of artistically rendered wax mold models of the diseased body from {{the late nineteenth century}} through the postwar period. These artifacts, although presented as medical teaching materials, literally and figuratively also place on exhibit the underside of official French narratives and policies concerning virtue and legitimacy. The secret fantasies and anxieties regarding vice, the blossoming of forbidden desires, and exoticism are projected onto bodies outside the respectable spaces of bourgeois life, in consonance with poet Charles Baudelaire’s conflation of beauty and horror. These insights complement a second chapter I will draft, “A Dangerous Romance: Transgressing Cultural Spectacles of Gender and Nation. ...|$|R
