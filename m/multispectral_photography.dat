The use of MSP, acquired at three different dates of which two were in the growing season of maize, is evaluated for land evaluation of four study areas in Limag e. The areas contain the three main soil types of the region: alluvial soils of the Allier Low Terrace, brown calcareous soils of the hills and black soils of the Marais. MSP imagery of July and August showed reduced growth {{at the start of}} the growing season on black soils of the Marais as well as a strong effect of slight drought on soils in stony gullies of the Allier Low terrace and on shallow soils of the hills. Limitations for maize growth were found to be in the domains of water availability, nutrient availability, resistance to compaction, workability and oxygen availability.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{results of}} {{an evaluation of the}} spectral signatures of vegetation communities recognised on <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography,</b> at scales of 1 : 15, 000 and 1 : 5, 000, in North West Queensland, Australia, with reference to specific environmental parameters, notably bedrock mineralization, and microdensitometer optical density measurements. Detailed ground-truth information obtained for the evaluation included plant species frequency recording and plant and soil sampling along a series of transects located across known mineralized zones and across spectral anomalies detected on the photography. Overlays of the spectral signature units, including those subjected to enhancement techniques, were prepared and correlated with the ground-truth data and a number of microdensitometer scan lines measuring the optical density within each of the eight spectral bands of the <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography.</b> The spectral signatures of vegetation, and especially the distinct spectral signature of geobotanically anomalous plant communities forming surface expression of mineralized bedrock and related geochemical soil anomalies, are best displayed on false colour infra-red photography which covers the visible and near infra-red part of the spectrum in which plant reflectivity is most sensitive, consequently yielding most information. Ground-truth investigations, confirming the interpretation of infra-red spectral signatures, reveal the composition of anomalous and background vegetation units and indicatethe influence of the mineral status of the soil, relief, drainage and lithology on plant species distribution. Over mineralized terrain, higher reflectivity in all spectral bands and especially the true colour green, panchromatic green and false colour infra-red are recorded by microdensitometer optical density measurements which positively correlate with the above average concentrations of metal in the indicator plants and surface soils. In the semi-arid environment of North West Queensland, the use of <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography,</b> in conjunction with detailed field studies, is shown to have application in the study of vegetation associations and plant conmunities forming surface expression of characteristic ground conditions.

40|$|Large-scale {{applications}} of remote sensing {{for the purpose}} of preparing crop estimates, natural resource inventories, disaster assessments, etc. for a given geographic region will, in general, involve questions of sampling, since complete coverage of the total geographic region and subsequent analysis of data collected with complete coverage appear technically and economically infeasible. This is true regardless of whether an aircraft, or a satellite is involved, and It applies equally to <b>photography,</b> <b>multispectral</b> measurements, radar, etc. Thus, even if remote sensing provided completely accurate data, estimates (of crop acreage, natural resources, extent of disaster, etc.) for the total region under study will be subject to an error, the so-called error of estimate.

40|$|The {{simplified}} reflectance model {{described earlier}} (Clevers, 1988 b) for estimating {{leaf area index}} (LAI) is further simplified. In this model the nearinfrared reflectance was corrected for soil background (in particular differences in soil moisture content) and subsequently used for estimating LAI by applying the inverse of a special case of the Mitscherlich function. In the specific situation that {{the ratio of the}} reflectances of bare soil in the red and near-infrared is constant for a given soil background, the corrected near-infrared reflectance is now ascertained as a weighted difference of total measured near-infrared and red reflectances (socalled WDVI = weighted difference vegetation index). The validity of this approach is confirmed by simulations with the SAIL model. The above concept was tested at the experimental farm of the Agricultural University Wageningen, by using reflectance factors measured in field trials by means of <b>multispectral</b> aerial <b>photography.</b> The soil type at the experimental farm yielded constant ratios between green, red, and near-infrared reflectances independent of soil moisture content (that is, as a function of time). The difference between measured near-infrared and red reflectances provided a satisfactory approximation of the corrected near-infrared reflectance. The estimation of LAI by this corrected near-infrared reflectance for real field data yielded good results in this study, resulting in the ascertainment of treatment effects with larger precision than by means of the LAI measured in the field by conventional field sampling methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{project set}} out with two main aims. The first {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether large scale <b>multispectral</b> aerial <b>photography</b> could be used to successfully survey and monitor urban wildlife habitats. The second objective was to investigate whether this data source could be used to predict population numbers of selected species expected to be found in a particular habitat type. Panchromatic, colour and colour infra-red, 1 : 2500 scale aerial photographs, taken in 1981 and 1984, were used. For the orderly extraction of information from the imagery, an urban wildlife habitat classification was devised. This was based on classifications already in use in urban environments by the Nature Conservancy Council. Pilot tests identified that the colour infra-red imagery provided the most accurate results about urban wildlife habitats in the study area of the Blackbrook Valley, Dudley. Both the 1981 and 1984 colour infra-red photographs were analysed and information was obtained about the type, extent and distribution of habitats. In order to investigate whether large scale aerial photographs could be used to predict likely animal population numbers in urban environments, it was decided to limit the investigation to the possible prediction of bird population numbers in Saltwells Local Nature Reserve. A good deal of research has already been completed into the development of models to predict breeding bird population numbers in woodland habitats. These models were analysed to determine whether they could be used successfully with data extracted from the aerial photographs. The projects concluded that 1 : 2500 scale colour infra-red photographs can provide very useful and very detailed information about the wildlife habitats in an urban area. Such imagery can also provide habitat area data to be used with population predictive models of woodland breeding birds. Using the aerial photographs, further investigations into the relationship between area of habitat and the breeding of individual bird species were inconclusive and need further research...|$|R

40|$|Invasive plants pose {{a serious}} threat to ecological, {{environmental}} and cultural values of infested regions and can be costly to control. Grass invasions are particularly concerning because they can alter wildfire regimes and change ecosystem function and structure at a global scale. Mapping, monitoring, and understanding invasive species ecology sufficiently to identify habitats prone to invasion are important for containment of the invasive plant. To this effect, remote sensing and spatial information science can be useful. In arid and semi-arid rangelands worldwide African perennial Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) has been introduced to improve pasture. However, it has become contentious because it can rapidly invade and transform non-target landscapes. Most research into Buffel grass relates to its agricultural uses, and {{little is known about the}} invasive ecology of the species. There is a need to consolidate existing knowledge, as well as map the current distribution, model potential distribution and improve efficiency in the detection of new infestations in remote landscapes. This research addresses these needs by developing and applying techniques from the spatial sciences to map and model Buffel grass distribution in remote, arid Australia. For controversial invasive species like Buffel grass, awareness about the ecological dangers of allowing spread to continue unchecked is important. Here, a new, comprehensive review is presented of the ecology, distribution and biodiversity impacts of Buffel grass when behaving as an invasive species. Importantly, this review also lays foundations for research into localised habitat requirements, setting the scene for all subsequent components of this research. The review reveals that temperature is a primary limitation to distribution at a global scale, soil texture may be a significant habitat parameter at localised scales and disturbance is required for seedling emergence. It is strongly suspected that Buffel grass fuelled fires are responsible for declining numbers of characteristic arid plants, the Saguaro Cactus (Arizona, USA) and the River Red Gum (Australia), and worldwide, arid landscapes stand out as requiring urgent control. The distribution of Buffel grass in invaded landscapes in arid southern Australia is not explicitly known. Over 3100 km of South Australian roads were surveyed to document current Buffel grass distribution in collaborative work with government. The grass was found to be wide ranging along major highways, but was mostly only sparsely distributed. Empirical modelling of species’ distribution helps identify local environments that may be prone to invasion, and is becoming an increasingly important step in effective management planning. Buffel grass roadside survey data were used in an exploratory regression analysis to identify environmental parameters of the species’ distribution across regional South Australia. Roadside populations were recorded separately from populations away from the road on adjacent land and considered as separate dependant variables for predictive modelling. The models return strong results and on the basis of these we make management recommendations that containment of propagules along roadsides will be the most important factor in preventing spread and that where roads intersect drainage lines should be focal points for monitoring. Remote sensing presents as an ideal mode for mapping and monitoring invasion as it affords a landscape scale view and can be cost effective compared with laborious field work. However, it is challenging to implement because of the overall similarity of the spectra of different grasses and variability of Buffel grass stands, and photosynthetic status within stands over space and time. In this thesis, Buffel grass discrimination is trialled using high spatial resolution satellite imagery and aerial <b>photography.</b> <b>Multispectral</b> (eight-band) satellite imagery (2 m GSD) namely, Worldview- 2 was found to effectively map dense infestations, but for early detection of emerging infestations, it is shown that aerial imagery spatial resolution no coarser than 5 - 6 cm GSD is required. Presented in this thesis are tools needed to assess, monitor, predict and ultimately mitigate Buffel grass spread in arid Australia, including maps of present distribution, techniques for mapping and monitoring invasion over time, and an understanding of the species ecology as an invader to predict regions vulnerable to infestation. The methodology for roadside survey which makes the data more applicable to landscape-wide predictive habitat modelling could be adopted for any species where roads are considered a vector for spread. The research has important implications for Buffel grass management in regional arid Australia, and also for understanding the exotic distribution of Buffel grass worldwide. For detection of emerging Buffel grass infestations at a regional scale, aerial survey is recommended. Use of satellite imagery for monitoring of larger infestations is one area for future research.

30|$|At {{the heart}} of bureaucratic {{practice}} during Warring States and early Imperial China were regular, small acts of accountancy in which objects and people were marked so that their movements could be kept track of, their quality checked and their numbers marshalled. In the mausoleum complex of the Qin Shihuang (259 - 210 bc, the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty), the longer texts and shorter inscribed marks found on the bronze weapons of the Terracotta Army are reasonably well known, and such information helps us to understand aspects of Qin craft organisation and logistics at this crucial period of Chinese state formation. This paper’s modest starting point is a study of two further, less well-known ink inscriptions found on crossbow triggers from Terracotta Army Pit 1. Using <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography,</b> digital microscopy and Raman analysis, we uncover evidence of further marks on the same two triggers that suggest a similar pattern of ‘matching’ marks {{as suggested by the}} incised evidence. We also identify the black substance used to make the marks as a soot-based ink. Spatial analysis of both the inked and incised trigger marks then provides wider context for how such marking practices amongst Qin bronze-workers may have operated.|$|E
30|$|Multispectral imaging is {{increasingly}} important as an approach in archaeological and heritage materials science and for object-scale assessments in related subject {{areas such as}} conservation, digital humanities and art history [21, 22]. A full imaging survey of all the bronze weapons from the Terracotta Army pits—using one or more multispectral scanners spanning the visible, near- and short-wave infrared for example—is highly desirable in future. However, for the immediate and preliminary purposes of this paper, we have explored the potential of <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography</b> for characterising existing ink marks on the weapons and potentially identifying new ones, especially {{with a view to}} cheap flexible usage in a variety of laboratory and on-site settings. To achieve this, a specially-designed camera (Fujifilm IS Pro) was used with a sensor responsive to an unusually wide UV, visible and near infrared (VNIR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum (approximately 380 – 1000  nm). The following workflow was used for capture and processing: (1) an ordinary RGB photograph was taken by applying a UV/IR-cut ‘hot’ filter to the camera; (2) IR-pass filters were used to capture four infrared images of increasing spectral range. Then (3) slight adjustment of each image for tonal range and exposure, then creation of an image stack of all acquired images. (4) Because of the different focal lengths that pertain to different infrared filters, small spatial adjustments were made to each image in the stack to ensure accurate co-registration. (5) The background of all images was masked out to ensure it played no role in subsequent multivariate image processing. (6) An orthogonal transformation (ordinary PCA) of the image stack was conducted, and (7) a false colour composite produced using the two most insightful principal components. Given the preliminary nature of the sample, we have not formalised a predictive model discriminating ink versus non-ink surfaces, and have opted for PCA as a most widely-known ordination method, rather than cross-comparing many different approaches to multivariate discrimination. We also explored the potential of UV-excited florescence (via a UV torch and lamp) to study ink marks, corrosion and other variability on the weapon surfaces, but this proved to be of marginal added value. We studied six triggers in this manner, but focused on two that were already known to have one ink mark each. As a complement to the above results from <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography,</b> and alongside closer-range digital microscopy (with a Dino-Lite USB digital microscope), Raman spectroscopy was also performed with a Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope, using a 514  nm Nd:YAG laser for the full spectral range from 100 to 4500  cm− 1. Cosmic noise was removed, and manual baseline correction and normalisation applied. Finally, we mapped all types of crossbow marks across the easternmost trenches of Pit 1 in order to place the rare ink inscriptions in a wider context provided by the spatial distribution of incised crossbow marks that are found in larger numbers.|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing uses many {{different}} types of imagery for interpretational purposes. <b>Multispectral</b> <b>photography</b> has shown to be of especially high interpretational value. During remote sensing studies which are done “in situ”, determining spectral reflectance coefficients of any given object is crucial. Spectrometers are usually used in acquiring such data. The authors of such a study have used an equipment set consisting of a digital video camera and an electronically tunable filter. The set is designed to work in the visible range 400 - 720 nm. The matrix in this camera has a resolution of 1392 x 1040 Px. It is capable of binning (the joining of pixels) 2 x 2, 4 x 4 and 8 x 8, which allows for the increase in sensitivity at the loss of resolution. Monochromatic images acquired by the camera have a radiometric resolution of 12 bits. The images are saved into the controlling computers memory by means of the IEEE- 1394 FireWire interface. The camera has a fully automated exposure mechanism together with an ROI function. The electronically tunable filter allows for the acquisition of images of a 10 nm band, with a 0. 1 nm step, within the given spectral range. Special software had been designed to control the set (the camera and filter), which allows for the acquisition of any chosen sequence of images within the entire visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as their primary processing. On the basis of a sequence of images, the spectral reflection coefficient can be determined for any objects within the scene. The image sequences can be acquired in laboratory conditions, as well as during fieldwork. The article describes the methodology in acquiring imagery using the video camera and the electronically tunable filter, as well as the determining of the spectral reflection coefficients. Additionally a comparison will be made between the reflectio...|$|E
40|$|Routine {{monitoring}} of algae in inland waters in southern Africa {{is a critical}} element in assessing the efficacy of eutrophication management options. Several authors have indicated that single point samples are not necessarily representative of conditions throughout the water body and some have suggested remote sensing {{as a means of}} overcoming this problem. Remote sensing of algae normally involves deriving the empirical relationship between radiance detected at a sensor, and contact sensed chlorophyll concentrations. Quantification of, or compensation for, contributions to the upwelling radiance other than that light reflected by the algae is critical for this approach. In southern Africa these contributions arise primarily from atmospheric effects and from scattering by sediments in the water. A review of the atmospheric correction models suggested that a cosine sun angle correction followed by dark pixel subtraction is the most feasible method to compensate for the former effects. Studies of the changes in upwelling radiance induced by addition of sediment to algal cultures indicated that subtraction of reflectance at ~ 665 nm from that at ~ 700 nm, may provide a means of compensating for the scattering by sediments. The disadvantage of this approach is that few sensor systems have narrow spectral bands centred at these wavelengths. Investigations {{of the nature of the}} reflectance from 5 algal species indicated that all had similar reflectance spectra, but the blue-green genera had a smaller peak at ~ 650 nm. Chlorophyll absorption at ~ 665 nm was evident by lower reflectance at this point, but the alga Microcystis sp. did not conform to the conceptual model of reflectance, in that reflectance at 665 nm was higher at increased cell density.. Spectra of natural waters confirmed the results obtained in the laboratory. Reflectance at ~ 700 nm showed the largest changes with increasing chlorophyll concentration and also had the highest correlations to chlorophyll concentrations. However, due to the strong absorption of these wavelengths by water, this reflectance peak only occurred when sufficient cells were found in the upper layers of water. Use of these wavelengths in remote sensing models should therefore be restricted to highly eutrophied waters. Although the reflectance spectra of different algae were similar, the amount of light scattered by each species (measured as turbidity) differed for any given chlorophyll concentration. This appeared to be due to the colonial nature of the cells and means that empirical models will be unique to the species on which they were developed. Comparisons of <b>multispectral</b> <b>photography</b> (MSP) and LANDSAT MSS imagery indicated the MSP data had higher correlations with chlorophyll concentrations than did the MSS data. Chlorophyll simulations from a test set of data using ordinary multiple regression showed that the MSP imagery had mean errors of 7. 3 M 9 /I, while that for the MSS imagery was 7. 4 M 9 /I. Similar tests using the canonical procedure produced larger mean errors of 9 M 9 /I and 12 M 9 /I for the MSP and MSS data respectively. This was due to the fact that the canonical procedure is not suitable for the spectral band widths of these sensors. In spite of similar simulation accuracies, the MSS imagery produced very patchy synoptic views. This was due to the lower variance (radiometric resolution) in the LANDSAT MSS data. This appears to be the most important criterion for accurate chlorophyll mapping in inland waters. Development of a single multidate algorithm for southern Africa is not yet feasible, and routine {{monitoring of}} chlorophyll using these techniques is impractical. However acceptable chlorophyll maps are possible if the model is recalibrated for each occasion and the sensor used has a high radiometric resolution. ...|$|E
