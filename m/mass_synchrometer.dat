40|$|Dedicated to H. -J. Kluge on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday anniversary - JÃ¼rgen Kluge Special IssueAt Princeton in the 1960 's, L. G. Smith invented an instrument of astonishing accuracy and rapid measurement time, derived from his so-called <b>mass</b> <b>synchrometer.</b> Using the same principle, a radiofrequency spectrometer was constructed in Orsay to measure masses of the shortest-lived nuclides at Cern's Isolde facility. Smith's spectrometer is now a museum piece, making the Orsay version (since baptized, MISTRAL) the sole example of such an instrument and the only one ever to be used on-line. Here we report on a measurement of the 65 ms half-life, N=Z nuclide $^{ 74 }Rb$ performed with MISTRAL. The measured mass excess of - 51944 (117) keV is compared with that obtained by ISOLTRAP, since independent measurements using different techniques assure a healthy gene pool for the recommended masses of the atomic mass evaluation. The nuclide $^{ 74 }Rb$ is the heaviest for which a precise mass is of importance for the so-called Wigner energy. A discussion is presented concerning this Wigner energy, perhaps the last component of nuclear mass formulas resisting microscopic treatment...|$|E
