500|$|Amargasaurus was {{discovered}} in sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation, which {{dates back to the}} Barremian and late Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous. A herbivore, it shared its environment with at least three other sauropod genera, which might have exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. Amargasaurus probably fed at <b>mid-height,</b> as shown by the orientation of its inner ear and the articulation of its neck vertebrae, which suggest a habitual position of the snout [...] above the ground and a maximum height of [...] Within the Sauropoda, Amargasaurus is most closely related to the Late Jurassic genera Dicraeosaurus, Brachytrachelopan and Suuwassea. Together, these genera form the family Dicraeosauridae, which differs from other sauropods in showing shorter necks and smaller body sizes.|$|E
500|$|F-84E: J35-A-17D engine, Sperry AN/APG-30 radar-ranging gunsight, {{retractable}} attachments for RATO bottles, inboard wing hardpoints made [...] "wet" [...] {{to permit}} carrying an additional pair of 230U.S. gal (870L) fuel tanks. Most aircraft were retrofitted with F-84G-style reinforced canopies. The fuselage was stretched 15"; the canopy was lengthened 8", the canopy frame was lengthened 12" [...] (accounting for another 4"), and a 3" [...] splice panel was added aft of the canopy. The stretch {{was not done}} to enlarge the cockpit but rather to enable a larger fuel tank, provide additional space for equipment under the canopy behind the pilot's seat, and to improve aerodynamics. This can be distinguished from earlier models {{by the presence of}} two fuel vents on ventral rear fuselage, the added radar in the nose splitter, and the pitot tube was moved downward from <b>mid-height</b> in the splitter (as on the F-84D) to clear the radar installation. 843 built. F-84E 49-2031 was a test aircraft for air-to-air missiles. F-84E 50-1115 was a test aircraft for the FICON project.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{investigation}} performed by Yu and Tan (2014), half of minimum reinforcements in the N 4 model, which were defined by ACI 318, {{were added to the}} <b>mid-heights</b> of the exterior beams. In Fig.  25 b, the load displacement response of N 2, N 4, N 5 and N 6 were plotted. Increasing the beam height significantly increases the flexural and arch action resistance of the beams. However, the deeper beams lead to the fracture of longitudinal bars {{in the early stages of}} loading and consequently decrease the catenary action of the sub-assemblage. However, adding longitudinal reinforcement in the mid heights of the beam section also has little effect on flexural and arching actions. Instead, it improves the tensile resistance of the beam and thereupon increases catenary action of the substructure.|$|R
40|$|Patterns of nest {{placement}} {{and its relationship}} to nest success in the Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus) were studied in populations breeding in New York and Kansas. Data were augmented with information on nest placement in other open-nesting tyrannids in order to examine the hypothesis that these flycatchers place their nests chiefly so as to conceal them from predators. Nesting success was significantly greater in New York than in Kansas but was relatively high in both populations, as is apparently true of North American breeding flycatchers in general. Geographic variation in nest placement in the Eastern Kingbird was relatively small and statistical comparisons of failed and successful nests indicated that nests placed at <b>mid-heights</b> in the tree, and about midway between the center of the tree and canopy edge, were most successful. These nest sites were also the most commonly used sites. Increased vegetative cover around the nest and a greater number of supporting branches for the nest were also associated with success, and it is their interaction with nest height and distance from the canopy edge that is apparently most important in determining success. Most tyrant flycatchers nest several meters or more above the ground, and interspecific variation in nest placement matches the range of sites used by Eastern Kingbirds. Aggressive nest defense is apparently characteristic of the family, and average nest height is also positively correlated with length of the nestling period. These facts support the predator-avoidance hypothesis and suggest that nest placement habits and aggressive nest defense are means by which open nesting birds can reduce rates of nestling mortality...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of beam-to-column connections under earthquake-type loading {{has been studied}} in the past by testing isolated interior or exterior connections. In such tests, the beams are allowed to elongate freely when subjected to large deformation reversal. In a real building, however, the beams may be partially restrained against such elongation. The current design procedures which have been developed {{on the basis of}} tests on isolated connections, therefore, ignore the effects of continuity and beam elongation on the performance of connections. In this investigation, the {{behavior of}} connections was studied by testing indeterminate frame subassemblies under earthquake-type loading. Six half-scale multiple-connection subassemblies were tested. Each subassembly consisted of a two-bay frame isolated at the column <b>mid-heights.</b> Five single connection subassemblies were also treated to correlate the behavior of connections in multiple-connection subassemblies with the behavior of connections observed by testing isolated connections. Tests have shown that restriction to elongation of beams in indeterminate systems resulted in axial compression in beams which in turn had a significant effect on the performance of connections. The joint shear increased in both interior and exterior connections and the column-to-beam flexural strength ratio decreased. The energy dissipation was not affected by the continuity, but the lateral load resistance increased significantly. The stiffness degradation was more controlled and gradual in the indeterminate subassemblies compared to that observed in isolated connections. Based on the observed mechanism of lateral load resistance and the observed behavior of connections, a procedure is presented to account for the presence of axial compression in the main beams in the design of beam-to-column connections...|$|R

2500|$|The most {{perceptible}} {{element of}} de Forest's design aesthetic in the Deanery is his stenciling, a technique for which his Indian workshop was known. Geometric designs were stenciled {{on the walls}} or on the ceilings throughout the house, as, for example, on {{the ceiling of the}} Blue Room, as an upper border in the dining room, a <b>mid-height</b> border in the corridor between the studies, and as an upper border and on the ceiling in Mamie Gwinn's study. Even the floors of the dining room were stenciled, as Thomas noted in a letter to de Forest: [...] "You remember it was so with my dining room. In four years the stenciling under the wax which we put on the floors was entirely worn off." [...] Several pieces of furniture were also transformed into [...] "art furniture" [...] by the addition of stenciled designs, possibly as a cost-saving measure, as the 1894–1896 renovations cost over $14,000.|$|E
60|$|And there, {{straight}} before us, {{lies the}} city, softly couched against the hill-side that faces the southern sea, and enjoying her 'kayf' in the sinking sun. Her lower zone, {{though in the}} Temperates, is sub-tropical: Tuscany {{is found in the}} <b>mid-heights,</b> while it is Scotland in the bleak wolds about Pico Ruivo (6,100 feet) and the Paül (Moorland) da Serra. I now see some change since 1865. East of the yellow-washed, brown-bound fort of São Thiago Minor, the island patron, rises a huge white pile, or rather piles, the Lazaretto, with its three-arched bridge spanning the Wady Gonçalo Ayres. The fears of the people forbid its being used, although separated from them by a mile of open space. This over-caution at Madeira, as at Tenerife, often causes great inconvenience to foreign residents; moreover, it is directly opposed to treaty. There is a neat group, meat-market, abattoir, and fish-market--where there is ne'er a flat fish save those who buy--near those dreariest of academic groves, the Praça Academica, at the east end proper, or what an Anglo-Indian would term the 'native town.' Here we see the joint mouth of the torrent-beds Santa Luzia and João Gomes which has more than once deluged Funchal. Timid Funchalites are expecting another flood: the first was in 1803, the second in 1842, and thus they suspect a cycle of forty years. [Footnote: The guide-books make every twenty-fifth year a season of unusual rain, the last being 1879-80.] The lately repaired Sé (cathedral) {{in the heart of the}} mass is conspicuous for its steeple of azulejos, or varnished tiles, and for the ruddy painting of the black basaltic façade, contrasting less violently with the huge splotches of whitewash, the magpie-suit in which the church-architecture of the Madeiras and the Canaries delights. The São Francisco convent, with its skull-lined walls, and the foundations of its proposed successor, the law courts, have disappeared from the space adjoining the main square; this chief promenade, the Praça da Constituição, is grown with large magnolias, vinhaticos, or native mahogany (Persea Indica), and til-trees (Oreodaphne foetens), and has been supplemented by the dwarf flower-garden (Jardim Novo) lately opened to the west. The latter, I regret to say, caused the death of many noble old trees, including a fine palm; but Portuguese, let me repeat, have scant sympathy with such growth. The waste ground now belonging to the city will be laid out as a large public garden with fountains and band-stands. Finally, that soundly abused 'Tower of Babel,' alias 'Benger's Folly,' built in 1796, has in the evening of its days been utilised by conversion into a signal-tower. So far so good.|$|R
