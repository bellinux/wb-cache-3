5|$|In general however, downstep is <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> than in Supyire; {{a similar}} {{phenomenon}} {{is found in}} Palaka, Tagwana, and Djimini.|$|E
5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used in the body of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E

[...] A {{potentially}} <b>more</b> serious, <b>widespread</b> form of TB is called [...] "disseminated tuberculosis", also known as miliary tuberculosis. Miliary TB currently makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary cases.|$|R
5|$|Coal balls may {{be found}} in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are <b>more</b> <b>widespread,</b> both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Equal {{franchise}} {{was eventually}} won {{with the passing}} of the Representation of the People Act 1928. This was not achieved through a matter of course, but through a constant campaign of organised pressure. The NUWSS reorganised into the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), taking on a broader range of issues to secure <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> support.|$|E
50|$|The lawsuit {{received}} {{extensive coverage}} in national venues such as The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, CNN.com, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Advocate, and many <b>more,</b> bringing <b>widespread</b> mainstream {{attention to the}} existence of, {{and the need for}} equal rights for, intersex people.|$|R

5|$|Medieval and Renaissance {{surgeons}} {{continued the}} practice of trepanation for head injury. In the Middle Ages, physicians further described head injury symptoms and the term concussion became <b>more</b> <b>widespread.</b> Concussion symptoms were first described systematically in the 16thcentury by Berengario da Carpi.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} and riboswitches {{are thought}} to be evolutionarily ancient due to their wide-scale distribution in distantly-related organisms. It has been proposed that, in the RNA world, RNA thermosensors would have been responsible for temperature-dependent regulation of other RNA molecules. RNA thermometers in modern organisms may be molecular fossils which could hint at a previously <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> importance in an RNA world.|$|E
5|$|Several species {{sometimes}} {{suffer from}} a wasting condition caused by bacteria in the genus Vibrio; however, a <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> wasting disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).|$|E
50|$|An AIRMET, or Airmen's Meteorological Information, is a concise {{description}} of weather phenomena that are occurring or may occur (forecast) along an air route {{that may affect}} aircraft safety. Compared to SIGMETs, AIRMETs cover less severe weather: moderate turbulence and icing, sustained surface winds of 30 knots or <b>more,</b> or <b>widespread</b> restricted visibility.|$|R
40|$|Data {{science is}} gaining more and <b>more</b> and <b>widespread</b> attention, but no {{consensus}} viewpoint on what data science is has emerged. As a new science, its objects {{of study and}} scientific issues should not be covered by established sciences. Data in cyberspace have formed what we call datanature. In the present paper, data science {{is defined as the}} science of exploring datanature...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>more</b> {{currently}} <b>widespread</b> used terms include garbage pile, garbage dump, waste pile, waste dump, and waste/garbage disposal site. The material (waste, garbage, refuse, rubbish, etc.) may {{be placed}} on a pile/mound on level ground or in a hole/pit dug into the ground which may be subsequently covered over with other material, often for sanitary, aesthetic or land reclamation reasons.|$|R
5|$|The Delichon martins have simple flight {{calls of}} one to three notes. In the two <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> species these have a {{distinctive}} buzzing quality. The male's song is a short simple ripple, perhaps less musical than that given by other swallows.|$|E
5|$|Trade between tribes became <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> {{during the}} Mariposa phase, and the diet {{continued}} to improve. Paiutes, Miwok, and Monos visited {{the area to}} trade; one major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern California.|$|E
5|$|Type I is <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> in Doberman Pinscher, but is {{as common}} in the Shetland Sheepdog as the Scottish Terrier. The {{condition}} appears in most breeds to some extent, but other breeds with an increased risk include the Golden Retriever, German Shepherd Dog, Basset Hound and Manchester Terrier.|$|E
50|$|Dr Hughes' son, Dr Simon H C Hughes, is {{a medical}} {{physicist}} whose work on CT and MRI scanners helped reduce their cost, making such equipment <b>more</b> available and <b>widespread.</b>|$|R
50|$|After a brief {{occupation}} by {{the forces}} of the Bishop of Münster (1672-74), Overijssel received a new form of government which granted the stadtholders <b>more</b> power. <b>Widespread</b> resistance against the increased power throughout the provinces eventually {{led to the formation of}} the Batavian Republic in 1795. A centralist government arose and the Netherlands was organised into a series of départements, based on those used by revolutionary France.|$|R
25|$|More {{efficient}} chemical testing allowed aquarists {{to understand}} the chemical properties of aquariums. By the 1980s, a biologically-based {{understanding of how to}} maintain an artificial ocean environment brought <b>more</b> successful and <b>widespread</b> marine fishkeeping.|$|R
5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> among insects {{because of}} size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{show that}} up to 500,000people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 {{individuals}} being considered to be at high risk. Lahars {{pose a threat to}} the nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchina, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> effects, including the potential closure of Bogotá's airport due to ashfall.|$|E
5|$|Following Erica's heavy rains, it was {{feared that}} the already {{existing}} dengue fever epidemic would become <b>more</b> <b>widespread.</b> Prior to Erica, there were already 437 cases of dengue fever in 2003 alone. The risk for leptospirosis was also increased by Erica. High winds and strong rains resulted in damages of at least US$15 million, particularly to schools. Two fatalities total were reported {{as a result of}} Erica. The name Erica was retired after the season.|$|E
50|$|It also {{identified}} that <b>more</b> substantial and <b>widespread</b> benefits for States, shipowners and seafarers {{could be expected}} to arise from the increased safety at sea, which was identified as the core objective of e-navigation.|$|R
50|$|More {{efficient}} chemical testing allowed aquarists {{to understand}} the chemical properties of aquariums. By the 1980s, a biologically-based {{understanding of how to}} maintain an artificial ocean environment brought <b>more</b> successful and <b>widespread</b> marine fishkeeping.|$|R
50|$|The 1992 Los Angeles riots {{which took}} place from April 29-May 4, 1992 {{contributes}} to <b>more</b> social unrest. <b>Widespread</b> looting, assault, murder and arson become evident. The incident begins {{the downfall of the}} economy.|$|R
5|$|Further east, Ibn Battuta {{traveled}} from Southeast Asia to Khanbaliq (Beijing) in China. Although the Muslim leaders there extended him a warm welcome, they {{advised him to}} leave the city soon. A civil war had caused the Khan to flee the city, and riots were becoming more and <b>more</b> <b>widespread.</b> Meanwhile, T'aigo Wangsa, a Korean Buddhist monk, traveled to China to receive training under the guidance of Buddhist leader Shih-wu. T'aigo later founded the T'aigo sect of Korean Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Jagannadh {{acquired}} the satellite {{rights of the}} film during his negotiations with the film's producers for 50 million. He wanted to rotate the film screening on various channels, at appropriate times, {{in a bid to}} gain <b>more</b> <b>widespread</b> viewership and recoup his investment. Studio N {{acquired the}} film's television broadcast rights in March 2012 for 66 million, which were later sold to Gemini TV. The film's DVD and Blu Ray discs were produced by Universal Home Entertainment and were released in May 2012.|$|E
25|$|Cassiodorus's {{legacy is}} quietly profound. Before the {{founding}} of Vivarium, the copying of manuscripts had been a task reserved for either inexperienced or physically infirm devotees, and was performed at the whim of literate monks. Through the influence of Cassiodorus, the monastic system adopted a <b>more</b> vigorous, <b>widespread,</b> and regular approach to reproducing documents within the monastery. This approach {{to the development of}} the monastic lifestyle was perpetuated especially through German religious institutions.|$|R
