And the present experiments were undertaken to elucidate the connection of adsorption, of plant nutrition, particularly phosphate and ammonium. In the case of mixed together with extremely different soil of adsorptive coeffient, New nature of adsorption inclined toward the properties of soil with high nutrient adsorptive coefficient, to the soil of similar nutrient adsorptive coefficient its nature were arithmetic mean of <b>mixed</b> together <b>soils.</b> Adsorptive amounts of phosphate were relative to adsorptive amounts of ammonium by <b>mixing</b> <b>soil.</b> Its correlation coefficient was 0. 966.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a fundamental study {{to explore the}} role of particle shape in the shear behaviour of mixtures of sand and fine particles (fines) through macro-scale and grain-scale laboratory experiments together with interpretations {{in the framework of}} critical state soil mechanics and conceptual micromechanics models. Two non-plastic fines of distinct shape (angular crushed silica fines and rounded glass beads) were added to two uniform quartz sands (Toyoura sand and Fujian sand) to produce four binary mixtures. Laboratory quantification of particle shape and size was conducted for both fines and sands, and a series of undrained triaxial tests was performed to investigate the overall response of the mixed soils at different percentages of fines. One of the significant findings is that the critical state friction angle of a <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> is affected not only by the shape of coarse particles but also by the shape of fine particles, and this shape effect is coupled with fines content. When a small amount of crushed silica fines was added to either Toyoura sand or Fujian sand, the critical state friction angle increased slightly with fines content; however, when a small amount of glass beads was added to either sand, the critical state friction angle decreased markedly with an increase in fines content. A new index, termed combined roundness, is proposed to account for the coupled effects of particle shape and fines content. The study also provides evidence showing that the undrained shear behaviour and collapsibility of a <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> are closely related to the shape of its constituent particles: a <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> containing rounded fines tends to exhibit higher susceptibility to collapse than a <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> containing angular fines of the same percentage, and this tendency will become more evident if the base sand is also composed of rounded particles. In addition, the study provides the first experimental evidence showing that the quasi-steady state marks a transition from a metastable to a stable microstructure. It is postulated that in a binary mixture composed of fine and coarse particles that are both rounded, the particles favour rolling, thus yielding a microstructure that is unstable, whereas in a binary mixture composed of fine and coarse particles that are both angular, the particles favour sliding rather than rolling, thus leading to a much more stable structure and response. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The article discusses the features of earthworm trophic-metabolic activity in the afforested remediated site (Western Donbass, Ukraine) with different options of <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> bulk. Western Donbass is the large center of coal mining located in South-Western part of Ukraine. High rates of technical development in this region lead to surface subsidence, rising and outbreak of high-mineralized groundwater, and formation of dump pits of mine wastes. Remediated area is represented by the basement of mine wastes covered by 5 options of artificial <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> with different depth of horizons. The following tree species were planted on top of artificial soil: Acer platanoides L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., and Juniperus virginiana L. The main practical tasks were to define on the quantitative basis the buffer capacity of artificial <b>mixed</b> <b>soil</b> and earthworm excreta in relation to copper contamination and to compare its immobilization capacity in conditions of artificial forest plants in the territory of Western Donbass. It was proved that earthworm excreta had a great influence on soil immobilization capacity (particularly, on soil buffering to copper) which increased for excreta in the following range: humus-free loess loam – top humus layer of ordinary chernozem. Immobilization efficiency of copper by earthworm excreta from ordinary chernozem bulk compared with baseline (ordinary chernozem) was significantly higher. It should be noted that trophic-metabolic activity of earthworms plays very important role as a zoogenic factor which restricts movement of excess chemicals, maintains stability and increases resistance to soil contamination, in particular, with copper.
