500|$|Bowie {{was given}} {{a role in the}} 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly {{received}} by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named [...] "Absolute Beginners", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits [...] "Day-In, Day-Out" [...] (his 60th single), [...] "Time Will Crawl" [...] and [...] "Never Let Me Down". Bowie later described it as his [...] "nadir", calling it [...] "an awful album". Supporting Never Let <b>Me</b> <b>Down,</b> <b>and</b> preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, and U2.|$|E
500|$|With news of {{the death}} of his daughter's friend, Wera Knoop (1900–1919), Rilke set to work on Sonnets to Orpheus. The Sonnets {{frequently}} refer to Wera, both directly where he addresses her by name and indirectly in allusions to a [...] "dancer" [...] or the mythical Eurydice. [...] Rilke wrote to the young girl's mother stating that Wera's ghost was [...] "commanding and impelling" [...] him to write. In a rush of inspiration, Rilke worked on the Sonnets and renewed his focus towards completing the remainder of Duino Elegies. [...] In one week, Rilke completed the unfinished elegies, and from 2 February to 23 February 1922 he completed all the 55 sonnets of the two parts of Sonnets to Orpheus. Rilke considered both collections to be [...] "of the same birth". In a letter to Klossowska on 9 February 1922, Rilke wrote: [...] "what weighed <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> caused my anguish most is done... I am still trembling from it.... And I went out to caress old Muzot, just now, in the moonlight." [...] Two days later, completing the last of his work on the Elegies in the evening, he wrote to Lou Andreas-Salomé that he had finished [...] "everything in a few days; it was a boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit, and whatever inside me is like thread and webbing, framework, it all cracked and bent.

People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times.

[...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

[...] Spielberg became Zemeckis's mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Zemeckis co-wrote with Gale. He later executive produced other Zemeckis films, including the Back to the Future trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to that, Lee {{noted that the}} song was also inspired by other events in her life, including people who she was collaborating with, [...] "holding <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> manipulating me and betraying me", eventually leading her {{to make the decision}} of [...] "put my foot down and walk out the door". During a 2011 interview with Spin magazine, Lee described [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] as [...] "mostly a chick anthem: 'You only want me when you're drunk. You only want me because I'm not there'" [...] and deemed it empowering for her female audience of listeners due to the response she had received from them.

2500|$|The poem {{begins with}} Tithonus {{speaking}} to Eos [...] "at the quiet {{limit of the}} world" [...] (line 7) where he lives with her.

He recounts how Eos, choosing him to be her lover, had filled him with so much pride that he had seemed [...] "To his great heart none other than a God!" [...] (14). Though she carelessly granted him immortality at his asking, he could not escape the ravages of time. The Hours aged him and his youth and beauty faded away−-"But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills / And beat <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> marr'd and wasted me" [...] (18–19).

2500|$|In 1950, the spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine had confounded the England batsmen to {{give the}} West Indies a 3–1 series win. Ramadhin still exerted his hold, taking 7/49 to dismiss England for 186 in the first innings of the First Test at Edgbaston. The West Indies made 474 and Cowdrey joined Peter May at 113/3 in the second innings, still 175 runs behind. May wrote of Cowdrey's [...] "steadying {{influence}} on me when I was charging down the wicket and trying to hit everyone into the car park. I recall he calmed <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said occupation of the crease was the vital requirement!" [...] Cowdrey ruthlessly padded away any ball from Ramadhin outside off stump, where {{he could not be}} given out leg before wicket. [...] "It was typical of Cowdrey that he should work out the theory so punctiliously", but his tactic became popular with less talented batsmen to the complaints of purists and detriment of the game. May made 285 not out and Cowdrey 154, his first Test century in England, and together they added 411 runs in 511 minutes, the third highest stand in Test cricket at the time, the highest for the fourth wicket until 2009, the highest stand ever made for England and the highest stand against the West Indies by any team.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat <b>me</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
