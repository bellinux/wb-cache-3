Based on {{a literature}} search {{and the study}} of 300 samples of saxicolous calcifuge lichen communities obtained with the "total sampling" method along several watercourses in continental France, the authors propose the nomenclature of "ekreophilic" for lichens developing on rocks subjected to prolonged water flows and "hydrophilic" when they colonise supports subjected to periodic immersion by watercourses. 2. Statistical analyses of the 300 samples show the existence of three groups defined by their contact times with water. The authors propose the names "subhydrophilic", "mesohydropilic" and "hyperhydrophilic" for lichens in {{the upper part of the}} <b>minor</b> <b>bed,</b> the lower part of the <b>minor</b> <b>bed</b> and in the low-flow channel, respectively. 3. A new classification for phytosociology, or plant communities, is proposed. It is defined by the existence of one class of hydrophilic lichens, three orders corresponding to the different times of contact with water, six alliances that depend on bioclimatic stage and finally several associations whose flora compositions should be defined by further work. Research perspectives resulting from this new ecological concept, and the role of symbiotic organisms in phanerogam colonisation of land exposed by receding water are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} human {{intervention}} in the Ariège river flow on its morphological evolution. If one examines the present day flow of the Ariège River (central Pyrénées), one observes a mutation of its fluvial dynamics following the construction of several dams; the sinuosity and the width of its channel have been reduced while its bed cuts deeper and its banks have become steeper. Vegetation has accentuated this evolution. By colonizing the <b>minor</b> <b>bed,</b> trees have closed the active band, thus favouring changes in the river. At the same time, analysis of hydrological readings over the past 100 years shows a weakening of high waters in the last decades. This diminution {{is largely due to}} the exploitation of dams. The reduction of hydrous constraints on channel borders has favoured the development of woody vegetation in the <b>minor</b> <b>bed.</b> We are faced with a process of de stabilization caused by human intervention in a fluvial system and in which vegetation plays a role both of catalyst and aggravating factor.

Papel de la antropización del caudal del Ariège en su evolución morfológica. Cuando se examina el funcionamiento actual del río Ariège (Pirineo central), se observa un cambio de su dinámica fluvial, resultante de la edificación de numerosas presas : la sinuosidad y la anchura del canal disminuyen mientras el ¡echo se profundiza y las pendientes aumentan. La vegetación va acentuando esta evolución. Al colonizar el lecho menor, los árboles van estrechando la zona activa, favoreciendo así ¡os cambios del río. Por otra parte, el análisis de las estadísticas hidrológicas desde unos cien años muestra una disminución de las aguas altas, en los últimos decenios. Esta disminución se puede atribuir en gran parte a la explotación de las presas. La reducción de la presión hídrica sobre ios bordes del canal favoreció la implantación de una vegetación leñosa en el lecho menor. Nos encontramos frente a un proceso de desestabilización antrópica de un sistema fluvial en el que la vegetación desempeña a la vez el papel de catalizador y el de factor agravante. Mercier Alexis.

40|$|The 1999 jökulhlaup at Sólheimajökull was {{the first}} major flood to be routed through the proglacial system in over 600 [*]years. This study reconstructed the flood using hydrodynamic, {{sediment}} transport and morphodynamic numerical modelling informed by field surveys, aerial photograph and digital elevation model analysis. Total modelled sediment transport was 469 800 [*]m 3 (+/- 20 %). Maximum erosion of 8. 2 [*]m occurred along the ice margin. Modelled net landscape change was – 86 400 [*]m 3 (+/- 40 %) resulting from – 275 400 [*]m 3 (+/- 20 %) proglacial erosion and 194 400 [*]m 3 (+/- 20 %) proglacial deposition. Peak erosion rate and peak deposition rate were 650 [*]m 3 [*]s- 1 (+/- 20 %) and 595 [*]m 3 [*]s- 1 (+/- 20 %), respectively, and coincided with peak discharge of water at 1. 5 [*]h after flood initiation. The pattern of bed elevation change during the rising limb suggested widespread activation of the bed, whereas more organisation, perhaps primitive bedform development, occurred during the falling limb. Contrary to simplistic conceptual models, deposition occurred on the rising stage and erosion occurred on the falling limb. Comparison of the morphodynamic results with a hydrodynamic simulation illustrated effects of sediment transport and bed elevation change on flow conveyance. The morphodynamic model advanced flood arrival and peak discharge timings by 100 % and 19 %, respectively. However, peak flow depth and peak flow velocity were not significantly affected. We suggest that morphodynamic processes not only increase flow mass and momentum but that they also introduce a feedback process whereby flood conveyance becomes more efficient via erosion of <b>minor</b> <b>bed</b> protrusions and deposition that infills or subdues <b>minor</b> <b>bed</b> hollows. A major implication {{of this study is that}} reconstructions of outburst floods that ignore sediment transport, such as those used in interpretation of long-term hydrological record and flood risk assessments, may need considerable refinement...|$|E

40|$|The {{software}} MARINE (Modélisation de l’Anticipation du Ruissellement et des Inondations pour des évéNements Extrêmes) {{has been}} developed at the Institute of Fluids Mechanics of Toulouse for flash flood is a distributed rainfall runoff model. It allows the calculation of the flood hydrograph at the outlet of the basin and helps the decision-makers to evaluate in real time the potential danger of a flood (Dartus et al. 2004). There are many parameters involved {{in the shape of}} the hydrograph due to the fact that the model is « spatially distributed » and « physically based ». The question is: which parameters are the most influent for the results and which parameters allow to obtain a good adequacy between the model results and the observations? For that purpose, we used the Bayesian method GLUE « Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation » that defines a theoretical framework and allows a systematic sensitiveness analysis of the different parameters involved in the model. In the framework of this paper, the method GLUE is presented as well as a preliminary study to its usage.

40|$|International audienceThe channelizing of the <b>minor</b> <b>bed</b> of the Drugeon {{river and}} the {{drainage}} of adjacent marshes were carried out from 1961 to 1973 {{in the hope of}} gaining 2000 ha of farmland. Those works led to important damage to the wetlands of the Drugeon basin, a Ramsar site since 2003, under the protection of several national and European laws since 1992. Actually, two hundred hectares only were gained and the stream length was shortened by 30 % (8 km). This changed the river into a rectilinear channel with subsequent erosion increasing the river bottom depth from some tens of centimetres to two meters, decreasing the fish populations and leading to the extinction of the White-footed Crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes). From 1993 to 1997 the combination of EU directives and national and regional protection laws led to achieve a LIFE programme aiming at restoring 30 km of the Drugeon river. This included re-meandering the stream over 20 km and filling the drains that have been dug in marshes in order to re-elevate the water table in adjacent areas. The first works begun in 1997 upstream and ended in 2001. Based on the IPA method (IBCC, 1977), the present study aims at comparing the nesting bird community between 1998 - 1999 (at {{the very beginning of the}} works) and 2006 - 2007 (5 years after the end of the works). A total of 104 nesting bird species were contacted at least once; 74 in 1998 on 15 IPAs, 80 in 1998, 94 in 2006 an 83 in 2007 on 20 IPAs. Total species richness per IPA was multiplied by 1. 3 ten years after the beginning of the works and by 1. 9 considering wetland species only (FIG. 2). Remarkably, bird abundance represented by the sum of the IPA scores also increased significantly (FIG. 3). Species number increase was observed all along the river but was neatly larger downstream (FIG. 4). Twelve species show a significant population increase (p < 0. 05) or possibly an increase (0. 05 < p < 0. 1). The Willow Warbler, the MarshWarbler, the Coot, the Reed Bunting, the Mallard, the Northern Lapwing and the Little Grebe increased; the Meadow Pipit increased only in the Coot area (p < 0, 05). The Common Pochard, the Tufted Duck and the Grey Wagtail possibly increased (0. 05 < p < 0, 1). Only theWhinchat showed a trend to decrease (0. 05 < p < 0. 1). Those results are discussed and compared with other bird censuses achieved along the first 80 kilometres of 5 French rivers (Seine, Saône, Loire, Allier, Loue). A remarkably high diversity of bird species was observed along the Drugeon river. The rehabilitation of the river led to improve the ecological conditions and the population of wetland species. Some of those species showed an increase in the area rehabilitated although they are known to markedly decline at European, French, Swiss and regional scales...|$|E

Most of these deposits are heavily collected for their excellently-preserved trilobites. The Oldenburg Butter Shale, however, is a previously-undescribed mudstone package from the Waynesville Formation, known only from limited exposure near Oldenburg, Indiana. The Oldenburg Shale is a 2 m-thick mudstone package with <b>minor</b> <b>beds</b> of shelly packstones, and calcisiltite-filled gutter casts. It contains abundant articulated trilobites. The mudstone portion contains illite, chlorite, quartz, calcite and traces of dolomite and pyrite. In outcrop, the shale exhibits no obvious bedding and breaks conchoidally. When cut and polished, the mudstone shows a mottled fabric, containing Lingulichnus and Chondrites trace fossils. The shelly units contain brachiopods, gastropods, and bryozoans. The gutter casts are 20 – 30 cm wide, display hummocky stratification, and contain Lingulichnus. Faunally, the Oldenburg is very unlike surrounding Waynesville strata. Instead of being dominated by brachiopods as is typical, the Oldenburg fauna consists of abundant bivalves (Modiolopsis, Ambonychia, and Caritodens), lingulid brachiopods, and the trilobites (Isotelus, and Flexicalymene, and rare Amphilichas in the upper 30 cm). Articulate brachiopods are represented in the shale to a limited extent by the genera Zygospira and Platystrophia. The shale also contains bryozoans, orthoconic cephalopods, rare crinoids and conulariids. Conodonts and scolecodonts are {{a major component of}} the microfauna. Taphonomy of the fossils, together with sedimentological features, indicates that this butter shale accumulated rapidly as a series of episodes of distal storm-generated mud and silt flows. Towards the top of the mudstone is a horizon of small concretions, about 7 cm wide. Overlying the butter shale is the pyrite crusted surface of the Mid-Richmondian Unconformity which removes the Oldenburg shale in most other locations.
