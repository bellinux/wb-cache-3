40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{synthesis}} and coordination chemistry of twenty-five nitrogencontaining heterocyclic ligands, nineteen {{of which were}} previously unreported compounds. These ligands were designed for use as synthons {{for the formation of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>cages,</b> so contain multiple coordination sites capable of bridging multiple metal atoms. The majority of <b>molecular</b> <b>cages</b> in the literature are formed by rigid bridging ligands, whereas the ligands studied in this research incorporate a higher level of flexibility, thereby lessening the degree of control over the self-assembly process and increasing the number of possible structures that can be formed upon reaction of these ligands with meal salts. Three of the new ligands synthesised were two-armed bridging ligands, which were reacted {{with a wide variety of}} metal salts to investigate what self-assembly products were formed. The complexes characterised include a M₃L₃ cyclic trimer, a range of coordination polymers of varying dimensionality, a range of dimeric products and a series of M₄L₆ cage-like molecular squares. However, the majority of ligands studied were three-armed, potentially tripodal compounds, which were envisaged as potential components of M₃L₂ or M₆L₄ <b>molecular</b> <b>cages.</b> The products of self-assembly of these ligands with various metals salts were shown to include a variety of discrete tri- and tetranuclear complexes, a range of coordination polymers of varying dimensionality and interpenetration, and a complex M₆L₄ assembly that appears to be a collapsed coordination cage. Unfortunately some of the ligands synthesised were shown to decompose in the presence of various metal salts, a phenomenon already identified in the literature. Analogues of these decomposition products were synthesised deliberately to identify the potential of a known tridentate ligand as a metallosupramolecular synthon. ¹H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray crystallography were used to study the compounds synthesised.

The radiopharmaceuticals we are interested in consist of a radioactive source contained in a <b>molecular</b> <b>cage</b> and are directed to specific sites in the body via a targeting molecule. Rhenium (Re) is a useful radioactive source that can effectively kill surrounding cells with the energy it emits. It is important for the radioactive source to be secured in the <b>molecular</b> <b>cage</b> so that it will not irradiate unwanted parts of the body. A radiopharmaceutical that will more effectively irradiate the tumor may require fewer testaments, less overall discomfort, and will hopefully result in a lower cost for patients. The focus of this study was to design the cage that would effectively hold Re. Once Re was contained in the cage it was reacted with phosphine to increase its stability. Characterization methods were employed to insure that the structure had formed, but further characterization is needed.

Inspired by previous host– guest knowledge, two pseudopeptidic <b>molecular</b> <b>cages</b> based on serine and threonine (CySer and CyThr, respectively) were {{designed and synthesized}} as hosts for the binding of the four possible stereoisomers of the Ac-Glu-Tyr-OH dipeptide, a target sequence of tyrosine kinases.

The CySer cage proved to be slightly more efficient than the CyThr counterpart, although both showed similar stereoselectivity trends: LL > DD ≥ LD > DL. This stereoselective binding was retained in the gas phase, as shown by ESI-MS competition experiments using the enantiomer-labelled method (EL), as well as CID experiments. Thus, the MS-determined discriminations follow the same trends observed by NMR, suggesting that the stereoselectivity observed for these systems must be mainly dictated by the polar host–guest interactions.

The area of rotaxanes and cage molecules was reviewed and selected examples discussed in detail. Three main strategies to synthesise a fumaramide thread were investigated, however these were unsuccessful. By changing the templating station and the stopper groups, several novel azo-dicarboxylate threads were synthesised, {{as well as their}} [2]- and [3]rotaxanes. Unusual reductions of the azo-dicarboxylate stations during the clipping processes were observed and these were studied in detail.

The structures of electron-precise cages, which offer three orbitals and three electrons for skeletal bonding, were rationalised by Mingos based on cage structures comprising n three-coordinate vertices (for n = 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.). Whilst these offered a conceptual rationale, {{an increasing number of}} potential structural topologies exist with increasing cage size, thereby limiting the predictive nature of this approach (e. g. there are three possible cage topologies for 8 vertex polyhedra and five for 10 -vertex polyhedra!). The current review re-examines the structural motifs possible for these electron-precise cages, focusing not only on the cage size (number of vertices) but also on the number and size of the faces of the cage. This approach reveals rather limited numbers of favourable topologies for the large family of hetero-atomic electron-precise cages (AB) x in which electrostatic contributions are maximised for topologies comprising only even-numbered (e. g. square and hexagonal) faces.
