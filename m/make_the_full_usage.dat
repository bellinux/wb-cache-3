40|$|Abstract. Learning objects {{metadata}} (LOM) facilitate search, evaluation, acquisition, and use {{of learning}} objects, which may contain any kind of multimedia information, by learners, instructors or automated software processes. As a result, learning objects reuse is promoted and thus, development cost for new ones is reduced. However, manual indexing of learning resources according to metadata standards is a laborious task. This fact suspends <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>usage</b> and reduces <b>the</b> intended advantages of standards, like IEEE LOM. The introduction of automatic metadata generation processes is a developing research field with diverse approaches. In this paper, we present a step-by-step methodology for automatic generation of metadata that exploits relations between the resources to be described. The methodology comprises the execution of consecutive steps of actions aiming at identifying inference rules for automatic generation of a resource’s metadata based on pre-existing metadata of its related resources...|$|R

In the second scenario (SC 2), the original biometric data is hidden into their respective host-objects using either the proposed method (PR) or another interesting steganographic method (ZG), introduced by Zhang et al. [40]. The final content is compressed and transmitted over error-prone channels.

Without iterations with node 0 and node 1, the positioning performance of other nodes is being restrained. In case 1, all nodes take part in the belief propagation process, which is helpful in improving the positioning performance of all nodes (especially nodes 2 to 5), so the overall performance of case 1 is better than that of case 0.
