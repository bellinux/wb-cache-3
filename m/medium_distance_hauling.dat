40|$|Abstract — We present {{structural}} {{results on}} optimal number of clusters and optimal rate {{with respect to}} long <b>haul</b> <b>distance</b> in a cluster based cooperative multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) sensor network. Using the concepts of super and sub modular functions and their associated properties it has been proved {{that the number of}} clusters to minimize the energy consumption is a decreasing function of long <b>haul</b> <b>distance.</b> From this, we conclude that as the long <b>haul</b> <b>distance</b> increases the cooperation among the nodes increases to counter the path loss due to fading in the channel. Furthermore, we also prove the rate to minimize the energy consumption is a decreasing function of long <b>haul</b> <b>distance.</b> Finally, through our numerical results we observe that optimizing node cooperation can lead to large scale energy savings.

However, one does not observe any topological structures on <b>medium</b> range <b>distance</b> scales, that is scales that are smaller than {{the size of the}} observed universe but larger than the microscopic scales for which quantum gravity becomes important. Recently, Friedman, Schleich and Witt have proven that there is topological censorship on these <b>medium</b> range <b>distance</b> scales: the Einstein equations, locally positive energy, and local predictability of physics imply that any <b>medium</b> <b>distance</b> scale topological structures cannot be seen. More precisely, we show that the topology of physically reasonable isolated systems is shrouded from distant observers, or in other words there is a topological censorship principle. 1...|$|R
