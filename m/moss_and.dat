5|$|Salta, and the Moss in particular, {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of plant and animal life, {{including}} some rare specimens. Adders, Britain's only native venomous snake, are seen on the <b>Moss,</b> <b>and</b> prey upon small rodents, such as voles. Many wild bird species inhabit Salta and the surrounding area, including larger species such as pheasants, which are also bred locally for hunting.|$|E

25|$|Bryophytes (<b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> liverworts) {{contribute}} substantially to {{the overall}} biodiversity of Heard Island, with 43 <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> 19 liverworts being recorded, often occupying habitats unsuitable for vascular plants, such as cliff faces. Bryophytes are present {{in most of the}} major vegetation communities including several soil and moss-inhabiting species. A 1980 survey of McDonald Island found lower diversity than that on Heard Island; four <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> a number of algal species are recorded from there.|$|R

5|$|The story {{follows a}} Shoshone National Forest fire lookout named Henry in 1989, {{following}} the Yellowstone fires of 1988. A month {{after his first}} day at work, strange things begin happening to both him and his supervisor Delilah, which connects to a conspired mystery that happened years ago. Henry interacts with Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform {{the process by which}} their relationship is developed. The game was directed by Olly <b>Moss</b> <b>and</b> Sean Vanaman, written by Chris Remo, Jake Rodkin, <b>Moss</b> <b>and</b> Vanaman, and produced by Gabe McGill and artist Jane Ng. The game's environment was modelled by Ng, based on a single painting by Moss. The design draws inspiration from New Deal advertisements by the National Park Service and field research conducted in Yosemite National Park.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on <b>moss,</b> <b>and</b> peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E

5|$|Leotia lubrica favours damp {{deciduous}} woodland, but {{can also}} be found under conifers. Particular favoured habitats include path sides and underneath bracken, while favoured substrates include soil, <b>moss</b> <b>and</b> plant waste, where it feeds as a saprotroph. Fruit bodies are typically encountered from late summer to late autumn in Europe, and from late spring to autumn in North America, where it is the most common Leotia species. It has also been recorded in eastern Asia, in China and Tibet, as well as in New Zealand and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents are herbivorous, feeding {{exclusively}} on plant material such as seeds, stems, leaves, flowers, and roots. Some are omnivorous {{and a few}} are predators. The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses, herbs, root tubers, <b>moss,</b> <b>and</b> other vegetation, and gnaws on bark during the winter. It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae. The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling, and also collects grasses, roots, and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers.|$|E

5|$|On July 31, 2008, Ramirez {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a {{three-way}} deal. The Boston Red Sox acquired outfielder Jason Bay and minor league infielder Josh Wilson, and the Pittsburgh Pirates got infielder Andy LaRoche and pitching prospect Bryan Morris from the Dodgers and outfielder Brandon <b>Moss</b> <b>and</b> pitcher Craig Hansen from the Red Sox. Ramirez had always worn uniform number 24, but the Dodgers had retired that number in honor of Hall of Fame manager Walter Alston. Ramirez instead chose to wear number 99 with the Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with <b>moss</b> <b>and</b> leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E
5|$|The Mecoptera {{are closely}} related to the Siphonaptera (fleas), and a little more distantly to the Diptera (true flies). They are {{somewhat}} fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or <b>moss,</b> <b>and</b> the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may pass through a diapause until favourable weather conditions occur.|$|E

5|$|The {{first part}} of what is now the Oslo Commuter Rail was the Trunk Line, which opened on 1 September 1854 between Oslo East Station (OsloØ, located at the same place as the current OsloS), and Eidsvoll. The line was at first private, {{although}} it was nationalized in 1926. On 3 October 1862, the Kongsvinger Line opened from Lillestrøm to Kongsvinger. The Østfold Line opened from OsloØ to <b>Moss</b> <b>and</b> onwards to Halden on 2 January 1879, followed by the Eastern Østfold Line from Ski via Mysen to Sarpsborg on 24 November 1882.|$|E
5|$|The most {{predominant}} {{plant species}} in the alpine zone around the pass are the grass species adapted to the harsh climate. Other alpine flora, such as <b>moss</b> <b>and</b> lichens on the rocks, and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in the alpine zone include ptarmigans, small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and pocket gopher, and mountain goats.|$|E
40|$|Cryptogams {{are rarely}} {{included}} in conservation planning and management. This study aims {{to improve the}} data available for cryptogam conservation by focusing on two groups of cryptogams, <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> macrofungi, to test the usefulness of vegetation type, vascular plants and environmental variables, including substrate, as surrogates for cryptogams in achieving satisfactory conservation outcomes. Sites from four vegetation types (wet forest, heathy woodland, grassy woodland and alpine heath) in the Hobart region of Tasmania were surveyed {{over a period of}} several years for vascular plants, <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> epigeous macrofungi using permanent plots. Repeated sampling of the macrofungi ensured that a reasonable proportion of the taxa likely to be present were recorded. A total of 284 vascular plants, 71 <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> 233 macrofungi were recorded. Ordination and analysis of similarity both showed that the four vegetation types were significantly different from each other; this pattern occurred for vascular plants, <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> macrofungi. Congruence between the three taxonomic groups was tested using Partial Mantel tests; all pairwise associations were highly significant, showing highly predictive rvalues. Significant and predictive associations occurred between environmental and substrate variables and biotic groups (vascular plants, <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> macrofungi, and their various subsets). Canopy cover was the best single predictor of most biotic groups. Particular combinations of significant environmental variables had higher correlations with biotic groups than single variables, for example the combination of altitude, canopy cover and geology had higher r-values than any of these factors individually. <b>Mosses</b> <b>and</b> macrofungi exhibited high substrate fidelity across time and space. Substrate preferences of macrofungi did not vary among vegetation types, but mosses in wet forest occurred on a wider range of substrates than the same species in other vegetation types. Iterative, optimisation, fully random and stratified random methods were compared for their effectiveness in the selection of sites for the conservation of vascular plants, <b>mosses</b> <b>and</b> macrofungi.

5|$|The {{river is}} nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 4.33) which determines {{the type of}} plant life found there. Mosses and liverworts are the most common. Near the source {{compressed}} flapwort (Nardia compressa) and green algae are the most dominant species. Closer to the mouth water earwort (Scapania undulata), feather <b>moss</b> <b>and</b> bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (Isothecium holtii) is very common on the banks; the Shimna River {{is one of only}} three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (Platyhypnidium alopecuroides) is found.|$|E
5|$|There were 31 {{compensatory}} selections {{distributed among}} 16 teams during rounds three through seven, with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills receiving 4 picks each.

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators.
