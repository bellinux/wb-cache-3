5|$|A {{jazz and}} gospel album, Goin' Home {{features}} Shepp and Parlan's interpretations of African-American folk <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> spirituals. Its title is {{an allusion to}} Shepp's return to his African cultural roots. Shepp had never recorded spirituals before and was overcome with emotion during the album's recording because of the historical and cultural context of the songs.|$|E
5|$|In performance, Mina {{combined}} several modern styles {{with traditional}} Italian <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> swing music, {{which made her}} the most versatile pop singer in Italian music. Mina dominated the country's charts for fifteen years and reached an unsurpassed level of popularity. She has scored 79 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts.|$|E
40|$|In two experiments, {{the perceptual}} {{similarity}} between a strong tonal <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> various transpositions was investigated using a paradigm in which listeners compared the perceptual similarity of a <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> its transposition {{with that of}} the same <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> another transposition. The paradigm has the advantage that it provides a direct judgment regarding the similarity of transposed melodies. The experimental results indicate that the perceptual similarity of a strong tonal <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> its transposition is mainly determined by two factors: (1) the distance on the height dimension between the original <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> its transposition (pitch distance), and (2) the distance between keys as inferred from the circle of fifths (key distance). The major part of the variance is explained by the factor pitch distance, whereas key distance explains only a small part...|$|R

50|$|The {{songwriter}} may expand {{upon the}} <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> chord progression by adding an instrumental melody (which may occur {{before or after}} the vocal melody, or alongside the vocal <b>melody)</b> <b>and</b> creating a more complex song structure (e.g., verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental solo section, verse, etc.).|$|R
5|$|Leontovych {{arranged}} many Ukrainian folk songs, creating artistically independent choral compositions {{based on}} their <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> lyrics. He followed the traditions of improvisation of Ukrainian kobzars, who would interpret every new strophe differently. He also employed humming and the variability in timbre of singers' voices as techniques in reaching a desired emotional or sensual effect.|$|E
5|$|Ramprasad is {{credited}} with creating a new compositional form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> kirtan. The new style took root in Bengali culture with many poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, mixing every common style of music from classical to semi-classical and folk. His songs are sung today, with a popular collection—Ramprasadi Sangit ("Songs of Ramprasad")—sold at Shakta temples and pithas in Bengal.|$|E
5|$|The {{lives of}} the Strauss dynasty members and their world-renowned craft of {{composing}} Viennese waltzes are also briefly documented in several television adaptations, such as The Strauss Family (1972), The Strauss Dynasty (1991) and Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time (1995). Many other films used his works and <b>melodies,</b> <b>and</b> several films have been based upon {{the life of the}} musician, the most famous of which is called The Great Waltz (1938), redone in 1972.|$|E
40|$|In {{the adult}} brain, <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> rhythm {{processing}} {{have been found}} to show di¡erent hemispheric dominance, with the right hemi-sphere apparently more sensitive to <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> the left hemi-sphere to rhythm. We used a novel, child-friendly scanning protocol to examine the neural basis of <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> rhythm pro-cessing in young children (mean age 6 years 4 months, n 33). FMRI data were acquired using a sparse temporal sampling technique, taking advantage of the natural delay in the cerebrovascular re-sponse to neuronal activity. We found that this group of young children showed some di¡erential specialization for <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> rhythmprocessing, but to a lesser extent thanpreviously reported in adults. These results suggest that hemispheric specialization for musical processing may develop with age. NeuroReport 15 : 1723...|$|R

5|$|As she did on Survivor, Beyoncé took a wider {{role in the}} {{production}} of Dangerously in Love, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks. Although Beyoncé did not create beats, she came up with <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> ideas she shared with the producers. With 43 songs completed — 15 of which made it to the album— Beyoncé is credited as co-writer and co-producer, as well as the album's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles.|$|E
5|$|Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments (also called And Other Musical Instruments) is {{the fourteenth}} studio album by American singer Barbra Streisand. It was {{released}} on November 2, 1973 by Columbia Records. The album was made available following a 1973 live television special promoted to improve Streisand's image and sound. With world music as the primary genre, the album's instrumentation varies greatly; even items such as kitchen utensils were used to create <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> beats. With {{a majority of the}} songs on the album being cover songs, Streisand also re-recorded various tracks that originated earlier in her career. Her manager, Martin Erlichman, was credited as the album's sole and executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Blunt's second studio album, All the Lost Souls, was {{released}} on 17 September 2007 in the United Kingdom and one day later in North America. It sold 65,000 units in its first week, and was certified gold in the UK after only four days. By the end of January 2008, the album had sold 600,000 copies in the UK, and 4.5 million copies internationally. Blunt completed the album's songs {{at his home in}} Ibiza in the winter of 2006–2007. He performed five of the ten album tracks during his 2005–2006 tours; lyrics, <b>melodies,</b> <b>and</b> harmonies were refined for the studio recording, on which his touring band played and Tom Rothrock worked as producer.|$|E

5|$|Called {{by nearly}} a dozen {{different}} names and with varying words, <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> purpose but common themes, the song's history reflects many of the evolutionary changes and cross-currents of American music. It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns, persists through that century, manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind inmate convicted of murder, and sees use in the 1950s as a folk song, before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane. Several of these different variants of the song are still performed in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts {{while she was}} working on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E
5|$|Many vocalists were {{considered}} to perform on the album; Matheos and Portnoy briefly considered having a different vocalist perform on each track. Daniel Gildenlöw of Pain of Salvation wrote some vocal <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> lyrics, but Moore ultimately performed most of the vocals and wrote most of the lyrics. Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree wrote lyrics and performed vocals on one track. Cynic and Gordian Knot bassist Sean Malone performed bass, but was credited as a guest musician because his schedule meant {{he was unable to}} join Matheos, Moore and Portnoy for the basic tracking sessions.|$|E

50|$|The troparia has a recitative-like {{sound with}} only a few parts singing at any one time.

5|$|Mikhail Tanich {{wrote the}} lyrics to every song the group {{performed}} until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing {{the lyrics to}} the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came to empathize with criminals {{from all walks of}} life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a guitar, drums, accordions, and are often performed with strong vocals.|$|E
5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived {{from the fact that the}} album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E
5|$|The various musical themes {{associated}} with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire Ring cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments {{to the source of}} the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, on the night before he died in Venice, in 1883.|$|E

5|$|Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba {{was forced}} to find {{employment}} as a child {{after the death of}} her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognised when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African <b>melodies,</b> <b>and</b> Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, the Disney short {{subjects}} were no longer being produced on a regular basis, with many of the shorts divisions' personnel either leaving the company or begin reassigned to work on Disney television programs such as The Mickey Mouse Club and Disneyland. While the Disney shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) during the 1930s, its reign over the award had been ended by MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons, Warner Bros' Looney Tunes and Merrie <b>Melodies,</b> <b>and</b> the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives to the older Disney style. During the 1950s, only one Disney short, the stylized Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom, won the Best Short Subject (Cartoons) Oscar.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Carey was {{discovered}} by Tommy Mottola, CEO of Columbia Records, and was promptly signed to the label. Carey's self-titled debut studio album, released the following year, focused on re-recording and mastering several songs she had already written in high school alongside classmate, Ben Margulies. Aside from the seven songs taken from Carey's demo tape, four other tracks were written and produced by the former {{and an array of}} famed record producers. The album was complimented by critics, who called it a mature debut, full of various genre influences ranging from pop, R and soul. The album became a commercial success, selling fifteen million units globally. While making a strong impact on pop music, Carey became interested in altering her sound, and deviating from pop music for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Following the success of her debut, Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical departure, enabling her to change her genre infusions, <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> production.|$|E
