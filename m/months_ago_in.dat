I am also satisfied that Richard did not strike linesman Thompson as a result of a mistake or accident as suggested … Assistance can also be obtained from an incident that occurred less than three <b>months</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> which the pattern of conduct of Richard was almost identical, including his constant resort to the recovery of his stick to pursue his opponent, as well as flouting the authority of and striking officials. On the previous occasion he was fortunate that teammates and officials were more effective in preventing him from doing injury to anyone and the penalty was more lenient in consequence. At the time he was warned there must be no further incident … The time for probation or leniency is past. Whether this type of conduct is the product of temperamental instability or willful defiance of the authority in the games does not matter. It is a type of conduct which cannot be tolerated by any player—star or otherwise. Richard will be suspended from all games both league and playoff for the balance of the current season.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 Dec 2012, after {{numerous}} rumors {{on whether}} she had tied the knot 2 <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>in</b> {{an interview with the}} press, she declared that now {{it can be said that}} she is married and has worn a wedding ring for two months. Some paparazzi pointed out that this can be easily recognized when she started wearing a more plain ring which matches the ring on Otto's (her husband) left hand though she may have intended to wear it on her right hand (yet, wearing ring on the right hand is actually a tradition in some Europe countries including the Netherlands). It is also expected that Thu Minh would never hold a big wedding celebration involving the public and the press in Vietnam since she is well known for being quite secretive in her love life. This could be a reason that she may have chosen to celebrate this only with some close friends and families − to avoid the public attention. Besides, because Thu Minh only has contact regularly with very few co-workers at a personal level, the news, hence, was not widespread and was under cover for a while. Till now, the public only acknowledges her husband's face and he is a Dutch businessman (Her husband's name has recently been revealed as Otto). Her husband appeared on the event she held on 21 December 2012 as an event to introduce her husband and celebrate the ended year 2012. In this event, he also spoke sincerely in Vietnamese though not much to thank the press, but expressed his willing to keep their relationship secretive. He also called Thu Minh his wife and teased her for being talkative ...|$|E

50|$|The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) {{suffered}} {{its largest}} defeat since the 1990 parliamentary election, while far-right Jobbik {{came to the}} second place {{for the first time}} since its establishment. Gábor Vona said his party, based on the results, could be the main challenger to the Fidesz in the 2018 parliamentary election. However, as political analyst Zoltán Lakner argued, Jobbik appeared in the election significantly worse than one <b>month</b> <b>ago</b> <b>in</b> the general election, because the party now gained only one-third of those votes, while the turnout was half of the previous one. The extremist party's second place was due to the fragmentation of the left-wing opposition.|$|R

50|$|Ivanovic {{was ranked}} 12th when Dubai Tennis Championships started, but wasn't seeded because nearly all top players came. That caused a clash {{in first round}} against #8 Angelique Kerber.
