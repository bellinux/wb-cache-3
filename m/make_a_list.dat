25|$|Secondary {{schools are}} divided into three types - gymnasiums, {{professional}} and craft schools. After graduating from the primary school, students take a test called Matura. The test covers subjects that were taught in primary school. They are awarded the maximum of 40 points at the test. They also get points from their average marks from 5th to 8th grade, and the maximum is 60 points. Both the points from Matura and from average marks are totallized into the maximum of 100 points. Then, students <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> of their preferred schools and are sorted according to how much points they had gained - every secondary school has {{a limited number of}} students it takes. After students make lists for preferred schools, they get into the first school that suits them according to the points.
