500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} <b>movable</b> <b>platen.</b> The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E

This paper presents a new design of a tiebarless clamping system for micro-{{injection molding}} machine. The tiebarless clamping system can provide lots of convenience, such as more mold space for automation etc., for a micro-injection molding machine. Good parallel precision between stationary platen and <b>movable</b> <b>platen</b> of a clamping system is an important feature for high precision injection molding. With special mechanism of this tiebarless clamping system, the <b>movable</b> <b>platen</b> will deform with the stationary platen synchronously under high clamping force to maintain the parallelism. Via tests and verifications, the parallel precision is controlled at good condition under 6 tons of clamping force...|$|E

The procedure recommends testing by centering the specimen on the lower platen of the testing machine in the desired orientation, {{so as not to}} incur eccentric loading. It is also recommended by the standard that the load be applied with a continuous motion of the <b>movable</b> <b>platen</b> of the testing machine at a speed of 0. 5 ± 0, 1 in.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-free robust/adaptive control scheme for tracking control of electro-hydraulic servo systems using output feedback only. The Taylor expansion theory {{is used to}} enable the proposed controller to identify and feedback linearize the dynamics of a system on-line, and to compensate parameter variation and various disturbances in real time. As a result, the closed-loop system of the complicated electrohydraulic system behaves as a simple linear dominated system plus a small uncertainty residual. By properly designing the adaptive law of the robust gain, asymptotic stability and satisfactory performance of the closed-loop system can be achieved. The details of controller design and stability analysis are presented in the paper. The controller has been implemented on a plastic injection molding machine to control {{the position of the}} mold-supporting <b>movable</b> <b>platen.</b> The results from experiments indicate that the proposed controller performs much better than the conventional PID feedback controller...|$|E
40|$|Plastic are {{certainly}} most versatile of all known materials today and have therefore, established themselves in enviable position from where {{are not even}} possible to replaced. Injection molding machine {{is one of the}} most widely used method of conversion of plastic into various end products application to wide range of plastic materials from plastic commodity to specialty engineering plastic. In injection molding machine stationary platen play a very important role. During the process generally compressive stress generates at particular regions. As load varies with fast rate there is chance to failure of tie bar rod. Due to heavy mould shape, size of platen also change, that’s increase its weight as well as stress level at certain region and this is not good in practice. This leads to failure of platen or failure of tie rod due to stretching by nut and platen. This create loss of money (Production stop), man (injured due to accident), and material (increase inventory cost). The aim of this project is study about those areas where stress can affect the failure of tie bar due to heavy weight of stationary platen the deflection or misalignment with <b>movable</b> <b>platen.</b> Finally redistribution of stress sothat uniforme stress achive (optimization of platen). This project is including Finite Element Analysis and Design Optimization of a Typical Structural Component of a Plastic Injection Molding Machine. The aim of project is to optimize a typical structural component (stationary platen) by using finite element analysis after checking induced stresses with allowable design stress. Hence design modification of platen is carried out to achieve good strength and cost effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|This paper deals with, the {{solution}} of problem occurred for reciprocating screw of Injection molding machine. It identifies and solves the problem by using the modeling and simulation techniques. The problem occurred in the reciprocating screw of machine which was wearing of threads due to affect of temperature of mold materials (flow materials) i. e. Nylon, low density polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC etc., The main work was to model the components of machine with dimensions, assemble those components and then simulate the whole assembly for rotation of the screw. The modeling software used is PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 for modeling the machine components like body, <b>movable</b> <b>platen,</b> fixed platen, barrel, screw, nozzle, etc. The analysis software ANSYS is {{used to analyze the}} reciprocating screws. The objectives involved are:-• To model all the components using modeling software Pro-E 4. 0 • To assemble all the components of the machine in the software. • To make the assembly run in Pro-E software. • Analysis of screw of machine using Ansys 11. 0 software. • To identify the wearing of threads and to provide the possible solutions. This problem is major for all industrial injection molding machines which the industries are facing and they need the permanent solution, so if the better solution is achieved then the industries will think for implementing it. The industries are having temporary solution but it will affect the life of the screw, because the stresses will be more in machined screw on lathe machine as compared to normal screw. Also if the screw will fail after some years of operation, the new screw available in the market will have the same problem. Also the cost associated with new screw and its mounting is much more as it is the main component of machine...|$|E
