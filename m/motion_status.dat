Our Method is based on two kinds of parameters: Environment and Behavior parameters. The behavior parameters include velocity, <b>motion</b> <b>status</b> such as walking and running, and preference. The environment parameters include road and obstacles. A collision-free path is generated by these parameters, and a motion mining system generates the motion that has <b>motion</b> <b>status</b> and velocity that a user inputted while following a path.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a generic scheme to analyze urban traffic via vehicle motion indication from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The scheme comprises two main steps performed progressively- vehicle extraction and <b>motion</b> <b>status</b> classification. The step for vehicle extraction {{is intended to}} detect and delineate single vehicle instances as accurate and complete as possible, while the step for <b>motion</b> <b>status</b> classification takes advantage of shape artefacts defined for moving vehicle model, to classify the extracted vehicle point sets based on parameterized boundary features, which are sufficiently good to describe the vehicle shape. To accomplish the tasks, a hybrid strategy integrating context-guided method with 3 -d segmentation based approach is applied for vehicle extraction. Then, a binary classification method using Lie group based distance is adopted to determine the vehicle <b>motion</b> <b>status.</b> However, the vehicle velocity cannot be derived at this stage due to unknown true size of vehicle. We illustrate the vehicle motion indication scheme by two examples of real data and summarize the performance by accessing the results with respect to reference data manually acquired, through which the feasibility and high potential of airborne LiDAR for urban traffic analysis are verified. 1...|$|E

Two control schemes are proposed: a top-down approach to maintain a desired topology of the local robots, and a bottom-up approach which allows changes of topology based on local robots interactions. In both cases, passivity of overall teleoperation system is formally guaranteed. The haptic cues fed back to the operator reflect the <b>motion</b> <b>status</b> of the multi-robot team and inform him about the presence of obstacles.

40|$|Debate has {{continued}} over which {{method of treatment}} for low back pain are the most effective. This {{is an important issue}} because {{in the absence of an}} effective treatment intervention, many acute episodes of low back pain become chronic problems. Given the prevalence of low back pain, there is a need for documenting effective treatment interventions. This study analyzed the effectiveness of an Intensive Back Program (IBP) in the treatment of back pain compared to conservative physical therapy on thirty patients. Success of this program was determined primarily by evaluating lumbar spine range of <b>motion,</b> functional <b>status,</b> perceived pain levels, and use of pain medications via a Disability Questionnaire. Sixteen patients participated in the IBP and fourteen in the Non-IBP group. Results from an initial questionnaire were compared to responses given on a follow-up questionnaire at time of discharge and again three months following discharge. A 2 X 3 Analysis of Variance indicated that subjects in the IBP showed a significant improvement (p 3 ̆c. 05) with regard to spinal movement into extension, functional disability status, perceived pain levels, and use of medication. It was also found that IBP patients had fewer complaints of and were less bothered by low back pain, sciatica, and numbness. Furthermore, the IBP subjects claimed to be more satisfied with their back condition and overall medicai care than the subjects treated conservatively.

This paper reports on an Intellidrive application for signalized intersection safety, where signals can dynamically adapt to hazardous conditions {{in order to avoid}} Red-Light-Running (RLR) related collision.

Likewise, the mean hospital stay after surgery did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (Table  1).

40|$|Even to {{the casual}} observer, it is {{apparent}} that there is a definite relationship between the education of the child, his cultural heritage, and the cultural environment within which the educational enterprise is set in <b>motion.</b> The <b>status</b> and position of culture as educational objective, however, has become problematic, especially in a country like South Africa where cultural differences have for many decades provided the foundation for serious disparities in the provision of education to its citizens. Where the RSA is apparently on the verge of radical and far-reaching change regarding its future educational policies, the following questions have to be addressed: Can culture be regarded as a regulating principle (like for instance the Christian) which must (co-) determine the spirit and direction of education? Or is culture merely the necessary facilitator which provides for adequate and tension free education, regardless {{of the nature of the}} society in which education manifests itself? The current demand to promptly and irrevocably expunge a system of fragmented and therefore repressive and unjust educational control (which is undeniably founded on the cultural differences which exist in this country), by implication also relativizes the role culture has to play in the education of the child. A fundamental reconsideration of the relationship between education and culture, as well as of the question as to whether cultural development can still legitimately be incorporated as a part of education which is no longer to be tom asunder solely on account of political strategies, is therefore essential at this stage. It should be ascertained what the impact of culture is on education in general, and whether and to what extent a concept like cultural maturity can function as an acceptable and legitimate educational objective for a non-repressive, non-racial but multi-cultural South African society...|$|R
40|$|Question: Are there {{different}} {{effects of}} home exercises and supervised exercises on pain and disability {{for people with}} subacromial impingement? Design: Randomised trial with two treatment arms, concealed allocation, blinded assessment of some outcomes, and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: Forty-six patients with subacromial impingement were recruited from an interdisciplinary outpatient clinic of {{physical medicine and rehabilitation}} at a university hospital in Norway. Intervention: The home exercise group had one supervised exercise treatment followed by exercises at home for 6 weeks. The supervised exercise group had up to 10 supervised exercise treatments in addition to home exercises for 6 weeks. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Secondary outcome variables were: average pain during the past week, the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, participant satisfaction with treatment, active range of <b>motion,</b> work <b>status</b> and clinical shoulder tests. Pain was assessed weekly and all outcomes were assessed at 6 weeks. Participants were free to seek ongoing treatment of their choice until 26 weeks, when the SPADI was assessed again. Results: While both groups improved considerably, the groups did not differ significantly on the SPADI after the intervention at 6 weeks (0 points, 95 % CI – 14 to 14) or when followed up at 26 weeks (– 2 points, 95 % CI – 21 to 17). There were no between-group differences for pain at any time. The remaining outcomes also did not differ significantly, except for the clinical tests of shoulder impingement. In the supervised exercise group, 11 out of 23 participants had two or more positive tests, compared to 18 out of 21 in the home exercise group. Conclusion: Supervision of more than the first session of a 6 -week exercise regimen did not cause significant differences in pain and disability in people with subacromial impingement.
