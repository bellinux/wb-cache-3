5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|After this, drivers {{refused to}} take no. 224 across the second Tay Bridge (which was built to a new design and opened in 1887). However, on the 29th anniversary of the disaster, 28 December 1908, no. 224 was used on the Sunday evening <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> Dundee via the Tay Bridge.|$|E
50|$|In {{the banking}} model, cheques are {{written by the}} paying party and then handed or <b>mailed</b> <b>to</b> the payee, who must then visit a bank or <b>mail</b> the cheque <b>to</b> his or her bank.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>to</b> an Employment Tribunal for unfair dismissal claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>to</b> reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 1954 Sauk-Prairie Star editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin {{urged the}} recall of McCarthy in a front-page {{editorial}} that ran alongside a sample petition that readers could fill out and <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower's authority, disrespecting Wisconsin's-own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and ignoring the plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.|$|E
5|$|The {{timetable}} for January 1883 shows {{a variety of}} passenger, goods and mixed trains, giving five passenger services down to Amlwch, and six up. The first train of the morning, departing Bangor at 04:20, and the 19:35 from Amlwch also carried <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> and from the island. The majority of trains still terminated at Gaerwen. As Llangefni held a livestock market on a Thursday, an extra service from Bangor to Llangefni on Thursdays was introduced by the 1896 timetable.|$|E

5|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> the post offices in these towns {{three times per}} week. Randolph was {{left out of the}} main route and put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the mail route roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) {{granted a}} five-year licence to {{transport}} passengers, cargo and <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> China; the airline {{was free to}} apply for traffic rights to 10 cities in China. On 5 July 2005, the airline announced the purchase of two Bombardier CRJ700s from Danish carrier Maersk Air, scheduled to arrive in July and mid-August, respectively. In addition, the airline had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Boeing {{for the purchase of}} 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 30 Boeing 737–800s on 20 December 2005 at a listed price of US$3.28 billion. An executive of the airline had told reporters that some of the Boeing aircraft was from Hainan Airlines' order.|$|E
5|$|The imams {{said that}} the three {{additional}} images were sent anonymously by <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> Muslims who were participating in an online debate on Jyllands-Postens website, and were apparently included to illustrate the perceived atmosphere of Islamophobia in which they lived. On 1 February, BBC World incorrectly reported {{that one of the}} images had been published in Jyllands-Posten. This image was later found to be a wire-service photograph of a contestant at a French pig-squealing contest in the Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival. One of the other two additional images (a photograph) portrayed a Muslim being mounted by a dog while praying, and the other (a cartoon) portrayed Muhammad as a demonic paedophile.|$|E

5|$|The remake takes {{advantage}} of the Wi-Fi feature of the Nintendo DS {{in the form of a}} Mail/Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others. Players are also able to send <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> various characters in the game as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight. An interruption-save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on. Like in the original, there is no way to make permanent saves while inside a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|While Reich was in Arizona in May 1956, {{one of his}} {{associates}} sent an accumulator part through the <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> another state, {{in violation of the}} injunction, after an FDA inspector posing as a customer requested it. Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with contempt of court; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich's absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{with the}} thawing of Sino-Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China {{led to the}} {{resumption}} of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, {{after a decade of}} talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. In the years before the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.|$|E

5|$|Raj asks Chauthrani to {{take his}} case; Chauthrani tells him not to resign, and to keep going to work. This case goes to court; Sonia and Roy engage a lawyer (Paresh Rawal). Initially, {{the bulk of the}} {{evidence}} is against Raj and the case gains widespread media attention. Raj's bank manager returns from Bangkok and gives him a tape that recorded Raj's encounter at Sonia's house. After the tape is proven genuine, Chauthrani is struck by a car driven by a goon hired by Sonia and the tape is destroyed. When Priya asks Raj why he called their bank manager from Sonia's house, he replies that he had called Rakesh, and the call went through to the bank manager as well due to the defect in the company handset. Priya continues the case after Chauthrani's injury. She exposes Sonia's earlier relationship with Raj in Cape Town and finally plays Rakesh's voice <b>mail</b> <b>to</b> the court - revealing what really occurred between Raj and Sonia. It is revealed that Sonia married Roy for money, power and status, but when he could not satisfy her sexually, she tried to resume her relationship with Raj. Priya wins the case and Roy leaves Sonia. Guilt-stricken and humiliated, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building. The end credit scene shows Raj and Priya walking their child.|$|E
