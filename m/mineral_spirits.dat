25|$|Magna, {{a special}} artist use acrylic paint was {{developed}} by Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden in 1947 and reformulated in 1960, specifically for Morris Louis and other stain painters of the color field movement. In Magna pigments are ground in an acrylic resin with alcohol-based solvents. Unlike modern water-based acrylics, Magna is miscible with turpentine or <b>mineral</b> <b>spirits</b> and dries rapidly to a matte or glossy finish. It was used extensively by Morris Louis, and Friedel Dzubas and also by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. Magna colors are more vivid and intense than regular acrylic water-based paints. Louis used Magna to great effect in his Stripe Series, where the colors are used undiluted and are poured unmixed directly from the can.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these degradation products in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components {{makes it harder to}} start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not be}} eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing <b>mineral</b> <b>spirits,</b> isopropyl alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E

His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes {{home from work and}} chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business.

Sansodor as an Odorless <b>Mineral</b> <b>Spirit</b> (OMS) is just as toxic as regular <b>Mineral</b> <b>Spirit</b> even though the aromatic components has been removed. OMS is a hydrocarbon that evaporates entirely and always produces toxic fumes. Sansodor also has a higher personal exposure limit (OSHA TLV of 300 ppm) compared to turpentine (a TLV of 100 ppm), or three times less hazardous than turpentine. Sansodor also has a slower evaporation rate than turpentine which makes it safer than turpentine in terms of inhalation risks. Sansodor because it is a form of petroleum hydrocarbon is volatile in high temperatures (it has a flash point of 174 degrees fahrenheit) so care should be taken to store it in a cool place.|$|R

5000|$|Application: Sansodor is {{a highly}} refined odorless <b>mineral</b> <b>spirit</b> {{that is used to}} dilute (thin) artists' oil paints and is also used to dilute oil media (linseed oils, alkyd media, etc.). To conform to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule in oil painting, Sansodor should be {{considered}} a [...] "lean" [...] medium (although, technically it is a thinner) and, therefore, used mostly in the initial layers of a painting. The addition of [...] "fat" [...] media like alkyd (faster drying) and linseed (slower drying) are progressively added into the subsequent layers of the painting in conformance to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule. Another guideline to follow is to use faster drying media (like alkyd) in the lower layers of the painting and use slower drying media (like linseed) in the later layers to ensure the bottom layers dry first. Although Sansodor can be used to reduce the viscosity of these media (thick media like stand oil and alkyds) to increase their flow, it should never exceed 50% of any oil paint medium mixture to ensure proper pigment bonding.|$|R
5000|$|Once major {{structural}} treatments {{have been}} performed and the gesso layer stabilized, {{it is necessary to}} assess the bole layer of the frame. Bole is a mixture of colored clay, glue size, and fat, which is applied on the frame as a base coat for the gilding [...] Typically, the bole layer, which is either red or gray, is revealed in the points of contact of the frame where the gilding has worn off. The color of the bole layer must be closely matched to that of the original bole, as the bole affects the overall tone of the frame.It is essential to determine which gilding process was used before proceeding with the in-gilding process. The two common gilding processes are water gilding and oil gilding. The difference in the two processes is in adhesive coating base. Water gilding is the traditional, more difficult method, which must be cleaned using a <b>mineral</b> <b>spirit</b> or denatured alcohol.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} three customized gels on a 19 th century panel painting {{for the removal of}} its degraded natural resin varnish from a water-gilded surface and a complex solvent-sensitive stratigraphic construction over the gilded substrate. At first, the varnish was unsoiled with a typical hydrogel that was composed of an aqueous phase buffered at pH 5. 5 with sodium acetate, poly(ethylene glycol) p-(1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethylbutyl) -phenyl ether surfactant and hydroxy-prorylmethyl cellulose. The removal of the entire aged varnish was facilitated with a microemulsion of an aqueous phase buffered at pH 8. 5 with triethanolaminate, a fatty phase of a <b>mineral</b> <b>spirit</b> - benzyl alcohol solution and a polyoxy-ethylene(23) lauryl ether surfactant, altogether incorporated in a viscous gel generated from the dissolution of a polyacrylic acid in poly(oxy- 1, 2 -ethanediyl) cocoalkylamine surfactant. The third gel, which was based on a polyacrylic acid of higher viscosity and incorporating a microemulsion of the same aqueous phase (pH 8. 5) as in the second gel, and a fatty phase made of benzyl alcohol and a polyoxyethylene(23) lauryl ether surfactant, enabled the selective removal of the degraded varnish over the elaborate gilded area with a composite stratigraphy over the golden leaf. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV fluorescence imaging were employed for the analysis of the aged varnish and the monitoring of the cleaning procedure, respectively. The conservation procedure determined the effectiveness of the customized gels employed for this special implementation. The fine preservation of the water-gildings and of the complex solvent-sensitive stratigraphic construction of the painted surface was a satisfactory outcome...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (International Trade)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This thesis {{identifies}} realistic export {{opportunities for}} South African {{products in the}} rest of the world and specifically {{in the rest of}} the African continent. The method chosen to achieve this goal is the Decision Support Model (DSM) developed by Cuyvers et al (1995) and Cuyvers (1997) that was specifically designed to assist export promotion institutions in planning and assessing their export promotion activities. This model is positioned into the international market selection literature and four main refinements to the DSM methodology are introduced to address the limitations of the model and to make it more applicable for the South African international trade conditions. The refined model is then applied to identify product–country combinations with the largest export potential for South Africa {{in the rest of the}} world and in the rest of the African continent specifically. The refinements to the DSM filtering process introduced in this study contribute to the effective use and application of the DSM results by South African exporters and more focused export promotion activities by South African export promotion organisations. The four refinements include (i) running the DSM on a HS 6 –digit level, (ii) introducing a method to calculate the potential export value of each identified export opportunity in order to prioritise between the product–country combinations identified as realistic export opportunities, (iii) taking the production capacity of South Africa into consideration in order to identify export opportunities that can be pursued immediately due to the country's existing revealed comparative advantage in the production and exportation of these products and (iv) developing a market accessibility index per product–country combination from a South African point of view on a HS 6 –digit level in order to make filter 3. 2 (barriers to trade) of the DSM applicable for South African conditions. The results of the application of the refined DSM to identify export opportunities for South Africa in the rest of the world include the top 50 worldwide export opportunities. There are 17 countries in which the top 50 worldwide product–country combinations identified as export opportunities for South Africa are located. These include the United States, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, Germany, Israel, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Singapore, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Brazil. Mineral products (coal, copper and aviation spirit); transportation products (1500 - 3000 cc automobile engines and diesel powered trucks); stone/glass (diamonds, platinum and rhodium) and metals (aluminium, iron/steel structures, nickel) are the product classifications within the top 50 worldwide product–country combinations that hold the largest worldwide export potential for South Africa. In terms of the product–country combinations with the highest export potential for South Africa in the rest of the African continent, there are 18 countries in which the top 50 product–country combinations for South Africa in the rest of the African continent are located. These include Nigeria, Namibia, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt, Zambia, Tunisia, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius, Tanzania, Senegal, Mozambique, Algeria, Malawi and Cote d'Ivoire. The products with the highest potential export values in the top 50 product–country combinations for South Africa in Africa include <b>mineral</b> products (aviation <b>spirit,</b> iron ore, sulphur and coal) and transportation products (1500 - 3000 cc automobile engines and diesel powered trucks weighing less than 5 tons).
