50|$|While {{only two}} {{specific}} orientations produce exact <b>gimbal</b> lock, practical <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals</b> encounter difficulties near those orientations. When {{a set of}} gimbals {{is close to the}} locked configuration, small rotations of the gimbal platform require large motions of the surrounding gimbals. Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of gimbal lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the gimbals limit the motion of the platform close to that point.|$|R

5000|$|From {{the first}} orders in 2008 to October 2012, Northrop Grumman {{delivered}} {{half of the}} 174 radars ordered. 18 of the radars on order are a lighter, extended-range version. Weight was reduced by combining the radar power supply and processor and incorporating a Systron Donner inertial system. The new system weights 45 lb. The patch antenna was replaced with a slot antenna, doubling its range to 10 mi. The original STARLite radar is used on the MQ-1C Grey Eagle and the Lockheed Martin Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) aerostat. The company is proposing the lighter version for integration onto small UAVs, including the RQ-7B Shadow, the MQ-8C Fire Scout, and the TigerShark UAS. Other potential customers include the Department of Homeland Security, which flies the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Guardian, and NATO countries. The active electronically scanned radar is mounted on a rotating <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbal</b> with a 360 degree field of regard, although the antenna itself has a 110 degree field of view.

40|$|The Circumstellar Imaging Telescope (CIT) is a 1. 9 m visible {{wavelength}} Cassegrain instrument {{whose primary}} {{mission is to}} locate extra-solar planets by direct imaging. The current reference concept calls {{for it to be}} deployed as a Space Station attached payload some time in the late 1990 s. Mission and signal processing demands impose the following attitude control requirements: pointing accuracy - 250 nrad RMS, pointing stability - 50 nrad RMS over 30 minutes, roll accuracy - 1 mrad RMS, roll stability 1 mrad RMS over 30 minutes. This paper reports on the results of a recent design study in which it was determined that these requirements can be met on the Space Station by a three tiered control system consisting of a two degree of freedom <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbal</b> for course pointing, a magnetically suspended roll bearing for roll accommodation, translational isolation and intermediate pointing control, and articulation of the secondary mirror for fine pointing...|$|E

The device uses electromagnetic forces for support levitation and pointing, both being accomplished from a ground reference thereby leaving the payload virtually free from a remotely located command center. Solid pointing angles of almost 2 (pi) steradians are achievable, {{limited only by}} structural interference. A third degree-of-freedom tilt axis can be added at will, but will not be elaborated.

The so-called [...] "flimbal" [...] (apparently for [...] "FLoated Measurement BAL") would offer unprecedented accuracy and would be free from [...] "gimbal lock", a problem that caused conventional platforms to [...] "tumble" [...] and lose their accuracy. Like the ICBM-X, there was little development as there appeared to be no need for a platform with the sort of accuracy the flimbal provided, and the expense of developing the system would be extremely high.|$|R

40|$|Phased array {{radar systems}} employ {{multiple}} antennas {{to create a}} radar beam that can be steered electronically. By manipulating the relative phase values of feeding signals among different antennas, the effective radiation pattern of the array can be synthesized to enhance the main lobe in a desired direction while suppressing the undesired side lobes in other directions. Hence the radar scanning angles can be electronically controlled without employing the bulky <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbal</b> structure, which can significantly reduce radar system size, weight and power consumption. In recent years, phased array technologies have received great attentions and are explored in developing many new applications, such as smart communication systems, military radars, vehicular radar, etc. Most of these systems are narrow band systems, where the phase delays are realized with narrow band phase shifter circuits. For the impulse ground penetrating radar however, its operating frequency spans an ultrawide bandwidth. Therefore the traditional phase shifters are not applicable due to their narrow band nature. To resolve the issue, in this study, a true time delay approach is explored which can precisely control time delays for the feeding pulse signals among different antennas in the array. In the design, an on chip programmable delay generator is being developed using Global Foundry 0. 18 µm 7 HV high voltage CMOS process. The time delay control is realized by designing a programmable phase locked loop (PLL) circuit which can generate true time delays ranging from 100 ps (picoseconds) to 500 ps with the step size of 25 ps. The PLL oscillator 2 ̆ 7 s frequency is programmable from 100 MHz to 500 MHz through two reconfigurable frequency dividers in the feedback loop. As a result, the antenna beam angle can be synthesized to change from 9. 59 ° to 56. 4 ° with a step of 2. 75 °, and the 3 dB beamwidth is 10 °. The power consumption of the time delay circuit is very low, where the supply voltage is 1. 8 V and the average current is as low as 472 uA...|$|E
40|$|Custom {{fiber optic}} bundle array {{assemblies}} {{developed by the}} Photonics Group at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center were an enabling technology for both the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and the Laser Ranging (LR) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) currently in operation. The unique assembly array designs provided considerable decrease in size and weight and met stringent system level requirements. This {{is the first time}} optical fiber array bundle assemblies were used in a high performance space flight application. This innovation was achieved using customized Diamond Switzerland AVIM optical connectors. For LOLA, a five fiber array was developed for the receiver telescope to maintain precise alignment for each of the 200 / 220 micron optical fibers collecting 1, 064 nm wavelength light being reflected back from the moon. The array splits to five separate detectors replacing the need for multiple telescopes. An image illustration of the LOLA instrument {{can be found at the}} top of the figure. For the laser ranging, a seven-optical-fiber array of 400 / 440 micron fibers was developed to transmit light from behind the LR receiver telescope located on the end of the high gain antenna system (HGAS). The bundle was routed across two moving gimbals, down the HGAS boom arm, over a deployable mandrel and across the spacecraft to a detector on the LOLA instrument. The routing of the optical fiber bundle and its end locations is identified in the figure. The Laser Ranging array and bundle is currently accepting light at a wavelength of 532 nm sent to the moon from laser stations at Greenbelt MD and other stations around the world to gather precision ranging information from the Earth to the LRO spacecraft. The LR bundle assembly is capable of withstanding temperatures down to - 55 C at the connectors, and 20, 000 <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbal</b> cycles at temperatures as cold as - 20 C along the length of the seven-fiber bundle (that is packaged into the gimbals). The total bundle assembly is 10 meters long with two interconnections requiring precise clocking of the seven-fiber array pattern...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop advanced six-degree-of-freedom actuators employing magnetic suspensions suitable for the control of structural vibrations in large space structures. The advanced actuators consist of a magnetically suspended mass that has three-degrees-of-freedom in both translation and rotation. The most promising of these actuators featured a rotating suspended mass providing structural control torques {{in a manner similar to}} a control moment gyro (CMG). These actuators employ large-angle-magnetic suspensions that allow gimballing of the suspended mass without <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals.</b> Design definitions and sizing algorithms for these CMG type as well as angular reaction mass actuators based on multi-degree-of-freedom magnetic suspensions were developed. The performance of these actuators was analytically compared with conventional reaction mass actuators for a simple space structure model...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{addresses the}} feasibility of using magnetically suspended composite rotors to jointly perform the energy and momentum management functions of an advanced manned Space Station. Recent advancements in composite materials, magnetic suspensions, and power conversion electronics have given flywheel concepts the potential to simultaneously perform these functions for large, long duration spacecraft, while offering significant weight, volume, and cost savings over conventional approaches. The Space Station flywheel concept arising out of this study consists of a composite-material rotor, a large-angle magnetic suspension (LAMS) system, an ironless armature motor/generator, and high-efficiency power conversion electronics. The LAMS design permits the application of appropriate spacecraft control torques {{without the use of}} conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals.</b> In addition, flywheel systems have the growth potential and modularity needed to {{play a key role in}} many future system developments...|$|R

40|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom that light bends away from the normal at the interface when it passes from high to low refractive index media, here we demonstrate an exotic phenomenon that the direction of electromagnetic power bends towards the normal when light is incident from arbitrary high refractive index medium to ϵ-near-zero metamaterial. Moreover, {{the direction of the}} transmitted beam is close to the normal for all angles of incidence. In other words, the electromagnetic power coming from different directions in air or arbitrary high refractive index medium can be redirected to the direction almost parallel to the normal upon entering the ϵ-near-zero metamaterial. This phenomenon is counterintuitive to the behavior described by conventional Snell's law and resulted from the interplay between ϵ-near-zero and material loss. This property has potential applications in communications to increase acceptance angle and energy delivery without using optical lenses and <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals...</b>|$|R
5000|$|For MX, the Draper Laboratory {{developed}} SABRE {{into the}} [...] "Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere" [...] (AIRS).

Over {{the period of the}} flight the drift would be so low that any inaccuracies in the platform would account for a maximum of 1% of the warhead's final accuracy-the rest would be due to issues like the timing of the firing of the rocket engines, minor differences in warhead construction, and unavoidable randomness in the atmosphere. The Air Force also contracted with Autonetics for a backup design using <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals,</b> the [...] "Advanced Stable Platform" [...] (ASP). In May 1975 the first hand-built AIRS was transferred from Draper's laboratory to Northrop for further development.|$|R

40|$|A three {{degree of}} freedom (DOF) spherical {{actuator}} is proposed that will replace functions requiring three single DOF actuators in robotic manipulators providing space and weight savings while reducing the overall failure rate. Exploration satellites, Space Station payload manipulators, and rovers requiring pan, tilt, and rotate movements need an actuator for each function. Not only does each actuator introduce additional failure modes and require bulky <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals,</b> each contains many moving parts, decreasing mean time to failure. A conventional robotic manipulator {{is shown in figure}} 1. Spherical motors perform all three actuation functions, i. e., three DOF, with only one moving part. Given a standard three actuator system whose actuators have a given failure rate compared to a spherical motor with an equal failure rate, the three actuator system is three times as likely to fail over the latter. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory reliability studies of NASA robotic spacecraft have shown that mechanical hardware/mechanism failures are more frequent and more likely to significantly affect mission success than are electronic failures. Unfortunately, previously designed spherical motors have been unable to provide the performance needed by space missions. This inadequacy is also why they are unavailable commercially. An improved patentable spherically actuated motor (SAM) is proposed to provide the performance and versatility required by NASA missions...|$|R
40|$|The {{airborne}} Conical Scanning Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer (CoSMIR) {{will provide}} measurements useful for atmospheric studies and satellite calibration and validation (cal/val). Designed {{to match the}} tropospheric sounding channels of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program QMSP) Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), the CoSMIR consists of four radiometers operating at 50 - 54 (3 channels - 50. 3, 52. 8, and 53. 6), 91. 655 (dual polarization), 150. 0, and 193. 31 (3 channels 11, 13, and 16. 6) GHz. The design of CoSMIR was primarily driven by its intended initial use as an SSMIS cal/val sensor. In particular, three design features were directly affected by this requirement: frequency planning, calibration target design, and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>gimbals.</b> An initial calibration assessment of CoSMIR was performed to determine any needed improvements. We used a combination of laboratory and field measurements to do this. Laboratory measurements included comparisons to a liquid nitrogen standard, IF amplifier and diode linearity tests, LO leakage and reflection testing, and antenna to calibration target coupling tests. Results of these tests will be reported. We also performed a satellite underflight under DM SP F- 15 and have compared CoSMIR imagery to SSM/T- 2 and SSM/I imagery.
