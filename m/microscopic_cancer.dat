40|$|A current {{problem in}} {{medicine}} and specifically breast cancer is the detection of <b>microscopic</b> <b>cancer</b> in surgical margins to ensure all of the cancer has been removed. Current methods rely on extensive pathology work that may take several days to complete. For breast cancer patients, positive findings for cancer in surgical margins require follow-up surgery to remove more tissue.

Such methods would reduce risks, costs, and patient suffering that accompany follow-up operations. Ultrasound is a promising in vivo detection method due to its low cost, portability, and ability to detect tissue changes arising from cancer. Recent simulations modeling very high frequency (VHF) ultrasonic wave reflections show differences between the reflection signals of a normal breast cell monolayer and tumor cell monolayer.

S 1 treatment might be effective for some patients if we can select the good responder to S 1 treatment or arrange the optimal dose of drug [13]. In this case, S 1 treatment plus radiotherapy was eventually effective. However, {{it was difficult to}} determine when adjuvant S 1 treatment was finished.

Translational research is required for finding the biomarker selecting those patients responsive to 5 -FU based treatment or the new strategy of how to use 5 -FU based chemotherapeutic agent and how long to continue the treatment. Since the efficacy of radiotherapy alone is limited in terms of the locoregional therapy, the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems to be best additional option to control residual cancer cells at the locoregional area as well as latent cells in distant organ.

40|$|Breast cancer {{remains the}} most common cancer in women in the {{developed}} world and the most frequent cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide [1]. In 2010 in the United States, the estimated number of new cases of breast cancer was 207, 090 (28 % of all cancer in women), with 39, 840 expected deaths (second cause of death after lung and bronchus carcinoma) [2]. Fortunately, thanks to the screening campaigns carried out in the Western countries, breast cancer can be treated in its early phase. The conventional surgical treatment for early breast cancer consists of either a mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS), often accompanied by axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If BCS is performed, whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with doses around 50 - 60 Gy remains the gold standard for local control. The benefit of postoperative radiotherapy is well known since the completion of few prospective randomized trials conducted in the years 1976 - 1990, which compared conservative surgery and radiation with conservative surgery alone. Several clinical trials compared also breast conservative surgery (BCS) alone vs. BCS followed by whole breast (WB) EBRT: 10 - 35 % of women receiving BCS alone showed locoregional recurrence, whilst it occurred only in 0. 3 - 8 % of women after BCS plus WB-EBRT (follow-up range: 39 - 102 months), although both treatments produced the same 10 -year overall survival rates [3]. However, there is some recent evidence that lack of radiotherapy is associated with an increased hazard ratio for death [4]. Current accepted treatment protocol takes advantage of the above experiences and consists of BCS, usually accompanied by axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If BCS is performed, it is almost always accompanied by postoperative regional radiotherapy; 2 Gy per day delivered five times a week for 6 - 8 weeks, for a total dose of 50 - 60 Gy to eliminate <b>microscopic</b> <b>cancer</b> foci remaining after surgery [5].

40|$|ABSTRACT Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) {{consists}} of using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing tumor-selective antigens, as carriers of cytotoxic radionuclides to tumor tissue. RIT {{has been effective}} in lymphoma but less successful in solid tumors. mAbs slowly diffuse from the vasculature into and through solid tumors, resulting in slow, limited accretion of antibodies. The outcome is a low tumor-to-normal tissue (T/N) activity ratio. Hence high activities (MBq) for therapy are needed to achieve sufficient tumor dose. The dose-limiting factor is myelotoxicity caused mainly by slow clearance of mAbs from the circulation. Methods: Extracorporeal depletion of radioactivity in blood is one strategy to increase T/N ratios and reduce toxicity. Extracorporeal affinity adsorption treatment (ECAT) {{is based on the}} biotin-avidin system utilizing the high-affinity interaction between avidin and biotin. Antibodies are radiolabeled and biotinylated using a trifunctional protein reagent. By passing whole blood extracorporeally through a column coated with avidin, radioimmunoconjugates are adsorbed in the column and eliminated from the circulation. Aim: To investigate and optimize ECAT in an imunocompetent syngeneic rat tumor model. Results: We established a suitable model for evaluation of the toxicity-reducing potential of ECAT, strategies to increase administered activities, and for the comparison of different radionuclides. In addition we developed a new technique for gaining blood access via the tail which requires no surgery, causes minimal stress to the animals and allows several animals to be studied simultaneously. ECAT reduces myelotoxicity associated with RIT. The timing of ECAT influences the duration and degree of bone marrow recovery and toxicity-reducing effect. The maximal tolerable dose of 177 Lu- or 90 Y-labeled RIC can be increased 2. 0 or 1. 5 times, respectively. ECAT is efficient as a means of removing biotinylated antibodies in a two-step pretargeting therapy concept, and would probably also be efficient as a clearing step in pretargeting strategies employing streptavidin-conjugated mAbs followed by the administration of radiolabelled biotin. Our rat tumor model with the tumor cell line used is not optimal for the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of high-dose RIT in combination with ECAT because of the favorable radiation “sensitivity” ratio of rats, which results in efficient tumor therapy even without ECAT. RIT with 90 Y and 177 Lu seems not to be effective on <b>microscopic</b> <b>cancer</b> disease due to the radiation energy being deposited outside the tumor cell cluster...|$|E
30|$|HDGC (OMIM # 137215) is an {{autosomal}} dominant genetic predisposition cancer syndrome with high penetrance. Between 25 and 30  % {{of cases of}} HDGC are caused by mutations in E-cadherin gene (CDH 1) (Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). This gene maps to chromosome 16 q 22.1, consists of 16 exons and encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin (Masciari et al. 2007). To date, more than 180 different germline CDH 1 mutations {{have been identified in}} HDGC families in a diverse range of ethnic groups. Mutation carriers have a cumulative risk of GC at 80  years of 70  % for men and 56  % in women, together with a high probability of lobular breast cancer in females (Corso et al. 2014; Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). Germline CDH 1 mutations have been identified in approximately 15 – 50  % of affected kindreds that meet the clinical criteria for HDGC. The wide range of this estimate has to do with both, the background incidence of gastric cancer and the criteria used to define the syndrome. According to the new guidelines, defined in 2015, CDH 1 testing should be considered in patients who meet one of the following criteria (including first and second degree relatives): (1) 2 GC cases regardless of age, at least one confirmed diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); (2) one case of DGC before 40  years old or (3) personal or family history of DGC and LBC, one diagnosed before 50  years old. In addition, testing could be considered in families with: (1) Bilateral lobular breast cancer (LBC) or family history of 2 or more cases of LBC before 50  years old; (2) A personal of family history of cleft lip/palate in a patient with DGC or (3) in situ signet ring cells and/or pagetoid spread of signet ring cells (van der Post et al. 2015). Because DGC is often asymptomatic until in its advanced stages, the diagnosis is often delayed and, as a result, the prognosis is poor. Thus, according to current guidelines, prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) should be strongly advised in asymptomatic carriers of CDH 1 pathogenic mutations, since {{this is the only way}} to completely eradicate their risk of GC; furthermore, almost 100  % of performed gastrectomies revealed the presence of <b>microscopic</b> <b>cancer</b> foci The optimal timing for the surgery is under debate, although most procedures are performed between the ages of 20 and 30  years, and current guidelines advocate this (Monahan and Hopkins 2016, van der Post et al. 2015).|$|E

Intraoperative detection of <b>microscopic</b> residual <b>cancer</b> in the tumor bed {{could be used to}} decrease the risk of a positive surgical margin, reduce rates of reexcision, and tailor adjuvant therapy. We used a protease-activated fluorescent imaging probe, LUM 015, to detect cancer in vivo in a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and ex vivo in a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial. In mice, intravenous injection of LUM 015 labeled tumor cells, and residual fluorescence within the tumor bed predicted local recurrence. In 15 patients with STS or breast cancer, intravenous injection of LUM 015 before surgery was well tolerated. Imaging of resected human tissues showed that fluorescence from tumor was significantly higher than fluorescence from normal tissues. LUM 015 biodistribution, pharmacokinetic profiles, and metabolism were similar in mouse and human subjects. Tissue concentrations of LUM 015 and its metabolites, including fluorescently labeled lysine, demonstrated that LUM 015 is selectively distributed to tumors where it is activated by proteases. Experiments in mice with a constitutively active PEGylated fluorescent imaging probe support a model where tumor-selective probe distribution is a determinant of increased fluorescence in cancer. These co-clinical studies suggest that the tumor specificity of protease-activated imaging probes, such as LUM 015, is dependent on both biodistribution and enzyme activity.

Subsequently, the FDs at different image orientations are analyzed. Results from both horizontal and vertical landscape sequences indicate that a region of stromal cells has the FD value higher than a region of cancer cells and a region of lymphocytes; in contrast, a region of lymphocytes has the FD value lower than other two regions. Results of the p values obtained from analysis-of-variance of FDs from three regions of histological structures indicate that the difference between mean FDs of three regions from vertical landscape is statistically more significant than that of three regions from horizontal landscape. Texture features computed from the CEA method can be useful for solving the classification of breast <b>cancer</b> cell from <b>microscopic</b> images that is difficult to classify if a colour feature and a spatial feature, notably shape, of cells are similar to each other...|$|R
40|$|Soft Tissue Sarcomas are a rare {{group of}} mesenchymal tumors with over 50 {{recognized}} subtypes. These tumors are {{a diverse group}} of malignancies that primarily arise from the connective tissue, fat and muscle. In the United States, there are estimated to be approximately 11, 000 new diagnoses a year with an annual mortality rate approaching 40 %. Unfortunately, with such a diversity of subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma, and the relative scarcity of patient samples, {{there is a need for}} animal models that faithfully recapitulate the biology of these tumors. Such animal models would be useful for dissecting the underlying biology of soft tissue sarcomas and to evaluate novel therapies. One such model is the LSL-KrasG 12 D; p 53 Flox/Flox mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma. These tumors are generated in a spatial and temporally restricted fashion and closely mimic the natural history of human soft tissue sarcomas, including a predilection to develop lung metastases. Here I will characterize this model of soft tissue sarcoma by: 1) performing cross species genomic comparisons to show that the LSL-KrasG 12 D; p 53 Flox/Flox mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma most closely resembles Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma, 2) utilizing this mouse model to identify cathepsin proteases as molecular markers of soft tissue sarcoma. I will then use cathepsin activated imaging probes for intraoperative molecular imaging to identify <b>microscopic</b> residual <b>cancer</b> in real time. Finally, 3) I identify a novel mechanism through which MAPK signaling regulates miRNA biogenesis and the development of distant metastases in the LSL-KrasG 12 D; p 53 Flox/Flox mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma.

40|$|Abstract Introduction To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a {{multifocal}} (trifocal) invasive carcinoma of the breast containing osteoclast-like giant cells. Case presentation A 64 -year-old Caucasian woman presented for routine mammography screening with three radiodense lesions in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast, a primary breast <b>cancer.</b> <b>Microscopic</b> examination showed three foci of invasive ductal carcinoma with multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells. Osteoclast-like giant cells in breast cancer are a rare phenomenon. They are described in less than two percent of all breast cancers and occur in association with invasive ductal cancer and invasive lobular cancer. In addition, osteoclast-like giant cells have been described in several sarcomas and metaplastic carcinomas of the breast. Conclusion To {{the best of}} our knowledge, this is the first report of a multifocal infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast containing osteoclast-like giant cells. This could be an indication for a possible early event in carcinogenesis associated with a biological event or secretion that indicates the differentiation and/or migration of stromal cells or macrophages. </p...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{theory was}} used to {{calculate}} the optimum treatment of <b>microscopic</b> squamous cervical <b>cancer</b> using probabilities obtained from an exhaustive literature review and a range of plausible value estimates. This showed that if there is no vascular involvement, survival is maximised by conservative treatment if tumour invasion is less than 3 mm while treatment by radical surgery results in maximal survival rates if the tumour invasion is over 3 mm. Radical surgery also maximises survival for smaller lesions where lymph channel involvement is present, especially if a surgical mortality {{at the lower end of}} the reported range is assumed. Refinement of our analysis to include an assessment of patient values showed that these conclusions are still valid regardless of the patient's relative preference for death from surgery or death from cancer. However, the wish to preserve fertility sharply reduces the overall net benefit of surgery. Conservative treatment becomes the preferred option for all microinvasive lesions even for patients who are prepared to trade-off a small (e. g. 2 %) risk of death in order to retain their fertility...|$|R
40|$|The current {{difficulty}} in visualizing the true extent of malignant brain tumors during surgical resection {{represents one of}} the major reasons for the poor prognosis of brain tumor patients. Here, we evaluated the ability of a hand-held Raman scanner, guided by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles, to identify the microscopic tumor extent in a genetically engineered RCAS/tv-a glioblastoma mouse model. In a simulated intraoperative scenario, we tested both a static Raman imaging device and a mobile, hand-held Raman scanner. We show that SERS image-guided resection is more accurate than resection using white light visualization alone. Both methods complemented each other, and correlation with histology showed that SERS nanoparticles accurately outlined the extent of the tumors. Importantly, the hand-held Raman probe not only allowed near real-time scanning, but also detected additional <b>microscopic</b> foci of <b>cancer</b> in the resection bed that were not seen on static SERS images and would otherwise have been missed. This technology has a strong potential for clinical translation because it uses inert gold-silica SERS nanoparticles and a hand-held Raman scanner that can guide brain tumor resection in the operating room...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} extract cancer affected area from a histopatholical image of bone cancer. Existing approaches are manual, time-consuming and subjective. In the proposed approach, morphology technique is used to find the area affected in the bone cell and extract the same using adaptive threshold technique. To get more accurate segmentation, watershed algorithm is used which will separate the attached tissue cells. In this method we used nucleus size, area, orientation to define malignancy level. Experiment results show that, using the proposed method, the meaningful features in the background with heterogeneous intensities are appropriately segmented. Bone tissue samples contain several cell type and these cells including blood cells, normal cells, and cancerous cells. Nuclear size and shape are good visual descriptors {{which is used to}} differentiate normal and cancer cell. This method successfully demonstrated an automated image segmentation technique to overcome noise due to staining process from bone <b>cancer</b> <b>microscopic</b> images and provide accurate analysis of nuclear size and density with a comparable difference from normal bone histology. The automatic segmentation resulted in a sensitivity of 76. 4 %, defined as the percentage of hand segmented nuclei that were automatically segmented with good quality...|$|R
