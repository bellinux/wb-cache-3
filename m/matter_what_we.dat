500|$|The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its {{commitment}} to Bryant by stating that it [...] "wholeheartedly support(ed)" [...] her right to free speech, praising her [...] "courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> decide, we're only going to lose. I wish she would just resign." [...] Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.|$|E
500|$|Tonight is {{a concept}} album that explores the highs and lows {{associated}} with an evening of debauchery, as stated by a critic on online publication Ventvox. [...] "This album covers all its bases from the initial excitement of the early evening to the numbness of the morning after", writes the reviewer. The line [...] "come on, let's get high" [...] from [...] "Ulysses", the album's first track, reveals this theme. The album has been influenced by non-British music. It has been inspired by the [...] "heavy dub sound of Jamaican reggae stars" [...] and has [...] "the heavy bass and space echo you would find on a dub mix." [...] The album also has somewhat of an African influence. Alex Kapranos stated in an XFM article that [...] "We're one of these bands that are always gonna sound the same no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do, {{but there are other}} influences there. I guess the drums are a little different, Paul has been listening to a lot of African stuff so that's gonna come through." ...|$|E

[...] Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was Oklahoma! (1943). [...] Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is [...] "the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. [...] In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma! and what came after it." [...] An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would serve, according to Hischak, as [...] "the model for Broadway shows for decades", and proved a huge popular and financial success. [...] Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. [...] Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers [...] "was Sam's blunt but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma!" [...] As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, [...] "We're such fools. [...] No <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another Oklahoma!

500|$|Universal spent $1.8 million {{promoting}} Jaws, {{including an}} unprecedented $700,000 {{on national television}} spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, {{in the description of}} film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal [...] "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" [...] for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that [...] "no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that [...] "you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E

500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo {{is subject to the}} whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live a life without choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of our former selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E

2500|$|The Devil {{is nearly}} indestructible, and scoffs {{at the idea}} that he could be {{contained}} within a Solomon's cage (which can confine the strongest demon).

In addition, the Devil cannot see, hear, or appear within curves or circles, although he can be summoned within a circle. He holds no influence over true love, which may be attributed to his belief that humans are incapable of experiencing it. The Devil also confesses that even though he tried to overthrow God, he still loved Him when Sam asked the Devil about love.
