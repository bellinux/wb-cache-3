60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sessions, of Panama, {{had gone}} to New York. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions</b> was in machinery. They liked New York. They lived in a flat and went to theaters. Mrs. Sessions was a pillowy soul whom Una trusted.|$|E
60|$|They {{went to a}} {{marvelous}} caf√©, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions</b> astounded them by the urbanity with which he hurried captains and waiters and 'bus-boys, and ordered lobster and coffee, and pretended {{that he was going}} to be wicked and have wine and cigarettes.|$|E
60|$|On {{the night}} before the funeral she refused to let even <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sessions</b> stay with her. She did not want to share her mother's shadowy {{presence}} with any one.|$|R
60|$|She saw a {{quadrangle}} {{of white}} on the table, behind a book. She pounced on it. It was a letter from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Sessions,</b> and Una scratched it open excitedly.|$|R

60|$|Months afterward, {{when she}} was going to {{vaudeville}} by herself, Una tried to identify the theater of wizardry, but she never could. The Sessionses couldn't remember which theater it was; they thought it was the Pitt, but surely they must have been mistaken, for the Pitt was a shanty daubed with grotesque nudes, rambling and pretentious, with shockingly amateurish programs. And afterward, on the occasion or two when they went out to dinner with the Sessionses, it seemed to Una that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions</b> was provincial in restaurants, too deprecatingly friendly with the waiters, too hesitating about choosing dinner.|$|E
60|$|Her {{agitation}} {{was increased}} by {{the problem of}} keeping up the maiden modesty appropriate to a Golden, a young female friend of the Sessionses', in a small flat with gentlemen lodgers and just one bathroom. Una was saved by not having a spinster friend with whom to share her shrinking modesty. She simply had to take waiting for her turn at the bathroom {{as a matter of}} course, and insensibly she was impressed by the decency with which these dull, ordinary people solved the complexities of their enforced intimacy. When she wildly clutched her virgin bathrobe about her and passed a man in the hall, he stalked calmly by without any of the teetering apologies which broad-beamed <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions</b> had learned from his genteel spouse.|$|E
60|$|The funeral {{filled the}} house with intruders. The drive to the {{cemetery}} was irritating. She wanted to leap out of the carriage.

But some one was talking to her. (It was awkward <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions,</b> for shrewd Mrs. Sessions had the genius to keep still.) He kept stammering the most absurd platitudes about how happy her mother must be in a heaven regarding which he did not seem to have very recent or definite knowledge. She was annoyed, not comforted. She wanted to break away, to find her mother's presence again in that sacred place where she had so recently lived and spoken.|$|E

40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of a Synthetic Proteasome Inhibitor (PSI) in rats {{has been described}} as able to provide a model of Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by behavioral and biochemical modifications, including loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), as assessed by post-mortem studies. With the present study we aimed to assess in-vivo by Magnetic Resonance (MR) possible morphological and metabolic changes in the nigro-striatal pathway of PSI-treated rats. 10 animals were subcutaneously injected with PSI 6. 0 mg/kg dissolved in DMSO 100 %. Injections were made thrice weekly over the course of two weeks. 5 more animals injected with DMSO 100 % with the same protocol served as controls. The animals underwent <b>MR</b> <b>sessions</b> before and at four weeks after the end of treatment with either PSI or vehicle. MR Imaging was performed to measure SN volume and Proton MR Spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) was performed to measure metabolites changes at the striatum. Animals were also assessed for motor function at baseline and at 4 and 6 weeks after treatment. Dopamine and dopamine metabolite levels were measured in the striata at 6 weeks after treatment. PSI-treated animals showed volumetric reduction of the SN (p< 0. 02) at 4 weeks after treatment as compared to baseline. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed MRI changes in SN showing a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase expression as compared to neuron-specific enolase expression. A reduction of N-acetyl-aspartate/total creatine ratio (p = 0. 05) and an increase of glutamate-glutamine-Œ≥ amminobutirrate/total creatine were found at spectroscopy (p = 0. 03). At 6 weeks after treatment, PSI-treated rats also showed motor dysfunction compared to baseline (p = 0. 02), accompanied by dopamine level reduction in the striatum (p = 0. 02). Treatment with PSI produced morphological and metabolic modifications of the nigro-striatal pathway, accompanied by motor dysfunction.

40|$|Attentional {{processes}} are fundamental to good cognitive functioning of human operators. The {{purpose of this}} study was to analyze the activity of neuronal networks involved in the orienting attention and executive control processes from the perspective of diurnal variability. Twenty-three healthy male volunteers meeting magnetic resonance (MR) inclusion criteria performed the Stroop Color-Word task (block design) in the MR scanner five times/day (06 : 00, 10 : 00, 14 : 00, 18 : 00, 22 : 00 h). The first scanning session was scheduled 1 ‚Äì 1. 5 h after waking. Between <b>MR</b> <b>sessions,</b> subjects performed simulated driving tasks in stable environmental conditions, with controlled physical activity and diet. Significant activation was found in brain regions related to the orienting attentional system: the parietal lobe (BA 40) and frontal eyefields (FEFs). There were also activations in areas of the executive control system: the fronto-insular cortex (FIC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), presupplementary motor area (preSMA), supplementary motor area (SMA), basal ganglia, middletemporal (MT; BA 21), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as a part of the central executive network. Significant deactivations were observed in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), superior frontal gyrus (SF), parietal lobe (BA 39), and parahippocampal that are thought to comprise the default mode network (DMN). Additionally, the activated regions included bilaterally lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus. The insula was bilaterally deactivated. Visual attention controlled by the goal-oriented attention system and comprising top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, activated by Stroop-like task, turned out to be prone to diurnal changes. The study results show the occurrence of time-of-day‚Äìrelated variations in neural activity of brain regions linked to the orienting attentional system (left parietal lobe-BA 40, left and right FEFs), simultaneously providing arguments for temporal stability of the executive system and default mode network. These results also seem to suggest that the involuntary, exogenous (bottom-up) mechanism of attention is more vulnerable to circadian and fatigue factors than the voluntary (top-down) mechanism, which appear to be maintained at the same functional level during the day. The above phenomena were observed at the neural level...|$|E

40|$|Genome wide {{association}} {{studies have}} provided {{evidence for a}} significant association between ZNF 804 A (zinc finger protein 804 A) - specifically the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 1344706 - and schizophrenia, but {{little is known about}} the function of the gene or the effects of the SNP. By studying post-mortem human brain tissue, I characterised ZNF 804 A immunoreactivity in adult and foetal human brain and investigated effects of diagnosis and rs 1344706 genotype on ZNF 804 A mRNA and protein expression. Secondly, I looked in a large sample of healthy volunteers (n= 922) at the effects of rs 1344706 on brain structure using volumetry and voxel based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, I recruited healthy volunteers who were either homozygous for the risk allele or homozygous for the non-risk allele (n= 50). They participated in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance (<b>MR)</b> <b>sessions</b> in which brain activity was measured during a working memory task, a visual processing task, and rest. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, also neurotransmitter levels were assessed. The experiments conducted for this thesis showed for the first time that ZNF 804 A immunoreactivity can be detected in both foetal and adult human brain and that it is mainly localised to layer III pyramidal cells, with a granular subcellular distribution throughout the cytoplasm. No effect of rs 1344706 on mRNA and protein expression was found. In our structural MRI study, rs 1344706 did not affect macroscopic brain structure as measured by volumetry and VBM, and given the large sample size, this seems a convincing negative. However, we did find that rs 1344706 alters prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity, with increased connectivity being observed in risk homozygotes. Additionally, using MEG, we found an effect of ZNF 804 A genotype on hippocampal connectivity in the theta band (4 - 8 Hz), with non-risk homozygotes displaying more connectivity. This finding provides a first clue as to the mechanisms that might underlie the previously observed effects of rs 1344706 on prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity. Future studies will need to elucidate the actual function of the ZNF 804 A protein, in order to bridge the gap between the molecular and neuroimaging findings described in this thesis.

40|$|Background: Health {{literacy}} {{as defined}} by Healthy People 2010, the national health initiative, is 2 ÃÜ 2 {{the degree to which}} individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. 2 ÃÜ 2 In order for patients to properly take medication, follow treatment instructions, and ask the appropriate questions of their medical providers, adequate health literacy is essential. Many studies have suggested a low level of health literacy corresponds to poor health outcomes, including higher medical costs, higher rates of disease and death, and increased hospitalization rates. The most recent National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL), conducted in 2003 by the National Center for Education Statistics, found that only 12 percent of the adult population had a Proficient level of health literacy. Of the remaining population, 53 percent had Intermediate health literacy, 22 percent had a Basic concept of health literacy and 14 percent were considered Below Basic. Given these statistics, physicians and other medical providers should be striving to know the literacy rates of their patient population and adjust their interactions and patient education materials {{to meet the needs of}} their patients 2 ÃÜ 7 understanding. Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to assess the health literacy of the general adult population of Northern Oregon/Southern Washington metropolitan areas. It is a continuation of a study on adult health literacy that began last year by a previous Pacific University Physician Assistant Student, Henry Sessions. Last year, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions</b> found the rate of Adequate health literacy levels in a local family practice clinic, at 95 percent, to be much higher than the national average of 62 percent, (if the Proficient and Intermediate levels from NAAL are combined). This year 2 ÃÜ 7 s authors were interested in discovering if the local literacy rate would approximate the national average, given a larger, more diverse sample population from a non-medical setting. They were interested in determining if there was a correlation in socioeconomic status, age, or ethnicity with adult health literacy rates. In addition, they hypothesized that people who see their medical providers frequently are more educated in medical jargon and disease processes, and, therefore, have a higher rate of health literacy. Study Design: Continuation study. Methods: Adult residents of Oregon and Washington were asked to fill out a short demographic survey and then complete a short, standardized medical-literacy test, the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (s-TOFHLA). Multiple non-medical sites were used for participant recruitment, including several area churches, community recreation exercise facilitates, and private homes. As an incentive, participants where entered into a drawing for a 250 Best Buy gift card. Adults with medical conditions were identified and asked the frequency of their medical visits. This population group was then compared with one that reported neither medical conditions nor regular provider visits. Microsoft Excel and Statistix 8. 1 software was used to analyze the data and compare variables of interest, such as gender, age and income. Results: This year, 289 s-TOFHLA 2 ÃÜ 7 s were completed by adults, ages 18 years or older, who live in either Oregon or Washington. Last year 2 ÃÜ 7 s sample consisted of 123 completed sTOFHLA 2 ÃÜ 7 s. This year 2 ÃÜ 7 s Adequate literacy rate, at 94. 5 percent, was comparable to that found last year. Combining the two sample sets for a total population of 412, the overall Adequate literacy rate was 94. 7 percent, with 5. 3 percent having a Marginal or Inadequate health literacy rate. The data showed a positive correlation between higher scores and more education (p= 3 ÃÜc 0. 001) as well as increased income (p= 0. 003). There was also a positive correlation between people that had more medical problems and a higher score (p= 0. 008). Caucasians scored higher than all other races. It also showed a negative correlation with age and scores. Typically those over age 65 scored lower on the s-TOHFLA (p= 0. 002). There was no correlation between score and gender, score and type of provider seen or type of insurance. Conclusion: The researchers this year had similar results as those found by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sessions</b> last year. Combined and individual study results showed that the Vancouver/Portland areas had a much higher adult health literacy rate as measured by the written s-TOFHLA than the national average. People with higher income and education were more likely to score the highest while people over age 65 were more likely to score lower. People that claimed to have more medical problems scored higher on the s-TOFHLA...|$|E
