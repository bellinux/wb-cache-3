500|$|Cochrane {{returned}} to Imperieuse immediately and the frigate then sailed from Plymouth to join Gambier. The admiral had received direct orders from Mulgrave on 26 March ordering him {{to prepare for}} an attack, to which he sent two letters, one agreeing with the order and another disputing it {{on the grounds that}} the water was too shallow and the batteries on Île-d'Aix too dangerous. Gambier did not however learn of the leadership of the operation until Cochrane joined the fleet on 3 April and presented Mulgrave's orders to the admiral. The effect was dramatic; Harvey, one of Nelson's Band of Brothers who had fought at Trafalgar, launched into a furious tirade directed at Gambier, accusing him of incompetence and <b>malicious</b> <b>conduct,</b> comparing him unfavourably to Nelson and calling Cochrane's appointment an [...] "insult to the fleet". Gambier dismissed Harvey, sending him and his 80-gun HMS Tonnant back to Britain in disgrace to face a court-martial, and then ordered Cochrane to begin preparations for the attack. Gambier also issued Cochrane with Methodist tracts to distribute to his crew. Cochrane ignored the order, but sent some of the tracts to his friend William Cobbett with a letter describing conditions with the fleet. Cobbett, a Radical journalist, wrote articles in response which later inflamed religious opinion in Britain against Cochrane during the scandal which followed the battle.|$|E

40|$|That {{states are}} subject to an {{obligation}} to prevent their cyber infrastructure from being used in a manner injurious to the international legal rights of other states is well established in customary international law. This obligation imposes a dual duty upon states. The first duty is an obligation of result insofar as it requires states to implement the laws and institutions necessary to prevent and punish <b>malicious</b> cyber <b>conduct</b> emanating from their territory, although international law confers upon states a wide margin of appreciation in deciding the design and content of such measures. The second duty is an obligation of conduct {{in the sense that}} where a threat emanates from their cyber infrastructure and states have (actual or constructive) knowledge of that threat they must act reasonably in utilising their capacity and resources to suppress it. What is reasonable in the circumstances will depend upon various factors operating at the time such as the resources available to the state and the risks involved in the particular activity. Taken together, these duties construct an international legal obligation which offers states a certain degree of protection from <b>malicious</b> transboundary cyber <b>conduct</b> committed by non-state actors.

50|$|It is {{no answer}} to the case made by the {{petition}} to say, as the defendant, by his counsel, does, that {{the judgment of the}} plaintiff is still in force and bearing interest, and the liability of the county still remains undisturbed. What is a judgment worth that cannot be enforced? The gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint is that the defendants have obstructed, and continue to obstruct, the collection of his judgment, and he avers that he has been damaged thereby to the amount of his judgment and interest; in other words, that by reason of the unlawful and <b>malicious</b> <b>conduct</b> of the defendants, his judgment has been rendered worthless. To reply to this that the judgment still remains in force on the records of the court is an inadequate answer to the plaintiff's cause of action.|$|E
50|$|An {{action for}} {{alienation}} of affection does not require proof of extramarital sex. An alienation claim is difficult to establish because it comprises several elements {{and there are several}} defenses. To succeed on an alienation claim, the plaintiff has to show that (1) the marriage entailed love between the spouses in some degree; (2) the spousal love was alienated and destroyed; and (3) the defendant's <b>malicious</b> <b>conduct</b> contributed to or caused the loss of affection. It is not necessary to show that the defendant set out to destroy the marital relationship, but only that he or she intentionally engaged in acts which would foreseeably impact the marriage. Thus, the defendant has a defense against an alienation claim where it can be shown that he or she did not know that the object of his or her affections was in fact married. It is not a defense that the guilty spouse consented to the defendant's conduct, but it might be a defense that the defendant was not the active and aggressive seducer. If the defendant's conduct was somehow inadvertent, the plaintiff would be unable to show intentional or malicious action. But prior marital problems do not establish a defense unless such unhappiness had reached a level of negating love between the spouses.|$|E

40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{presents a}} typology of sexting episodes {{based on a}} review of over 550 cases obtained from a national sur‐ vey of law enforcement agencies. The cases all involved “youth‐produced sexual images, ” defined as images of minors created by minors that could qualify as child pornography under applicable criminal statutes. The episodes could be broadly divided into two categories, which we termed ‘Aggravated ’ and ‘Experimental’. Aggravated incidents involved criminal or abusive elements beyond the creation, sending or possession of youth‐produced sexual images. These addi‐ tional elements included 1) adult involvement; or 2) criminal or abusive behavior by minors such as sexual abuse, ex‐ tortion, threats; <b>malicious</b> <b>conduct</b> arising from interpersonal conflicts; or creation or sending or showing of images without the knowledge or against the will of a minor who was pictured. In Experimental incidents, by contrast, youth took pictures of themselves to send to established boy ‐ or girlfriends, to create romantic interest in other youth, or for reasons such as attention‐seeking, {{but there was no}} criminal behavior beyond the creation or sending of images, no apparent malice and no lack of willing participation by youth who were pictured.

40|$|The Second Circuit has {{recently}} {{joined in a}} longstanding circuit split regarding {{the interpretation of the}} phrase “exceeds authorized access” under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The split centers around whether an otherwise authorized computer user who violates usage restrictions has exceeded authorized access. In United States v. Valle, the Second Circuit answered the question in the negative. Upon finding the phrase to be ambiguous, the Second Circuit invoked lenity, and therefore narrowly construed their interpretation in the defendant’s favor. This note argues that the Second Circuit was correct to apply lenity as the plain meaning of the phrase, the legislative history, and other similar statutes involving access, provide support for both sides of the split—rendering its interpretation fatally ambiguous. Additionally, by not narrowly construing the phrase, it would allow for arbitrary and draconian enforcement, as the lowest tier of punishment could plausibly criminalize any violation of a computer usage policy, no matter how minimal. Further, this note argues that under this narrow interpretation, the phrase becomes superfluous. To remedy this, {{and at the same time}} dissolve any ambiguity and policy concerns, the CFAA should be amended to expressly allow for an improper use analysis, but only if the alleged access violation is in conjunction with the <b>malicious</b> <b>conduct</b> enumerated in the CFAA’s second tier of punishment...|$|E

30|$|The {{rationale}} behind HTMS {{is to find}} {{a solution to the problem}} where a privileged node is compromised by an attacker and then used to damage the network in some way. This could be by trying to attack other nodes, or by <b>conducting</b> <b>malicious</b> transactions with servers. One transaction on its own may not seem malicious, but when a combination of potentially harmful transactions occur globally throughout the network, the results could be disastrous. For instance, one update by a colonel to battle plans may not seem harmful, but a series of small updates over time may change the battle plans entirely. HTMS aims to thwart such attacks by collecting data from multiple parties that have transacted with the node before, and then deciding whether to grant access to this node using a global picture.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{security}} properties of Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) protocols, especially the difference caused by on-demand and proactive route queries. The on-demand route query enables the <b>malicious</b> host to <b>conduct</b> real time attacks on AODV. The communication overhead {{of attacks on}} DSDV is independent of the attack methods and the width of attack targets. A single false route propagates slower in AODV than in DSDV. The detection of false destination sequence in AODV heavily depends on the mobility of hosts. False distance vector and false destination sequence attacks are studied by simulation. The delivery ratio, communication overhead, and the propagation of false routes are measured by varying the traffic load and the maximum speed of host movement. The anomalous patterns of sequence numbers detected by destination hosts {{can be applied to}} detect the false destination sequence attacks. 1...|$|R

Authorship analysis is the statistical study of linguistic and computational characteristics of the written documents of individuals. This paper is the first work that presents a unified data mining solution to address authorship analysis problems based on the concept of frequent pattern-based writeprint. Extensive experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed solution can precisely capture the writing styles of individuals.

40|$|With {{millions}} of users, Online Social Networks (OSNs) are a huge cultural phenomenon. Put briefly, they are characterized by: i) an intrinsic sharing of personal information, ii) a {{rich set of}} features to publish, organize and retrieve contents, especially for emphasizing their social organization, iii) the in- teraction with a heterogeneous set of devices, e. g., ranging from desktops to mobile appliances, and iv) the mix of Web-based paradigms and sophisticated methodologies for processing data. However, if not properly implemented, or without effective security policies, i) – iv) could lead to severe risks in terms both of privacy and security. In this perspective, this chapter analyzes the major peculiarities of OSN platforms, the preferred development methodologies, and usage patterns, also by taking into account how personal information can be exploited to <b>conduct</b> <b>malicious</b> actions. Then, a graph-based modeling approach is introduced to reveal possible attacks, {{as well as to}} elaborate the needed countermeasures or (automated) checking procedures...|$|R

It explains in more detail the TCP SYN Flood DDoS attacks and methods for preventing and mitigating {{the effects of these}} attacks.

40|$|Populated IP {{addresses}} (PIP) — IP addresses {{that are}} as-sociated {{with a large}} number of user requests — are im-portant for online service providers to efficiently allocate resources and to detect attacks. While some PIPs serve legitimate users, many others are heavily abused by attack-ers to <b>conduct</b> <b>malicious</b> activities such as scams, phishing, and malware distribution. Unfortunately, commercial proxy lists like Quova have a low coverage of PIP addresses and offer little support for distinguishing good PIPs from abused ones. In this study, we propose PIPMiner, a fully automated method to extract and classify PIPs through analyzing ser-vice logs. Our methods combine machine learning and time series analysis to distinguish good PIPs from abused ones with over 99. 6 % accuracy. When applying the derived PIP list to several applications, we can identify millions of mali-cious Windows Live accounts right on the day of their sign-ups, and detect millions of malicious Hotmail accounts well before the current detection system captures them...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive use of networks, in {{particular}} the Internet, either by malicious or inno-cent users, threatens the service availability and quality of polite applications. Common queueing mechanisms which supposedly solve the problem, are shown in this work to be ineffective for bursty applications, including Web applications. This can be exploited by <b>malicious</b> users to <b>conduct</b> {{a new kind of}} denial of service attacks. We propose a new traffic control mechanism called Aggressiveness Protective Queuing (APQ) which is based on attributing importance weights to the users and which solves this problem by dynamically decreasing the weight of the aggressive users. The actual weight used for a flow is a dynamically varying parameter reflecting the past bandwidth usage of the flow. We show that under heavy load (deterministic model), APQ significantly restricts the amount of traffic an aggressive user can send and bounds it, at most, to twice the amount of traffic sent by a polite (regular) user. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of APQ under a stochastic environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is {{evolving}} to {{be a new}} paradigm for wireless Internet connectivity as it obviates the need for wired infrastructure at every Access Point (AP) a. k. a Mesh Router (MR).

The self-configurable architecture of MRs paves way for <b>malicious</b> intruders to <b>conduct</b> a Denial-of-Service attack (DoS) on the MRs by flooding the network with a large volume of traffic; thus rendering the system inaccessible to the real users. In this paper, we present a cache based defense at the MRs to identify flooding style DoS attacks. We use a most frequently used cache mechanism to identify such flows and raise an early alert to curb them. We effectively avert any performance degradation by dropping the identified attack flows along the forwarding routers.
