ENL and EAAL were measured on pigs weighing 24, 62 and 105 kg. In all cases, daily ENL increased linearly (P < 0. 05) with BW, {{for the majority of the}} AA and total N. As BW increased, daily ENL, total EAAL and the majority of EAAL increased linearly independently of micronisation (P < 0. 05). When expressed per kg DMI, total EAAL and the majority of each EAA decreased curvilinearly and reached nadir at around 100 kg BW. For ENL expressed per kg DMI, micronisation resulted in a curvilinear decrease with increasing BW, as compared to a linear decrease for pigs fed the native pea fibre diet (non-micronised). Micronisation of pea inner fibres did not decrease ENL or EAAL daily, except for proline. When the losses were expressed as g·k– 1 g DMI, micronisation did not decrease ENL but decreased (P < 0. 05) endogenous losses for a majority of AA as well as for total AA.

Three ponies were offered 4 kg dry matter (DM) per day of either 100 % hay cubes (HC), or one of three diets consisting of a 50 : 50 barley:HC mix. Due to small refusals of HC, the actual DM intakes (kg per day) were 3. 74, 3. 67, 3. 57 and 3. 52 (S. E. D. 0. 18) for the HC, RB:HC, MB:HC and EB:HC diets, respectively. With the exception of butyrate, all intra-caecal fermentation parameters 4 - 8 h post feeding in ponies given diet RB:HC were significantly (P< 0. 05) different from those observed in ponies fed diet HC. Thus, in ponies fed diet RB:HC, intra-caecal pH and acetate molar proportions were reduced whilst lactate concentration and propionate molar proportions were increased (P< 0. 05) compared with values recorded in ponies fed diet HC. By contrast, intra-caecal total VFA, lactate and pH levels of ponies fed diets MB:HC or EB:HC {{were similar to those}} in ponies fed HC at all time points measured, although acetate and propionate molar proportions were lower and higher, respectively, in ponies fed diets EB:HC and MB:HC compared with those fed HC.

The Control diet contained per kg 221 g crude protein and 12. 83 MJ ME. Four additional diets contained 300 g/kg of each of the two untreated or micronised experimental field bean cultivar samples. Each diet was then split into two batches {{and one of them was}} supplemented with 3400 units tannase per kg diet resulting in 10 diets in total. Each diet was fed to seven pens with two randomly selected male broilers each. Birds fed the high tannin bean sample had a lower weight gain (p < 0. 001), and a lower determined apparent ME (p < 0. 05), and DMD (p < 0. 001) but a higher tannin degradability (p < 0. 001). Compared to the Control diet, feeding field beans increased (p < 0. 001) the weights of the proventriculus and gizzard of the birds, and also increased endogenous mucin losses (p < 0. 05). Supplementing diets with the tannase-containing enzyme preparation improved dietary ME (p < 0. 001), DMD (p < 0. 001), NR (p < 0. 001) and DEE (p < 0. 05), but did not change tannin degradability. Heat treatment of the beans reduced the degradability of condensed tannins and increased endogenous mucin losses (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The primary aim of {{this work}} was to provide an {{alternative}} method of synthesis of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug copper indomethacin (Cu-Indo) and to produce alternative forms of the drug to increase its marketability. Dense gases as anti-solvents were used to achieve these aims. The study involved the synthesis, purification, micronisation and co-precipitation of Cu-Indo with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Initially the volumetric and solubility behaviours of the solventanti-solvent systems were investigated to determine the optimum processing conditions. The solubility of Cu-Indo in an expanded solution {{was found to be}} a complex function of the solvent and other solutes. Copper indomethacin was successfully synthesised and purified in a single vessel using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Drug yields of 98 % and purities near 100 % were achieved at optimum conditions with the advantages of less residual solvent in the drug, less solvent waste, reduced processing time and increased yields over the conventional synthesis process. Copper indomethacin was produced in a variety of morphologies and particle sizes using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. An investigation of the effect of process parameters on the particle characteristics showed that solute concentration was the dominant variable. Spherical particles with diameters less than 8 mm were obtained at optimum conditions. The immediate benefit of <b>micronising</b> Cu-Indo was demonstrated with an eight fold increase in dissolution rate when compared to the conventionally produced drug. Polyvinylpyrrolidone was successfully co-precipitated with Cu-Indo using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. The PVPCu-Indo co-precipitates were found to increase the solubility of the drug in ethanol with a 36 fold solubility enhancement at optimum conditions. The use of dense carbon dioxide as anti-solvent in this work demonstrates the potential of the GAS and ASES processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Copper indomethacin was synthesised, purified and micronised in a single vessel at a substantial saving in terms of time and solvent usage.

40|$|Fly ash, a {{byproduct}} of coal-fired thermal power plants is considered an environmental pollutant {{if it is to}} be disposed of and requires considerate financial liabilities on fly ash producers for its safe disposal. But fortunately, because of its physical and chemical properties, it has found applications in many fields; like mineral extraction, soil stabilization, waste treatment and as a supplementary cementitious material. As cement industry is responsible for 5 - 7 % of global greenhouse gas emissions, application of fly ash as a cement replacement material provides the dual benefit of cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and in increasing the utilization rate of fly ash produced worldwide. The majority of global fly ash production falls under class F low calcium category, which has low reactivity. Therefore to improve the performance of fly ash blended cement composites, the researchers have looked at many ways like; reducing the particle size, making use of hydrated lime, silica fume, and Metakaolin, etc. Recently, the use of nanomaterials has been gaining widespread attention of the research community due to their small particle size and high reactivity that help in improving the properties of the concrete at the nanoscale level. The majority of the past research on low calcium, class F fly ash cement composites, concentrated on 60 % or less of fly ash content and there is a great potential for the further improvement in replacement levels. Therefore, our research aimed at developing a cement composite that not only increases the percentage of fly ash content but also considerably increases the cement replacement level having comparable mechanical properties to that of ordinary portland cement (OPC). Based on the review of existing literature, there appeared to be no research available that investigates the effect of micro (silica fume) and nano silica in combination with hydrated lime and set accelerator on high volume fly ash (HVFA) cement composite replacing 80 % of cement. Therefore, our first study was undertaken to fill up this knowledge gap. The fly ash used in this study was micronised using Sturtevant jet mill microniser to produce ultra fine fly ash (UFFA). The research findings show that when UFFA is partially replaced with silica fume (SF) and used in combination with both the set accelerator (SA) and hydrated lime (HL), there is a considerable improvement in its pozzolanic activity resulting in large improvement in its 7 and 28 day compressive strength. On the contrary, nano silica (nS) modified HV-UFFA performed better when used without the SA and HL, resulting in significantly improving its 7 and 28 day compressive strength. The strength achieved at 28 days was at par with that of OPC. The addition of SA and HL to nS modified HV-UFFA blend resulted in the development of high early age microcracking, thereby considerably reducing its 28 day strength compared to that of nS, HV-UFFA and OPC blend not containing HL and SA. The second experiment was planned to look at the effect of different concentrations of nS on raw HVFA cement blends with and without SA and HL, replacing 70 % of cement. The difference in experiment 2 compared to experiment 1 were (i) raw fly ash was used in experiment 2 in lieu of UFFA as <b>micronising</b> fly ash consumes electricity that adds to the carbon footprint (ii) two concentrations of nano silica were used i. e. 5 and 7. 5 % to study the effect of increase in nano silica content on HVFA cement composite. The fly ash content was partially replaced with 5 and 7. 5 % of nS and 5 % HL. The results show that the 7 day strength increased with the increasing amount of nano silica. However, at 28 days both the samples showed approximately the similar improvement in strength. With the addition of set accelerator to nano silica modified HVFA cement blends, there was a considerable reduction in 7 and 28 day compressive strength results. Addition of HL to HVFA cement blend, containing 5 % nS showed no effect on its further strength development. However, when HL was added to the 7. 5 % nS modified HVFA cement coposite, a considerable reduction in its 7 and 28 day compressive strength results were observed. This shows that nS is highly effective in improving the strength of HVFA cement composites when used alone without any additives, but when it is used in combination with either HL or SA, shows no or negative effect on the development of compressive strength of raw fly ash blended cement composites. Looking at the significant improvement in the strength results of HVFA cement composites by incorporating nano silica, the next experiment was planned to looking at the effect of other nano materials on HVFA cement composites. As the major elemental oxides present in OPC are SiO 2, CaO and Al 2 O 3. This experiment was planned to incorporate the nano sized sources of these elemental oxides. Since the reaction of pure CaO is highly thermal in nature and addition of nano CaO would have been highly exothermic and could have introduced high thermal stresses at early ages of curing, nano CaCO 3 was used as a source of CaO. Therefore, the third experiment plan looked at a quantitative comparative study of the effect of 5 % and 7. 5 % of nano silica, 2. 5 % and 5 % of nano alumina (nA) and 2. 5 % and 5 % of nano calcium carbonate (nCC), on the properties of HVFA cement composites, replacing 80 % of cement. The results show that the addition of nS significantly improves the compressive strength of HVFA cement composites and considerably increases the formation and thermal stability of silica-rich hydrogarnet phase, which increases with the increase in nS content. The addition of nCC to HVFA cement composite does not show any effect on the pozzolanic reaction at 7 days of curing but at 28 days considerably improves its pozzolanic reaction, which increases with the increase in nCC content. The performance of nCC in improving the mechanical properties is less pronounced than that of nS. The addition of nA though improves the hydration/pozzolanic reaction of HVFA cement composite, resulting in the improvement in compressive strength, but only if added in small quantities (2. 5 % or less). If it is added in higher amounts, it promotes the formation of Al(OH) 3 gel that severely inhibits the hydration/pozzolanic reaction within the cement matrix. Based on the knowledge gained from the previous experiments, we found that the amorphous nano silica holds a great potential for the development of zero cement composite. That motivated us to design our fourth experiment, replacing 100 % of cement. In the fourth experiment we replaced OPC with slag, which is another industrial by product. Zero cement mix designs were developed incorporating slag, HVFA and various concentrations of nano silica and hydrated lime. The results show that the optimum content of nano silica in a high volume fly ash, slag and HL blend is 5 %. With a further increase in nano silica content although the pozzolanic reaction and the resulting C-S-H/C-A-S-H gel formation increases but it also increase the micro-cracking within the cement matrix, resulting in negatively impacting the strength development. The portlandite added externally in the form of Ca(OH) 2 powder, to the nS modified SCM blend, activates the pozzolanic reaction which increases with the increase in portlandite content. The best mix design containing 5 % nS, 70 % FA and 25 % slag in combination with 15 % HL as an additive, achieved a 28 day compressive strength of 70 % compared to that of OPC. It is to be noted that though this research aimed at minimising the carbon footprint of the cement composites, it was not completely eliminated. The various raw materials that have CO 2 emissions associated with their production are listed below: Nano silica &ndash; As per the information provided by the supplier of Nano silica, it was produced by pyrogenic method, which is highly energy intensive process. It is produced from the flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl 4) at ~ 1800 &deg;C temperature. Calcium hydroxide &ndash; Calcium hydroxide is produced commercially by treating lime (CaO) with water (H 2 O). The CaO used in this process is produced by the de-carbonation of limestone (CaCO 3), which releases CO 2 into the atmosphere during production. Ultrafine fly ash (UFFA) &ndash; Though fly ash is a by-product of thermal power plants using coal as a fuel, micronizing the fly ash (i. e. reducing the particle size of the raw fly ash) is an energy intensive process.

The highest peak serum glucose and serum insulin concentrations were observed after feeding the extruded barley, lower concentrations were observed after feeding the <b>micronised</b> barley and the lowest concentrations were observed after feeding the rolled barley. Breath hydrogen increased within four hours of feeding all the barley diets, and the mean (sd) peak hydrogen concentrations were 98. 3 (55. 2) ppm for rolled barley, 59. 3 (31. 5) ppm for <b>micronised</b> barley and 96. 1 (51. 9) ppm for extruded barley. There were wide variations within individual horses but these concentrations were not significantly different. Breath methane concentrations were very variable and, although there were no significant differences, there was a trend for higher methane concentrations after the feeding of rolled barley...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{findings}} {{demonstrated that}} {{particle size reduction}} of insoluble fibre materials (i. e. starfruit insoluble fibre-rich fraction and cellulose) to micro-sizes effectively enhanced their physicochemical properties, which provided clues to their physiological functions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of particle size reduction of these insoluble fibres by micron technology on indices of bowel health. RESULTS: Feeding of the <b>micronised</b> fibres (9. 68 - 14. 3 mu m), especially those prepared by high-pressure micronisation, effectively (P < 0. 05) improved various caecal and faecal indices, such as decreasing the caecal ammonia concentration (by 20. 0 - 30. 0 %), increasing the faecal output (135 - 150 %) and moisture content (143 - 1571 / 0) and lowering the activities of undesired beta-D-glucosidase (by 39. 2 - 43. 6 %) and P-D-glucuronidase (by 71. 4 - 77. 5 %) in faeces of hamsters. Relationships between physicochemical properties and physiological functions of the <b>micronised</b> fibres were considered. The results also demonstrated that the type, processing and related particle size of insoluble fibres were important factors affecting their physicochemical properties and physiological functions. CONCLUSION: The consumption of <b>micronised</b> insoluble fibres at 5 % level might exert a favourable effect on improving various caecal and faecal indices. The results of this study provide some hints on potential applications of micron technology in the food industry. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} a function-based relationship between the physical and bulk properties of pre-blended mixtures of fine and coarse lactose grades with the in vitro performance of an adhesive active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Different grades of <b>micronised</b> and milled lactose (Lactohale (LH) LH 300, LH 230, LH 210 and Sorbolac 400) were pre-blended with coarse grades of lactose (LH 100, LH 206 and Respitose SV 010) at concentrations of 2. 5, 5, 10 and 20 wt. %. The bulk and rheological properties and particle size distributions were characterised. The pre-blends were formulated with <b>micronised</b> budesonide and in vitro performance in a Cyclohaler device tested using a next-generation impactor (NGI) at 90 l/min. Correlations between the lactose properties and in vitro performance were established using linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses. The addition of milled and <b>micronised</b> lactose fines with the coarse lactose had a significant influence on physical and rheological properties of the bulk lactose. Formulations of the different pre-blends with budesonide directly influenced in vitro performance attributes including fine particle fraction, mass median aerodynamic diameter and pre-separator deposition. While linear regression suggested a number of physical and bulk properties may influence in vitro performance, ANN analysis suggested the critical parameters in describing in vitro deposition patterns were the relative concentrations of lactose fines % < 4. 5 μm and % < 15 μm. These data suggest that, for an adhesive API, the proportion of fine particles below % < 4. 5 μm and % < 15 μm {{could be used in}} rational dry powder inhaler formulation design...|$|R

40|$|The aerosol {{performance}} and delivery characteristics of tobramycin {{for the treatment}} of respiratory infection were evaluated using the Orbital™, a multi-breath, high dose, dry powder inhaler (DPI). <b>Micronised</b> tobramycin was prepared and tested in the Orbital and in the commercially available TOBI Podhaler (Novartis AG). Furthermore, the TOBI Podhaler formulation containing tobramycin as Pulmospheres was tested in both the commercial Podhaler device (T- 326) and Orbital for comparison. By varying the puck geometry of the Orbital, it was possible to deliver equivalent doses of <b>micronised</b> tobramycin (114. 09 ± 5. 86 mg) to that of the Podhaler Pulmosphere product (116. 01 ± 2. 59 mg) over 4 sequential simulated breaths (60 L min− 1 for 4 s) without the need for multiple capsules. In general, the aerosol performance of the <b>micronised</b> tobramycin from the Orbital was higher than the T- 326 Podhaler device, with fine particle fraction (FPF) of 44. 99 % ± 1. 09 % and 37. 03 % ± 0. 86 %, respectively. When testing the Pulmosphere powder in the two devices, the T- 326 had marginally better performance with a FPF of 68. 77 % ± 2. 10 % compared to 61. 30 % ± 3. 45 %. This is to be expected since the TOBI Podhaler and Pulmosphere are an optimised powder and device combination. The Orbital was shown to be capable of delivering high efficiency, high dose antibiotic therapy for inhalation without the need for the use of multiple capsules as used in current devices. This approach may pave the way for a number of antibiotic therapies and medicaments where high dose respiratory deposition is required...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAim {{to study}} the effect on plasma {{vascular}} endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels of oral purified flavonoid fraction treatment for sixty days in patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). Material and methods twenty patients «CEAP» (clinical stage 2 – 4) with chronic venous disease were included. Duplex ultrasonography {{was used to assess}} the venous disease. Patients were treated for 60 days with Daflon® 500 mg twice daily. Blood was collected from a foot vein immediately before starting treatment and within one week of stopping treatment. Plasma VEGF levels were determined using a sandwich ELISA method. Results VEGF levels decreased in patients with stage C 4 CVD after treatment with purified <b>micronised</b> flavonoid fraction treatment (98 pg/ml to 57 pg/ml). The levels of VEGF in patients with skin changes were significantly higher (98 pg/ml) than those with normal skin (9 pg/ml p=< 0. 001 Wilcoxon). Conclusions plasma VEGF levels were much higher in patients who have skin changes of CVD.

40|$|The authors {{report the}} results of a large open multicenter study using 200 mg <b>micronised</b> {{fenofibrate}} once a day. Among 1545 selected patients who underwent a 3 -month period with nutritional advice, 1334 were included in a 6 -month drug study. Inclusion criteria were total serum cholesterol equal to or above 250 mg/dl and/or serum triglycerides equal to or above 200 mg/dl. At 6 months, average changes from inclusion levels were - 20. 5, - 26. 1, - 7. 5 and + 15. 2 % for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol >- 160 mg/dl on inclusion, plasma fibrinogen and HDL-cholesterol, respectively. Median decrease of serum triglycerides was 46. 5 %. Trial discontinuation for clinical and biological adverse events were 5 and 1 %, respectively. In conclusion, <b>micronised</b> fenofibrate at a daily dose of 200 mg had significant lipid-modifying properties but also exhibited a beneficial effect on other related risk factors such as fibrinogen reduction. The safety profile was very satisfactory providing an excellent benefit/risk ratio. © 1994 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the progestagen component in combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for breast cancer risk has been long debated. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} progestins exert both genomic transcriptional and non-genomic effects that can enhance the proliferation, invasiveness and spread of breast cancer cells. According to a novel hypothesis, progestins can still activate cancer stem cells in patients with pre-existing, clinically undetected breast cancer. However, some experimental and clinical data suggest that different progestins may have a different impact on the pathophysiology of malignant breast cells. In vitro studies on estrogen receptor (ER) + breast cancer cells have shown that the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to estradiol (E(2)) produces a significantly higher increase of the mRNA levels and activities of estrogen-activating enzymes aromatase, 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type- 1 and sulfatase when compared with progesterone plus E(2). In randomised trial performed on ovariectomised adult female monkeys, oral E(2) plus MPA have resulted in a significantly greater proliferation of breast lobular and ductal epithelium when compared with placebo, whereas E(2) plus <b>micronised</b> progesterone have not. In the same experimental model, oral E(2) plus MPA have been found to induce the expression of genes encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and downstream targets, whereas E(2) alone or E(2) plus <b>micronised</b> progesterone had no or modest effects on EGFR-related genes. In last years, some clinical studies on HRT users have shown that androgenic progestin- or MPA-based formulations are associated with an increased breast cancer incidence, whereas <b>micronised</b> progesterone- or dydrogesterone-based formulations are not. Further basic and clinical investigations on this topic are strongly warranted to elucidate whether the choice of the progestagen component in combined HRT could be of clinical relevance as for breast cancer ris...|$|R
