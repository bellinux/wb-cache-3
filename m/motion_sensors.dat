5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a book on the state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the book on the building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E

Interferometric Radars, high-resolution Cameras, or <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> can monitor instable areas {{over a long}} term, lasting from days to years. Experts interpret the recorded data {{and are able to}} recognize upcoming ruptures in order to initiate appropriate measures. Such systems (e.g. the monitoring of the Weissmies glacier in Switzerland) can recognize events several days in advance.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{positioning}} (DP) is a {{computer-controlled system}} to automatically maintain a vessel's position and heading by using its own propellers and thrusters. Position reference sensors, combined with wind sensors, <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> and gyrocompasses, provide {{information to the}} computer pertaining to the vessel's position and the magnitude and direction of environmental forces affecting its position. Examples of vessel types that employ DP include, {{but are not limited}} to, ships and semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling units (MODU), oceanographic research vessels, cable layer ships and cruise ships.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Replacing {{physical}} activity with videogaming has {{been implicated in}} causing obesity. Studies have shown that using motion-sensing controllers with activity-promoting videogames expends energy comparable to aerobic exercise; however, effects of motion-sensing controllers have not been examined with traditional (non–exercise-promoting) videogames. Materials and Methods: We measured indirect calorimetry and heart rate in 14 subjects during rest and traditional videogaming using <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> and joystick controllers. Results: Energy expenditure was higher while subjects were playing with the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (1. 30 ± 0. 32 [*]kcal/kg/hour) than with the joystick (1. 07 ± 0. 26 [*]kcal/kg/hour; P< 0. 01) or resting (0. 91 ± 0. 24 [*]kcal/kg/hour; P< 0. 01). Oxygen consumption during videogaming averaged 15. 7 percent of predicted maximum for the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> and 11. 8 percent of maximum for the joystick. Minute ventilation was higher playing with the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (10. 7 ± 3. 5 L/minute) than with the joystick (8. 6 ± 1. 8 L/minute; P< 0. 02) or resting (6. 7 ± 1. 4 L/minute; P< 0. 001), predominantly because of higher respiratory rates (15. 2 ± 4. 3 versus 20. 3 ± 2. 8 versus 20. 4 ± 4. 2 beats/minute for resting, the joystick, and the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor,</b> respectively; P< 0. 001); tidal volume did not change significantly. Peak heart rate during gaming was 16. 4 percent higher than resting (78. 0 ± 12. 0) for joystick (90. 1 ± 15. 0; P= 0. 002) and 17. 4 percent higher for the <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> (91. 6 ± 14. 1; P= 0. 002); mean heart rate did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Playing with a <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> burned significantly more calories than with a joystick, but the energy expended was modest. With both consoles, the increased respiratory rate without increasing tidal volume and the increased peak heart rate without increasing mean heart rate are consistent with psychological stimulation from videogaming, rather than a result of exercise. We conclude that using a <b>motion</b> <b>sensor</b> with traditional videogames does not provide adequate energy expenditure to provide cardiovascular conditioning...|$|R
25|$|Caltech {{scientists}} {{recorded the}} events on {{a cluster of}} twelve strong <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> that were placed throughout the region {{with a total of}} 87 channels of recorded data. Nine of these instruments were located on the Caltech campus, two were at the nine story Jet Propulsion Laboratory building 180 (ten miles northwest of the campus) and the final device was placed on a hillside 5km to the west. Investigation of the accelerograms from these units revealed the strongest shaking lasted 4–5 seconds. The vertical accelerations were considered relatively high and early analysis (pre-digitilization) indicated that the mainshock was complex, with a double train of P-waves arriving with a 1.4–1.8 second interval.|$|E
25|$|The form of home {{automation}} called assistive domotics focuses on {{making it possible}} for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as {{home automation}} for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{from the}} {{submarine}} occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge {{in a separate}} container which is separated by seventeen titanium alloy pinnacles activated by a double alloy steam system. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike {{is strong enough to}} eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000ft/s (6,000m/s), or 13,600mph (21,600km/h).|$|E

500|$|The GameCube and Wii {{versions}} feature several minor {{differences in}} their controls. The Wii version of the game makes use of the <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> and built-in speaker of the Wii Remote.

The player controls Link's sword by swinging the Wii Remote. Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk. Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely, without entering a special [...] "lookaround" [...] mode required by the Wii; however, in the GameCube version, only two of Link's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time, as opposed to four in the Wii version.|$|E
500|$|As {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} in California since the October 1989 {{event in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, the mainshock near Petrolia produced {{some of the highest}} ground motions ever recorded (at that time) by the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP). Fourteen existing CSMIP stations comprising 84 strong <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> recorded the event, ten of which were ground response stations. The remaining four were located on structures, including a Highway 101 overpass in Rio Dell, a dam, a one-story supermarket in Fortuna, and a 5-story residential building in Eureka. The supermarket, residential building, and dam were 28, 50, and 75 kilometers distant from the epicenter respectively, and recorded peak accelerations of [...]46g, [...]34g, and [...]15g. An accelerograph at the Painter Street overpass (a concrete bridge, [...] from the epicenter) recorded a free field acceleration of [...]55g and an instrument on the structure saw an amplified peak of 1.23g during the mainshock.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of motion}} capture {{to control the}} {{position}} and orientation of a virtual camera enables the operator to intuitively move and aim the virtual camera by simply walking about and turning the virtual camera rig. [...] A virtual camera rig consists of a portable monitor or tablet device, <b>motion</b> <b>sensors,</b> optional support framework, and optional joystick or button controls that are commonly used to start or stop recording and adjust lens properties. [...] In 1992, Michael McKenna of MIT's Media Lab demonstrated the earliest documented virtual camera rig when he fixed a Polhemus magnetic motion sensor and a 3.2 inch portable LCD TV to a wooden ruler.

500|$|According to Marc and Claire Headley, two Scientologists {{who left}} the Church in 2005, {{residents}} at the base {{are not permitted to}} leave without the permission of a supervisor and have to work at least 16 hours a day, from 8 am to past midnight, with shorter hours on Sundays and little time for socialising. Communications with the outside world are effectively cut off; cellphones and Internet access are generally banned, mail is censored and passports are kept in a locked filing cabinet. The perimeter of the base is closely guarded around the clock. It is ringed with high fences that are topped with spikes and razor wire and monitored by inward-facing <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> to detect anyone trying to climb out of the compound. The Tampa Bay Times reported that dozens of workers tried to escape from the base– some of them repeatedly– but were caught and returned by Sea Org [...] "pursuit teams". The escapees are said to have been subjected to isolation, interrogation and punishment on their return to the compound.|$|E
500|$|Very small {{quantities}} of merchandise were sold for WALL-E, as Cars items were still popular, and many manufacturers {{were more interested}} in Speed Racer, which was a successful line despite the film's failure at the box office. Thinkway, which created the WALL-E toys, had previously made Toy Story dolls when other toy producers had not shown an interest. Among Thinkway's items were a WALL-E that danced when connected to a music player, a toy that could be taken apart and reassembled, and a groundbreaking remote control toy of him and EVE that had <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> that allowed them to interact with players. There were even plushies. The [...] "Ultimate WALL-E" [...] figures were not in stores until the film's home release in November 2008, at a retail price of almost $200, leading The Patriot-News to deem it an item for [...] "hard-core fans and collectors only".

500|$|The Imperial County Services building, a six-story {{reinforced}} concrete building located [...] {{northwest of the}} epicenter in El Centro, was built in 1971 when there were few other tall buildings in the area. The decision to equip the building with nine strong <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> in May 1976 was based on its size, structural attributes, and location in a seismically active area. Unusually detailed structural analysis was possible {{as a result of}} the building having been outfitted with the instrumentation. The initial configuration was tested shortly after its installation when a relatively small (4.9 local magnitude) earthquake occurred [...] northwest of the building on November 4, 1976. The accelerations recorded on the equipment during the event proved to be of very low amplitude and, as a result, the instrumentation was upgraded to include a 13 channel configuration in the building along with a Kinemetrics triaxial (3 channel) accelerograph located [...] east of the building at ground level. The full 16 channel system was managed by the California Division of Mines and Geology Office of Ground Motion Studies and provided almost 60 seconds worth of high resolution data during the 1979 event.|$|E

500|$|The team wanted Journey of Dreams {{to revolve}} around a {{dramatic}} storyline {{in the hope}} that the player would find it more engaging and intuitive, as Iizuka thought the original Nights into Dreams was not user-friendly. Originally, the game had a full free-roaming 3D flight system, but Iizuka thought it was too complex and [...] "not as fun" [...] as the core flight element featured in the original game. Iizuka thought the most difficult challenge of the development process was keeping the game's flight mechanics fun while building upon elements of the original game. To recreate the experience, the team tested a variety of controller schemes which included the Wii remote and Nunchuk, the GameCube controller, and the Classic Controller—the latter two left for players who preferred using a traditional controller configuration. Initially, the game used the Wii remote by having the player point it at the screen, but the team discovered that its <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> would not pick up small movements, so Iizuka created an alternative hybrid motion-pointer system, which he believed would retain the game's fun-to-fly experience. In a retrospective interview, Iizuka said that the entire game was created from scratch and used a new engine specifically designed for the Wii.|$|E
500|$|Jones, nicknamed [...] "Jonesy", is an American Shorthair {{who is the}} rodent-control ship's cat on the Nostromo. After {{the birth}} and escape of the Alien, Jones is {{detected}} by the crew and risks interfering with the ship's <b>motion</b> <b>sensors</b> (which could mistake the cat's movements for those of the Alien). Brett finds Jones in the cargo room, where the Alien kills Brett as Jones watches. When the remaining crew members prepare to escape the ship, Ripley loads Jones into a pet carrier but must temporarily abandon him as the Alien approaches her. The Alien inspects Jones but leaves him alone, since the cat poses no threat. Ripley retrieves Jones and flees {{with him on a}} shuttle. She and the cat are in cryosleep for fifty-seven years, until they are rescued. Jones remains Ripley's pet for the duration of her new employment until she departs on the Sulaco, leaving him behind. Four cats were used in Alien, with each exhibiting specific feline behaviors such as scampering and hissing. According to Ridley Scott's audio commentary on the Alien DVD, to capture Jones' fearful reaction to the Alien a screen was placed between the cat and a German Shepherd; when the screen between the animals was removed, the cat immediately hissed.|$|E
