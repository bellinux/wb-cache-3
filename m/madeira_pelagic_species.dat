The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is a typical demersal fish, but {{can also be found}} in the open water column, and the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) is predominantly a <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> but forms large aggregations near the seabed when it spawns on banks of gravel.|$|R

40|$|The author {{describes}} the commercial viable off-shore fishing methods for catching known commercial resources available around Sri Lanka. He also {{describes the}} in-shore fishing {{methods such as}} bait fishery which are related and of prime importance for carrying out certain off-shore methods. The paper is intended as a background for the description of fishing methods. The methods discussed are: (1) Longlining for large <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> such as large tuna (yellow fin, big eye), shark, spearfish and others; (2) Drift-netting for small and large tuna species (skipjack, yellow fin and others), shark, spearfish, etc.; (3) Pole and line for all deep-sea <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> such as skipjack, yellow fin, frigate mackerel, etc.; and (4) Purse seining (small scale) for small <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> suitable as bait fish for pole and line and longline fisheries...|$|R
50|$|Straddling {{stocks are}} usually pelagic, rather than demersal. Demersal species move less than <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> since {{they tend to}} relate to bottom topography. <b>Pelagic</b> <b>species</b> are more mobile, their {{movements}} influenced by ocean temperatures {{and the availability of}} zooplankton as food. Example pelagic fish are capelin, herring, whiting, mackerel and redfish, There are, however, a few demersal species that are straddling, such as the Greenland halibut migrates in feeding/spawning migrations to Greenland in the west and to the Faeroes in the east.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. In Peru, the {{fisheries}} {{are characterized by}} a strong fishmeal industry. The species used for fishmeal production is mainly anchovy and also some other small <b>pelagic</b> <b>species.</b> There is some concern that {{an excellent source of}} food is used for a product not directly going for human consumption. Since several years the Peruvian government has put an emphasis on the promotion of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> for human consumption. One decade ago, a FAO project was implemented, trying to promote the usage of anchovies in direct consumption. The project included several activities such as school feeding, recipes, market promotion, and product development. This paper presents the promising results of these various initiatives but also highlights the remaining challenges faced by the Peruvian government to further promote the use of small <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> for human consumption...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Oceanography {{has seen}} the recent {{development}} of many new tools and techniques. The subfield of pelagic visual ecology in particular has benefited from {{the development of more}} reliable, portable, and economic tools and techniques that can be taken to sea including spectrometers, microspectrophotometery, electroretinography, and ultraviolet and polarization imaging systems. These advances have led to a relative wealth of data on the visual physiology of <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> and on the optical properties of these species and their environment. These data, particularly in combination with computational methods, have tested long-standing hypotheses in pelagic ecology and led to new hypotheses and research directions. While the ability to study <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> still lags far behind what is possible in terrestrial and coastal environments, a renaissance may be developing {{in the study of the}} integrative biology of <b>pelagic</b> <b>species...</b>|$|R

40|$|Echosounder {{data from}} four surveys (1992, 1993, 1995 and 1996) {{is used to}} {{investigate}} the spatio-temporal variability of school behaviour in North-Western Mediterranean waters. The schools are described using morphological, energetic, spatial and temporal descriptors. The variability in the morphological, positional and energetic parameters of the schools is attributable more {{to the size of}} the school's individuals (juveniles or adults) than to the relative composition (percentage) of <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> in the area. This fact made difficult the identification of species in the studied area. The concentration of schools in certain geographic zones is determined by local oceanographic characteristics that favour the trophic or reproductive activity of these species. The diurnal aggregative behaviour of <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> is typical of the zone and no schools were detected at night. The biomass of the <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> in the area under consideration has diminished during the 4 -year study period and no relationship was found between the number of schools and the biomass evaluated. This is the first time that the schools of small pelagic fishes from the Spanish Mediterranean Sea have been described and the information could be useful to the management and exploitation of the fisheries in the areaPublicado...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Pelagic fishes {{occupy the}} surface waters {{from the coast}} to the open ocean. There are {{approximately}} 260 <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> around Australia. While {{some of the most}} well known are the large offshore apex predators such as tunas, billfish and sharks, the mid-trophic level small <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> such as sardines, anchovies, and squids, are critical to ecosystem function. Pelagic fishes of all sizes have high ecological, economic and social value. The observed impacts of climate change are restricted to changes in local abundance and distribution, particularly southward range extensions. Little is known regarding changes in phenology, physiology or community structure. In future, general ocean warming around Australia and in particular on the east coast, in combination with predicted strengthening of the East Australia Current, is likely to see the distribution of a range of <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> extend southwards from present limits. On the west coast, changes in the strength of the Leeuwin Current are likely to have major implications for the distribution and abundance of some species, including western Australian salmon and Australian herring in waters off South Australia. Changes in productivity, for example due t...|$|R
50|$|This is {{a solitary}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> {{of the open}} seas of the {{south-west}} Pacific. It has an effortless graceful flight with few wing beats, and does not follow ships. It feeds on the wing, picking fish and squid from near the surface.|$|R
5000|$|The Australian {{barracuda}} prefers cooler inshore waters, preferring {{patches of}} seagrass Zostera or Heterozostera or seaweed or sandy areas close to weed patches or reefs. It is a <b>pelagic</b> <b>species,</b> which congregates in large shoeals and is highly migratory. Their food {{is made up}} of smaller fish, cephalopods, crustaceans and bloodworms, it is referred to as an ambush feeder but is also known to actively pursue prey. It appears the Australian barracuda is an opportunistic predators, able to exploit almost any potential prey species, and the variety of prey taken suggests that it hunts {{at all levels of the}} water column, taking demersal species such as Haletta semifasciata and Metapenaeopsis prawns and <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> such as pilchards, southern sea garfish and squid.|$|R
50|$|Bathybates is a genus of piscivorous {{cichlids}} {{endemic to}} Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. The genus includes both <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> that mainly feed on Tanganyika sardines and benthic species that mainly feed on other cichlids. They {{are some of}} the deepest-living cichlids, regularly occurring down to 200 m.|$|R
50|$|The Kanglang fish (Anabarilius grahami) is {{a species}} of cyprinid fish. It is a <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> endemic to Fuxian Lake in Yunnan, {{southern}} China.

50|$|It is a <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> {{that can}} be found from the surface to depths of 150 m, {{normally}} far from land, though occasionally closer to shore, around islands or inlets. One of only four known endothermic sharks, it is seldom found in waters colder than 16 °C (61 °F).|$|R
50|$|Partly due to {{its unique}} geology as a solitary {{pinnacle}} standing out from around 50m. depth to just under the surface {{it is said to}} attract a variety of different <b>pelagic</b> <b>species</b> of all different sizes.
