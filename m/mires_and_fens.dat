40|$|Across {{much of the}} {{temperate}} zone, bogs, <b>mires,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fens</b> {{are relatively}} limited in their extent because of anthropogenic conversion of the habitat itself and/or the surrounding landscape. This is particularly the case in northern Europe where agricultural intensification and urban expansion have reduced the area of wetlands, with many existing as isolated fragments. As a consequence, many remote sensing techniques have focused on using imagery from very high resolution (VHR) sensors...|$|E
40|$|Norway has a {{rich and}} diverse orchid flora {{consisting}} of 36 species. Orchids are found throughout the country, {{but most of the}} species are confined to calcareous or base-rich substrates. Important orchid-rich types of vegetation include rich pine and spruce forests, rich deciduous forests, open calcareous meadows, rocky outcrops and screes, hay meadows and calcareous <b>mires</b> <b>and</b> <b>fens.</b> Many species are rare, and 17 species and 3 subspecies are red listed. 13 species are generally protected. Both the orchids and their habitats are susceptible to various disturbances such as e. g. building activities, road construction, quarrying, drainage, forestry and changes in agricultural practices (less intense grazing, termination of mowing), which has resulted in the continuation of the previously inhibited succession. Most of the types of habitat mentioned are important conservation sites and thus many orchid occurrences (e. g. of Cypripedium calceolus, Epipogium aphyllum, Epipactis palustris and Ophrys insectifera) are protected by a network of nature reserves designated for these habitats. However, there is an urgent need to secure species with small populations in some of the mire reserves, and succession is also a problem in many of the reserves. Protection of the few existing localities for some species is also needed. A more detailed discussion of the status of the red listed species is presented...|$|E

40|$|Question: Why do similar fen meadow {{communities}} {{occur in}} different landscapes? How does the hydrological system sustain base-rich <b>fen</b> <b>mires</b> <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> meadows? Location: Interdunal wetlands and heathland pools in The Netherlands, percolation mires in Germany, Poland, and Siberia, <b>and</b> calcareous spring <b>fens</b> in the High Tatra, Slovakia. Methods: This review presents {{an overview of}} the hydrological conditions of <b>fen</b> <b>mires</b> <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> meadows that are highly valued in nature conservation due to their high biodiversity and the occurrence of many Red List species. Fen types covered in this review include: (1) small hydrological systems in young calcareous dune areas, and (2) small hydrological systems in decalcified old cover sand areas in The Netherlands; (3) large hydrological systems in river valleys in Central-Europe and western-Siberia, and (4) large hydrological systems of small calcareous spring fens with active precipitation of travertine in mountain areas of Slovakia. Results: Different landscape types can sustain similar nutrient poor and base-rich habitats required by endangered fen meadow species. The hydrological systems of these landscapes are very different in size, but their groundwater flow pattern is remarkably similar. Paleo-ecological research showed that travertine forming fen vegetation types persisted in German lowland percolation mires from 6000 to 3000 BP. Similar vegetation types can still be found in small mountain mires in the Slovak Republic. Small pools in such mires form a cascade of surface water bodies that stimulate travertine formation in various ways. Travertine deposition prevents acidification of the <b>mire</b> <b>and</b> sustains populations of basiphilous species that elsewhere in Europe are highly endangered. Conclusion: Very different hydrological landscape settings can maintain a regular flow of groundwater through the top soil generating similar base-rich site conditions. This is why some fen species occur in very different landscape types, ranging from mineral interdunal wetlands to mountain mires. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{provide the}} first {{comparative}} overview {{on the current}} numbers of alien species that invade representative European terrestrial and freshwater habitats {{for a range of}} taxonomic groups. Location Europe. Methods Numbers of naturalized alien species of plants, insects, herptiles, birds and mammals occurring in 10 habitats defined according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) were obtained from 115 regional data sets. Only species introduced after ad 1500 were considered. Data were analysed by ANCOVA and regression trees to assess whether differences exist among taxonomic groups in terms of their habitat affinity, and whether the pattern of occurrence of alien species in European habitats interacts with macroecological factors such as insu- larity, latitude or area. Results The highest numbers of alien plant and insect species were found in human-made, urban or cultivated habitats; if controlled for habitat area in the region, wetland and riparian habitats appeared to support relatively high numbers of alien plant species too. Invasions by vertebrates were more evenly distributed among habitats, with aquatic and riparian, woodland and cultivated land most invaded. <b>Mires,</b> bogs <b>and</b> <b>fens,</b> grassland, heathland <b>and</b> scrub were generally less invaded. Habitat and taxonomic group explained most variation in the proportions of alien species occurring in individual habitats related to the total number of alien species in a region, and the basic pattern determined by these factors was fine-tuned by geographical variables, namely by the mainlandâ€“island contrast and latitude, and differed among taxonomic groups. Main conclusions There are two ecologically distinct groups of alien species (plants and insects versus vertebrates) with strikingly different habitat affinities. Invasions by these two contrasting groups are complementary in terms of habitat use, which makes an overall assessment of habitat invasions in Europe possible. Since numbers of naturalized species in habitats are correlated among taxa within these two groups, the data collected for one group of vertebrates, for example, could be used to estimate the habitat-specific numbers of alien species for other vertebrate groups with reasonable precision, and {{the same holds true for}} insects and plants.

50|$|Freshwater marshes are {{non-tidal}} biomes containing {{little or}} no peat (unlike bogs <b>and</b> <b>fens,</b> both a kind of <b>mire</b> <b>and</b> <b>mires</b> consisting heavily of moist, biologically active peat). They are most common in the Gulf Coast region, specifically in Florida. They {{can be one of}} two principal types: either fresh water mineralized marshes, which derive their water from groundwater, streams and surface runoff; or poorly mineralized fresh water marshes whose moisture comes mostly from regular direct precipitation. Freshwater marshes support an independent pH-neutral ecosystem which encourages biodiversity. Common species include ducks, geese, swans, songbirds, swallows, coots, and black ducks. Although shallow marshes do not tend to support many fish, deeper ones are home to many species, including such large fish as the northern pike and carp. Some of the most common plants in these areas are cattails, water lilies, arrowheads, and rushes.|$|R
40|$|The Pto gene {{was derived}} {{originally}} from the wÃ­ld tomato species Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium and confers resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strains expressing the avirulence gene avrPto. The Fen gene is also derived from L. pimpinellifolium and confers {{sensitivity to the}} insecticide fenthion. We have now isolated and characterized the alleles of Pto <b>and</b> <b>Fen</b> from cultivated tomato, L. esculentum, and designated them pfo <b>and</b> <b>fen.</b> High conservation of genome organization between the two tomato species allowed us to Ã­dentÃ­fy the pto <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> alleles from among the cluster of closely related Pfo gene family members. The pto <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> alleles are transcribed and have uninterrupted open reading frames that code for predicted proteins that are 87 and 98 % identical to the Pto <b>and</b> <b>Fen</b> protein kinases, respectively. In vitro autophosphorylation assays revealed that both the pto <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> alleles encode active kinases. In addition, the pto kinase phosphorylates a previously characterized substrate of Pto, the Pto-interacting Ptil serine/ threonine kinase. However, the pto kinase shows impaired interaction with Ptil and with several previously isolated Pto-interacting proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. The observation that pto <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> are active kinases and yet do not confer bacterial speck resistance or fenthion sensitivity suggests that the amino acid substitutions distinguishing them from Pto <b>and</b> <b>Fen</b> may interfere with recognition of the corresponding signal molecule or with protein-protein interactions involved in the Pto- and fen-mediated signal transduction pathways...|$|R

40|$|Seepages {{occurring}} at high altitudes in the Hottentots Holland Mountains (HHM) (Western Cape Province, South Africa) {{were subject to}} a phytosociological survey. RelevÃ© sampling method and classification procedures of the floristic-sociological (Braun-Blanquet) approach as well as numerical data analyses (numerical classification and ordination) were used to reveal syntaxonomic patterns and characterize {{the position of the}} syntaxa along major environmental gradients. Nine plant communities were recognized, three of which were classified as associations, following formal syntaxonomic and nomenclatural rules of the floristic-sociological approach. Most of the studied mire communities were dominated by low-growing clonal restios (Restionaceae), whereas some consisted of other types of graminoids. The most important species determining the structure (and function) of the mire communities on sandstones of the HHM include restios Anthochortus crinalis, Chondropetalum deustum, C. mucronatum, Elegia intermedia, E. thyrsifera, Restio subtilis, R. purpurascens, cyperoids Epischoenus villosus, Ficinia argyropa, grasses Ehrharta setacea subsp. setacea, Pentameris hirtiglumis as well as shrubs Berzelia squarrosa, Cliffortia tricuspidata, Erica intervallaris and Grubbia rosmarinifolia. Protea lacticolor and Restio perplexus dominate a rare shale band seepage community. There are two major groups of communities-the fens (dominated by carpets of Anthochortus crinalis and other low-growing species) and the restio marshlands (mosaics of low tussocks of Restio subtilis and tall Chondropetalum mucronatum).

The vegetation normally has intimate mixtures of species considered to be acidophile and others thought of as calciphile or basophile. In some cases the mire occupies a physically transitional location between bog <b>and</b> <b>fen</b> vegetation, as for example on the marginal lagg of raised bog or associated with certain valley <b>and</b> basin <b>mires.</b> In other cases these intermediate properties may reflect the actual process of succession, as peat accumulates in groundwater-fed fen or open water to produce rainwater-fed bog isolated from groundwater influence. Many of these systems are very unstable underfoot and can therefore also be described as 'quaking bogs'.Depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion described as:occurring in complex mosaics with lowland wet heath <b>and</b> valley <b>mire</b> vegetation, in transition <b>mires,</b> <b>and</b> {{on the margins of}} bog pools and hollows in both raised and blanket bogs.

The nationally scarce species brown beak-sedge Rhynchospora fusca and marsh clubmoss Lycopodiella inundata also occur in this habitat.On lowland heaths in southern and eastern England this habitat occurs on humid, bare or recently exposed peat in three distinct situations:*in and around the edges of seasonal bog pools, particularly on patterned areas of valley mire,*in flushes on the edges of valley mires in heathlands, and*in areas that are artificially disturbed, such as along footpaths and trackways and in old peat-cuttings and abandoned ditches.|$|R
