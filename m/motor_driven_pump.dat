The motor-pump subsystem is analyzed {{from the point of view}} of optimizing the power requirement of the induction motor, which has led to an optimum u-f relationship useful in controlling the motor. The complete pumping system is implemented using a dc-dc converter, a three-phase inverter, and an induction motor-pump set. The dc-dc converter is used as a power conditioner and its duty cycle is controlled so as to match the load to the array. A microprocessor-based controller is used to carry out the load-matching...|$|E

40|$|Demand-side {{management}} (DSM) {{is a set}} {{of actions}} taken by an electric utility to influence the electricity usage by a customer. Typical DSM activities include rebates for higher efficiency appliances and discounted electric rates for electric customers whose service can be interrupted on short notice. This paper explores two more subtle DSM activities: using turbine "let-downs" and thermal storage. High efficiency and adjustable speed drive (ASD) electric motors have long been considered as demand-side management strategies for industrial consumers of electricity. An alternative strategy to replacing aging electric motors with high efficiency or ASD motors is a turbine let-down. A turbine letdown is a turbine which uses pressure reduction to produce useful work. A typical application of this type of turbine would be to replace both a pressure reducing device and an electric <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> <b>pump.</b> Air conditioning is a primary contributor to peak electric loads in Texas. One of the ways to solve this problem is to move the loads from peak to off-peak periods without changing overall electricity consumption. By using cool storage systems, energy consumption for businesses and industry can be shifted, reducing electricity costs to the consumer and reducing the electric utility's need to build more power plants...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the late}} 70 's, several {{research}} and development projects deal with future Power-by-Wire-technology for aircraft ight control systems, aiming to reduce the overall system weight, as well as installation and maintenance eort. The design of appropriate electrically powered actuators still is a key technology. An overview about typical functional and performance requirements on primary ight control actuators is given. With electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHAs), based on an electric <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> <b>pump</b> directly connected to a hydro-cylinder, safety functions can be realized with low eort bymeans of small valves. The two basic EHA principles are considered here: the EHA-SM, having a constant displacement pump driven by a speed controlled, electronically commutated brushless DC motor, and the EHA-SP, with an electrically controlled servopump driven by an uncontrolled AC induction motor. A rating method for these EHA-types is proposed to design components {{very close to the}} actual requirements, aiming at weight saving solutions. Using charac-teristic motor torque-speed curves as well as pump performance maps, partly leads to iterative solutions due to interdependencies between the components. Weight and typical dimension envelope estimates were developed as functions of the performance/design values calculated before. Finally, nonlinear dynamic simu-lation models are set up, thus completing a little 'toolbox ' helping the ight control actuation developer, particularly { but not exceptionally { during early project stages...|$|E
40|$|The Reactor Recirculation System {{has been}} {{designed}} to perform the following functions: a. To provide forced circulation of reactor water through the core to overcome the power density limitation of the fuel. b. To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 Â°F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> <b>pump,</b> a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, pipe support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the moisture separators and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant. To control reactor power level, the system makes use of the boiling water reactor large negative power coefficient. A power level increase is achieved b...|$|E

40|$|The {{unavailability}} of standby {{safety system}} components due to failures in {{nuclear power plants}} is considered to involve a time independent and a time dependent part. The former relates to the component`s unavailability from demand stresses due to usage, and the latter represents the component`s unavailability due to standby time stresses related to the environment. In this paper, data from the nuclear plant reliability data system (NPRDS) were used to partition the component`s unavailability into the contributions from standby time stress (i. e., due to environmental factors) and demand stress (i. e., due to usage). Analyses are presented of motor operated valves (MOVs), <b>motor</b> <b>driven</b> <b>pumps</b> (MDPs), and turbine <b>driven</b> <b>pumps</b> (FDPs).

40|$|In Part I of this two-part series, {{we focus}} on {{efficient}} use of <b>motors,</b> <b>drives</b> and <b>pumps,</b> both for process equipment and compressed air systems. Pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in the U. S. spend nearly $ 1 billion each year for the fuel and electricity they need to keep their facilities running (Figure 1, below). That total that can increase dramatically when fuel supplies tighten and oil prices rise, as they did last year. Improving energy efficiency should be a strategic goal for any plant manager or manufacturing professional working in the drug industry today. Not only can energy efficiency reduce overall manufacturing costs, it usually reduces environmental emissions, establishing a strong foundation for a corporate greenhouse-gas-management program.

In this paper, the developed boost converter steps up the voltage {{produced by the}} PV array to a value which is suitable to run a single-phase induction motor.
