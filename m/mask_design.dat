25|$|The {{introduction}} of the shadow <b>mask</b> <b>design</b> by RCA produced a workable solution for color television, albeit one with considerably less image brightness. Interest in alternative systems like the Telechrome or Geer tube faded by the late 1950s. The only alternatives to see widespread use were General Electric's slot-mask, and Sony's Trinitron, both were modifications of the RCA concept. All CRT-based methods have since been almost completely replaced by LCD television, starting in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The Dos Leyendas show {{featured}} a new entrance {{set up by}} CMLL, featuring three large video screens and separate staircases for the rudos and tecnicos to come down during their introductions. The crowd {{was estimated to be}} over 14,000 spectators in total, which was a significant improvement compared to the attendance of the Super Viernes shows of the previous weeks, which had drawn less than half those numbers. In the opening match La Dinastía Casas ("The Casas Dynasty") of El Felino and his sons Puma and Tiger shows their team unity with their black and white ring gear as well as Puma and Tiger both wearing masks that combined their own <b>mask</b> <b>design</b> with that of their brother. While the team of Delta, Guerrero Maya Jr. and Tritón came ready to fight El Felino was fired up and motivated by teaming with his sons, which showed in his performance in the match. Puma and Tiger had been at odds at times before the show, but there was no signs of dissension during the match as La Dinastía Casas won both the second and third fall, taking the final fall with Tiger and Puma pinning their opponents. The second match clearly demonstrated that Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto) work as a well functioning team due to their many years of experience from teaming together, the three managed to win the first fall over La Máscara, Máscara Dorada and Valiente in convincing fashion, {{so much so that the}} Arena Mexico crowd were cheering for the team despite them being the rudos in the match. During the second fall the high flying moves and skills of Máscara Dorada was the only time the crowd would cheer for the tecnico side, supporting them as they won the second fall. In the third and deciding fall Averno got the pinfall victory for his team, giving Los Hijos del Averno a very appreciated victory.|$|E

50|$|In {{comparison}} to early shadow <b>mask</b> <b>designs,</b> the Trinitron grille cuts off {{much less of}} the signal coming from the electron guns. RCA sets built in the 1950s cut off about 85% of the incoming signal, while the grille cuts off about 25%. Improvements to the shadow <b>mask</b> <b>designs</b> continually narrowed this difference in the two designs, and by the late 1980s the difference in performance, at least theoretically, was eliminated.|$|R
500|$|After {{his initial}} training, Felipe Alvarado {{would make his}} {{official}} wrestling debut on April 2, 2000, using the ring name [...] "Brazo de Oro Jr.", wearing the same <b>mask</b> <b>design</b> as his father. As Brazo de Oro Jr. he often teamed up with his cousins (José Christian Alvarado and his brother) who worked as Brazo de Platino Jr. and Brazo de Plata Jr. respectively, collectively referred to as Los Brazos Junior. The trio worked primarily for CMLL, normally in the early parts of the shows as they gained in ring experience. During the summer of 2002 Brazo de Oro Jr. was involved in his first significant storyline feud against a local wrestler on Oaxaca known as Némesis. On August 24, 2002 Brazo de Oro Jr. defeated Némesis [...] in a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", after which Némesis was forced to unmask. In Lucha libre the Lucha de Apuestas matches are generally considered more prestigious than winning a championship. Through CMLL's working relationship with International Wrestling Revolution Group Los Brazos Junior worked several major shows for that promotion. Including the Arena Naucalpan 26th Anniversary Show on December 21, 2003 where they defeated the trio of Angel de Tijuana and Los Megas (Mega and Ultra Mega). and the subsequent IWRG 8th Anniversary Show on January 1, 2004 where they defeated Los Comandos (Comando Alfa, Comando Delta and Comando Gama).|$|E
500|$|In 2012 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} their Generacion 2012, ("Generation 2012"), {{essentially the}} 2012 [...] "graduating class" [...] from CMLL's wrestling school. The group included Oro Jr. Herodes Jr., Taurus, Genesis, Guerrero Negro Jr. and Akuma {{as well as}} Espanto Jr. who wore the distinctive black and white mask of the Los Espantos team. Espanto Jr. was later revealed to be {{the son of the}} original Espanto Jr., who had used the ring name from 1984 until 1994. In the weeks and months following the introduction of Generacion 2012 wrestler, [...] "Hijo del Espanto" [...] (Literally [...] "the Son of Espanto") publicly stated that he was the rightful holder of the rights to the Espanto name, given to him by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II. Hijo del Espanto demanded that Espanto Jr. changed his name, but neither the wrestler nor CMLL ever responded to the request. CMLL never commented on the claim of El Hijo del Espanto, nor did they modify Espanto Jr.'s name or <b>mask</b> <b>design.</b> Previously El Hijo del Espanto had successfully prevented AAA from promoting a different team as [...] "Los Hijos del Espanto", who in fact were uncles of Espanto Jr., Sergio and César Andrade Salas. While the claim was successful in 2001, the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission did not block CMLL's usage of the name [...] "Espanto Jr." [...] as CMLL continued to promote Espanto Jr. even after the claim by El Hijo del Espanto.|$|E
500|$|To {{produce the}} many grisly effects for the film, the {{producers}} recruited KNB Effects team Howard Berger, Robert Kurtzman, and Gregory Nicotero. One {{of their first}} tasks was {{the production of a}} mask for the film's killer. In his script, Williamson had only described the antagonist as a [...] "masked killer", which gave Craven no specific information on what type of mask to use or how to conceal the body. While location scouting, Maddalena discovered the Ghostface mask hanging from a post inside the house previously used for the film Shadow of a Doubt. Craven wanted to use it, but the <b>mask</b> <b>design</b> was owned by Fun World, a costume company. He was told to create one that the production could own. KNB developed multiple design sketches varying from deformed faces to monstrous visages riddled with fangs. Craven found nothing like the Ghostface design, so he had KNB develop a mask that was based on it, with enough differences to avoid any claim of copyright. The team developed several molds based on the Ghostface design, but Craven found none were as suitable as the mask he wanted to use. Desperate to use the design, Craven finally convinced the studio to approach Fun World and gained permission to use the mask. While negotiations were in progress, he had KNB make a mask that was very similar to the original mask, but was appropriate for use in filming. The mask they produced, made of a thin foam, was used in two scenes of the film: the opening scene with Barrymore's character and the murder of Principal Himbry. Craven disliked the mask due to its slight differences from the original, and thus used the Fun World design for the rest of filming.|$|E

500|$|Hechicero was one {{of sixteen}} wrestlers {{given a chance to}} compete in the 2014 En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournament. The En Busca de un Ídolo tournament {{featured}} younger wrestlers, mostly low-to-mid-card wrestlers where they were given an opportunity to showcase their wrestling skills on a national scale. As part of the tournament each wrestler would earn points from the outcome of their matches, feedback from a panel of judges and a weekly online poll. Hechicero was one eight wrestlers to qualify as he survived a Torneo cibernetico elimination match along with Cavernario, Chachorro, Dragon Lee Guerrero Negro, Jr., Soberano, Jr., Star Jr., and Super Halcón, Jr. Hechicero ended up on the team being coached by Virus each week, with coaching focusing not just on the actual wrestling but also how to play their characters in the ring, interact with the fans and so on. During the weekly judging Hechicero received praise for his in-ring skills but also got several comments on {{the fact that he did}} not wrestle a very rudo style and needed to be more aggressive in the ring, something he tried to incorporate from week to week. After the first round Hechicero won almost every single weekly online poll, propelling him to the top of the ranking at the end with a total of 565 points, 114 more than the second place Cavernario. In the week between the first and the second round Hechicero teamed up with Virus and Cachorro to defeat Negro Casas, Cavernario and Dragon Lee on the May 23 Super Viernes show. In the second round Hechicero lost to Cavernario but defeated both Dragon Lee and Cachorro to earn a total of 250 points, including the majority of the online poll votes. The point score qualified Hechicero for the finals against Cavernario. In the final Cavernario defeated Hechicero two falls to one to win the tournament. The following week all eight [...] "Busca" [...] competitors two trainers faced off in a torneo cibernetico elimination match that saw Negro Casas eliminate Virus as the last man to win the match, Hechicero was eliminated as the sixth man by as he and Cavernario pinned each other at the same time. In the weeks following the En Busca de un Ídolo finals Hechicero began teaming with Mephisto and Ephesto for a couple of shows, possibly signaling that CMLL had plans to make them a trio after Mephisto and Ephesto's regular partner Averno had left CMLL. Later when Mephisto and Ephesto were announced as teaming with El Hombre Sin Nombre ("The Man with No Name") there was initial confusion if that meant Hechicero was being given a new ring identify, but once El Hombre Sin Nombre made his debut, it was obvious that the physical appearance and wrestling style did not match Hechicero. On the October 10, 2014 Super Viernes show Hechicero debuted a new look, including a new <b>mask</b> <b>design</b> and trunks in black with gold or red embellishment. As part of his image makeover Hechicero began carrying a bowl that burned with red flames as part of his entrance rituals. At ringside Hechicero often touches and sometimes scoops out the flames from the bowl without hurting his hands.|$|E

2500|$|For the film's killer, Williamson's script had {{provided}} Craven {{only with the}} description [...] "masked killer", forcing him and his design team to create the Ghostface costume from scratch to conceal the killer's identity. While awaiting permission from Fun World, creators of the Ghostface <b>mask</b> <b>design,</b> Craven had the design team KNB Effects create an alternative {{that was used in}} two scenes before being replaced by the original Fun World design once permission was granted. Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask, believing it was not [...] "scary", and the studio, upon reviewing the dailies footage of the opening scene, were concerned that it was progressing in a direction they did not want and there was consideration that Craven could ultimately be replaced. To assuage their concerns, the first thirteen minutes of the opening scene were compiled as a workprint, a rough version of the finished film, and upon seeing it, the studio were content to let Craven continue and Weinstein was satisfied that the mask could be scary. The third and final act of the film, set at a house party, was over forty minutes long and shot at a vacant property in Tomales over twenty-one nights. The scene was considered the most difficult to shoot, as it took place entirely in one location, yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters, and as it was set at night, meant that production had to halt at daybreak.|$|E

2500|$|Although several makeup effects {{companies}} were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Stan Winston was not {{directly involved in}} the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on [...] creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, [...] "The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and how to make it affordable. We knew {{there was going to be}} a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given." [...] Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, [...] "We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters." [...] During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible. Hurd explained, [...] "We wanted the aliens to be more like a different ethnic race than like lizard people, ..." [...] She added, [...] "We didn't want our audiences thinking, 'Gee, look how different these aliens are.' Rather, after about five minutes we wanted the audience to accept them as different from us, but not so different that no one is buying the storyline. We wanted the aliens to be characters–not creatures." [...] A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that [...] "the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster's comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would've required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead." [...] Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had [...] "heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters." [...] Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the <b>mask</b> <b>design.</b> Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.|$|E

As a result, the <b>mask</b> <b>designed</b> may deliver poor performance with process variations. In this paper, we first describe how a general point spread function (PSF) with wave aberration can degrade the output pattern quality, and then show how the wave aberration function can be incorporated into an inverse imaging framework for robust input <b>mask</b> pattern <b>design</b> against aberrations. A level-set-based time-dependent model can then be applied to solve it with appropriate finite difference schemes.
