50|$|In any lattice, a modular pair {{is a pair}} (a, b) of {{elements}} such that for all x satisfying a ∧ b ≤ x ≤ b, we have (x ∨ a) ∧ b = x, i.e. if {{one half of the}} diamond isomorphism theorem holds for the pair.

40|$|Lengths of all {{caves in}} a region have been {{observed}} previously to be distributed hyperbolically, like self-similar geomorphic phenomena identified by Mandetbrot as exhibiting fractal geometra:. Proper cave lengths exhibit a fractal dimension of about 1. 4. These concepts are extended to other self-similar geometric properties of caves with the /bllowing consequences. Length of a cave {{is defined as the}} sum of sizes of passage-filling, linked modular elements larger than the cave-defining modulus. If total length of all caves {{in a region}} is a self-similar fractal, it has a fractal dimension between 2 and 3; and the total number of linked modular elements in a region is a self-similar fractal of the same dimension. Cave volume in any <b>modular</b> <b>element</b> size range may be calculated from the distribution. The expected conditional distribution of <b>modular</b> <b>element</b> sizes in a cave, given length and modulus, also is distributed hyperbolically. Data from Little Brush Creek Cave (Utah) agree and yield a fractal dimension of about 2. 8 (like the Menger Sponge). The expected number of modular elements in a cave equals approximately the 0. 9 power of length of the cave divided by modulus. This result yields an intriguing ' 'parlor trick.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{three main}} results. First, {{we show that}} if a commutative semigroup variety is a <b>modular</b> <b>element</b> of the lattice Com of all commutative semigroup varieties then it is either the variety COM of all commutative semigroups or a nil-variety or the join of a nil-variety with the variety of semilattices. Second, we prove that if a commutative nil-variety is a <b>modular</b> <b>element</b> of Com then it may be given within COM by 0 -reduced and substitutive identities only. Third, we completely classify all lower-modular elements of Com. As a corollary, we prove that an element of Com is modular whenever it is lower-modular. All these results are precise analogues of results concerning modular and lower-modular elements of the lattice of all semigroup varieties obtained earlier by Jezek, McKenzie, Vernikov, and the author. As an application of a technique developed in this paper, we provide new proofs of the `prototypes' {{of the first and}} the third our results. Comment: 15 page...|$|E
