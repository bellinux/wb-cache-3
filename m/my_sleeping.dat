I sent for an ambulance, and {{he was taken to}} hospital. I also noticed that ten of <b>my</b> <b>sleeping</b> tablets were missing." [...] In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that {{he wanted to go to}} sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Mick Molloy {{returned}} to Triple M with Tough Love from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. He {{was joined by}} Robyn Butler, Alan Brough and Richard Molloy (aka [...] "Roo"). Alan left the show {{at the end of}} 2004 and it shifted to 12:00 pm – 1:00 pm, presumably to allow Molloy to work on other projects. At the end of 2006, Molloy ended the show, sarcastically saying [...] "The relentless grind of a one-hour national radio show has finally taken its toll. The midday starts were also brutal, often playing havoc with <b>my</b> <b>sleeping</b> patterns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Invocation. Hamlet {{addresses}} the Ghost (Hamlet: Spectre infernal! Image venerée! [...] "Infernal apparition! Venerated image!"). The ghost gives a sign indicating that Horatio and Marcellus should withdraw, and Hamlet orders {{them to do}} so. The ghost speaks: Écoute-moi! [...] "Listen to me!". He identifies himself and commands Hamlet to avenge him. Hamlet asks what is the crime he must avenge, and who has committed it? Sounds of music from within the castle, fanfares, and distant cannon are heard, and the Ghost responds: [...] "Hark: it is he they are honoring, he who they have proclaimed King! ... The adulterer has defiled my royal residence: and he, to make his treason more complete, spying upon my sleep and {{taking advantage of the}} hour, poured poison on <b>my</b> <b>sleeping</b> lips. ... Avenge me, my son! Avenge your father! ... From your mother, though, turn your anger away, we must leave punishment in the care of heaven." [...] The ghost withdraws, his parting words: Souviens-toi! [...] "Remember me!" [...] Hamlet draws his sword and proclaims his intention to obey the ghost's command (Hamlet: Ombre chére, ombre vengeresse, j'exaucerai ton vœu! ... je me souviendrai! [...] "Beloved shade, avenging shade, I shall fulfill your command! ... I shall remember!"). The English musicologist Elizabeth Forbes has written: [...] "Even the composer's detractors, and there have been many, are agreed that Thomas' music for this scene is masterly; he catches the chilling, gloomy atmosphere perfectly...." [...] In his review of the recording with Thomas Hampson as Hamlet, Barrymore Laurence Scherer says [...] "Thomas captures Hamlet's shadowy malaise in both vocal line and somber accompaniment.... The intimacy of the recording provides Thomas Hampson with ample opportunity {{to make the most of}} the relationship between words and music..." [...] The orchestral music which accompanies his vow to avenge his father's murder is another example of a theme which reoccurs multiple times at key points in the drama.|$|E

60|$|WE {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness, hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our senses. The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing all other cares and considerations. Nothing, however, could be done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. In this I succeeded beyond <b>my</b> expectations, <b>sleeping</b> until <b>my</b> companions, who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.|$|R

60|$|She had got {{the start}} of me--thanks to <b>my</b> laziness in <b>sleeping</b> away the {{precious}} {{hours of the morning}} in bed.
