40|$|In this work, p-CuGaO 2 /n-ZnO {{heterojunction}} diodes were deposited by RF powered sputtering method on {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PETP, PET) substrates. Structural, morphology, optical and electrical properties of CuGaO 2 /ZnO heterojunction was investigated {{as a function}} of annealing duration. The structural properties show the ZnO films (002) peak were stronger at the range of 34 ° while CuGaO 2 (015) peak is not visible at 44 °. The surface morphology revealed that RMS roughness become smoother as the annealing duration increase to 30 minutes and become rougher as the annealing duration is increased to 60 minutes. The optical properties of CuGaO 2 /ZnO heterojunction diode at 30 minutes exhibit approximately 75 % optical transmittance in the invisible region.

40|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{between the}} switching energy and electro-thermal robustness is explored for 1. 2 -kV SiC MOSFET, silicon power MOSFET, and 900 -V CoolMOS body diodes at different temperatures. The <b>maximum</b> <b>forward</b> <b>current</b> for dynamic avalanche breakdown is decreased with increasing supply voltage and temperature for all technologies. The CoolMOS exhibited the largest latch-up current {{followed by the}} SiC MOSFET and silicon power MOSFET; however, when expressed as current density, the SiC MOSFET comes first followed by the CoolMOS and silicon power MOSFET. For the CoolMOS, the alternating p and n pillars of the superjunctions in the drift region suppress BJT latch-up during reverse recovery by minimizing lateral currents and providing low-resistance paths for carriers. Hence, the temperature dependence of the latch-up current for CoolMOS was the lowest. The switching energy of the CoolMOS body diode is the largest because of its superjunction architecture which means the drift region have higher doping, hence more reverse charge. In spite of having a higher thermal resistance, the SiC MOSFET has approximately the same latch-up current while exhibiting the lowest switching energy because of the least reverse charge. The silicon power MOSFET exhibits intermediate performance on switching energy with lowest dynamic latching current...|$|E

The development of mega-watt power converters strongly depends on the state-of-the-art of power semiconductor technology. The Emitter Turn-off Thyristor (ETO) is a new emerging high power semiconductor switch which combines the advantages of Gate Turn-off Thyristor’s (GTO) high voltage and current capability and MOS easy gate control. Its superior control characteristics combined with its high speed, wider RBSOA, higher controllable <b>maximum</b> <b>current,</b> <b>forward</b> <b>current</b> saturation capability, its on-device current sensing and low cost make the ET 0 the most promising power device in high power, smart control applications.

50|$|The above {{descriptions}} assumed {{an ideal}} diode with zero {{resistance in the}} forward direction and infinite resistance in the reverse direction. The circuit designer must concern himself with real diodes. The articles p-n diode and a less detailed article p-n junction describe the physics of the PN diode.

The designer of a reliable diode logic circuit is usually limited to what the diode specification provides which is often less than the equation suggests.

40|$|Abstract The {{efficiency}} of a solar cell {{is given by}} its average electrical parameters. On inhomogeneous materials and especially on large-area solar cells the inhomogeneity of the short circuit current, the open circuit voltage and the fill factor are important factors to reach high and stable efficiencies and may limit the overall performance of the device. A locally increased dark <b>forward</b> <b>current</b> (shunt) reduces the fill factor and the open circuit voltage of the whole cell. The inhomogeneity of the <b>forward</b> <b>current</b> in a solar cell can be measured using lock-in thermography. The quantitative and voltage-dependent evaluation of these thermographic investigations of various solar cell types on mono- or multicrystalline silicon enables the Paper presented at EMRS 2001 Strasbourg classification of the different shunting mechanisms found. By further microscopic investigations the physical reasons for the increased dark <b>forward</b> <b>currents</b> can be determined. It turns out that a high density of crystallographic defects like dislocation tangles or microdefects can be responsible for an increased dark <b>forward</b> <b>current.</b> Unexpectedly, grain boundaries in solar cells on multicrystalline silicon do not show any measurable influence on the local dark <b>forward</b> <b>current.</b> In most cases shunts caused by process-induced defects are dominating the current-voltage characteristic at the maximum power point of the solar cell. In commercial solar cells shunts at the edges are most important, followed by shunts beyond the grid lines...|$|R
