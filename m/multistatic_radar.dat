50|$|Passive (<b>multistatic)</b> <b>radar,</b> {{bistatic}} {{radar and}} especially <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar</b> systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional monostatic radars, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy {{away from the}} transmitter's line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.|$|E
50|$|The {{ambiguity}} function can {{be extended}} to <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars,</b> which comprise multiple non-colocated transmitters and/or receivers (and can include bistatic radar as a special case).|$|R
50|$|With purpose shaping, {{the shape}} of the target’s {{reflecting}} surfaces is designed such that they reflect energy away from the source. The aim is usually to create a “cone-of-silence” about the target’s direction of motion. Due to the energy reflection, this method is defeated by using Passive (<b>multistatic)</b> <b>radars.</b>|$|R

50|$|Passive (<b>multistatic)</b> <b>radar,</b> {{bistatic}} {{radar and}} especially <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar</b> systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional monostatic radars, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F117) reflects energy {{away from the}} transmitter's line of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor. Such a system typically uses either low frequency broadcast TV and FM radio signals (at which frequencies controlling the aircraft's signature is more difficult). Later stealth approaches do not rely on controlling the specular reflections of radar energy and so the geometrical benefits {{are unlikely to be}} significant.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{waveform}} selection for range-Doppler estimation in wide-band <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars</b> is addressed. The transmitted signal {{is assumed to}} be cyclostationary, and cyclostationarity properties are exploited for range-Doppler estimation in severe noise and interference environments. Simulation studies are carried out to investigate waveform parameter selection for better estimation performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{concerns}} PN {{signal detection}} in multipath interference {{by using a}} passive correlation receiver with an OS CFAR processor. Noise level estimation is performed in both windows, using the ordered statistics (OS) approach. The minimum of the average decision threshold is used as an OS estimation criterion of effectiveness [1] The CFAR processor parameters are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The achieved results can be applied for target detection in <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars</b> using existing communication networks...|$|R
30|$|In a <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar</b> system, {{illuminators}} {{of opportunity}} such as radio or television transmitters can be used. The transmitted signals are {{not under the}} control of the receiver; thus, the receiver can remain hidden. One can measure the time difference of arrival (TDOA) and Doppler shift between signal received directly from the illuminator and delayed copies from potential targets. As the receiver and transmitter in the <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar</b> system are completely separated, the receiver therein just needs to process the received signals while it has to service the transmitter in a feedback manner and consumes much more power in some other radar systems; therefore, the <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar</b> system is more economic. Due to the non-cooperative illuminator transmits low RF signals, the chance to detect stealth and low altitude targets increases [1]; however, this causes problem in that measurement of the azimuth angle is often of very poor quality or not even available at some extreme situations. Therefore, in this <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar</b> system, the range and range rate are measured while the angle information is assumed to be unavailable, due to the low RF frequencies of the illuminating signals.|$|R
5000|$|Monostatic radar is radar {{in which}} the {{transmitter}} and receiver are collocated. [...] This is the conventional configuration for a radar, but the term is used to distinguish it from a bistatic radar or <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Increased {{coverage}} in <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar</b> {{may be obtained}} via the spreading of the radar geometry throughout the surveillance area - such that targets might {{be more likely to}} be physically closer to transmitter receiver-pairs and thus attain a higher signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
50|$|Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign {{with support}} of DARPA, {{have shown that}} it is {{possible}} to build a synthetic aperture radar image of an aircraft target using passive <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar,</b> possibly detailed enough to enable automatic target recognition (ATR).|$|E
40|$|Various {{methods for}} {{analyses}} of scattering are mentioned and new approximate relationships are derived. Experimental results for thin wire and several numerical simulations of forward scattering using approximate estimations, physical optics and exact solutions for two-dimensional scattering are presented both for far and near fields. That allows not only accuracy analyses but also conclusions about scattering and total {{fields in the}} presence of objects, which are important for many applications such as communications, bistatic and <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars</b> and electromagnetic compatibility...|$|R
50|$|Passive radar {{accuracy}} {{is a strong}} function of the deployment geometry {{and the number of}} receivers and transmitters being used. Systems using only one transmitter and one receiver will tend to be much less accurate than conventional surveillance <b>radars,</b> whilst <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars</b> are capable of achieving somewhat greater accuracies. Most passive radars are two-dimensional, but height measurements are possible when the deployment is such there is significant variation in the altitudes of the transmitters, receiver and target, reducing the effects of geometrical dilution of precision (GDOP).|$|R
40|$|Multisatic {{radar systems}} offer the {{potential}} to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} the monostatic or bistatic systems. In particular, the ability to build larger apertures allows to increase spatial accuracy. Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is a method of choice in the context of slow-moving target detection. However, the statistics of signals from <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars</b> are typically range-dependent. This range-dependence leads to major difficulties in estimating the interference plus noise covariance matrix required to perform STAP. In this paper, we present a method able to compensate for the range-dependence of the signal statistics and we show that this method achieves near-optimal performance. 1...|$|R
50|$|MISTRAM was a multistatic long {{baseline}} radar interferometer developed for precision measurements of missile trajectories at the US Air Force Eastern Test Range. <b>Multistatic</b> <b>radar</b> systems {{have a higher}} complexity with multiple transmitter and receiver subsystems employed in a coordinated manner at more than two sites. All of the geographically dispersed units contribute to the collective target acquisition, detection, position finding and resolution, with simultaneous reception at the receiver sites. In a simpler sense, multistatic radars are systems which have two or more receiving sites with a common spatial coverage area, and data from these coverage areas are combined and processed at a central location. These systems {{are considered to be}} multiple bistatic pairs. <b>Multistatic</b> <b>radar</b> systems have various uses, including prevention of jamming and anti-radar munitions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar</b> {{system is}} one in which {{there are at least three}} {{components}} - for example, one receiver and two transmitters, or two receivers and one transmitter, or multiple receivers and multiple transmitters.

30|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} target detection for <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars.</b> We propose an algorithm that is able to keep constant the false alarm rate, when the disturbance samples associated with each receiver-transmitter pair are distributed according to a compound Gaussian model.

The results show that clutter statistical diversity has a strong impact on detection performance. The performance of both single-channel and multichannel detection schemes are evaluated by processing real sea clutter data collected by the NetRAD nodes, in order to evaluate which of the two channels, i.e. the bistatic and monostatic channels, is more favourable for target detection. Furthermore, the gain achieved by using a multistatic detection algorithm is also analysed.|$|R

50|$|Much of {{the stealth}} comes in {{directions}} {{different than a}} direct return. Thus, detection can be better achieved if emitters are separate from receivers. One emitter separate from one receiver is termed bistatic radar; one or more emitters separate {{from more than one}} receiver is termed <b>multistatic</b> <b>radar.</b> Proposals exist to use reflections from emitters such as civilian radio transmitters, including cellular telephone radio towers.|$|E
50|$|A {{bistatic}} {{remote sensing}} system would separate source 3a from sensor 3b; a multistatic system could have multiple pairs of coupled sources and sensors, or an uneven ratio of sources and sensors as long as all are correlated.

It is also a requirement, from operations personnel concerned with shallow water operations.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPassive bistatic radars (PBR) and passive <b>multistatic</b> <b>radars</b> (PMR) use opportunistic transmitters {{to detect and}} locate targets. In this thesis, a maritime scenario was modeled with merchant vessels serving as multiple non-cooperative opportunistic transmitters while a frigate warship equipped with Electronic Warfare (EW) and Direction Finding (DF) receivers takes {{on the role of}} the receiver in a PBR/PMR configuration. The targets are assumed to be the generic Formidable-class frigate. A MATLAB model is developed to simulate the operating environment and passive detection and location process. Detection coverage is investigated to propose optimal PBR/PMR configurations and geometry, while elliptical and hyperbolic target location methods are explored to quantify the effects of PBR/PMR parameters and geometry on target estimated location uncertainty.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a new {{algorithm}} for motion parame-ter estimation of moving targets in a <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar.</b> Existing methods for motion parameter estimation rely on the estimated Doppler signatures of the observed signals corre-sponding to each transmitter. These techniques may fail for weak signals where the individual Doppler signature cannot be properly estimated. The focus {{of this paper is}} on motion parameter estimation from weak signals observed using mul-tiple illuminators. Utilizing the sparsity of the motion param-eters, the proposed technique obtains robust motion parame-ter estimates through the fusion of the data corresponding to all available illuminators, achieving signal enhancement and multistatic diversity. To reduce the computational cost, the acceleration and velocity parameters are decoupled and se-quentially estimated.

In this paper, we develop parametric models of canonical shapes for bistatic {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR). We generalize geometric theory of diffraction solutions for scattering mechanisms in a plane to develop three-dimensional models for six canonical shapes: a rectangular plate, dihedral, trihedral, cylinder, top-hat, and sphere. The proposed models provide physically relevant yet compact scattering solutions that are easily implemented for radar signal processing and ATR applications. The derived models are shown to agree with results obtained from high-frequency, asymptotic scattering simulations.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) with {{uncertain}} observations, namely for Pd< 1, for the 2 D position measurements of a <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar,</b> {{to optimize the}} geometry of the system. This {{is an extension of}} the enumeration method CRLB [1 - 3] to the multisensor case, where it is considered that the multiple receivers could detect or miss the target independently of one another. This version of the CRLB with uncertain observations is the correct measure for the realistic performance assessment of a passive radar, since typically passive radars show low values of Pd and neglecting the target miss probability, in the standard evaluation of the CRLB, provides unreliable performance assessments. The obtained CRLB is then used inside the <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar</b> optimization scheme derived by the authors in [4], to select the broadcast transmitters and the receiver locations providing the highest accuracy. The proposed approach is illustrated by means of a case study: a <b>multistatic</b> passive <b>radar</b> based on two transmitters of opportunity and a single receiver. For this case, we analyse how the Signal to Noise Ratio and the detection probability affect the measurement accuracy and the estimation accuracy and, finally, we use the theoretical CRLB to select the two transmitters among the available ones and choose the receiver location, for a target flying a specific trajectory. © 2010 EuMA...|$|R
