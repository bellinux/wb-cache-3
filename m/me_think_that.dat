Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, and it made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> so many people spend their lives being {{told what to do}} by people that they just don't like. So it was that idea, and watching Bill O'Reilly, and all these words just came out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|... "That's Not My Penguin" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television commentators. Matt Fowler of IGN gave an extremely positive review. He {{claimed that the}} story worked [...] "either way" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "awesome", mainly because of the hallucinations. Fowler stated that he had his [...] "mind blown" [...] and that {{the best part of the}} episode was [...] "when the show, for a little while, actually made <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there was something to Gabriel's Dr. Wild story". Claiming that he was [...] "hooked" [...] to the show, Folwer concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "A-" [...] review, he noted that the episode [...] "doesn't show any signs of imminent immolation". He thought that the morale of the episode was [...] "wanting something to be real doesn't make it easier to pretend, and the harder Michael has to work to keep this up, the better the odds that he’s going to lose his grip". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix [...] "loved" [...] the episode. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a [...] "5 out of 5" [...] as a perfect score and thought that the entry [...] "really used Awake concept to its advantage".|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{said in his}} {{announcement}} for the 1980 race that he had gone [...] "as far as we could in the Congress with the vote-fraud problems. I think it's now to be left up to the voters of the Fourth District to decide if there was voter fraud in the election. That will happen this fall. ...

I hesitate no less to say that I will never hold communication with the Duke of Portland until he has made that amende honorable to those...whose weight and consideration in Ireland he has made subservient to his own purposes and views in this country. ...my inclinations, my private attachments, the habits of my life, all combine to make me anxious to see the moment when I {{may be able to}} give the members of opposition honourable assistance. ... But in stating this it certainly is not in my contemplation to become again an active member of an opposition. Those days are over—circumstances have happened that make <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I can be no more usefully so...but, in one word, should circumstances ever present to me the opportunity of doing essential injury to Mr Pitt's power, or of rendering effectual service to Mr Fox, I will not fail to seize it.|$|E
