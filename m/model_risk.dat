25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group {{might well be}} seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage <b>model</b> <b>risk,</b> or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.|$|E
2500|$|More fundamentally, {{investors are}} stuck with {{estimating}} key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to <b>model</b> <b>risk</b> {{in terms of}} the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are probabilistic in nature, not structural. [...] This is a major difference as compared to many engineering approaches to risk management. As estimation errors are critical in MPT, appropriate modeling approaches must be applied. In an MPT or mean-variance optimization framework, accurate estimation of the variance–covariance matrix is paramount. [...] Thus, forecasting with Monte-Carlo simulation with the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginal distributions are effective. [...] Allowing the modeling process to allow for empirical characteristics in stock returns such as auto-regression, asymmetric volatility, skewness, and kurtosis is important. [...] Not accounting for these attributes can lead to severe estimation error in the correlation and variance–covariance matrices that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values).|$|E

By applying classification techniques from taxonomy development, the collective knowledge of previous modelers has been captured in a classification scheme for system dynamics <b>modeling</b> <b>risks.</b> The classification scheme allows modelers to more efficiently and effectively consider <b>modeling</b> <b>risks</b> by reducing the variation in their knowledge levels. The classification structure is focused {{on the steps of the}} system dynamics modeling methodology and the achievement of system knowledge and improvement objectives. As part of a broader <b>modeling</b> <b>risk</b> management approach, the risk classification scheme assists modelers in identifying and prioritizing the anticipated sources of <b>modeling</b> <b>risks</b> for a project.

By a change of measure we remove the discounting, which simplifies the expression. This leads to (defective) renewal equations as they had been found by different methods in the literature. If we use the change of measure such that ruin becomes certain, the renewal equations simplify to ordinary renewal equations. This helps to discuss the asymptotics as the initial capital goes to infinity. For phase-type claim sizes, explicit formulae can be derived.

40|$|Background There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to inform the targeted treatment of individuals found early in the diabetes disease trajectory. Aim To describe cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles and treatment of individual CVD <b>risk</b> factors by <b>modelled</b> CVD <b>risk</b> at diagnosis; changes in treatment, <b>modelled</b> CVD <b>risk,</b> and CVD risk factors in the 5 years following diagnosis; and how these are patterned by socioeconomic status. Design and setting Cohort analysis of a cluster-randomised trial (ADDITION-Europe) in general practices in Denmark, England, and the Netherlands. Method A total of 2418 individuals with screen-detected diabetes were divided into quartiles of modelled 10 -year CVD risk at diagnosis. Changes in treatment, <b>modelled</b> CVD <b>risk,</b> and CVD risk factors were assessed at 5 years. Results The largest reductions in <b>risk</b> factors and <b>modelled</b> CVD <b>risk</b> were seen in participants {{who were in the}} highest quartile of <b>modelled</b> <b>risk</b> at baseline, suggesting that treatment was offered appropriately. Participants in the lowest quartile of risk at baseline had very similar levels of <b>modelled</b> CVD <b>risk</b> at 5 years and showed the least variation in change in <b>modelled</b> <b>risk.</b> No association was found between socioeconomic status and changes in CVD risk factors, suggesting that treatment was equitable. Conclusion Diabetes management requires setting of individualised attainable targets.

40|$|Quantitative risk {{analysis}} is usually ignored in construction risk management, although numerous techniques are available. One of {{the shortcomings of}} conventional quantitative {{risk analysis}} techniques {{is that they can}} only analyse either duration or cost risks. In view of this, an integrated duration-cost influence network that systematically represents the interdependencies among the duration and cost parameters of a construction task has been developed, and mathematical equations have been formulated to represent the dependencies.
