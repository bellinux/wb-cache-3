5000|$|In {{the first}} season, Earth is {{attacked}} by Gamilon, a distant planet. The radiation from Gamilon's planet bombs forces everyone on Earth underground. With {{no way to}} remove the radiation, all life on Earth will be wiped out in one year. The Earth then receives unexpected help from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar, who offers a device called [...] "Cosmo DNA" [...] which will remove the radiation. However, since Iscandar is 148,000 light years away, Starsha also sends plans for the experimental Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine</b> that, when constructed, will aid whoever can travel to Iscandar.

40|$|Abstract — A {{real-time}} vehicle <b>motion</b> planning <b>engine</b> {{is presented}} in this paper, with the focus on exploiting the prior and online traffic knowledge, e. g., predefined roadmap, prior environment information, behaviour-based motion primitives, within the space exploration guided heuristic search (SEHS) framework. The SEHS algorithm plans a kinodynamic vehicle motion in two steps: a geometric investigation of the free space, followed by a grid-free heuristic search employing primitive motions. These two procedures are generic and possible {{to take advantage of}} traffic knowledge. In this paper, the space exploration is supported by a roadmap and the heuristic search benefits from the behaviour-based primitives. Based on this idea, a light weighted <b>motion</b> planning <b>engine</b> is built, with the purpose to handle the traffic knowledge and the planning time in real-time motion planning. The experiments demonstrate that this SEHS <b>motion</b> planning <b>engine</b> is flexible and scalable for practical traffic scenarios with better results than the baseline SEHS motion planner regarding the provided traffic knowledge.

A message from the planet Iscandar was received, containing plans for a space drive called the Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine,</b> which would give a spacecraft immense power and let it travel faster than light.

5000|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Earth secretly build a massive spaceship inside {{the ruins of}} the gigantic Japanese battleship Yamato which lies exposed at the former bottom of the ocean location where she was sunk in World War II. This becomes the [...] "Space Battleship Yamato" [...] for which the story is titled. Using Starsha's blueprints, they equip the new ship with a space warp drive, called the [...] "wave motion engine", and a new, incredibly powerful weapon at the bow called the [...] "Wave Motion Gun". The Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine</b> (hadō enjin) is capable of converting the vacuum of space into tachyon energy, as well as functioning like a normal rocket engine, and providing essentially infinite power to the ship, it enables the Yamato to [...] "ride" [...] the wave of tachyons and travel faster than light. The Wave Motion Gun (hadō hō), also called the Dimensional Wave Motion Explosive Compression Emitter, is the [...] "trump card" [...] of the Yamato that functions by connecting the Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine</b> to the enormous firing gate at the ship's bow, enabling the tachyon energy power of the engine to be fired in a stream directly forwards. Enormously powerful, it can vaporize a fleet of enemy ships—or a small continent (as seen in the first season, fifth episode)—with one shot; however, it takes a brief but critical period to charge before firing.|$|E

Yurisha was sent to Earth one year before Sasha with the message and the engine schematics; Sasha was tasked with bringing the engines [...] "activation core".

It {{is capable of}} {{converting}} the vacuum of space into tachyon energy, as well as functioning like a normal rocket engine, and providing essentially infinite power to the ship, it enables the Yamato to [...] "ride" [...] the wave of tachyons and travel faster than light; in its first test it travels from Earth's Moon to Mars in one minute. However, this feature must be activated with perfect timing (by a human navigator), at a point when space at the origin and destination are in the correct phase, otherwise the ship could become lost in the fourth dimension. In Yamato Rebirth, the engine can warp even faster than before.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>motion</b> {{estimation}} <b>engine</b> design in future high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) encoders. First, a methodology is explained to analyze hardware implementation cost {{in terms of}} hardware area, memory size and memory bandwidth for various possible <b>motion</b> estimation <b>engine</b> designs. For 11 different configurations, hardware cost {{as well as the}} coding efficiency are quantified and are compared through a graphical analysis to make design decisions. It has been shown that using smaller block sizes (e. g. 4 × 4) imposes significantly larger hardware requirements at the expense of modest improvements in coding efficiency. Secondly, based on the analysis on various configurations, one configuration is chosen and algorithm improvements are presented to further reduce hardware implementation cost of the selected configuration. Overall, the proposed changes provide 56 × on-chip bandwidth, 151 × off-chip bandwidth, 4. 3 × core area and 4. 5 × on-chip memory area savings when compared to the hardware implementation of the HM- 3. 0 design.

5000|$|The Wave Motion Gun (hadō hō): The [...] "trump card" [...] of the Yamato, the Dimensional Wave Motion Explosive Compression Emitter, or Wave Motion Gun for short, {{functions}} {{by connecting}} the Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine</b> {{to the enormous}} firing gate at the ship's bow, enabling the tachyon energy power of the engine to be fired in a stream directly forwards. As of the 2009 movie, it has six reactors, and it can fire six shots instead of one large one. However, when combined to fire a single shot, it may rip the hull apart. Enormously powerful, it can vaporize a fleet of enemy ships with one shot or an object the size of Australia; however, it takes a brief but critical period to charge before firing. It used to require all non-essential power systems be deactivated, but now it only leaves the ship unable to warp a short time after firing (around 20 minutes, as indicated in the live-action movie). The recoil absorption mechanism can be manually deactivated with a lever; this was used to save the ship on one occasion.|$|E
50|$|By 2220, {{the ship}} has been {{completely}} rebuilt. The Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine</b> can now warp faster, the Wave Motion Gun can fire six shots instead of one, without power drain (though, in dire situations, it can be reconfigured to combine {{the power of the}} six shots and fire one enormous shot), and the ship's length has increased by 20 meters. All the fighters have been replaced by Cosmo Pulsars and Cosmo Pulsar Bombers. The Third Bridge has been painted blue, and now serves as a radar command post, with the occupants inside surrounded by an orb that projects data onto its surfaces. The white anchor logo, which had been removed from the ship in the film Final Yamato (1982), has been re-painted {{on the side of the}} ship, although the white bands around the barrels of the cannons were removed. The Bridge's old gauges and dials have been replaced with control screens and holoscreens. The control surfaces have been changed to a yoke. The hangar has also been expanded, and it uses large mechanical arms to move the fighters out of their spaces. Also, the old Wave Motion Gun target scope has been replaced with one that has a holographic screen.|$|E
50|$|In 2191, Earth made {{first contact}} with aliens called Gamilas. First attempt at {{peaceful}} {{contact with the}} Gamilas failed, resulting in interstellar war. The United Nations Cosmo Navy, even though outmatched by the Gamilas space naval forces, was able to stop their direct assaults on Earth in the second battle for Mars, but suffered heavy losses in the process.The Gamilas, from their military base on Pluto, then started planetary bombardment with modified asteroids called planet bombs. The planet bombs hampered United Nations efforts to rebuild their space fleet and forced Earth to build underground cities to protect humanity. The planet bombs altered the atmosphere and irradiated the planetary surface, causing the complete destruction of the planet's biosphere. The Gamilas then started what {{is believed to be}} their first step in terraforming ―preparing the Earth to be inhabited by themselves― by introducing plant life that was lethal to any life on Earth. With mankind facing extinction, the United Nations started planning for a small colony of humans to leave Earth in an attempt at the survival of humanity, called the Isumo Plan.But in early 2198 Starsha, from the planet Iscandar, learned of Earth's situation and dispatched her sister Yurisha to Earth. Yurisha brought with her the designs to what is called the Dimensional Wave <b>Motion</b> <b>Engine,</b> providing for interstellar flight along with other technological assistance to Earth. The Iscandarans revealed that they could reverse the damage done to the Earth with the Cosmo Reverse System. For technical reasons they could not send the system directly and would need Earth to send a ship for it. The United Nations then scrapped the Isumo Plan in order to build a new Cosmo Navy ship to retrieve the Cosmo Reverse System. The new ship was designed as a heavily armed space battleship. To conceal the ship's construction from the Gamilas, Earth built the new ship at the same site as the sunken World War II Yamato battleship. The new space battleship was also named the Yamato for which the series Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is named.|$|E
