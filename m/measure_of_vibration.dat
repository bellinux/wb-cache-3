40|$|Objective – To {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} four frequency weightings for hand-transmitted vibration to predict the incidence of vibration-induced white finger (VWF). Methods – In a longitudinal study of vibration-exposed forestry and stone workers (n= 206), the incidence of VWF was related to <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure {{expressed in terms of}} 8 -h frequency-weighted energy-equivalent r. m. s. acceleration magnitude (A(8)) and years of follow-up. To calculate A(8), the r. m. s. acceleration magnitudes <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> were weighted by means of four frequency weightings: (i) Wh (the frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001); (ii) Wh-bl (the band-limiting component of Wh); (iii) Whf (a frequency weighting based on finger vibration power absorption); and (iv) WhT (a frequency weighting based on a Japanese study of VWF prevalence). The relations of VWF to alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure were assessed by the generalised estimating equations (GEE) method to account for the within-subject dependency of the observations over time. Results – Data analysis with a GEE logistic model and a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> statistical fit suggested that A(8) calculated by weighting the tool r. m. s. accelerations with Wh-bl gave better predictions of the cumulative incidence of VWF than the other alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> daily <b>vibration</b> exposure.

40|$|There {{are several}} methods to measure surface {{evenness}} for car roads, but almost none for bike paths. Accordingly, VTI (the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute) {{have created a}} smartphone application which uses the accelerometers in the phone to measure the vibration from the road. This report’s aim is {{to analyze the data}} collected using this application, investigate if the data is repeatable, to find factors that are important for evenness and perform classification of bike paths as even or wiggly. Two main methods were used, Gaussian process and wavelets. Gaussian process was used to classify bike paths and wavelets to investigate the repeatability and see how many trips are needed to get a consistent result. The results show that the two different smartphones gave quite different results; one smartphone indicated almost twice as high RMS values (<b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration)</b> than the other. The GPS positions of smartphones were quite good, except under a tunnel and close to high buildings. Some short section of the road gave very high or very low RMS values, but the general standard of all investigated bike paths were too even to detect any significant differences between the paths. The results show that there’s some unexplained variance in the turns, but the effect of the turns hasn’t been tested. The wavelets analysis show that around 15 trips were needed to get a consistent result. The report contains a description of a designed experiment that will continue this project.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Assessing {{physical}} exposures in {{occupational health}} studies proves challenging {{regardless of the}} industry. In transportation, however, the problem is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} subjects are literally on the move. To improve the understanding of the link between chronic whole-body vibration exposure and adverse health outcomes, this study evaluated epidemiologic trends, comparing injury events among employees in a large metropolitan transit agency. The epidemiology results indicate that bus drivers are at increased risk for injury compared to a referent group of administrative workers. This study also presents the technological advancements in field-based, whole-body vibration (WBV) exposure assessment by comparing three generations of WBV data collection equipment. This study presents the ISO 2631 Part 1 and Part 5 results for field-based WBV exposure studies among professional truck drivers, bus drivers, and heavy equipment operators. Finally, this study applied field-collected vibration signal data to research on a vibration simulation hexapod. The final phase of this study evaluated vibration attenuation, comparing the current industry standard (an air-ride suspension seat) to a newly developed technology (an electromagnetically active seat) across city streets, freeways, and rough roads. This comparison of seat suspension technologies was conducted for evaluation between professional truck drivers and bus drivers, and it included a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> transmission through the spines of subjects.

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the relation between alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) and low back pain (LBP) in professional drivers. Methods The incidence of 12 -month LBP, high pain intensity (numerical rating scale score[5), and disability in the lower back (Roland and Morris disability scale score C 12) was investigated in a cohort of 537 drivers over a 2 -year follow-up period. LBP outcomes, individual characteristics, and work-related risk factors were investigated by direct interview using a structured questionnaire. Daily vibration exposure was expressed in terms of either equivalent acceleration over an 8 -h reference period [A(8), root-mean-square (r. m. s.) method] or vibration dose value [VDV, root-mean-quad (r. m. q.) method]. From the vibration magnitudes measured on vehicles and total exposure duration, seven alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> cumulative <b>vibration</b> exposure were calculated for each driver, using expressions of the form Rai mti, where ai is the frequencyweighted r. m. s. or r. m. q. acceleration magnitude on vehicle i (aws or awq, respectively), ti is the lifetime exposure duration for vehicle i, and m = 0, 1, 2, or 4. Results In the drivers’ cohort, the cumulative incidence of LBP outcomes were 36. 3 % for 12 -month LBP, 24. 6 % for high pain intensity, and 19. 2 % for disability in the lower back. A transition model, which takes into account the temporal sequence of cause and effect and captures the longitudinal part of the relationship, showed that VDV performed better than A(8) for the prediction of LBP outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders, test for trends suggested an increased risk for developing high pain intensity and disability over time (and, to a lesser extent, 12 -month LBP) with the increases <b>of</b> cumulative <b>vibration</b> doses computed from lifetime exposure duration and r. m. q. vibration magnitude (i. e.

The control group consisted of {{a small sample of}} 30 fire inspectors not exposed to WBV. Personal, occupational and health histories were collected by means of a structured questionnaire. Vibration measurements were performed on representative samples of the machines and vehicles used by the driver groups. From the vibration magnitudes and exposure durations, alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> dose were estimated for each subject. Daily vibration exposure, expressed in terms of 8 -h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration, A(8), averaged 0. 28 – 0. 61 (range 0. 10 – 1. 18) ms 2 rms in the driver groups. Duration of exposure to WBV ranged between 1 and 41 years. The 7 -day and 12 -month {{prevalence of}} LBP was greater in the driver groups than in the controls. In the professional drivers, the occurrence of 12 -month LBP, high intensity of LBP (Von Korff pain scale score X 5), and LBP disability (Roland & Morris disability scale score X 12) significantly increased with increasing cumulative vibration exposure. Even though several alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure were associated with LBP outcomes, nevertheless a more regular trend of association with LBP was found for vibration dose expressed as Paviti (m s 2 h), in which the frequency-weighted acceleration, av, and lifetime exposure duration, t, were given equal weight. In multivariate data analysis, individual characteristics (e. g. age, body mass index) and a physical load index (derived from combining manual materials handling and awkward postures) were significantly associated with LBP outcomes, while psychosocial work factors (e. g. job decision, job support) showed a marginal relation to LBP. This study tends to confirm that professional driving in industry is associated with an increased risk of work-related LBP. Exposure to WBV and physical loading factors at work are important components of the multifactorial origin of LBP in professional drivers...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} prospectively {{the relation}} between vibration-induced white finger (VWF) and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> cumulative (lifetime) exposure to handtransmitted vibration (HTV).

The diagnosis of VWF (Raynaud’s phenomenon in the controls) {{was based on the}} medical history, the administration of colour charts and the results of a cold test. Tool vibration magnitudes were expressed as root-mean-square (r. m. s.) acceleration, frequencyweighted according to international standard ISO 5349 - 1 and also unweighted over the frequency range 6. 3 – 1250 Hz. From the vibration magnitudes and exposure durations, alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> cumulative <b>vibration</b> dose were calculated for each HTV worker, according to the expression: dose = Sai mti, where ai is the acceleration magnitude on tool i, ti is the lifetime exposure duration (hours) for tool i, and m = 0, 1, 2 or 4. Results: The incidence of VWF varied from 5 to 6 % in the HTV workers versus 0 to 1. 5 % for Raynaud’s phenomenon in the controls. After adjusting for potential confounders, <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> cumulative <b>vibration</b> dose derived from total operating hours and high powers of unweighted acceleration (ie,, with m. 1) gave better predictions of the occurrence of VWF than dose measures calculated from frequency-weighted acceleration (ie,).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the exposure-response relationship for the vascular component <b>of</b> the hand-arm <b>vibration</b> syndrome, called vibration-induced white finger (VWF). Over the past two decades, several epidemiological studies have shown a poor agreement between the risk for VWF observed in various occupational groups and that predicted by models included in annexes to International Standard ISO 5349 (ISO 5349 : 1986, ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001). Either overestimation or underestimation of the occurrence of VWF have been reported by investigators. It has been argued that the current ISO frequency-weighting curve for hand-transmitted vibration, which assumes that vibration-induced adverse health effects are inversely related to the frequency <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> between 16 and 1250 Hz, may be unsuitable for the assessment of VWF. To investigate this issue, a prospective cohort study was carried out to explore the performance of four alternative frequency weightings for hand-transmitted vibration to predict the incidence of VWF in groups of forestry and stone workers. The findings of this study suggested that <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure which give relatively more weight to intermediate and high frequency vibration produced better predictions of the incidence of VWF than that obtained with the frequency weighting currently recommended in International Standard ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001...|$|R

40|$|The Naval Postgraduate School Physics Department is {{investigating}} the feasibility of identifying ground combat vehicles by <b>measuring</b> their frequency <b>of</b> <b>vibrations.</b> This thesis reconfigured an existing CO 2 laboratory laser radar system that is capable <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the frequencies <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> <b>of</b> a simulated target into a more compact and rugged form for field testing. The optical performance of the laboratory laser radar system was also improved with a combination half-wave plate, brewster-angle plate, and quarter-wave plate. The new device was tested under laboratory conditions using a target with known frequencies <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> and a target with a more complex frequency spectrum. Both tests involved illuminating the targets with the laser beam. The first target was a retro-reflector driven by a piezoelectric actuator vibrating at selectable known frequencies (typically 400 Hz). The second target was a 9 -volt DC motor supplied with 10 volts and 13 volts respectively in order to vary its speed. The laser radar proved capable of detecting the first target's frequencies <b>of</b> <b>vibrations</b> and the more complex frequency spectrum of the DC motor. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

40|$|Real-world whole-body {{vibration}} exposures comprise {{motion in}} fore-aft, lateral and vertical directions simultaneously. There {{can also be}} components of roll, pitch and yaw. If evaluating vibration with respect to human response, most investigators will use methods defined in ISO 2631 - 1. This uses frequency weightings that were originally derived from laboratory studies of the subjective responses to vibration in one direction at a time. This paper describes experiments carried out using a 6 degree-of-freedom vibration simulator to validate the applicability of ISO 2631 - 1 in multi-axis environments. 15 subjects were exposed to 87 stimuli comprising single-axis, dual-axis and tri-axial random vibration, {{to which they were}} required to produce subjective ratings. It is shown that in this study the root-sum-of-squares method of summation of subjective ratings in individual axes was an adequate technique for prediction of subjective rating <b>of</b> multiaxis <b>vibration.</b> Better agreement between objective and subjective <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> was obtained for unweighted vibration than for frequency weighted signals. The best agreement for this study was achieved when axis multiplying factors were set at 2. 2 and 2. 4 for x- and y-axis vibration respectively. Different values could be appropriate for other postures, seats, and vibration conditions and should be determined in future studies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the use of}} an accelerometer commonly {{present in}} a mobile device for the <b>measuring</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> in a vehicle. Such measurements are used to map the quality of the road surface. The signal from the accelerometer and the current travelling speed of the vehicle are evaluated according to a threshold function. This function allows for a determination of whether the signal reported by the device signifies a pot-hole or another type of defect on the road surface. If the defect is determined to pose a threat to a vehicle travelling at higher speeds, then this fact is saved into the memory of the device. The second part of this thesis deals with the design of an internet and a mobile application, which is able to collect all measured data processes using cluster analysis and then shares the results with other participating devices. Tha practical results is that a map of road surface defect is thus created, which is then displayed to road users. This thesis deals with theory of mobile device sensors, including signal processing, as well as the design creation of the internet and mobile application...|$|R
