40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of an ester of <b>montanic</b> <b>acid</b> with multifunctional alcohols in {{the effectiveness of the}} dispersion and compatibility of TiO 2 nanoparticles when included as filler in poly(ethyleneterephthalate) for composite production is studied through the study of the non-isothermal crystallization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The application of the Avrami method enables to evaluate the compatibility and the level of dispersion/aggregation of the nanofiller in the poly(ethylene terephthalate) by the analysis of the temperature and enthalpy of crystallization, the kinetic parameters and the half-crystallization timePostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|Sarcocornia ambigua is a {{perennial}} glasswort, native of South America {{and a potential}} new seed-oil crop and forage for direct irrigation with salt water. Small seeds develop inside fertile segments of its cylindrical leafless shoots and, at the harvest, seeds are typically mixed with remnant cellulose material difficult to separate. This work evaluated different extraction methods and the composition of total esterified fatty acids in a meal of ground fertile shoots of S. ambigua, seeking for an alternative primary matter and larger yield of total lipids. The highest lipid yield was obtained with a chloroform:methanol mixture (2 : 1) (v/v) (5. 2 % of dry weight). The most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the meal were linoleic acid (C 18 : 2; 21. 4 %) and oleic acid (C 18 : 1; 18. 3 %). Fifty six percent of the lipids in S. ambigua meal were saturated and palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) was the main fraction (19. 8 %). Long-chain fatty acids (&# 8805; C 20) represented 29. 5 % of the lipids. Most abundant long-chain fatty acids were behenic acid (C 22 : 0; 7. 1 %), lignoceric acid (C 24 : 0; 5. 3 %) and <b>montanic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 28 : 0; 4. 0 %). The percentage of saturated lipids in S. ambigua meal was {{higher than that of}} vegetable oils with a MUFA nutritional profile and some of these lipids have known bioactive properties...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is based}} on the {{analysis}} of the influence of dispersing agents on the non-isothermal kinetics, thermomechanical behavior and dispersing action of PET/TiO 2 nanocomposites. The influence of two montanic waxes and an amide wax used as dispersing agents in the nucleating effect of the nanoparticles is studied. The dispersing agents are the following: a) a partly saponified ester of <b>montanic</b> <b>acids</b> (PSEMA), b) an ester of <b>montanic</b> <b>acids</b> with multifunctional alcohols (MAWMA) and c) an amide wax based on N,N '-Bisstearoyl ethylenediamine (AW). The non-isothermal kinetics based on the Avrami method revealed that MAWMA and PSEMA favors the nucleating effect of the nanoparticles when are included in PET. Birefringence microscopy points out the good dispersing capacity of MAWMA and AW and the termomechanical analysis confirmed that the ester of <b>montanic</b> <b>acids</b> with multifunctional alcohols MAWMA shows the best dispersing properties and best promotes the nucleating effect of the TiO 2 nanoparticles when used for PET/TiO 2 nanocomposites productionPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
30|$|A {{series of}} hydrocarbons, {{predominantly}} nonacosane and hentriacontane, plus the methyl esters of palmitic, oleic, stearic, tetracosanoic, <b>montanic</b> and melissic <b>acids</b> were also detected in PRM 27, signifying a composite substance, and which may indicate a presence of beeswax [22, 32]. No beeswax {{is evident in}} PRM 28. This difference provides {{an explanation for the}} difference in character between the samples, whereby PRM 27 is soft and waxy, and PRM 28 is glassy and brittle (Table  1). It also concurs with the description of PRM 27 originating from ‘wild bees’ nests’.|$|R
