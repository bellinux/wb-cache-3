5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver {{supplies}} and aid in {{search and rescue}} missions. On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred <b>more</b> <b>debt</b> and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E

25|$|Mayor John F. Hylan was an {{advocate}} of public operation of the subway, and wanted this goal to be set with a vengeance. He was fired from the BRT after working as a motorman for some time, {{and he wanted to}} avoid having to spend more money to recapture the IRT and BRT, so he tried to push the two operators out of business. To that end, Hylan had denied allocating money for the BRT by refusing to build new lines, refusing to raise fares (thereby putting the BRT in <b>more</b> <b>debt),</b> denied building permits so that some major building work lasted longer than planned, and even refusing to build a new subway yard for the BRT. The Malbone Street Wreck in 1918 contributed to the losses incurred by the two companies, which led to the bankruptcy of the BRT in 1918. The BRT, however, was reorganized into the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The IRT was almost bankrupt, but managed to complete the line to Flushing by 1928. So, Hylan drew up plans for a third subway network, which should be built and operated in contrast to the existing subway lines, which were privately operated.|$|E
25|$|By the {{midpoint}} of the 2009 season, things had improved both on and off field for Melbourne. They had secured a record number of members, re-merged with the MCC, knocked-off <b>more</b> <b>debt</b> and were starting to show some fight on field. Players such as Liam Jurrah had begun to emerge as top young talents and were catching the eye of the footballing public. However, {{on the eve of the}} Round 14 clash against West Coast, influential president Jim Stynes announced that he had cancer, this evoked a very emotional response from the footballing public and the club lifted from three embarrassing defeats the weeks before to convincingly beat West Coast in front of a passionate MCG crowd. At the end of the season, Melbourne finished 16th on the ladder and for a second year in a row won no more than four games which granted them a Priority Pick in the National Draft. Melbourne therefore had picks 1 and 2 in the draft to build on their young talent. At the end of the season fan favourites Russell Robertson, Matthew Whelan and Paul Wheatley announced that they would no longer be playing for Melbourne in 2010 and beyond. During September 2009, midfielder Brock McLean asked to be a traded and a deal involving Carlton's pick 11 in the National Draft was agreed to.|$|E

He felt that Darren is torn about his addiction because although he is aware of his problem he believes [...] "his next big win is just around the corner". When talking to What's on TV about Darren's addiction, Dawson said it began slowly but spiralled out of control, thinking that gambling is easy after a few big wins. Eventually, Darren was willing to bet on everything, even [...] "who's going to have toast for breakfast".

This results in women being in disproportionately <b>more</b> <b>debt</b> than men.

2500|$|Option ARMs {{are often}} offered {{with a very}} low teaser rate (often as low as 1%) which {{translates}} into very low minimum payments {{for the first year}} of the ARM. During boom times, lenders often underwrite borrowers based on mortgage payments that are below the fully amortizing payment level. This enables borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan (i.e., take on <b>more</b> <b>debt)</b> than would otherwise be possible. When evaluating an Option ARM, prudent borrowers will not focus on the teaser rate or initial payment level, but will consider the characteristics of the index, the size of the [...] "mortgage margin" [...] that is added to the index value, and the other terms of the ARM. Specifically, they need to consider the possibilities that (1) long-term interest rates go up; (2) their home may not appreciate or may even lose value or even (3) that both risks may materialize.|$|E

The son inherited his mother's temper but he would not speak while he experienced various fits. On one occasion, the young Byron bit off a piece of a china saucer during his [...] "silent rage". Byron's problems were compounded by his mother's lack of money, especially with her having to provide for her delinquent husband.

2500|$|This {{principle}} {{is open to}} a series of qualifications. Most significantly, statute may require directly or indirectly that the company not be treated as a separate entity. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, section 214 stipulates that company directors must contribute to payment of company debts in winding up if they kept the business running up <b>more</b> <b>debt</b> when they ought to have known there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency. A number of other cases demonstrate that in construing the meaning of a statute unrelated to company law, the purpose of the legislation should be fulfilled regardless of the existence of a corporate form. For example, in Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre and Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd, the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 said that trading with any person of [...] "enemy character" [...] would be an offence. So even though the Continental Tyre Co Ltd was a [...] "legal person" [...] incorporated in the UK (and therefore British) its directors and shareholders were German (and therefore enemies, while the First World War was being fought).|$|E

Our data provides a breakdown of debt into bank debt comprised of revolving credit and term loans, public debt composed of commercial paper, senior bonds and subordinated bonds and the remaining components consisting of capital leases and other debt. We demonstrate that debt composition varies according to access to public debt markets, credit market conditions and firm level characteristics. We first show that rated firms tend to have <b>more</b> public <b>debt</b> and less bank debt than non-rated firms. Furthermore, during periods of credit tightening, the role of credit ratings becomes more significant in terms of driving debt structure. We then show that rated firms have on average a <b>more</b> diversified <b>debt</b> structure than non-rated firms.
