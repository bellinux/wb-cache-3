It was officially formed in 1974 when with the approval of Dubai ruler, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum, Egyptian teachers who were members of the Muslim Brotherhood came to work in the UAE and began to recruit young Emiratis. Dr. Ali Salem Humaid, chairman of Dubai based think-tank, the Al Mezmaah Centre for Studies and Research, has stated that the recruited young students, “operated secretly through front organizations like <b>mafia-style</b> <b>gangs,</b> money-laundering and espionage rings.” [...] The group continued to build influence in the 1970s and 1980s, serving in high posts in the education and justice sectors. The work and activities of Al Islah have been directly linked to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.|$|R
