5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow can be caused by the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> mice between inland and coastal populations, or the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E

It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.|$|E

Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E
