Besides these users do not pay <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> VOIP <b>calls</b> {{as compared to the}} circuit switched phone calls. So they do not bother much about the quality of services. However, it is expected that the quality should be sound enough to pay for their time as well as money.

50|$|The Syracuse Menaechmus returns, {{the mantle}} still over his arm, {{in search of}} Messenio, who has left the inn. His brother's wife sees him, and {{assuming}} him to be her husband, demands that he confess his shame. He asks her of what he should be ashamed—and, furthermore, why she should address a total stranger so. He adds that he didn't steal her mantle, that a lady gave it to him. This is too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wife, who <b>calls</b> her father from the house. The father, also assuming {{that he is the}} husband, tells him that he must be crazy. This idea seems an excellent means of escape for Menaechmus: he feigns insanity so violently that the father rushes off <b>for</b> a physician, <b>the</b> wife seeks safety in the house, and Menaechmus goes off to resume his hunt for Messenio.|$|R
500|$|Goergen {{found the}} sound design unmemorable, {{saying that the}} music does not add much and that players {{would be likely to}} mute the game after hearing the [...] "beeping" [...] sound effect used for {{dialogue}} for too long. Meanwhile, Ponce and Petit liked it: Ponce <b>called</b> <b>the</b> score [...] "masterful" [...] and said that it [...] "gets under your skin at the right moments", while Petit said that she appreciated the sound, which she called atmospheric and [...] " [...] shivers up your spine". She was unimpressed with the environments, but said that they were clear and easy to look at. She liked <b>the</b> character portraits, <b>calling</b> them expressive and, paired with the dialogue, enough to make the player not care about the lack of voice acting. Ponce, too, felt that the game did not need voice acting. He felt that the way the game favored textual narration over animated cutscenes made it more immersive, allowing the player to imagine the scenes. Goergen said that the graphics were well done, but that they did not do <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. Kaplan <b>called</b> <b>the</b> presentation [...] "awesome", saying that it looked great and that the artwork stood on its own despite the simplicity of the animations, and that the soundtrack was [...] "fantastic".|$|R

5000|$|So <b>Much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Afterglow is {{the third}} studio album by Everclear, {{released}} on October 7, 1997. It contained the singles [...] "Everything to Everyone", [...] "I Will Buy You a New Life", [...] "Father of Mine", [...] "So <b>Much</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Afterglow", and [...] "One Hit Wonder". This album strays noticeably from the band's past work, which is much less clean and polished. While those past attempts were clear examples of post-grunge, many listeners have been more inclined to categorize So <b>Much</b> <b>For</b> <b>The</b> Afterglow as power pop. A number of the songs from this album, especially [...] "Everything to Everyone", [...] "I Will Buy You A New Life" [...] and [...] "Father of Mine," [...] received heavy rotation on MTV's Total Request Live and launched Everclear into mainstream popularity briefly in <b>the</b> late-90's. So <b>Much</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Afterglow provided Everclear with their only Grammy nomination to date, a Best Rock Instrumental nod in 1998 for [...] "El Distorto de Melodica." ...|$|R
