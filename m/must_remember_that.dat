5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

However, we <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence {{for the use of}} marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{identification}} to genus {{can often}} be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort; one <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> a mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for {{the identification of the}} species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: {{but there are times}} when the laws of nature assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

500|$|Songbirds {{and their}} {{associated}} symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee's mother's maiden name. The titular mockingbird {{is a key}} motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack {{to teach them to}} shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can [...] "shoot all the bluejays they want", they <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, [...] "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." [...] Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, [...] "'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson." [...] Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.|$|E
500|$|Wisden commented: [...] "The {{inclusion}} {{once again}} of Leyland was a move which yielded splendid results." [...] Coming in to bat at number three, Leyland shared a partnership of 382 with Len Hutton, {{at the time}} a record English Test partnership for any wicket; as of 2013, it remains England's highest partnership for the second wicket, and the highest for any wicket against Australia. As there was no time limit on the match, Leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six-and-a-half hours before he was run out. Hutton went on to score 364, at the time the highest score in Tests. England had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate the bowlers, and Cardus expressed his frustration to Leyland during an interval in play. Cardus wrote: [...] "'And even you, Maurice,' I complained, in sorrow not anger, 'even you won't hit the ball and give us some cricket.' 'Hey, wait a minute, Mr Cardus,' expostulated Leyland, as though pained at my protest, 'wait a minute—tha <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Ah'm playing for me place in team. England {{went on to win the}} match and level the series. Leyland's innings was his highest in Tests, but this was his final match for England. In 41 Tests, he scored 2,764 runs at 46.06 and took six wickets.|$|E

2500|$|Elementary and {{frequent}} examples in kinematics involve projectiles, for example a ball thrown upwards into the air. Given initial speed , one can calculate {{how high the}} ball will travel before it begins to fall. The acceleration is local acceleration of gravity [...] At this point one <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> while these quantities appear to be scalars, the direction of displacement, speed and acceleration is important. They could in fact be considered as unidirectional vectors. Choosing [...] to measure up from the ground, the acceleration [...] must be in fact , since {{the force of gravity}} acts downwards and therefore also the acceleration on the ball due to it.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{examples}} of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the [...] "truth" [...] that society is free; scandals (e.g., Watergate) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> though such examples seem extreme, such extremity {{is an important}} part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.|$|E
