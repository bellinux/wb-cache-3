2500|$|Upon {{completion}} of the sale, the investor typically has a limited time (for example, 3 days in the US) to borrow the shares. [...] If required by law, the investor first ensures that cash or equity is on deposit with his brokerage firm as collateral for the initial short <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b> [...] Some short sellers, mainly firms and hedge funds, participate {{in the practice of}} naked short selling, where the shorted shares are not borrowed or delivered.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on asset prices, trading volume and investors' welfare in a general {{equilibrium}} asset pricing model where investors differ in their degree of risk aversion. In the stationary equilibrium of the model binding <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> decrease the riskless rate and increase its volatility, as well as stock trading volume. Contrary to previous partial equilibrium results, stock prices are not affected by <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> Small changes in <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> produce large effects on the long-run distribution of wealth among investors. From a welfare perspective <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> might benefit the constrained less risk averse investors, while they always make more risk averse investors worse-off. ...|$|R

50|$|Portfolio margin is a risk-based margin policy {{available}} to qualifying US investors. The goal of portfolio margin is to align <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> {{with the overall}} risk of the portfolio. Portfolio margin usually results in significantly lower <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on hedged positions than under traditional rules. While <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> of Regulation T generally limit leverage on equity to 2:1, with portfolio margin, leverage of 6:1 or more is possible.|$|R
2500|$|During the New Deal {{years as}} well as the 1940s, there was much less focus on Wall Street and finance. The {{government}} clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit, but these policies began to ease. From 1946 to 1947, stocks could not be purchased [...] "on margin", meaning that an investor had to pay 100% of a stock's cost without taking on any loans. But this <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> was reduced four times before 1960, each time stimulating a mini-rally and boosting volume, and when the Federal Reserve reduced the margin requirements from 90% to 70%. These changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit. The growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the 1960s, with some down years during the early 1970s {{in the aftermath of the}} Vietnam War. Trading volumes climbed; in 1967, according to Time Magazine, volume hit 7.5 million shares a day which caused a [...] "traffic jam" [...] of paper with [...] "batteries of clerks" [...] working overtime to [...] "clear transactions and update customer accounts".|$|E

5000|$|Regulation T {{governs the}} {{extension}} of credit by securities brokers and dealers in the United States.Its best-known function is the control of margin requirements for stocks bought on margin. The initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> for such margin stock purchases is 50%, and has been since 1974, but Regulation T gives the Federal Reserve the authority to change that percentage. Raising the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> ostensibly reduces risk in the financial system by reducing the potential leverage and total buying power of investors. Conversely, lowering the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> ostensibly increases systemic risk by expanding the buying power and leverage available to investors. [...] Since 1974 the Federal Reserve has not deemed it necessary to adjust the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement,</b> despite periodic extremes of price volatility in the equities markets.|$|E
40|$|In {{financial}} markets, short sellers will {{be required}} to post margin to cover possible losses in case the prices of the risky assets go up. Only a few studies focus on the optimization and performance evaluation of portfolios in the presence of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> In this paper, we investigate the theoretical foundation of DEA (data envelopment analysis) approach to evaluate the performance of portfolios with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> from a different perspective. Under the mean-variance framework, we construct the optimization model and portfolio possibility set on considering <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> The convexity of the portfolio possibility set is proved and the concept of efficiency in classical economics is extended to the portfolio case. The DEA models are then developed to evaluate the performance of portfolios with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements.</b> Through the simulations carried out in the end, we show that, with adequate portfolios, DEA can be used as an effective tool in computing the efficiencies of portfolios with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for the performance evaluation purpose.

40|$|Traders in futures {{markets are}} {{required}} to deposit initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for their open futures positions and maintain minimum <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for these open positions. Futures exchanges set these <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> and require higher <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> for more volatile contracts. It {{has been argued that}} futures exchanges may use changing <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> to control the volatility of futures contracts and this question is still of interest. To address this question, I investigate the relationship between margin changes and futures price volatility for 24 different futures contracts, which include contracts on agricultural commodities, livestock, equity indices, interest rate and foreign currency. I provide evidence using univariate tests that the futures price volatility is significantly reduced following margin increases, while the futures price volatility increases but to a lesser extent following margin decreases. A regression analysis shows that larger margin changes have a greater negative effect on the futures price volatility. This relationship holds for the different futures contracts. Finally, it may be argued that <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> and futures price volatility are endogeneous variables. To address the potential presence of endogeneity, I employ the instrumental variables technique along with two stages least squares estimation and find that the inverse relationship between margin changes and volatility still holds...|$|R

40|$|Official <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> in the U. S. {{stock market}} were {{established}} in October 1934 to {{limit the amount of}} credit available for the purpose of buying stocks. Since then, higher or rising <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> are associated with lower stock price volatility, lower excess volatility, and smaller deviations of stock prices from their fundamental values. The results hold throughout the post- 1934 period and are not very sensitive to the exclusion of the turbulent depression years from the sample.

50|$|The rule {{provides}} {{day trading}} buying power {{to up to}} 4 times a pattern day trader's maintenance margin excess. The excess maintenance margin is the difference of the account equity and the <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b> For example, if a trader has $100,000 worth of equities with no margin loan, the leverage ratio is 4:1, meaning that it can buy securities of up to $400,000. If the account has a margin loan, the day trading buying power is equal to four times the difference of the account equity and the current <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Example 3: An {{investor}} is long 50 {{shares in}} Universal Widgets Ltd, trading at 120 pence (£1.20) each.

The results are then used to assess the costs of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on alternative strategies. The primary conclusion is that the playing field is more level than a cursory focus on initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> might indicate. The costs associated with <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on equities or stock indexes are essentially fixed costs. On the other hand, costs of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on derivatives, particularly on futures contracts, have a low fixed cost component but are more sensitive to the price of the underlying security.

40|$|Both in {{practice}} and in the academic literature, models for setting <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> in futures markets use daily closing price changes. However, financial markets have recently shown high intraday volatility, which could bring more risk than expected. Such a phenomenon is well documented {{in the literature on}} high-frequency data and has prompted some exchanges to set intraday <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> and ask intraday margin calls. This article proposes to set <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> by taking into account the intraday dynamics of market prices. Daily margin levels are obtained in two ways: first, by using daily price changes defined with different time-intervals (say from 3 pm to 3 pm on the following trading day instead of traditional closing times); second, by using 5 -minute and 1 -hour price changes and scaling the results to one day. An application to the FTSE 100 futures contract traded on LIFFE demonstrates the usefulness of this new approach.

50|$|The initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirement</b> is {{the amount}} of {{collateral}} required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the maintenance <b>margin</b> <b>requirement,</b> the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirement.</b> On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes two {{value-based}} {{standards for}} setting the initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> on futures positions.

Based on this observation, we argue that initial <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> are adequate if the initial margin that must be posted is either (1) equal to the ex ante value of the payoffs to the futures position or (2) sufficient to reduce the value of the potential losses absorbed by the futures clearinghouse to zero. Using a numerical valuation approach that incorporates the stochastic volatility of the futures market, we examine the adequacy of <b>margin</b> <b>requirements</b> in the crude oil futures market.
