5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer <b>memory</b> <b>devices</b> and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E

Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble <b>memory</b> <b>devices.</b> Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic <b>memory</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic <b>memory</b> <b>devices</b> have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as <b>memory</b> <b>devices,</b> instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E

25|$|Flash <b>memory</b> <b>devices</b> are {{typically}} much faster at reading than writing. Performance {{also depends on}} the quality of storage controllers which become more critical when devices are partially full.

25|$|When a 2-terminal, {{non-volatile}} memory device {{is found to}} be in a distinct resistance state {j}, there exists therefore no physical one-to-one relationship between its present state and its foregoing voltage history.

25|$|Some file {{systems are}} {{designed}} to distribute usage over an entire memory device without concentrating usage on any part (e.g., for a directory) to prolong the life of simple flash <b>memory</b> <b>devices.</b> Some USB flash drives have this 'wear leveling' feature built into the software controller to prolong device life, while others do not, {{so it is not}} necessarily helpful to install one of these file systems.|$|E

25|$|Using ReadyBoost-capable {{flash memory}} (NAND <b>memory</b> <b>devices)</b> for caching allows Windows Vista {{and later to}} service random disk reads with better {{performance}} than without the cache. This caching applies to all disk content, not just the page file or system DLLs. Flash devices typically are slower than a mechanical hard disk for sequential I/O, so, to maximize performance, ReadyBoost includes logic that recognizes large, sequential read requests and has the hard disk service these requests.|$|E

Some computers can boot up from flash drives.|$|E

In this way, it is possible to combine a plurality of FIFO memories in a single addressable <b>memory</b> <b>device.</b> This implementation is favourable in view of power consumption and area.

25|$|Some {{organizations}} forbid {{the use of}} flash drives, {{and some}} computers are configured to disable the mounting of USB mass storage devices by users other than administrators; others use third-party software to control USB usage.
