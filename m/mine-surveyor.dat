40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the engineering-geological, geological-prospecting {{information}}, the <b>mine-surveyor</b> {{information about the}} geotechnical conditions of exploitation. The paper purpose is to rise the efficiency {{and the safety of}} open-casting. The theoretical and methodical foundations of new scientifically-applied trend of geological-mining sciences as the geometrization of geotechnical conditions of exploitation of deposits of solid minerals have been developed. The new indicators of districting of mining areas according to the geomechanical and mine-engineering conditions of exploitation have been offered. The mark system of extimation of stability of open cast edges has been created. The prediction charts of exploitation conditions have been introduced at the Uralasbest Integrated Works. The application fields are the open casts of ore deposits, the research institutes of mining, the mining collegesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
