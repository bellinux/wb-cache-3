500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came,</b> too." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E
60|$|My {{father was}} {{fortunately}} still asleep, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> {{down to see}} whether I was frightened.|$|E
60|$|The {{figure of}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>comes</b> always into <b>my</b> {{conception}} of the Change.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not for my sake,’ says {{my sister}} obstinately, and then <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>comes</b> ben {{to me to}} say delightedly, ‘She winna listen to reason!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Vent. Look, emperor, this is {{no common}} dew, [...] [Weeping. I have not wept this forty years; but now <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>comes</b> afresh into <b>my</b> eyes; I cannot help her softness.|$|R
60|$|The {{departure}} of Susan did take place not long afterwards. It occurred one Saturday night. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> upstairs looking pale.|$|E
60|$|In a while <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> in. She sat down, {{pleating}} up {{the hem of}} {{her black}} apron, and smoothing it out again.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard him}} leave the house, {{but he did}} not go down the garden. Then, in a few minutes, every one of which seemed to me like an hour, the low voices at the gate ceased and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> slowly up the path towards the house.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the islanders}} still {{stood on the}} shore and wept, {{stretching}} their hands in vain after the departing boat, and crying aloud in piteous tones, [...] "Oh, my father, return! Oh, <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>come</b> back! Oh, very great gods, do not fly and desert us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! {{after my}} father's death? No! <b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>come</b> back, and she's living at Muggett's cottages. The sea air suits 'er. She likes the old place better than Hammersmith ... and I can afford it. Got an old crony or so here.... Gossip ... have tea.... S'pose you ain't married, Kipps?" ...|$|R
60|$|I drew back, still wrought upon by my surprise; {{and then}} <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> voice <b>came</b> cold and acid.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What have we to do {{with the}} Court?' cried my sister, and this, of course, only added fuel to the flame, till at last <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> to declaring that she should never trust her {{daughter}} with my brother again, for he was not fit to take care of her.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the very}} first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her bell at cock-crow. When <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> down to breakfast {{and was going to}} make the tea, Miss Murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek, which was her nearest {{approach}} to a kiss, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> from France," [...] {{said the}} small {{member of the}} club. [...] "She arrived in this country {{when she was about}} sixteen years of age, coming with an uncle, who was her guardian. My uncle's name was Pierre Dunrot, and he was by {{profession}} a teacher of ancient history." ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. If you'd {{been brought}} up by <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> sir, you'd {{know better than to}} joke about her. What I'm telling you is the truth; and I wouldn't tell it to you if I could see my {{way to get out of}} the fix I'll be in when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>comes</b> here this day to see her boy in his glory, and she after {{thinking}} all the time it was against the English I was fighting.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, come, spirit-mother! {{discourse}} of the hours My young bosom beat all its beating to yours, When heart-woven wishes in soft counsel fell On ears--how unheedful, proved sorrow might tell! That deathless affection nae sorrow could break; When all else forsook me, ye would na forsake; Then <b>come,</b> oh <b>my</b> <b>mother!</b> <b>come</b> often to me, An' soon an' for ever I'll come unto thee! ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{towards the}} close of these same {{holidays}} that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and I called upon Mrs. Teidelmann in her great stone-built house at Clapton. She had sent a note round that morning, saying she was suffering from terrible headaches that quite took her senses away, so that {{she was unable to}} come out. She would be leaving England in a few days to travel. Would <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>come</b> and see her, she would like to say good-bye to her before she went. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> handed the letter across the table to my father.|$|R
60|$|At that moment, {{strange to}} say, {{thoughts}} of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> into my mind, {{but there was}} no time to be lost, and I threw myself, with a good deal of energy, into the first boat that was lowered, and pulled at the oar as if my own life depended on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said he {{had come}} on business, and without waiting {{began to talk about}} the {{treasure}} we had taken from the isle. He insisted upon it that the treasure belonged to him, since his uncle, Sid Merrick, was dead. When <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> in he demanded that she give him some money and sign some papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Cynthia is a protegee of my mother's, the {{daughter}} of an old schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come down, <b>come</b> down, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> dear, <b>Come</b> frae {{the castle}} wa! I fear, if langer ye stand there, Ye'll let yoursell down fa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't wish to hear {{anything}} of your feelings; I have said exactly what I mean. Choose, and quickly, lest <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> should <b>come</b> in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, {{surely it}} were better {{to deliver it}} into my hands, were it but to weep over it," [...] {{answered}} Middlemas. [...] "My fortune, Hartley, has been very cruel. You see that my parents purposed to have made me their undoubted heir; yet their purpose was disappointed by accident. And now <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>comes</b> with well-intended fondness, and while she means to advance my fortune, furnishes evidence to destroy it.--Come, come, Hartley--you must be conscious that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> wrote those details entirely for my information. I am the rightful owner, and insist on having them." ...|$|R
60|$|To me personally, old Hasluck's {{coming and}} all that {{followed}} thereupon made perhaps more difference than to any one else. My father now was busy all the day; if not in his office, then away in the grim city of the giants, as I still thought of it; while to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> every day more social and domestic duties; so that for a time I was left much to my own resources.|$|E
6000|$|That night, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> {{to kiss me}} good-night, I {{turned my}} face {{to the wall and}} pretended to be asleep, for {{children}} as well as grown-ups have their foolish moods; but when I felt the soft curls brush my cheek, my pride gave way, and clasping my arms about her neck, and drawing her face still closer down to mine; I voiced the question that all the evening had been knocking at my heart: ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! If {{that was}} it, I was {{quite ready to}} go. I waited, in the utmost impatience, until <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> home from Mrs. Grayper's (for it was that {{identical}} neighbour), to ascertain {{if we could get}} leave to carry out this great idea. Without being nearly so much surprised as I had expected, my mother entered into it readily; and it was all arranged that night, and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid for.|$|E
6000|$|... "How small {{the world}} is!" [...] Sophie cried. [...] "Why, all <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> people <b>come</b> from Veering Hollow. There {{must be some}} there still--the Lashmars. Did you ever hear of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I can get <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to <b>come,</b> too, I {{will be glad}} to do so, for I {{hate the}} Fork; but I will not leave her there, sick and alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was at Winona last Saturday, and {{expected}} to stay there till June, when I was due to graduate. Then the devil broke loose, and here I am. When will <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> case <b>come</b> up?" ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{years ago}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> {{to me with}} an old note book which had been {{discovered}} in some rubbish that {{had been placed in}} the yard to burn. The book had probably been hidden in an old picture frame for many years. It belonged to my great-grandfather, Col. Ebenezer Zane. From its faded and time-worn pages I have taken the main facts of my story. My regret is that a worthier pen than mine has not had this wealth of material.|$|E
6000|$|But {{with that}} the words of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> back to me out of a far-away morning: [...] "He made us of His Power and Love." [...] Yet I could not answer him, could only wait, as if {{expectant}} that by mere silence I {{should be able to}} share the thoughts he was thinking. And, all the while, my eyes were brooding in some dark chamber of my mind on Fanny, and not, as they well might have, on the dark bark of Mr Crimble tossing in jeopardy beneath its fleeting ray of hope.|$|E
60|$|But when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>came</b> to {{hear how}} he and Annora had {{witnessed}} the scene from the windows of M. Darpent's house, her indignation knew no bounds. I never saw her so angry with Eustace as she now was, {{that he should have}} taken his sister into the house of one of these councillors; a bourgeois house was bad enough, but that it should have been actually one of the disaffected, and that the Darpent carriage should have been seen at our door, filled her with horror. It was enough to ruin us all for ever with the Court.|$|E
6000|$|To my delight, {{almost to}} <b>my</b> surprise, <b>mother</b> <b>came,</b> alone. [...] "Father will follow {{in a few}} days," [...] she said--"if he can find someone to look after his stock and tools while he is gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "because, you see--hé, {{there is}} nothing to do--no money--work--work--work--no life--you see nothing. When I was a small boy my father, he died, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>comes</b> with me to Naples. Then I go with the little boats on the sea--fishing, {{carrying}} people--" [...] He flourished his hand as if to make her understand all the things that must be wordless. He smiled at her--but there was a faint, poignant sadness and remoteness in him, a beauty of old fatality, and ultimate indifference to fate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eight years,' said Lord Rotherwood. 'He died {{six weeks}} after my father. Well! I have made <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> promise to <b>come</b> home.' ...|$|R
