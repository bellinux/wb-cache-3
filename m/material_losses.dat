40|$|Background: <b>Material</b> <b>loss</b> at {{the taper}} {{junction}} of metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM THRs) has {{been implicated in}} their early failure. The mechanisms of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> are not fully understood; analysis of the patterns of damage at the taper can help us better understand why <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> occurs at this junction. Methods: We mapped the patterns of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> {{in a series of}} 155 MOM-THRs received at our centre by scanning the taper surface using a roundness-measuring machine. We examined these <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> maps to develop a five-tier classification system based on visual differences between different patterns. We correlated these patterns to surgical, implant and patient factors known to be important for head-stem taper damage. Results: We found that 63 implants had ‘minimal damage’ at the taper (<b>material</b> <b>loss</b> < 1 mm 3) and the remaining 92 implants could be categorised by four distinct patterns of taper <b>material</b> <b>loss.</b> We found that (1) head diameter and (2) time to revision were key significant variables separating the groups. Conclusion: These <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> maps allow us to suggest different mechanisms that dominate the cause of the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> in each pattern: (a) corrosion, (b) mechanically assisted corrosion or (c) intra-operative damage or poor size tolerances leading to toggling of trunnion in taper...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Taper {{junction}} <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> is {{the result}} of corrosion and mechanical wear. The significance of the taper junction <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> is highlighted by studies that compared resurfacing and total hip replacements of the same type and size. High volumes of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> are reported, especially from the head taper, but the pattern of wear is unknown. One report characterized the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> pattern of five tapers (n= 5) into axisymmetrical and asymmetrical, along the long axis of the taper. We noticed more than two patterns on our retrievals and we set out to characterize these types and relate them to clinical variables. Methods: We retrospectively analysed retrieved cobalt-chromium tapers (n= 146) using a roundness measurement machine. We also performed a corrosion classification and collected clinical data (metal ion levels, time to revision, component sizes). A non-blinded author devised a four-group classification (table). Two blinded authors classified the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> patterns derived from the roundness measurement machine. Results: The four groups of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> patterns Low wear (n= 62), Open-end band (n= 29), Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> (n= 51) and Coup-Countercoup (n= 4). Kappa was 0. 78 (p< 0. 001) in the assessment of interobserver reliability. Kruskal-Wallis test revealed: - Significantly higher volumes of wear on the taper of Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> compared to Low wear (p< 0. 001) and Open-end band compared to Low wear (p< 0. 001) groups. - Significantly higher chromium ion blood levels in the open-end band compared to the Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> group. - Significantly higher Cobalt ion blood levels in the Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> compared to the Low wear group - Significantly higher Cobalt/Chromium ration in the Open-end band compared to the Low wear group One-way ANOVA analysis revealed: - Significant difference between in the head sizes between the groups (p= 0. 01). Post-hoc analysis located the difference between the Low wear (median= 40, range= 20) and Open-end band (median= 49, range= 20) groups (p< 0. 001). - Significantly higher time to revision in the Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> compared to the Low wear group (p= 0. 05), in the post-hoc analysis. - Significantly higher corrosion scores in the Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> compared to the Low wear group (p< 0. 001) and the Open-end band compared to the Low wear group (p< 0. 001). Discussion: The results suggests that corrosion becomes worse over time and that the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> pattern evolves gradually from the Low wear to Open-end band and finally to Stripped. Further analysis is required to assess the factors that affect the Coup-countercoup group...|$|R

40|$|Measuring {{the amount}} of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> {{in the case of}} revised hip {{replacements}} {{is considered to be a}} prerequisite of understanding and assessing the true in vivo performance of the implant.

Along with assessing the volumetric wear, maximum linear penetration and taper contact length can also be determined. The method was applied to retrieved large head metal-on-metal femoral heads in order to quantify the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> at this junction. <b>Material</b> <b>loss</b> from the female femoral head taper can be characterized as a localized area that is in contact with the stem taper surface.

40|$|<b>Material</b> <b>loss</b> at the Head-Neck {{junction}} {{accounts for}} {{a third of the}} total volume <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> in contemporary metal-on-metal total hip replacements. It is speculated that the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> is the result of corrosion and mechanical wear (fretting). High volumes of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> have been reported, especially from the head taper. There is only one report on characterizing the pattern of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> and this was in {{a very small number of}} cases (n= 5). Our aim was to identify the different <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> patterns at the head taper and their corresponding mechanisms We retrospectively analysed a series of retrieved Large Head Metal on Metal Total Hip Replacements (155 cups, 155 femoral heads and 4 stems). We measured <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> on the bearing surfaces and the head-neck junction using well-published metrology methods. Furthermore we collected patient (age, gender and time of primary/revision operations), pre-revision (cobalt and chromium blood metal ion, oxford hip score, cup orientation and implant position) implant (cup and head size, manufacturer and corrosion severity) data. Finally we used surface analysis techniques (microscopy and spectroscopy) to identify fretting, imprinting and the material composition of debris. We devised a novel four-group classification and two blinded engineers classified the <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> patterns using wear maps derived from the metrology analysis We observed four distinct patterns of taper surface <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> at our retrieval centre and we set out to characterize these types and relate them to patient, implant and clinical variables. The four groups of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> patterns were defined as: (1) Low wear (n= 63), (2) Open-end band (n= 32), (3) Stripped <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> (n= 54) and (4) Coup-Countercoup (n= 6) (Figure). The Interobserver Reliability Kappa score was 0. 78 (p< 0. 001) indicating substantial agreement between the two examiners. Analysis of variables between the groups identified significantly different head sizes (highest: Group 2, p= 0. 000), corrosion severity (highest: Group 2, p= 0. 004) and time to revision (highest: Group 3, p= 0. 040). We identified four different <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> patterns each with its own mechanism. Corrosion was identified as the principal mechanism in Groups 1 and 3. Group 1 head-neck junctions are thought to have a better seal with less fluid ingress in the junction. Group 3 head-neck junctions are attacked by corrosion either circumferentially, or unilaterally, along the whole engagement length. Mechanically assisted corrosion was the principal mechanism in Group 2. The higher friction torque opens up the open-end part of the junction and the ingressing fluid accelerates the corrosion. Extensive fretting was also observed under the scanning electron microscope. Intra-operative surgical damage was identified as the principal mechanism in Group 4, with only 6 components. The patterns and the mechanisms of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> at the head-neck junction contribute to the understanding of large head metal-on-metal hip replacements. As a result, better implants can be designed in the future. Clinically, these findings suggest that head size and head taper-trunnion fit are the main factors that determine the longevity of the head-neck junction. On the other hand, patients selection does not influence the integrity of the junction...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of the head-stem taper {{junction}} {{requires the}} estimation of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> from the taper surfaces of both femoral head and stem. This paper describes a method for the measurement and analysis of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> from the modular taper junction of hip replacements, in particular femoral stem tapers where generally the entire taper surface has been engaged. In such cases no direct unworn datum is readily identifiable to assess <b>material</b> <b>loss.</b> The highly anisotropic topology of some stem designs poses additional challenges to the measurement and analysis process. Estimation of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> of retrieved femoral stems is further complicated by retrieval damage or surface deposits often present on the taper surface. The femoral head tapers typically exhibit areas of pristine surface attributed to the difference in taper length compared to the engaging stem. These areas can be selected as unworn when employed in the analysis process, provided they do not show surface damage or deposits. Measurement of the taper surfaces has been performed using a Talyrond (Ametek, Inc., US) out-of-roundness measurement instrument equipped with a 5 µm diamond tip stylus. Vertical axial traces were employed to digitize {{the surface of the}} taper. Measurement data has been analyzed using a multi stage process that has been specifically adapted for stem tapers.

40|$|Summary. Multiple linear {{regression}} analysis of fifteen factors showed that bearing surface design {{was the most}} significant predictor of high taper <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> in retrieved metal-on-metal hip replacements. Introduction. Joint registries have reported high revision rates for large diameter metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM-THR). It has been speculated that additional cobalt-chrome debris may be released from head-stem taper junction, and {{that this may be}} implicated in clinical failure. However, the mechanisms and clinical significance of taper <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> remain largely unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the volume of taper <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> in a large series of MOM-THR retrievals, and then by using multiple {{linear regression}} analysis identify any significant predictors of high taper <b>material</b> <b>loss.</b> Methods. This was a retrospective study of 125 consecutively collected large diameter (> 38 mm) MOM retrieval cases, and included six contemporary bearing designs and eight femoral stem designs. We recorded patient demographic data and all commonly reported clinical and design variables, including fifteen variables identified through review of the literature that had been indicated as factors likely to affect the mechanical or electrochemical properties of the head-stem taper junction (Table 1). Post-operatively we measured the volume of material lost from all 280 components. <b>Material</b> <b>loss</b> of the bearing surfaces was measured using a coordinate measuring machine and of the taper surfaces using a roundness measuring machine. We then performed univariable and multiple linear regression analyses to determine the variables significantly associated with high volumes of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> at the taper junction. Results. The median volume of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> from the taper junction was 2. 16 mm 3 (range: 0. 13 - 25. 19), significantly (p < 0. 001) less than the median volume of material lost from the bearing surface, which was 5. 79 mm 3 (range: 0. 59 - 309. 17). Full results of all univariable regression analyses are given in Table 1. Univariable analysis identified two significant predictors of high taper material loss: (1) bearing surface design (p = 0. 015) and (2) edge loading of the bearing surfaces (p = 0. 017). The same two variables were confirmed as the only two significant predictors in the final multiple linear regression model (Table 2), and both were independent predictors, with tests for interaction proving non-significant (p = 0. 510). Discussion/Conclusion. It has been speculated that <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> at the head-stem taper junction is implicated in the high revision rates reported for MOM-THR. However, there is little published data to support this and both the clinical significance and mechanism of <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> remains poorly understood. Using multivariable statistical analysis to analyze a large series of retrieval data, we have shown that bearing surface design and edge loading of the bearing surfaces are significant predictors for high taper <b>material</b> <b>loss.</b> This study contributes significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms of MOM hip failure, and suggests important factors that predispose patients to increased metal ion exposure...|$|R

40|$|Summary The taper {{junction}} is {{an important}} source of implant-derived metal debris but in the majority of cases contributes significantly less to the overall volumetric <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> than the bearing surfaces. Introduction There have been several reports of higher failure rates for stemmed large head metal-on-metal (LH-MOM) hip arthroplasties when compared to the same bearing used as a resurfacing. This has been attributed to <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> from the head-stem taper junction. The contribution of the taper junction to the total <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> remains poorly understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the volumetric wear of both bearing surfaces and the taper junction, and investigate any relationships with blood metal ion levels and commonly reported clinical variables. Methods This was a study of 48 consecutively collected stemmed LH-MOM retrieval cases. The series included several contemporary designs of MOM hip. We recorded all relevant clinical data, including pre-revision whole blood cobalt and chromium ion levels and component position. Volumetric wear of the bearing surfaces was measured using a coordinate measuring machine, and of the taper surface (Figure 1) using a roundness measuring machine.

After major {{conflicts}} such as the Battle of the Frontiers, the First Battle of the Marne, the Battle of Verdun, and the Second Battle of the Aisne—the latter resulting in tremendous loss of life and mutiny within the army—the French proved to be enough of a cohesive fighting force to counterattack and defeat the Germans at the Second Battle of the Marne, the first in what would become a string of Allied victories that ended the war. The Treaty of Versailles eventually returned Alsace-Lorraine to France. The French military, civilian and <b>material</b> <b>losses</b> during the First World War were huge. With more than 1.3 million military fatalities and more than 4.6 million wounded, France suffered the second highest Allied losses, after Russia. As a result, France was adamant on the payment of reparations by Germany. The organised failure of the Weimar Republic to pay reparations led to the Occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian forces.|$|E
25|$|The Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, felt {{threatened}} by the CSR. It induced the Chinese warlords to have the National Revolutionary Army besiege the CSR, launching what Chiang and his fellow nationalists called encirclement campaigns. The communists responded with what they called counter-encirclement campaigns. Chiang Kai-shek's first, second and third encirclement campaigns were defeated by the Chinese Red Army, led by Mao. However, after the third counter-encirclement campaign Mao was replaced by Wang Ming, a Chinese communist returning from the Soviet Union. The Chinese Red Army was commanded by a three-man committee, which included Wang Ming's associates Otto Braun (the Comintern military advisor), Bo Gu and Zhou Enlai. The CSR then began a rapid decline, due to its extreme left-wing governance and incompetent military command. The new leadership could not rid itself of Mao's influence (which continued during the fourth encirclement campaign), which temporarily protected the communists. However, due to {{the dominance of the}} new communist leadership after the fourth counter-encirclement campaign, the Red Army was nearly halved. Most of its equipment was lost during Chiang's fifth encirclement campaign; this began in 1933 and was orchestrated by Chiang's German advisers, who advocated encircling the CSR with fortified blockhouses. This was effective; in an effort to break the blockade the Red Army besieged the forts many times, suffering heavy casualties and only limited success. As a result, the CSR shrank significantly due to the Chinese Red Army's manpower and <b>material</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Obtaining optimal {{marginal}} adaption with prefabricated {{stainless steel}} crowns (SSCs) is difficult, especially after removing dental caries or defects in cervical areas. This situation requires {{the use of}} an SSC after tooth reconstruction. This study evaluated microleakage and <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> with five restorative materials at SSC margins. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty primary molar teeth were randomly divided into six groups (n = 20). Class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of the teeth in groups 1 - 5. Cavities were restored with amalgam, resin-based composite, glass ionomer (GI), zinc phosphate, or reinforced zinc oxide eugenol (Zonalin). Group 6 without cavity preparation was used as a control. Restorations with SSCs were prepared according to standard methods. Then, SSCs were fitted so that the crown margins overlaid the restorative materials and cemented with GI. After thermocycling, the specimens were placed in 0. 5 % fuchsin and sectioned. The proportions of mircoleakage and <b>material</b> <b>loss</b> were evaluated with a digital microscope. Statistical analysis was performed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: The groups differed significantly (P < 0. 001). Amalgam and GI showed the least microleakage. Amalgam restorations had significantly less microleakage than the other materials (P < 0. 05). Microleakage was greatest with resin-based composite, followed by Zonalin. <b>Material</b> <b>loss</b> was greater in samples restored with Zonalin and zinc phosphate. Conclusion: When SSC margins overlaid the restoration materials, cavity restoration with amalgam or GI before SSC placement led to less microleakage and <b>material</b> <b>loss.</b> Regarding microleakage and <b>material</b> <b>loss,</b> resin-based composite, zinc phosphate, and Zonalin were not suitable options...|$|R
