50|$|The red owl (Tyto soumagnei) is an owl in {{the barn}} owl family Tytonidae. It {{is also known as}} the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>red</b> <b>owl,</b> Madagascar grass-owl and Soumange's owl. It is a rare {{resident}} of Madagascar that was virtually unknown from its discovery in 1876 to its rediscovery by researchers from the World Wide Fund for Nature in 1993. It is currently listed as vulnerable because of habitat loss, but recent studies have determined it may have a wider range than believed, though further research in distribution and ecology is required. It has possibly been overlooked because of its close resemblance to the closely related barn owl.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> {{will produce}} a call when leaving the roost site, {{immediately}} after leaving the roost site, {{and in response to}} other <b>red</b> <b>owls</b> throughout the night.|$|R
50|$|The {{call of the}} <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> {{is similar}} to that of the barn owl. They make a 1.5 - 2.0 second long {{screeching}} hiss that is an even frequency with a slight downward frequency towards the end. This slight decrease in frequency at the end of the call distinguishes the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> from the barn owl.|$|R
50|$|The diet of the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> {{has been}} {{determined}} from pellets and observation. They feed mostly on small mammals of families Tenrecidae and Muridae that are native to the island. Prey species include insects, frogs, geckoes, tenrecs, afrosoricidians (Microgale spp., Oryzorictes hova), rodents (Eliurus spp., Rattus rattus), and the eastern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus). All species are native to Madagascar except the roof rat (Rattus rattus). In one sampling of pellets, Tsingy tufted-tailed rats were 50% of the total prey mass of <b>red</b> <b>owls</b> in Ankarana. There is little to no evidence that <b>red</b> <b>owls</b> consume frogs in the wild, as they appear to prefer small mammals, but they will frequently eat frogs in captivity. Most of the prey species inhabit forests or {{can be found on}} the forest edge and in disturbed habitats.|$|R

50|$|The {{observed}} {{range of}} the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> has been evolving frequently {{with an increase in}} surveys and observation since its rediscovery in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|The {{greatest}} threat to the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> has been the increasing rate of deforestation and fragmentation of its forest habitat. Madagascarâ€™s forests {{are among the most}} biologically rich and unique in the world and close to 90% of the islands species live within or on the edge of these forests and woodlands. In the 1950s, 160,000 km2 of forest cover (as determined from analysis of aerial photographs) was present, 26% of which was dry forest, the prime habitat for <b>red</b> <b>owls.</b> By the 2000s, analysis of aerial photos showed a decrease in forest cover to 89,800 - 101,100 km2 [...] with 90% accuracy. This represents a 41% reduction in dry forest area, with most clearing at the small scale along forest edges. Dry forests were the most fragmented forest type and increased the most in fragmentation from the 1950s - 1990s. This forest degradation presents a threat to <b>red</b> <b>owls</b> as well as the prey species, such as the Tsingy tufted tail rats, on which the owl depends.|$|R
50|$|There {{is almost}} no overlap in {{preferred}} diet between the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> and the barn owl, despite physical similarities. Red owls eat mostly native species while barn owls eat {{a greater number}} of introduced species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> inhabits dry {{deciduous}} {{forests to}} humid evergreen forests. They prefer to roost on rock ledges in ravines and cave entrances that are near degraded {{primary and secondary}} vegetation. Roost sites are typically at least 3.7 m from the ground. The species appear to prefer areas along the forest edge and slightly to heavily disturbed habitat, including rice paddies and tavies (areas where the forest has been cleared and burned {{to make way for}} cultivation). Their home ranges, roost sites, and hunting range typically encompass this type of habitat. An individual <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> has never been recorded to be in a closed canopy forest or a mature forest stand.|$|R
50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is the {{destruction}} of its forest habitat. The forest was cleared for subsistence farming and livestock. The bird also competes with its introduced relative, the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>red</b> fody (Foudia madagascariensis). Cyclones and drought reduce the food supply.|$|R
50|$|Masoala harbors {{many other}} novelties, {{such as the}} Madagascar day gecko, leaf-tailed gecko, {{chameleons}} of all sizes, spectacular birds such as the helmet vanga, and rare species such as the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> and tomato frog. Masoala {{is also home to}} the spectacular day-flying sunset moth, Chrysiridia rhipheus. The Madagascar serpent-eagle was recently rediscovered here, and exists in healthy populations only in this part of north east Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|Far {{less well}} known are the {{breeding}} successes in other areas, for example, with fossas (civits from <b>Madagascar)</b> and <b>red</b> river hogs.|$|R
50|$|Formerly the Provo Angels from 2001 through 2004, {{the team}} changed {{ownership}} after the 2004 season and moved from Provo {{to a new}} stadium in neighboring Orem.

The Owlz also introduced a new mascot named Hootz, a <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> with a head in the shape of a large baseball. Hootz was married in 2009 in an on-field ceremony to Holly, a female owl.|$|R
50|$|One hundred {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} on the reserve, of which 63 are endemic to Madagascar, including the endangered Madagascan serpent eagle (Eutriorchis astur) and the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> (Tyto soumagnei), which is a vulnerable species on the IUNC Red List. There are also nineteen species of reptiles and seven species of lemurs: Indri indri, Propithecus, Varecia variegata, Eulemur fulvus, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus and the aye-aye. Among the reptiles, there are nineteen species, including Calumma gallus, Calumma furcifer and the Madagascar tree boa Sanzinia madagascariensis.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> {{resembles the}} {{cosmopolitan}} barn owl but is smaller (27-30 cm) and has rich orange plumage with small black spots. It {{is known to}} live in humid evergreen forest and dry deciduous forest in {{the east of the}} island, being found in primary forest and in disturbed secondary forest (possibly even human altered open areas). It feeds on native small-mammals like tenrecs (Tenrecidae) and tuft-tailed rats (as opposed to the barn owl, which feeds on introduced species). It nests and roosts in tree cavities and along cliffs with dense vegetation.|$|R
50|$|The barn-owls are {{a wide-ranging}} family, {{although}} they are absent from northern North America, Saharan Africa, and large areas of Asia. They live {{in a wide range}} of habitats from deserts to forests, and from temperate latitudes to the tropics. The majority of the 16 living species of barn-owls are poorly known. Some, like the <b>red</b> <b>owl,</b> have barely been seen or studied since their discovery, in contrast to the common barn-owl, which is one of the best known owl species in the world. However, some subspecies of the common barn-owl possibly deserve to be separate species, but are very poorly known.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> is an orange-red {{color with}} small black spots {{and a dark}} grey/brown facial disk. Eyes are {{typically}} a sooty black color, the beak is a pale grey, and the cere (a fleshy patch {{at the base of}} the upper mandible of the beak) is flesh colored. Feet are a smoke grey color. One individual collected was measured: weight of 323 grams, body length of 275 mm, unflattened wing-length of 209 mm, tail length of 100 mm, tarsus-length of 56.6 mm and width of 6.0 mm, and a beak length from the cere of 11.6 mm.|$|R

2500|$|Castilleja exserta {{is known}} {{by a handful}} of common names: exserted Indian paintbrush, {{sometimes}} <b>red</b> <b>owl's</b> clover, or purple Indian paintbrush. It is one of two secondary larval host plants of the butterfly that remains edible later in the season and acts as a back up when the dwarf plantain dries up. The plant can grow up to [...] in height. It prefers mesas, slopes and open areas in ponderosa pine forests and poppy fields at elevations from 1,500 to 4,500feet(1,370m). The flowers bloom from March to May and are about 1.25inches long (32mm) and formed in dense spikes, they are magenta or purple on the lower corolla lips and have yellow or white tips. The bract, modified leaves, are a reddish purple and hold five to seven lobes, each about one inch long (25mm).

50|$|The {{first known}} nest found was in August 1995 near Ambanizana, Madagascar. Initial surveys {{restricted}} {{populations in the}} north and extreme east of the island. Recent sightings have ranged from northern Madagascar, along the eastern half of the island, and more recently in the extreme southeast lowlands of Tsitongambarika. The sightings cover a fairly wide altitudinal range, from sea level to 2000 m. Because of this expansion in observed range, it has been proposed that the <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> may be more reclusive rather than extremely rare. This has been disputed, but if the overall number of individuals is low, whether due to patchy distribution and/or low population density, it is still appropriate to consider the species vulnerable or endangered. A conservative estimate of the current population is 3,500 - 15,000 individuals with a decreasing trend. A population towards the lower side of population estimate may be true based on the relatively few number of sightings throughout history despite more extensive survey work.|$|R
5000|$|The red fody (Foudia madagascariensis), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the <b>Madagascar</b> fody, <b>red</b> cardinal fody or common fody, is a small bird native to Madagascar and introduced to various other islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a common bird within its restricted range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R

50|$|The Pan Africa Raptor Conservation Program is {{designed}} to help stem the loss of biodiversity in Africa. Many species threatened by habitat loss have been surveyed, including the Cape vulture and Taita falcon in southern Africa and the African fish eagle, augur buzzard, Sokoke scops owl, Pemba scops owl, Ruppell's vulture, African white-backed vulture, and crowned eagle in several nations in East Africa. The Peregrine Fund has biologists and field workers in Madagascar, an island off the east coast of Africa with vast biological diversity. In 2006, they re-discovered the Madagascar pochard, a diving duck thought to be extinct, while searching for Madagascar harriers. The Peregrine Fund also re-discovered the Madagascar serpent eagle and <b>red</b> <b>owl</b> in 1993, both long thought to be extinct, and helped create Madagascar's largest rainforest reserve in 1997. In 2015, the Fund's Malagasy biologists successfully protected three new areas, totally more than 190,000 hectares, that {{have been added to the}} countryâ€™s national park system and will be managed by and for local people to benefit many endangered species.|$|R
