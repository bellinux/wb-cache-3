40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} peak power {{estimation}} in CMOS circuits {{is essential for}} analyzing the reliability and performance of circuits at extreme conditions. The dynamic power dissipated is directly proportional to the switching activity (number of gate outputs that toggles (changes state)) in the circuit. The Power Virus problem involves finding input vectors that cause <b>maximum</b> dynamic <b>power</b> <b>dissipation</b> (<b>maximum</b> toggles) in circuits. Techniques that use a gate-level representation of the given circuit to generate a power virus are reported in the literature. As the power virus problem is NP-complete the gatelevel techniques are less scalable with increasing design size and produce less optimal vectors. In this paper, an approach for power virus generation using behavioral models of digital circuits is presented. The proposed technique converts the given behavioral model automatically to an integer (word-level) constraint model and employs a integer constraint solver to generate the required power virus vectors. Experimenting the proposed technique on ISCAS’ 85 behavioral level benchmark circuits and the standard DLX processor model show that the above technique is fast and yields higher-quality results than the known gatelevel techniques. Interestingly, the paper attempts to generate an assembly program that cause the <b>maximum</b> dynamic <b>power</b> <b>dissipation</b> on the given DLX processor model. To {{the best of our}} knowledge the proposed technique is the first reported that considers power virus generation using behavioral level models...|$|R

50|$|In most VLSI devices, <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>dissipation</b> {{is due to}} {{the clock}} network and clocked {{sequential}} elements.

Sequential elements, latches and flip flops dissipate power when there is switching in their internal capacitance. This may happen with every clock transition/pulse into the sequential element. Sometimes the sequential elements need to change their state, but sometimes they retain their state and their output remains the same, before and after the clock pulse. This leads to unnecessary dissipation of power due to clock transition.

5000|$|Secondary {{breakdown}} is {{a failure}} mode in bipolar power transistors. In a power transistor with a large junction area, under certain conditions of current and voltage, the current concentrates in a small spot of the base-emitter junction. This causes local heating, progressing into a short between collector and emitter. This often leads {{to the destruction of}} the transistor. Secondary breakdown can occur both with forward and reverse base drive. Except at low collector-emitter voltages, the secondary breakdown limit restricts the collector current more than the steady-state power dissipation of the device. Power MOSFETs do not exhibit secondary breakdown, and their safe operating area is limited only by maximum current (the capacity of the bonding wires), <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>dissipation</b> and maximum voltage. [...] However, Power MOSFETs have parasitic PN and BJT elements within the structure, which can cause more complex localized failure modes resembling Secondary Breakdown.|$|E
5000|$|The tube is {{attached}} to a manifold which is itself attached to a high-quality vacuum pump. The tube is then evacuated of air until it reaches a vacuum level of a few torr. The evacuation is paused, and a high current is forced through the low-pressure air in the tube via the electrodes (in a process known as [...] "bombarding"). This current and voltage is far above the level that occurs in final operation of the tube. The current depends on the specific electrodes used and the diameter of the tube, but is typically in the 150 mA to 1500 mA range, starting low and increasing {{towards the end of the}} process to ensure that the electrodes are adequately heated without melting the glass tube. The bombarding current is provided by a large transformer with an open-circuit voltage of roughly 15,000VAC to 23,000VAC. The bombarding transformer acts as an adjustable constant current source, and the actual voltage during operation depends on the length and pressure of the tube. Typically the operator will maintain the pressure as high as the bombarder will allow to ensure <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>dissipation</b> and heating. Bombarding transformers may be specially made for this use, or may be repurposed electrical utility distribution transformers (the type seen mounted on utility poles) operated backwards to produce a high voltage output.|$|E
