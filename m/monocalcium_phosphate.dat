50|$|Since {{chemical}} {{expertise is}} required to create a functional chemical leaven without producing off-flavors from the chemical precursors involved, such substances are often mixed into premeasured combinations for maximum results.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o desempenho e a mineralização óssea de frangos de corte, na fase de 1 - 21 dias de idade, e a biodisponibilidade de fósforo de fosfatos comerciais utilizados na alimentação de frangos de corte. Mil e oito pintos machos de um dia de idade foram distribuídos em 14 tratamentos, com 6 repetições de 12 aves cada, em delineamento inteiramente ao acaso. Os fosfatos avaliados foram o defluorizado, monocálcico B, bicálcico A, bicálcico B e bicálcico C, com dois níveis de fósforo disponível (0, 30 e 0, 40 %). Foi adotada a técnica da {{abscissa}} e o fosfato monocálcico A como padrão (valor 100 %), com quatro níveis de fósforo disponível: 0, 25, 0, 35, 0, 45 e 0, 55 % para o cálculo da biodisponibilidade relativa. Todos os fosfatos com 0, 40 % do fósforo disponível proporcionaram às aves ganho de peso semelhante. Houve maior mineralização óssea das aves com o fosfato monocálcico B, comparado ao fosfato defluorizado. As fontes de fósforo apresentaram pequenas diferenças nos valores de biodisponibilidade relativa, com melhores resultados quanto ao monocálcico B e com maior sensibilidade de resposta da variável cinzas ósseas, em relação ao ganho de peso. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the performance and the bone mineralization of broilers, at 1 to 21 days of age, and the bioavailability of phosphorus in commercial phosphates utilized in the broilers feeding. One thousand and eight male chickens of one day old were distributed in a completely randomized design, in fourteen treatments, with six replications of twelve birds each. Phosphates evaluated were: defluorinated <b>phosphate,</b> <b>monocalcium</b> B, dicalcium A, dicalcium B and dicalcium C, with two levels of available phosphorus (0. 30 and 0. 40 %).

All the phosphates with 0. 40 % of available phosphorus levels propitiated similar weight gain to broilers. The monocalcium B resulted in higher bone mineralization of broilers than the defluorinated phosphate. The different phosphorus sources presented few differences in the values of relative bioavailability of phosphorus, with better results for the monocalcium B and with higher sensibility response for bone ashes than for body weight gain...|$|R

50|$|The acid in {{a baking}} powder can be either {{fast-acting}} or slow-acting. A fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature, and a slow-acting acid will not react until heated in an oven. Baking powders that contain both fast- and slow-acting acids are double-acting; those that contain only one acid are single-acting. By providing a second rise in the oven, double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical, {{and this is the}} type most widely available to consumers today. Double-acting baking powders work in two phases; once when cold, and once when hot. Common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and <b>monocalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (also called calcium acid phosphate).

Phosphates addition to contaminated soil decreased Pb leachability, but resulted in significant mobilization of As. Simultaneous immobilization of Pb and As was obtained only when soil was treated with mixtures of phosphates and ferrous sulfate. Arsenic uptake by plants was also seen to increase when soil was treated only with phosphates, but co-addition of ferrous sulfate was efficient in maintaining As phytoaccumulation at low levels. The addition of at least 1. 5 M/M phosphates and 10 M/M iron sulfate to soil reduced the dissolved levels of Pb and As in the water extracts to values {{in compliance with the}} EU drinking water standards. However, both additives contributed in the acidification of soil, decreasing pH from 7. 8 to values as low as 5. 6 and induced the mobilization of pH sensitive elements, such as Zn and Cd.
