5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Iran is {{regarded}} by the United Nations and other non-governmental organizations {{as among the}} world's worst offenders against freedom of religion — alongside Saudi Arabia and Sudan. Members of religious minorities are, by law and practice, barred from being elected to a representative body (except to {{the seats in the}} Majles reserved for minorities, as provided for in the Constitution) and from holding senior government or military positions. They also suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits, and incurring heavier punishments, than Muslims. Muslim men are free to marry non-Muslim women but marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> recognized.|$|E

60|$|The inward man I {{call the}} new creature, {{of which the}} Spirit of God is the support, as my soul {{supports}} my body. But, I say, this new <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always well. He knows nothing that knows not this. Now being sick, things fail. As when a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in health of body, his pulse beats so as to declare that he is sick; so when a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well within, his inward pulse, which are his desires--for I count the desires for {{the pulse of the}} inward man--they also declare that the <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> well within.

25|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} on sexual behaviour in most developing countries. The limited sources that are available indicate that although homosexual self-identification might occur relatively infrequently, the prevalence of homosexual behaviour is higher.

25|$|Guaraní {{ceramics}} {{fall into}} two major categories: na'e, or dishes, and yapepó, pots, pans, and storage containers. These were both utilitarian and ceremonial. The precontact ceramic tradition of the Gran Chaco was dramatically transformed under European colonization, which created a demand for pitchers, cups, and other introduced pottery forms. Author Josefina Pla observed that women are typically potters, and animals associated with <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> represented in Guaraní pottery.|$|E

25|$|South Korea's still {{continuing}} traditionalist beliefs {{result in}} few people being open about their homosexuality. Homosexuality is discouraged, although homosexuality is legal in South Korea. As a result, {{there are few}} if any legal protections in place for gays and lesbians, {{and many of them}} are afraid to come out to their families, friends, and co-workers. Gay <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allowed to serve in the military, and in 2005 five soldiers were discharged for homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} also hosts several non-varsity sports, including wrestling, men's soccer, crew, ultimate frisbee, rugby, lacrosse, and ice hockey. Georgia's men's {{soccer team}} received {{a bid to}} play in the NIRSA Club National Championship {{for the first time in}} 2007. Despite the program's success, however, Title IX restrictions prevent the UGA men's team from competing on the varsity level as the women's is allowed to do. Similarly, University of Georgia <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> permitted to compete with a varsity gymnastics team, again due to Title IX restrictions. Several Varsity sports are duplicated with non-varsity teams, such as women's tennis. Georgia's men's lacrosse team has won the South Eastern Lacrosse Conference three times, in 1998, 2007, and 2008, and received an automatic bid to the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association national tournament; while the women's team earned an at-large bid to the WDIA National Tournament in 2007.|$|E

500|$|According to Tripp, sexual {{attraction}} is encouraged by [...] "tension and distance" [...] between {{one person and}} another, and is consequently [...] "seldom aroused and never rewarding unless something in the partner or in the situation itself is viewed as resistant to it." [...] Tripp maintains that societies have increased divisions {{between men and women}} partly to satisfy needs inherent in sexual psychology. He suggests that there are often elements of truth to traditional accusations made against women, such as deviousness, and that derogatory descriptions of women serve to increase divisions between the sexes, create tension between them, and make relations between men and women more exciting. Tripp proposes that social bonds between <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> prone to becoming sexual because the similarity and camaraderie between men make them too close to each other for homosexual activities to have any interest. Tripp maintains that heterosexuality and homosexuality generally develop in parallel ways, but that since homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, is not encouraged and institutionalized by society, its origins are more [...] "scattered and diverse." [...] He reviewed anthropological evidence on homosexuality.|$|E

500|$|The {{first film}} Shaw {{appeared}} in was Caste in 1930. He {{soon began to}} make a name for himself in films such as Brewster's Millions in 1935, <b>Men</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> Gods in 1936 and Farewell Again in 1937. He was making about £300 a week during this stage of his career, a significant sum higher than the salary of the British Prime Minister of the time. He brought what the Daily Telegraph described as a [...] "smooth villainy" [...] to the role of Frank Sutton in The Squeaker in 1937, while in 1939 he played the hero Cmdr. David Blacklock alongside Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in The Spy in Black, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's first collaboration. Shaw described himself as a film buff and called Academy Award-winning actor Spencer Tracy his [...] "great god of all screen actors"; he was so impressed by Tracy's technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple, while Shaw claimed to find it so difficult to master himself.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the BBC {{analyzed}} the stigma over men crying during Titanic and films in general. [...] "Middle-aged <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> 'supposed' to cry during movies," [...] stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing {{the ending of}} Titanic as having generated such tears, adding that [...] "men, if they have felt weepy during , have often tried to be surreptitious about it." [...] Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, [...] "For many men, {{there is a great}} deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed." [...] Rohrer said, [...] "Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during Titanic will readily admit to becoming choked up during Saving Private Ryan or Platoon." [...] For men in general, [...] "the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion".|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make it so hard to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E
