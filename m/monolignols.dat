50|$|<b>Monolignols</b> are phytochemicals {{acting as}} source {{materials}} for biosynthesis of both lignans and lignin. The starting material for production of <b>monolignols</b> is the amino acid phenylalanine. The first reactions in the biosynthesis are {{shared with the}} phenylpropanoid pathway, and <b>monolignols</b> {{are considered to be}} a part of this group of compounds. There are three main monolignols: coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol and paracoumaryl alcohol. Different plants use different <b>monolignols.</b> For example, Norway spruce lignin is almost entirely coniferyl alcohol while paracoumaryl alcohol is found almost exclusively in grasses.|$|E
50|$|The phenylpropenes {{are derived}} from the <b>monolignols.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Monolignols</b> are synthetised in the cytosol as glucosides. The glucose {{is added}} to the monolignol to make them {{water-soluble}} and to reduce their toxicity. The glucosides are transported through the cell membrane to the apoplast. The glucose is then removed and the <b>monolignols</b> are polymerised into lignin.|$|E
30|$|<b>Monolignol</b> dimers I, II, and III {{derived from}} CAs were {{oxidized}} {{in the presence}} of HRP and H 2 O 2, resulting in the formation of <b>monolignol</b> oligomers by radical coupling reactions. There was {{a significant difference in the}} consumption rates of these dimers. The consumption rate of III was the highest among the three dimers. One of the causes of this result is likely that III contains twice the number of phenolic hydroxyl groups as I and II. There was very little difference in the oxidation potentials measured for the dimers, which implied that the reaction rate of the dimers was not related to the oxidation potential. After conducting the reaction for 3  h, both the single-component and mixed-component reactions produced <b>monolignol</b> tetramers and hexamers derived from the <b>monolignol</b> dimers, as detected by LC–MS analyses. Furthermore, <b>monolignol</b> octamers were detected in the products of the reaction systems containing II. The <b>monolignol</b> tetramers were identified in the products of single-component reaction systems, and were shown by MS analysis to be formed by 5 - 5 and 5 -O- 4 couplings between the <b>monolignol</b> dimer units. HRP-catalyzed oxidation reactions utilizing a mixture of dimers indicated that <b>monolignol</b> dimers can function as radical mediators. In plant cell wall biosynthesis, cellulose and hemicellulose are synthesized first, and then the cell walls are lignified [39 – 41]. The reaction mechanism that proceeds via radical mediation is thought to be an effective and efficient process by which lignification can occur in the narrow space between polysaccharides.|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} and biosynthesis of lignin {{are not yet}} fully understood, especially the step following the initial dimerization of <b>monolignol.</b> Liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC–MS) was {{used to analyze the}} consumption rates of <b>monolignol</b> dimers formed by β-O- 4, β- 5, and β-β couplings between coniferyl alcohols in efforts to understand the activity of <b>monolignol</b> dimers in enzymatic dehydrogenative polymerization. We investigated the reaction kinetics in single-component and mixed-component reaction systems containing one and two species of the dimers, respectively. A difference was observed between the consumption rates of the three dimers we tested, and the consumption rate of one dimer in the single-component reaction was different from that in a mixed-component reaction. In qualitative LC–MS analyses, coniferyl alcohol oligomers were detected in the reaction products. Some <b>monolignol</b> tetramers were formed by 5 - 5 and 5 -O- 4 coupling between the dimers. The results of this work suggested that <b>monolignol</b> dimers with β- 5 and β-β linkages could function as radical mediators in enzyme-catalyzed polymerization.|$|R
30|$|In the dehydrogenative {{polymerization}} of <b>monolignol</b> dimers catalyzed by HRP, {{a radical}} of a <b>monolignol</b> dimer was generated by {{association between the}} active site of HRP and the phenolic hydroxyl group on the <b>monolignol</b> dimer. The opportunity for association between a molecule and an enzyme increases {{as the number of}} phenolic hydroxyl groups on the substrate increases. Therefore, one reason that the consumption rate of III was higher than those of I and II is the difference in the number of phenolic hydroxyl group present.|$|R

30|$|Free {{radicals}} generated at the phenolic {{hydroxyl group}} (C- 4 -OH) of a <b>monolignol</b> {{can be transferred}} to C- 1, C- 5, or C-β [33], and the radical coupling reactions conducted to produce <b>monolignol</b> dimers result mainly in the generation of I, II, and III [34]. In the same manner, radical coupling reactions between I, II, and III may occur via radicals at C- 4 -O and C- 5 to form 5 -O- 4 or 5 - 5 linkages. Indeed, linkages between some of the <b>monolignol</b> tetramers present in the reaction products were identified as being constructed by 5 -O- 4 and 5 - 5 linkages. This result {{is consistent with previous}} reports about linkages among <b>monolignol</b> dimers and oligomers [35, 36]. In LC–MS chromatograms of all single-component reaction products, shown in Figs.  4 a, 5 a, and 6 a, major peaks for <b>monolignol</b> tetramers with 5 -O- 4 and 5 - 5 linkages were recorded. Some previous studies on computer simulations of electron densities and electron paramagnetic resonances suggested that II was hardly oxidized by peroxidase [37, 38]. However, in the current work, {{it has been shown that}} II does participate in the dehydrogenative polymerization catalyzed by HRP, leading to the production of <b>monolignol</b> oligomers.|$|R
40|$|Lignin is an {{aromatic}} polymer {{derived from}} the combinatorial coupling of <b>monolignol</b> radicals in the cell wall. Recently, various glycosylated lignin oligomers have been revealed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Given that <b>monolignol</b> oxidation and <b>monolignol</b> radical coupling are known {{to occur in the}} apoplast, and glycosylation in the cytoplasm, it raises questions about the subcellular localization of glycosylated lignin oligomer biosynthesis and their storage. By metabolite profiling of Arabidopsis leaf vacuoles, we show that the leaf vacuole stores a large number of these small glycosylated lignin oligomers. Their structural variety and the incorporation of alternative monomers, as observed in Arabidopsis mutants with altered <b>monolignol</b> biosynthesis, indicate that they are all formed by combinatorial radical coupling. In contrast to the common believe that combinatorial coupling is restricted to the apoplast, we hypothesized that the aglycones of these compounds are made within the cell. To investigate this, leaf protoplast cultures were cofed with C- 13 (6) -labeled coniferyl alcohol and a C- 13 (4) -labeled dimer of coniferyl alcohol. Metabolite profiling of the cofed protoplasts provided strong support for the occurrence of intracellular <b>monolignol</b> coupling. We therefore propose a metabolic pathway involving intracellular combinatorial coupling of <b>monolignol</b> radicals, followed by oligomer glycosylation and vacuolar import, which shares characteristics with both lignin and lignan biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|For a {{long time}} it has been {{believed}} that lignification has {{an important role in}} host defense against pathogen invasion. Recently, by using an RNAi gene-silencing assay we showed that <b>monolignol</b> biosynthesis plays a critical role in cell wall apposition (CWA) -mediated defense against powdery mildew fungus penetration into diploid wheat.

Additional analyses are necessary for a complete understanding of HRP-catalyzed oxidation.

As described in the introduction, HRP has been used as the primary enzyme in the study of lignification. In this study, we also used HRP as a model enzyme to find new insights into the early stage of lignin polymerization. However, HRP actually does not work for lignification in vivo. In the future, we would like to conduct additional studies using enzymes that have functionality in natural lignification, so that an understanding of the mechanism of the action of <b>monolignol</b> dimers and oligomers in lignification of plant cell walls can be gained.|$|R
30|$|<b>Monolignol</b> oligomers, i.e., tetramers, hexamers, and octamers, {{formed by}} radical {{coupling}} between <b>monolignol</b> dimers, were {{detected in the}} total ion chromatograms obtained from the LC–MS analyses. Several <b>monolignol</b> tetramers derived from the single-component reactions were identified by comparing the mass spectra of <b>monolignol</b> tetramers obtained from unlabeled dimers with those from deuterium-labeled dimers. The molecular weight of D-CA increased by 1 relative to CA, {{which led to the}} molecular weights of D-I and D-III being 2 higher than those of I and III, and the molecular weight of D-II being 1 higher than that of II. When a deuterium-labeled tetramer was generated from radical coupling of two deuterium-labeled dimers via the 5 -positions (5 - 5 linkage), the molecular weight of the tetramer from D-II was equal to that from II, whereas those from D-I and D-III were 2 higher than I and III, respectively. By contrast, when radical coupling occurs between the 5 -position and the phenolic oxygen (5 -O- 4 linkage), the molecular weight of the deuterium-labeled tetramer from D-II increased by 1 relative to that of an analog synthesized from II, while the molecular weights of the tetramer derived from D-I and D-III increased by 3 relative to those of I and III, respectively.|$|R

[...] Laccases can be polymeric, and the enzymatically active form can be a dimer or trimer. Other laccases, such as those produced by the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, {{play a role in the}} degradation of lignin, and can therefore be classed as lignin-modifying enzymes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} monolignol monomers, methoxylated to various degrees: p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol (Figure 3). These lignols are {{incorporated}} into lignin {{in the form of}} the phenylpropanoids p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S), respectively. Gymnosperms have a lignin that consists almost entirely of G with small quantities of H. That of dicotyledonous angiosperms is more often than not a mixture of G and S (with very little H), and monocotyledonous lignin is a mixture of all three. Many grasses have mostly G, while some palms have mainly S. All lignins contain small amounts of incomplete or modified <b>monolignols,</b> and other monomers are prominent in non-woody plants.|$|E
40|$|A central {{question}} in lignin biosynthesis is how guaiacyl intermediates are hydroxylated and methylated to the syringyl <b>monolignol</b> in angiosperms. To address this question, we cloned cDNAs encoding a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (LsM 88) and a caffeate O-methyltransferase (COMT) from sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) xylem. Mass spectrometry-based functional analysis of LsM 88 in yeast identified it as coniferyl aldehyde 5 -hydroxylase (CAld 5 H). COMT expressed in Escherichia coli methylated 5 -hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde to sinapyl aldehyde. Together, CAld 5 H and COMT converted coniferyl aldehyde to sinapyl aldehyde, suggesting a CAld 5 H/COMT-mediated pathway from guaiacyl to syringyl <b>monolignol</b> biosynthesis via coniferyl aldehyde that {{contrasts with the}} generally accepted route to sinapate via ferulate. Although the CAld 5 H/COMT enzyme system can mediate the biosynthesis of syringyl <b>monolignol</b> intermediates through either route, kcat/Km of CAld 5 H for coniferyl aldehyde was ≈ 140 times greater than that for ferulate. More significantly, when coniferyl aldehyde and ferulate were present together, coniferyl aldehyde was a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 0. 59 μM) of ferulate 5 -hydroxylation, thereby eliminating the entire reaction sequence from ferulate to sinapate. In contrast, ferulate {{had no effect on}} coniferyl aldehyde 5 -hydroxylation. 5 -Hydroxylation also could not be detected for feruloyl-CoA or coniferyl alcohol. Therefore, in the presence of coniferyl aldehyde, ferulate 5 -hydroxylation does not occur, and the syringyl <b>monolignol</b> can be synthesized only from coniferyl aldehyde. Endogenous coniferyl, 5 -hydroxyconiferyl, and sinapyl aldehydes were detected, consistent with in vivo operation of the CAld 5 H/COMT pathway from coniferyl to sinapyl aldehydes via 5 -hydroxyconiferyl aldehyde for syringyl <b>monolignol</b> biosynthesis...|$|R

50|$|Regulation of CCR {{expression}} {{is thought to}} occur primarily at the transcriptional level. In Arabidopsis thaliana, several of the required transcription factors for CCR expression have actually been identified, including MYB58 and MYB63, {{both of which are}} implicated generally in secondary cell wall formation. It has been shown that over-expression of these two transcription factors results in a 2- to 3-fold increase in CCR mRNA transcripts, though intriguingly, the up-regulation of genes further upstream in the <b>monolignol</b> pathway is even greater. Non-transcriptional regulation of CCR, however, can be important as well. In rice (Oryza sativa), for example, evidence suggests that the CCR1 homolog is an effector of Rac1, a small GTPase important for plant defense response. In this case, the Rac1 protein is proposed to activate CCR upon binding, leading to enhanced <b>monolignol</b> biosynthesis. Because Rac1 also activates NADPH oxidase, which produces peroxides critical for <b>monolignol</b> polymerization, overall lignin biosynthesis is enhanced as well.|$|R
50|$|Phylogenomic {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} enzymes with true CCR activity first {{evolved in the}} ancestor(s) of land plants. Most if not all modern land plants and all vascular plants {{are believed to have}} at least one functional CCR, an absolute requirement for any plant species with lignified tissues. Most CCR homologs are highly expressed during development, especially in stem, root, and xylem cells which require the enhanced structural support provided by lignin. However, certain CCRs are not constitutively expressed throughout development and are only up-regulated during enhanced lignification in response to stressors such as pathogen attack. CCR is especially important because it acts as a final control point for regulation of metabolic flux toward the <b>monolignols</b> and therefore toward lignin as well; prior to this reduction step, the cinnamoyl-CoA's can still enter into other expansive specialized metabolic pathways. For example, feruloyl-CoA is a precursor of the coumarin scopoletin, a compound believed {{to play an important role}} in plant pathogen response. CCR also plays a role in determining lignin composition by regulating levels of the different monomers according to its specific activity toward particular cinnamoyl-CoA's. Monocots and dicots, for example, tend to have very different lignin patterns: lignin found in monocots typically has a higher percentage of p-coumaroyl alcohol-derived subunits, while lignin found in dicots is typically composed of almost entirely coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol subunits. As can be seen in the diagram shown to the right, these <b>monolignols</b> are derived directly from their corresponding aldehydes, except in the case of sinapyl alcohol - interestingly, while several CCR homologs have been shown to act on sinapoyl-CoA in vitro, it is unclear whether this activity is biologically relevant and most current models of the lignin pathway do not include this reaction as a valid step.|$|E
5000|$|In lignan biosynthesis, {{oxidative}} enzymes perform proton coupled {{electron transfer}} {{to remove a}} hydrogen atom from <b>monolignols,</b> forming a radical intermediate. These intermediates then couple in a radical termination reaction to form one {{of a variety of}} dimers, known as lignans. In vitro reactions of coniferyl alcohol (a common monolignol) in the presence of oxidative enzymes produce a wide variety of different dimers at varying concentrations. When dirigent protein from [...] "Forsythia intermedia" [...] is present, production of (+)-pinoresinol is greatly enriched, and other products are far less abundant. Because this enrichment is so pronounced, the enzyme is hypothesized to produce (+)-pinoresinol exclusively, and to compete with the non-protein-mediated coupling reaction, which produces a heterologous mix of products. This has been confirmed by analyzing the various mixtures produced with different concentrations of dirigent proteins present. The mechanism by which this stereoselectivity is achieved is not well understood at this time. However, since no reaction proceeds in the absence of oxidative enzymes, dirigent protein does not itself appear to catalyze the oxidation of coniferyl alcohol to form radicals.|$|E
30|$|Lignin, a major {{component}} of secondary cell walls, is a heterogeneous tridimensional phenolic polymer resulting from the oxidative polymerization of <b>monolignols</b> (Boerjan et al. 2003). During defense responses, lignin and lignin-like phenolic compounds accumulate throughout the HR region. Deposition of lignin during defense responses is considered to function as a physical barrier against pathogen infection (Moerschbacher et al. 1990). Cinnamoyl-CoA esters, the precursors of monolignol biosynthesis, are generated by the general phenylpropanoid pathway and then converted into <b>monolignols</b> by two enzymes, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (CCR 1) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase. The <b>monolignols</b> catalyzed by CCR and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase are transferred to the cell wall and polymerized by peroxidase H 2 O 2 induced as one of the defense responses may stimulate polymerization of <b>monolignols</b> in the infected regions. It is also possible that <b>monolignols</b> have antimicrobial activity, as has been previously reported (Keen and Littlefield 1979).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the lignins and lignans, both monolignol-derived {{coupling}} products, {{account for}} nearly 30 % of the organic carbon circulating in the biosphere, the biosynthetic mechanism of their formation has been poorly understood. The prevailing view has been that lignins and lignans are produced by random free-radical polymerization and coupling, respectively. This view is challenged, mechanistically, by the recent discovery of dirigent proteins that precisely determine both the regiochemical and stereoselective outcome of <b>monolignol</b> radical coupling. RESULTS: To understand further the regulation and control of <b>monolignol</b> coupling, leading to both lignan and lignin formation, we sought to clone the first genes encoding dirigent proteins from several species. The encoding genes, described here, have no sequence homology with any other protein of known function. When expressed in a heterologous system, the recombinant protein was able to confer strict regiochemical and stereochemical control on <b>monolignol</b> free-radical coupling. The expression in plants of dirigent proteins and proposed dirigent protein arrays in developing xylem and in other lignified tissues indicates roles for these proteins in both lignan formation and lignification.
