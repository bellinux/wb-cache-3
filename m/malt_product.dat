40|$|Complementation and {{polarity}} suppression {{data are}} interpreted {{in terms of}} the genetic structure of the maltose B region. It is proposed that this region comprises two divergent operons. One operon includes malK, a cistron involved in maltose permeation, and lamB the only known cistron specifically involved in Î» receptor synthesis. The other operon includes malJ 1 and malJ 2 which are most probably two different cistrons, both involved in maltose permeation*. It is further assumed that expression of the two operons is controlled by malT, the positive regulatory gene of the maltose system, located in the malA region. The target(s) for the action of the <b>malT</b> <b>product</b> is (are) most likely to be located between malJ 1 and malK. There is an indication that the two operons might overlap in the region of their promoters. The structure of such an overlap as well as the possible function of the products of the different cistrons in malB are briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} plaque-forming lambda h 80 transducing phages {{carrying}} various {{portions of the}} malA region were isolated. A 5, 800 -base pair HindIII-EcoRI DNA fragment from one of these phages was cloned into pBR 322 and shown to contain malT, which is the positive regulator gene of the maltose regulon, and most of malP, the structural gene for maltodextrin phosphorylase. A restriction map of the HindIII-EcoRI fragment was established, and it was correlated with the genetic map of the malA region (i) by mapping deletions which had been generated in vitro on the plasmid and (ii) by locating on the restriction map a DNA insertion of known genetic position. A 600 -base pair HincII-HaeII segment was shown to contain {{all or part of}} the promoters for malT and malP, which are known to be transcribed in opposite directions.

40|$|The malPQ operon, one of {{the three}} operons of the maltose regulon, is {{positively}} controlled by the product of gene malT. The starting point for malPQ transcription was deduced from experiments which involved a hybridization of in vivo-synthesized malPQ mRNA with adequate DNA probes, followed either by a digestion of nonhybridized DNA (S 1 nuclease mapping) or by an extension of the hybridized probe (reverse transcriptase mapping). In the wild-type strain, this starting point was 37 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon for malP. This analysis was also performed on a double mutant which contained both a 13 -base pair deletion and a 3 -base pair insertion in the promoter region. This double mutant expressed the malPQ operon exactly as the wild-type strain did, in a maltose-inducible manner. In this strain, the starting point for malPQ transcription was shifted 11 nucleotides downstream from the wild-type location. An analysis of these results suggests that (i) the binding site for the <b>malT</b> <b>product</b> is located upstream from the region which is severely altered in the double mutant, i. e., upstream from position - 31; and (ii) the 30 -base pair sequence which precedes the transcription starting point contains very few positions which are essential for promoter activity...|$|E
40|$|Malt {{analysis}} {{provides guidance}} {{on the effectiveness}} of the malting process and the suitability of the malt for brewing. The brewer judges malt quality by referring to the malt analysis provided by the maltster. We have malted current varieties to the standard four day (96 hr) germination period. We then abbreviated the process by 24 hours to a three day (72 hr) germination time. We have identified through malt analysis on some standard four day germination varieties {{that it is possible to}} abbreviate the process by 24 hrs and still achieve a desirable <b>malt</b> <b>product.</b> The obvious beneficiaries of this technology are the malt houses. The outcomes will impact on the possible production output without impacting heavily on capital and operational costs. This research could reduce the malting time by 24 hours by selecting suitable varieties. Therefore a higher throughput could be achieved from malt houses that are currently at capacity. Alternatively if the same amount of grain was used for processing, a shorter malting time would cut down considerably on output costs. Less power and water could be used in the process which would cut down substantially on expenditure. Malt analysis will now be carried out on a larger set of varieties and these will be compared with microarray analysis of gene expression comparisons to endeavour to identify genes responsible for differing rates of initiation of in the malting process to help reduce this malting time even further, possibly to a two day malting...|$|E

40|$|Barley is a {{good source}} of dietary fibre, {{particularly}} Î²-glucan and arabinoxylan, to increase formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Butyric and propionic acid are involved in the preservation of colonic barrier function, thus decreasing the risk of inflammation. Previous studies have shown that malting barley increased formation of butyric acid in caecum of rats and had abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria than unmalted barley. However, this differed between malts, probably due to the differences in fibre functional characteristics. The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of barley variety and malting conditions on the functional properties of the dietary fibre in barley <b>malt</b> <b>products,</b> with the overall aim of improving intestinal health. Focus was given to Î²-glucan functional properties, but also arabinoxylan. The influence of these fibres on substrate delivery to the colon, SCFAs formation, microbiota composition and gene expression was investigated. In the first study, rats fed commercial barley malts had a higher level of butyric and propionic acids in the caecum and portal serum than those fed control diets (cellulose). Î²-glucan with broader molecular weight seemed to better increase the caecal SCFA formation. In addition, the malts contributed to improved mucosal barrier function and inflammatory state by decreasing mRNA expression of tight junction protein and toll-like receptors in the small intestine and distal colon. However, malt with high amounts of advanced glycation end-products seemed to attenuate the effect on occludin (tight junction protein) in the small intestine. To evaluate the possibility of using malting to tailor functional characteristics of the fibre, three barley varieties were malted using different temperatures and levels of lactic acid in the steeping water. The extent to which barley components changed depended on the variety. Steeping at 35 Â°C with 0. 4 % lactic acid preserved soluble fibre and Î²-glucan content better, but not the soluble arabinoxylan, compared with steeping at 15 Â°C and without lactic acid. However, no changes in Î²-glucan molecular weight (> 10 kDa) were observed. Î²-glucan molecular weight analysed with AF 4 at a wider molecular weight range (> 2 kDa), was shown to be affected by both variety and processing (steeping or mashing) to different extents. Addition of proteolytic enzymes shifted the Î²-glucan of high molecular weight to a lower molecular weight range, suggesting that proteins are involved in the structure of Î²-glucan, which might result in an apparently higher molecular weight. After passage through a dynamic gastrointestinal in vitro model (TIM- 1), it was observed that Î²-glucan molecular weight gradually decreased in the different barley products investigated. The longer in vitro transit time of soluble fibre and Î²-glucan was related to their high content and/or molecular weight, which also seemed to be linked to a higher degree of fermentation in an in vivo model (rats). In the last study it was investigated the differences of microbiota composition in rats fed barley <b>malt</b> <b>products.</b> Rats fed <b>malt</b> <b>products</b> had higher microbiota diversity (negatively associated with ulcerative colitis and obesity) than those fed barley extracts rich in arabinoxylan or Î²-glucan, and control. Malts contributing with a higher content of Î²-glucan increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Blautia and tended to increase butyric acid, whereas soluble arabinoxylan increased Akkermansia and propionic acid in the caecum. By mixing barley products (brewersâ spent grain and malt) it was possible to modulate the microbiota into an intermediary abundance of taxa, with slight increase of butyric acid compared with malt alone. In conclusion, malting seems to be a potential processing method for tailoring barley composition to promote intestinal health. Both the selection of barley variety and the processing conditions affected the composition of <b>malt</b> <b>products.</b> The resulting barley products with a high content of soluble fibre, Î²-glucan and soluble arabinoxylan, enhanced colon fermentation, microbiota composition and, to some extent, the SCFA formation...|$|R

40|$|Barley <b>malt,</b> a <b>product</b> of {{controlled}} germination, {{has been shown}} to produce high levels of butyric acid in the cecum and portal serum of rats and may therefore have anti-inflammatory effects. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate how four barley malts, caramelized and colored malts, 50 -malt and 350 -malt, differing in functional characteristics concerning beta-glucan content and color, affect short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), barrier function and inflammation in the hindgut of rats fed high-fat diets. Male Wistar rats were given malt-supplemented high-fat diets for four weeks. Low and high-fat diets containing microcrystalline cellulose were incorporated as controls. All diets contained 70 g kg(- 1) dietary fiber. The malt-fed groups were found to have had induced higher amounts of butyric and propionic acids in the hindgut and portal serum compared with controls, while cecal succinic acid only increased to a small extent. Fat increased the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins and Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the small intestine and distal colon of the rats, as well as the concentration of some amino acids in the portal plasma, but malt seemed to counteract these adverse effects to some extent. However, the high content of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) in caramelized malt tended to prohibit the positive effects on occludin in the small intestine and plasma amino acids seen with the other <b>malt</b> <b>products.</b> In conclusion, <b>malting</b> seems to be an interesting process for producing foods with positive health effects, but part of these effects may be destroyed if the malt contains a high content of AGE...|$|R

40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} {{epidemics}} of wheat and barley cause heavy economic losses to farmers due to yield decreases {{and production of}} mycotoxin that renders the grain useless for flour and <b>malt</b> <b>products.</b> No highly resistant cultivars are available at present. Hyphae of germinating fungal spores use different paths of infection: After germination at the extruded tip of an ovary, the hyphae travel along the epicarp {{in the space between}} the lemma and palea. Infection of the developing kernel proceeds through the epicarp, successively destroying the layers of the fruit coat and finally the starch and protein accumulating endosperm. Hyphae reaching the rachis proceed to apically located developing kernels. Using a constitutively green fluorescence protein-expressing Fusarium wild-type strain, and its knockout mutant, preventing trichothecene synthesis, we demonstrate that trichothecenes are not a virulence factor during infection through the fruit coat. In the absence of trichothecenes, the fungus is blocked by the development of heavy cell wall thickenings in the rachis node of Nandu wheat, a defense inhibited by the mycotoxin. In barley hyphae of both wild-type and the trichothecene knockout mutant, are inhibited at the rachis node and rachilla, limiting infection of adjacent florets through the phloem and along the surface of the rachis. Effective resistance to Fusarium head blight requires expression of genes that combat these different pathways of infection...|$|R

The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant activity of kilned (standard) and roasted (speciality) malts in relation to phenolic compounds, sugars, amino acids, and color [assessed as European Brewing Convention units (degrees EBC) and absorbance at 420 nm]. The concentrations of sugars and amino acids decreased with the intensity of the applied heat treatment, and this was attributed to the extent of the Maillard reaction, as well as sugar caramelization, in the highly roasted malts. Proline, followed by glutamine, was the most abundant free amino/imino acid in the malt samples, except those that were highly roasted, and maltose was the most abundant sugar in all malts. Levels of total phenolic compounds decreased with heat treatment. Catechin and ferulic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the majority of the malts, and amounts were highest in the kilned samples. In highly roasted <b>malts,</b> degradation <b>products</b> of ferulic acid were identified. Antioxidant activity increased with the intensity of heating, in parallel with color formation, and was significantly higher for roasted malts compared to kilned malts.
