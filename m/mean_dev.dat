40|$|Aims: We {{analyze the}} {{possible}} clinical differences between bone jaw exposed areas in ONJ (osteonecrosis of the jaws) and ORN (osteoradionecrosis). Patients and method: Group 1 was composed with 53 ONJ cases and group 2 with 20 ORN cases. In both groups we analyzed, the major {{size of the}} exposed bone areas, the number of exposed areas, the location on the jaws {{and the presence of}} others associated and severe complications, such as skin fistulas and jaw fractures. We also investigated the possible local aetiology or trigger factor of the lesions. Results: The major size of the bone exposed areas was 2. 29 ± 2. 02 (<b>mean</b> ± std. <b>dev)</b> in group 1 and 2. 7 ± 2. 9 (<b>mean</b> ± std. <b>dev)</b> in group 2 (p> 0. 05). The number of exposed areas was 1. 8 ± 1. 34 (<b>mean</b> ± std. <b>dev)</b> in group 1 and 1. 2 ± 0. 55 (<b>mean</b> ± std. <b>dev)</b> in group 2 (p> 0. 05). There were more fractures in the second group (20 %) (p< 0. 05), and skin fistulas (35 %) (p< 0. 05). We found more patients in group 1 in which the dental extraction was the local aetiology of the bone necrosis (35 cases, 66. 03 %), while in group 2 there were 8 (40 %) (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: In our study with ONJ there were not differences in the major size of the bone exposed areas, but there were more lesions per patient than in group with ORN. The severity of the complications, such as jaw fractures and skin fistulas were higher in ORN, and in this group it was more frequent the spontaneous lesions than in the ONJ where it is more frequent following dental extractions...|$|R

40|$|Various {{physical}} {{attributes of the}} Earth's surface are factors that influence local topography and indirectly influence human behaviour in terms of habitation locations. The determination of geomorphological setting {{plays an important role}} in archaeological landscape research. Several landform types can be distinguished by characteristic geomorphic attributes that portray the landscape surrounding a settlement and influence its ability to sustain a population. Geomorphometric landform information, derived from digital elevation models (DEMs), such as the ASTER Global DEM, can provide useful insights into the processes shaping landscapes. This work examines the influence of landform classification on the settlement locations of Bronze Age (Minoan) Crete, focusing on the districts of Phaistos, Kavousi and Vrokastro. The landform classification was based on the topographic position index (TPI) and deviation from <b>mean</b> elevation (<b>DEV)</b> analysis to highlight slope steepness of various landform classes, characterizing the surrounding landscape environment of the settlements locations. The outcomes indicate no interrelationship between the settlement locations and topography during the Early Minoan period, but a significant interrelationship exists during the later Minoan periods with the presence of more organised societies. The landform classification can provide insights into factors favouring human habitation and can contribute to archaeological predictive modelling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new method for muscle force estimation from multi-channel surface electro-myograms. The method combines a motor unit twitch model with motor unit innervation pulse trains, which are estimated from multi-channel surface electromyograms. The motor unit twitches are then aligned to the innervation pulse trains and summed up to obtain the total muscle force. The method was tested on real surface EMG signals acquired during force ramp contractions of abductor pollicis brevis muscle in 8 male subjects. With 22 ± 5 (<b>mean</b> ± std. <b>dev.)</b> motor units identified per subject, the force estimation error of our method was 16 ± 4 % RMS. These results were compared to the method which uses the EMG amplitude processing to estimate muscle force.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{increase}} our understanding of the gaseous elemental mercury (GEM, Hg°) fluxes between the atmosphere and soils. Moreover, we wanted to quantify the annual GEM flux, identify the controls, and compare the GEM flux to annual rates of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) dry deposition and wet deposition of total mercury. We measured GEM fluxes using the modified Bowen ratio (MBR) technique from 6 July 2009 to 6 July 2010 in western Maryland. The annual hourly <b>mean</b> (±std. <b>dev.)</b> GEM flux was − 0. 63 ± 31. 0 ng·m− 2 ·h− 1. Hourly mean GEM fluxes were not strongly correlated with atmospheric trace gases, aerosols, or meteorology. However, hourly mean GEM emissions (15. 3 ± 27. 9 ng·m− 2 ·h− 1) and deposition (− 14. 6 ± 26. 6 ng·m− 2 ·h− 1) were correlated with ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B), wind speed (WS), ozone (O 3), and relative humidity (RH). The annual net GEM flux was − 3. 33 µg· m− 2 ·year− 1 and was similar to the annual dry deposition rate of GOM (2. 5 to 3. 2 µg·m− 2 ·year− 1), and 40 % less than the annual mean wet deposition (8 µg·m− 2 ·year− 1) of total mercury.

We began a project to measure, with high spatial and temporal resolution, soil CO 2 flux in a stand (11 x 25 m area) of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) at the Logan, Utah, Forestry Sciences Laboratory. Beginning on Nov. 1, 2009, hourly soil CO 2 flux measurements were made at a single location in the stand using the Li-Cor LI- 8100 soil CO 2 flux instrument and 20 -cm long-term chamber. Beginning in April, 2010, monthly soil CO 2 flux measurements were made on a grid of 11 locations within the stand using the LI- 8100 equipped with the 20 -cm survey chamber. Hourly soil temperature (10 -cm depth) and volumetric soil water content data were also collected. Soil CO 2 flux, temperature, and water content were highly temporally and spatially variable in the sagebrush stand. <b>Mean</b> (std <b>dev)</b> soil CO 2 flux, temperature, and water content for the measurement period (November 1, 2009 - October 31, 2010) were 0. 96 (0. 81) umol m- 2 s- 1, 10. 59 (10. 11) deg C, and 0. 101 (0. 062) m 3 m- 3, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: Aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the cavity margin adaptation of three composites using optical microscope and software evaluations. Methods: 30 molars were randomly divided into 3 groups. An MOD cavity was prepared on each tooth. In the first group (G 1) restorations were performed using a new experimental bulk-filling composite. In the second group (G 2) Surefil SDR (Dentsply) was used with a single-application technique. In the third group, a traditional nanohybrid composite was used with a microlayering technique (Tetric Evoceram, Ivoclar-Vivadent). Composites were cured (G 1 : > 2000 mW/cm 2, 1 s; G 2 : 1. 200 mW/cm 2, 20 s; G 3 : 1. 200 mW/cm 2, 10 s per increment), then samples were cut in 1 mm-thick slices, starting from the coronal end of the tooth. Sections at 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm were analyzed. After the images optical-microscope acquisition (50 x), the gap analysis has been carried out through a digital automated software (Jmicrovision). The mean marginal gap width and standard deviations were calculated using Kruskal‐Wallis and Tukey’s tests because of the non-parametric distribution (p< 0. 05).

A single application of halosulfuron applied when there was little alfalfa foliage slightly reduced plant heights for several cutting cycles with increasing rate decreasing plant height.

The trend of decreasing cumulative forage fresh weight with increasing halosulfuron rate was significant (Adj. R 2 = 0. 178, P = 0. 015) indicating that for the three harvests after August 25 th, halosulfuron had a small but negative effect on forage fresh weight. The harvest on April 5, 2000, the fourth harvest following the halosulfuron applications on August 25, 1999, indicated that there was no longer any residual effect of halosulfuron on alfalfa growth. Plant populations measured on April 10, 2000 were not affected by either one or two halosulfuron applications in this experiment. A set of sequential halosulfuron treatments applied when there was substantial alfalfa foliage (about 80 % of the ground surface covered) severely suppressed alfalfa regrowth. Little regrowth occurred in these plots in October or November after the sequential applications compared to the untreated control or to the plots that received only the initial application of halosulfuron. The change in mean percent yield loss with successive harvests on November 15 th, February 22 nd and April 5 th of 85, 40 and 14 % indicated that the alfalfa plants were recovering from the halosulfuron applications. The cumulative forage fresh weight yields for treatments receiving sequential halosulfuron treatments (0. 032 + 0. 032, 0. 047 + 0. 047, or 0. 063 + 0. 063 lb a. i. /A) were (<b>means</b> ± std. <b>dev.)</b> : 11. 67 ± 1. 46, 10. 85 ± 1. 06, and 10. 44 ± 0. 98 tons/A, respectively, and were much less than the cumulative yield of 18. 97 ± 1. 17 tons/A from the untreated plots.

40|$|Purpose: Computed tomographic (CT) colonography is a {{relatively}} new technique for detecting bowel cancer or potentially precancerous polyps. CT scanning is combined with three-dimensional (3 D) image reconstruction to produce a virtual endoluminal representation similar to optical colonoscopy. Because retained fluid and stool can mimic pathology, CT data are acquired with the bowel cleansed and insufflated with gas and patient in both prone and supine positions. Radiologists then match visually endoluminal locations between the two acquisitions in order to determine whether apparent pathology is real or not. This process is hindered {{by the fact that the}} colon, essentially a long tube, can undergo considerable deformation between acquisitions. The authors present a novel approach to automatically establish spatial correspondence between prone and supine endoluminal colonic surfaces after surface parameterization, even in the case of local colon collapse. METHODS: The complexity of the registration task was reduced from a 3 D to a 2 D problem by mapping the surfaces extracted from prone and supine CT colonography onto a cylindrical parameterization. A nonrigid cylindrical registration was then performed to align the full colonic surfaces. The curvature information from the original 3 D surfaces was used to determine correspondence. The method can also be applied to cases with regions of local colonic collapse by ignoring the collapsed regions during the registration. RESULTS: Using a development set, suitable parameters were found to constrain the cylindrical registration method. Then, the same registration parameters were applied to a different set of 13 validation cases, consisting of 8 fully distended cases and 5 cases exhibiting multiple colonic collapses.

40|$|Purpose: Evaluate Gadoxetate Disodium {{enhanced}} dual-energy CT for {{visualization of}} perihilar cholangiocarcinoma by exploiting the hepatobiliary uptake of Gadoxetate Disodium and viewing images at the k-edge of gadolinium on {{the spectrum of}} simulated monoenergetic energies available with Dual Energy CT. Material and methods: In this prospective, IRB-approved study in patients with suspected cholangiocarcinoma, subjects who underwent a clinically indicated Gadoxetate Disodium liver MRI were immediately scanned without further IV contrast administration using rapid kVp-switching dual energy CT (rsDECT). Initial Gadoxetate Disodium dose was the FDA approved clinical dose, 0. 025  mmol/kg; after additional IRB/FDA approval, 10 subjects were scanned with 0. 05  mmol/kg. Both 50  keV and 70  keV simulated monoenergetic images as well as gadolinium(-water) material density images were viewed qualitatively and measured quantitatively for gadolinium uptake in the hepatic parenchyma and any focal lesions identified. Results: Of 18 subjects (mean age 55 years, 10 M, 8 F, weight 84  kg), eight were scanned with 0. 025  mmol/kg (Group 1) and 10 with 0. 05  mmol/kg Gadoxetate Disodium (Group 2). Five patients had cholangiocarcinoma (all in Group 1). On synthetic monoenergetic images using standard and double Gadoxetate Disodium dose, the liver parenchyma did not appear enhanced qualitatively. Comparison of mean hepatic parenchymal HU at 50 and 70  keV showed a measurable increase in attenuation at the lower viewing energy, which corresponded to the k-edge of gadolinium. No statistically significant difference was observed on quantitative gadolinium measurement of hepatic parenchyma for single versus double Gadoxetate Disodium dose using rsDECT gadolinium material density images. Of the five cholangiocarcinomas, the tumor to nontumoral hepatic tissue HU differences were 51. 1 (32. 2) (<b>mean</b> and std <b>dev)</b> and 49. 0 (26. 5) at 50 and 70  keV, respectively. Conclusion: In this small pilot population, evaluation of potential hilar/perihilar cholangiocarcinoma using dual energy CT at both the single FDA-approved dose and double dose of gadolinium demonstrated observed differences in attenuation between the hepatic parenchyma and lesions. However, small sample size and heterogeneity of lesions warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Background. Venomenhal® (V) {{is a new}} {{brand of}} Hymenoptera venom {{allergen}} for diagnosis and immunotherapy of venom allergy. We studied the safety of switching the patients treated with other brands of venom to V.   Methods. We performed duplicate skin prick tests with V and ALK Reless® (R) venom extract (100 μg/ml) in 68 patients (50 males, 42 ± 15 years) on maintenance immunotherapy with honey bee (26) or wasp (42) venom. On two consecutive maintenance injection days 53 patients received in random order either 100 μg of R or V venom.   Results. Weal diameter in skin prick tests (<b>mean</b> ± st. <b>dev.)</b> were 3. 9 ± 1. 1 mm (V) and 4. 1 ± 1. 0 mm (R) for bee venom (NS) and 3. 4 ± 1. 0 mm (V) and 3. 9 ± 1. 2 mm (R) for wasp venom (p < 0. 01). Local reaction 30 minutes after maintenance injection were 6. 1 ± 1. 7 cm (V) and 5. 4 ± 2. 5 cm (R) for bee venom (NS) and 5. 1 ± 1. 8 cm (V) and 6. 1 ± 1. 8 cm (R) for wasp venom (p < 0. 05). Late local reactions (LLR) and tiredness (T) {{on the day of}} injection and 24 hours after injection were equally distributed among both groups and were mild (LLR on the day of injection: 38 % of patients [V] vs. 43 % [R]. LLR after 24 hours: 28 % [V] vs. 28 % [R]. T on the day of injection: 21 % [V] vs. 23 % [R]. T after 24 hours: 0 % [V] vs. 6 % [R]).   Conclusions. V was at least as safe as A. There were no adverse reactions due to switching from one brand to another. Slightly but significantly smaller weal in skin prick tests and immediate local reactions might be due to lesser potency or better purification of V wasp extract. </p...|$|R
