25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of <b>manualism</b> vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the cochlear implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the cochlear implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E
500|$|Up to the 1950s, the {{predominant}} method in deaf education was oralism – acquiring oral language comprehension and production. Linguists {{did not consider}} sign language to be true [...] "language", but rather something inferior. Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption. Aided by {{the civil rights movement}} of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for <b>manualism,</b> the use of sign language in deaf education. Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL. In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics. In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as [...] "Ameslan", but this term is now considered obsolete.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trend}} for {{cochlear}} implants in children grows, deaf-community advocates {{have tried to}} counter the [...] "either or" [...] formulation of oralism vs <b>manualism</b> with a [...] "both and" [...] approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{originally}} {{formed as}} a part of Orange County's burgeoning third wave ska scene, much of the band's early material was rooted in the genre. Boasting an eight-piece line-up featuring two lead guitarists, a keyboardist and a horn section consisting of two trumpets and a saxophone, The Aquabats' style of ska was primarily driven by brass and guitar, incorporating elements of surf rock and punk rock. Their second album, 1997's The Fury of The Aquabats!, while still predominantly ska-based, found the band starting to expand their sound into newer territory, featuring more pronounced punk and surf influences and [...] experimentalism, including several instrumentals, pastiches of ragtime and tango music and the utilization of such unconventional instruments as clarinets, electric sitars and even <b>manualism.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Manualism</b> is {{a method}} of {{education}} of deaf students using sign language within the classroom. <b>Manualism</b> arose in the late 18th century {{with the advent of}} free public schools for the deaf in Europe. These teaching methods were brought over to the United States where the first school for the deaf was established in 1817. Today <b>manualism</b> methods are used in conjunction with oralism methods in the majority of American deaf schools.|$|E
50|$|Some deaf {{schools in}} Germany and England that were contemporaries of the Abbé de l'Épée's Paris School used an oralist {{approach}} emphasising speech and lip reading, {{in contrast to}} his belief in <b>manualism.</b> Their methods were closely guarded secrets, and they saw Épée as a rival. The oralism vs. <b>manualism</b> debate still rages to this day. Oralism is sometimes called the German method, and <b>manualism</b> the French method in reference to those times.|$|E
50|$|Two {{general methods}} of deaf {{education}} are <b>manualism</b> and oralism. <b>Manualism</b> is instruction using sign language, and oralism uses spoken language. Although controversy has existed {{since the early}} eighteenth century about which method is more effective, many deaf-educational facilities attempt to integrate both approaches. The National Association of the Deaf advocates a bilingual approach, to best support deaf students in their education.|$|E
50|$|This {{tradition}} {{continued until}} 1880 when oralism began to replace <b>manualism</b> {{as the dominant}} approach to Deaf education, almost obliterating ASL and Deaf culture in America. Oralism was the main philosophy in Deaf education until 1965 when the linguist William Stokoe argued that ASL {{should be regarded as}} a full language with all of the expressive power of any oral language. Deaf Pride began to shoot higher than it had in a century and Deaf education returned to <b>manualism</b> for the most part.|$|E
50|$|Before the 1860s {{and before}} the American Civil War, manual {{language}} was very popular among the Deaf community and also supported by the hearing community. The hearing community viewed deafness as “isolating the individual from the Christian community”. At the time, {{the people of the}} United States were fairly religious (notably Christian), and the hearing-advantaged believed that sign language opened deaf individuals' minds and souls to God. Through this, the hearing community believed that <b>manualism</b> brought deaf people closer to God and opened deaf people to the gospel, which brought <b>manualism</b> general acceptance.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{with years}} of practice, <b>manualism</b> is very {{difficult}} to control. It {{may be one of the}} hardest [...] "instruments" [...] in the world to play, and live stage performances are extremely rare.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the American Civil War in {{the late}} 1860s, the {{argument}} for “Survival of the Fittest” was applied to the issue of education for the deaf {{as a result of a}} Darwinist perspective of Evolution. This movement brought manualists arguing their view that signs were closer to nature because the first thing babies learn to do is gesture, which is akin to sign language. To the Deaf community, <b>manualism</b> was at the time considered a gift from God. During this particular time in the United States, oralism was coming about which gave some a negative view of <b>manualism</b> because, it was argued, it was not a natural language.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1860s, the American hearing {{community}} viewed <b>manualism,</b> sign language, as an art, {{and naturally}} beautiful. They also thought of deaf people who signed as being like the Romans {{because of the}} pantomimes that {{are a part of}} the language.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the trend}} for {{cochlear}} implants in children grows, deaf-community advocates {{have tried to}} counter the [...] "either or" [...] formulation of oralism vs <b>manualism</b> with a [...] "both and" [...] approach; some schools are now successfully integrating cochlear implants with sign language in their educational programs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Manualism</b> {{is the art}} {{of playing}} music by {{squeezing}} air through the hands. Because the sound produced has a distinctly flatulent tone, such music is usually presented as a form of musical comedy or parody. The musical performer is called a manualist, who may perform a cappella or with instrumental accompaniment.|$|E
50|$|In January 1890, a {{national}} conference {{for the deaf}} was held in St Saviour's Church for the deaf in London. Here, Maginn presented his views for improving the deaf education system in Britain. He proposed forming {{a national}} association for the deaf, {{and said that the}} American Combined Method education system, which incorporated fingerspelling, Signed English and lip-reading (the <b>manualism</b> approach), which gave access to English as a written language and spoken language, where possible.|$|E
5000|$|Adam Deibert, {{also known}} as Prince Adam, is an American multi-instrumentalist whose skills include <b>manualism.</b> As {{a former member of}} the Californian rock band The Aquabats, he {{provided}} [...] "hand wind" [...] accompaniment for several of the bands early tracks, and often performed such at their live shows, doing covers of popular songs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLMqjPMJ878 In 2007, he was featured in a segment on the childrens television program Yo Gabba Gabba! playing a rendition of [...] "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfub0l-WGYw ...|$|E
50|$|Oralism is the {{education}} of deaf students through oral language by using lip reading, speech, and mimicking the mouth shapes and breathing patterns of speech instead of using sign language within the classroom. Oralism came into popular use in the United States around the late 1860s. In 1867, the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts was the first school to start teaching in this manner. Oralism and its contrast, <b>manualism,</b> manifest differently in deaf education and {{are the source of}} controversy for involved communities.|$|E
5000|$|This {{tradition}} of thought was overturned {{during the period}} of Enlightenment. The ideology during this period was focused on scientific thinking. Two major schools of thought emerged concerning which method of education would benefit deaf children: with a visual sign language or with solely speaking and lipreading, <b>manualism</b> vs. oralism. Since sign language was associated with prejudices of inferiority, of being unequal with spoken languages, of lacking abstract vocabulary, and of possessing no grammar, the oral school won control in the education of the deaf everywhere.|$|E
5000|$|An {{approach}} {{very similar}} to Total Communication was developed by David Denton at the Maryland School for the Deaf in 1967. The term [...] "Total Communication", though, and its specific philosophy, was first used by Roy Holcomb in California. It {{was adopted by the}} Maryland school as the official name for their educational philosophy. TC was supposed to find a middle ground in age-old disputes between oralism and <b>manualism,</b> and as an alternative to Simultaneous Communication. In practice, however, most Total Communication programs use some form of Simultaneous Communication.|$|E
5000|$|John Twomey, also a {{professional}} attorney {{and father of}} 7, appeared on several other programs including The Mike Douglas Show where he performed the [...] "Colonel Bogey March," [...] made famous in the film The Bridge Over the River Kwai, and The Merv Griffin Show where he performed [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In." [...] Twomey's name appeared in the credits of a 1970s Barney Miller episode in which he provided off-camera <b>manualism</b> for {{a scene in which}} a man was arrested for disturbing the peace by [...] "playing" [...] his hands.|$|E
50|$|While {{working at}} Gallaudet University in the 1970s, William Stokoe felt that American Sign Language was a {{language}} {{in its own}} right, with its own independent syntax and grammar. Stokoe classified the language into five parts which included: handshapes, orientation, location, movement, and facial expression, in which much {{of the meaning of}} the sign is clarified as well as the grammar of the sentence expressed. Some sign languages, such as American Sign Language, have been promoted as the traditional way of communication for deaf people. <b>Manualism</b> is combined with oralism as the contemporary technique for the education of deaf students.|$|E
5000|$|Before the Clarke School for the Deaf {{made its}} mark in deaf American {{education}} in the 1860s, there was a popular support of <b>manualism.</b> Manual language soon became a less popular chose for deaf education due to the new Darwinist perspective. Clarke School for the Deaf in 1867 became a [...] "mainstream service" [...] for deaf students through creating a [...] "learn to listen" [...] mentality. This was done through the proper training of educators in auditory/oral education. Since its start, Clarke School for the Deaf has expanded and provided support to the oralism movement within deaf education and policy.|$|E
50|$|Support for oralism gained {{momentum}} in the late 1860s {{and the use of}} <b>manualism</b> started to decrease. Many in the hearing community were now in favor of the evolutionary perspective, which depicted deaf people who used manual language akin to “lower animals”. Some hearing people viewed speech as what separated humans from animals, which in turn caused manual language to be viewed as unhumanlike. The first schools for oralism opened in the 1860s were called The New York Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf Mutes and The Clarke Institution for Deaf-Mutes (now the Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech).|$|E
5000|$|John Twomey is a manualist who {{appeared}} on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1972 and 1974. He {{is credited with}} bringing <b>manualism</b> to the public stage, as his performance of [...] "Stars and Stripes Forever" [...] was seen by millions of people and {{was included in the}} Best of Johnny Carson collection. Twomey also coined the term [...] "manualism," [...] as he introduced himself as a [...] "manualist" [...] in the show. Twomey was a regular guest of Johnny's after that first appearance all the way until Johnny retired from The Tonight Show.|$|E
50|$|For {{most of the}} {{remainder}} of the century, education of deaf children speaking sign language, a practice known as <b>manualism,</b> continued to grow. Approximately forty percent of all teachers were deaf. More than thirty schools for the deaf were opened, the majority of which were manual. William Willard was the first deaf superintendent in America and founded Indiana School for the Deaf in 1843. Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University) was founded in Washington, D.C in 1864 with Thomas Gallaudet's son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, as the school's superintendent. Edward Miner Gallaudet strongly believed in speaking sign language and had a number of arguments with Alexander Graham Bell, an oralist.|$|E
5000|$|Prof. Michael Ndurumo is a deaf Kenyan {{educated in}} the United States who {{advocated}} the use of SEE in 1985 while working for the Kenya Institute of Education (KIE). [...] He was {{a supporter of the}} use of sign language in classrooms. This led to the Ministry of Education’s formation of Machakos School for the Deaf where Ndurumo incorporated the ASL manual alphabet and the total communication method. Total communication is a mixture of oralism and <b>manualism,</b> and incorporates the use of the individual’s specific vocabulary, sign language, fingerspelling, speech and lip reading, manually coded language and other forms of communication to teach at an individual level for students.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the course}} of their two decades-long career, The Aquabats have {{experienced}} several radical evolutions in their sound and musical style.Having originally formed as a part of Orange County's burgeoning third wave ska scene, much of the band's early material was rooted in the genre.

5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of formal deaf education {{in the eighteenth century}} in the United States, <b>manualism</b> and oralism have been on opposing sides of a heated debate that continues to this day. [...] Oralism as the systematic education of deaf people began in Spain in the mid-1500s and was the byproduct of socioeconomic motives. The church barred deaf people from holy communion because they could not confess aloud. Deaf people were also prohibited from inheriting their family's wealth; therefore, to preserve the family wealth, deaf heirs in Spain were sent to Pedro Ponce de Leon after hearing that he taught a deaf man to talk in San Salvador Monastery in Oña. Oralism provided members of the privileged classes with deaf children a way to channel their children's education and an opportunity to keep them away from the deaf community. Speaking has been equated with the higher classes and higher intellect, signing with the lower.|$|E

5000|$|The use of MCE in deaf {{education}} is controversial. Contemporary deaf education can favor {{one of three}} streams - sign language, MCE, and oralism - {{or a combination of}} two or all three. Some opponents of MCE note that the use of MCE often occurs with an attempt to deny or replace the natural languages of the deaf community, which are seen as retarding the child's chances of acquiring of 'good English'. Conversely, these opponents argue, to deny a deaf child access to a natural sign language is to deny the child access to language in general - that exposing a deaf child to an awkward, unnatural coding of an oral language is no substitute for fundamental natural language acquisition - and that a child must be fully exposed to natural language early in order have the best command of any language later. (That is, a deaf child must be fully exposed to a sign language, and denying this exposure prevents the learning of language at the age when it is crucial for mental development.) Also, they argue that the supplanting of native languages is a form of colonialism. In the <b>manualism</b> vs. oralism debate, some forms of MCE are opposed by oralists who believe that even manual English lessens the motivation for children to learn to speak and speechread. Within the signing Deaf Community in the UK use of manually coded English in social settings outside of {{education is}} sometimes regarded as [...] "old fashioned" [...] and characteristic of older people (who grew up during the repression of sign languages in the educational system).|$|E
40|$|Many Deaf {{people today}} {{consider}} themselves a linguistic minority with a culture {{distinct from the}} mainstream hearing society. This is {{in large part because}} they communicate through an independent language——American Sign Language (ASL). However, two hundreds years ago, sign language was a “common language” for communication between hearing and deaf people within the institutional framework of “manualism. ” <b>Manualism</b> is a pedagogical system of sign language introduced mainly from France in order to buttress the campaign for deaf education in the early- 19 th-century America. In 1817, a hearing man Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet (1787 - 1851) and a deaf Frenchman Laurent Clerc (1785 - 1869) co-founded the first residential school for the deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. These early manualists shaped sign language within the evangelical framework of “moral government. ” They believed that the divine origin of signs would lead the spiritual redemption of people who could not hear. Inside manual institutions, the religiously defined practice of signing, which claimed to transform the “heathen deaf” into being the “signing Christian,” enabled the process of assimilation into a shared “signing community. ” The rapid expansion of manual institutions hence fostered a strong and separate deaf culture that continues to influence today’s deaf communities in the United States. However, social reformers in the mid-nineteenth century who advocated “oralism” perceived <b>manualism</b> as a threat to social integration. “Oralists” pursued a different model of deaf education in the 1860 s, campaigning against sign language and hoping to replace it entirely with the skills in lip-reading and speech. The exploration of this tension leads to important questions: Were people who could not hear “(dis) abled” in the religious context of the early United States? In what ways did the manual institutions train students to become “able-bodied” citizens? How did this religiously framed pedagogy {{come to terms with the}} “hearing line” in the mid 19 th century? In answering these questions, this dissertation analyzes the early history of manual education in relation to the formation and diffusion of religious governmentality, a topic that continues to influence deaf culture to this day. published_or_final_versionModern Languages and CulturesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
