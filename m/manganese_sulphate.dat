Similarly, the 2003 NICNAS report ruled that the airborne concentrations of manganese {{as a result of}} car emissions from vehicles using fuel containing MMT poses no health hazard.|$|E
30|$|Adsorption {{increased}} {{in the presence of}} <b>manganese</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions, but higher manganese concentrations inhibited Cu sorption. The presence of sulphates, at concentrations similar to those tested here, is therefore likely to increase adsorption of Cu, Mn and U from AMD while manganese may have antagonistic effects on Cu removal by maghemite.|$|R
30|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} revealed a paucity of information on metal removal by NPs in mine drainage conditions. The pH in AMD, for example, is often ≤ 3 and adsorption in such extreme pH is different from pH 6 at which many studies are conducted. Further, AMD contains additional ions such as <b>manganese</b> and <b>sulphates</b> that are likely to affect the adsorption efficiency of NPs and any remediation technology applied. <b>Manganese</b> and <b>sulphates</b> are abundant in mine drainage, being the products of pyrite (FeS 2) and MnS oxidation (Schemel et al. 2000). However, unlike ferric ions that are also abundant but precipitate at low pH, manganese persists in solution over a wide range of pH and may therefore have an effect on adsorption of other cations. The successful treatment of AMD using NPs requires that these effects are quantified to improve the optimal functioning of remediation technologies.|$|R

50|$|A large Canadian {{study from}} 2002 (funded by automakers, {{who are against}} its use) {{concluded}} that MMT impairs the effectiveness of automobile emission controls and increases pollution from motor vehicles. However, a later study by the Canadian government found that “no Notice of Defect {{was found to be}} potentially caused by MMT.” Many studies have been undertaken over time that confirmed the use of mmt is compatible with vehicles and safe for human health and the environment. In particular, a 2013 risk assessment on MMT was undertaken by ARCADIS Consulting, following a methodology developed by the European Commission. This risk assessment was verified by an independent panel and found by the EU Commission to be compliant with their methodology. It concluded that “when MMT is used as a fuel additive in petrol, no significant human health or environmental concerns related to exposure to either MMT or its transformation combustion products (manganese phosphate, <b>manganese</b> <b>sulphate</b> and manganese tetroxide) were identified even in locations where mmt is approved for use at levels up to 18 mg Mn/l.” As stated by Health Canada in their risk assessment on the widespread use of MMT in Canadian gasoline, “all analyses indicate that the combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the Canadian population” MMT is manufactured by reduction of bis(methylcyclopentadienyl) manganese using triethylaluminium. The reduction is conducted under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide.MMT is a so-called half-sandwich compound, or more specifically a piano-stool complex (since the three CO ligands are like the legs of a piano stool). The manganese atom in MMT is coordinated with three carbonyl groups {{as well as to the}} methylcyclopentadienyl ring. These hydrophobic organic ligands make MMT highly lipophilic, which may increase bioaccumulation. While the structure of mmt suggests lipophilicity and potential to bioaccumulate, comparison of bioconcentration factors (BCF) reported for plant and animal species in comparison to regulatory-based cutoffs (i.e., US EPA and EU REACH) indicates a low bioaccumulative potential of mmt. Figures 2 and 3 of the study (pages 182 & 184) shows the BCF plotted against time and illustrates the potential BCF of mmt. From these figures, the upper curve (A) demonstrates the 9-day mmt BCF plateauing at approximately 400 in plants and 200 in fish, with both values well below the Bioaccumulative/very Bioaccumulative (B/vB) thresholds of US EPA, EU REACH and Environment & Climate Change Canada. A variety of related complexes are known, including ferrocene, which is also under consideration as an additive to gasoline.|$|E

Adsorption of all three ions was rapid, and equilibrium was attained in 5  min or less. 56  % of Cu, 53  % of Mn and 49  % of U were adsorbed. In addition, adsorption efficiencies were enhanced by ≥ 10  % {{in the presence of}} <b>manganese</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions, although Cu sorption was reduced in 1 : 2 Cu-to-Mn solutions. Adsorption also increased with pH: 86  % Cu, 62  % Mn and 77  % U were removed from solution at pH 9 and increasing initial metal concentrations. Increasing NP concentrations did not, however, always increase metal removal. Kinetics data were best described by a pseudo-second-order model, implying chemisorption, while isotherm data were better fitted by the Freundlich model. Metal removal by NPs was then tested in AMD-contaminated surface and ground water. Removal efficiencies of up to 46  % for Cu and 54  % for Mn in surface water and 8  % for Cu and 50  % for Mn in ground water were achieved, confirming that maghemite NPs can be applied for the removal of these ions from AMD-contaminated waters. Notably, whereas sulphates may increase adsorption efficiencies, high Mn concentrations in AMD will likely inhibit Cu sorption.|$|R

The problem remained unresolved for 7 months, provoking community protests and eventually court action against the Department of Water Affairs. Although evidence pointed to coal mining {{as the source of}} contamination, it was unclear how the dam became polluted so rapidly. We investigated the events surrounding the contamination of Carolina's water supply, in an attempt to identify a possible cause and to assess whether the event has relevance for other dams in the Vaal River system. Chemical analyses of water samples revealed that the pollution originated from the Witrandspruit subcatchment where seepage from coal mines had accumulated in a wetland upstream of the dam. During an unusually heavy downpour, ponds holding polluted run-off from coal handling facilities overtopped and flushed the contents of the wetland into the Boesmanspruit Dam. While a recurrence of the event at Carolina is possible, major dams in the upper Vaal River catchment are unlikely to experience a similar catastrophic event. In the long term, pollution of these dams is likely to proceed gradually, as is currently occurring at the Middelburg and Witbank Dams...|$|R
