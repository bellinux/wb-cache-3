This burgeoning new nightlife scene is shaped by Jordan's young population. In addition to {{the wide range of}} drinking and dancing venues on the social circuit of the city's affluent crowd, Amman hosts cultural entertainment events, including the annual Amman Summer Festival. Souk Jara is a Jordanian annual weekly flea <b>market</b> <b>event</b> that occurs every Friday throughout the summer.

40|$|<b>Marketing</b> <b>event</b> {{optimization}} We {{present an}} algorithm for performing multi-channel <b>marketing</b> <b>event</b> optimization. Previous related work, which {{made use of}} a complex mixed-integer linear program to generate a marketing plan, was capable of providing plans for only groups of individuals, referred to as micro-segments, and considered only the direct mail channel. Today, most firms use multiple channels, such as e-mail, call centers, and direct mail, to contact customers with <b>marketing</b> <b>events.</b> Our method successfully overcomes many past restrictions and reduces the run time for the marketing scenarios so that computation can take place on a daily basis. The algorithm used is an advanced form of a greedy heuristic which—given a set of <b>marketing</b> <b>events</b> by channel, a set of individuals, some constraints, and the concepts of saturation and cannibalization—determines the optimal set of <b>marketing</b> <b>events</b> to present to an individual customer. The algorithm is embedded in a solution {{that is designed to}} operate as an interactive what-if scenario planner, or as a batchoriented job that can continually maintain each customer’s future contact plans in an optimal fashion...|$|R

This thesis presents a statistical method for finding financial <b>market</b> <b>events</b> using a maximum entropy model. A maximum entropy approach is presented to model an empirical matrix of daily stock returns while retaining its non-stationarity and heterogeneity. All speci cations of this maximum entropy model can be {{expressed in terms of}} the measurable properties of the matrix of daily stock returns. Closed form solutions of the expected moments, auto- and cross-correlations of the time series in the model, as well as the expected eigenvalue of the correlation matrix, are calculated. Using the maximum entropy model a method is constructed to detect financial <b>market</b> <b>events.</b> Here, a binary classifier is used based on the statistical significance of the empirical data calculated using the probability distribution function of the maximum entropy model. We find that the method is able to distinguish financial <b>market</b> <b>events</b> from non-events in historical data...|$|R
