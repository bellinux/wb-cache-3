40|$|Mucinous {{carcinoma}} is {{also known}} as <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> colloid carcinoma, gelatinous carcinoma and mucin producing carcinoma. They are uncommon neoplasms of the breast and the reported incidence varies from 1 - 4 %. Most of the mucinous carcinomas occur in older age group. FNAC can aid in diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma with only a few FNAC studies documented in literature. We present here a 56 year old lady with a huge ulcerated breast mass clinically diagnosed as Malignant Phyllodes tumor. An FNAC was done which showed epithelial cell clusters with mild atypia in a background of both bluish violet and pink extracellular material. Spindle shaped cells were noted in the ground substance which led to a diagnosis of a phyllodes tumor with extensive myxoid change. Mastectomy was performed and the histopathological features confirmed a diagnosis of mucinous carcinoma. The tumor had areas showing thick collagenized fibrous septae separating tumor cell clusters and also areas of fibrosis. The pitfall in FNAC diagnosis {{may be due to the}} sampling from such an area...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{comprehensive}} retrospective analysis of 1341 gastric neoplasms out of 10 733 individuals subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the main teaching cum referral hospital in the Kashmir Valley. Of these 78 % were males and 22 % females, majority being in {{the age group of}} 41 – 60 years with 60 % of the patients being smokers. On endoscopy, the commonest site of cancer was the body of stomach 40. 7 %, followed by the antrum 35. 5 % and the cardiac region 23. 8 %. Endoscopic features revealed nodular masses 39 %, polypoid masses 21 %, malignant ulcers 11 %, infiltrative masses 12 %, rounded tumor masses 9 %, linitus plastica 5 % and early gastric carcinoma 3 %. Histology revealed adenocarcinoma 91 %, (including <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> 9 %, and schirrous carcinoma 7 %), leiomyosarcoma 7 %, and reticulum cell sarcoma 2 %. No significant association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer was observed in a short study out of these patients. The peculiar geography and some special dietary habits with a possible familial predisposition may have a bearing on the high risk of gastric cancer in the valley...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome 13 q {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as the site of}} a gene predisposing to human breast cancer, because loss of heterozygosity of alleles on this chromosome has been observed in some ductal breast tumors and because two breast cancer lines are altered at the retinoblastoma gene (RB 1) at 13 q 14. To test this possibility, linkage of breast cancer susceptibility to 14 loci on chromosome 13 q loci was assessed in extended families in which breast cancer is apparently inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. RB 1 was excluded as the site of a breast cancer gene by a lod score of Z = - 7. 60 at close linkage for 13 families. Multipoint analysis yielded negative lod scores throughout the region between 13 q 12 and 13 q 34; over most of this distance, Z less than - 2. 0. Therefore, chromosome 13 q appears to be excluded as the site of primary lesion for breast cancer in these families. In addition, comparison of tumor versus normal tissues of nonfamilial breast cancer patients revealed an alteration at the 5 ' end of RB 1 in a <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> but no alterations of RB 1 in five informative ductal adenocarcinomas. Linkage data and comparisons of tumor and normal tissues suggest that changes in the RBI locus either are secondary alterations associated with progression of some tumors or occur by chance...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of 73 {{patients}} with <b>mucoid</b> breast <b>carcinomas</b> treated at Guy's Hospital between 1973 and 1989, 24 (33 %) patients had pure mucoid lesions and 49 (67 %) had mixed <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> The patients with pure mucoid cancers had significantly smaller tumours and, among those in whom an axillary dissection was performed, mixed mucoid cancers {{were more likely to}} be associated with axillary nodal metastases (46 % vs 14 %). After long-term follow-up of 64 patients, both relapse-free and overall survival were significantly better for those with pure <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> for whom the 10 -year actuarial overall survival was 100 %. The overall proportion of the tumour that was mucoid was also positively associated with a more favourable prognosis in patients with mixed tumours. With such a good prognosis, patients with pure <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinomas</b> may not require systemic adjuvant therapy after adequate primary treatment...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION:Desmocollin 3 (DSC 3) is {{a member}} of the cadherin {{superfamily}} of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules and a principle component of desmosomes. Desmosomal proteins such as DSC 3 are integral to the maintenance of tissue architecture and the loss of these components leads to a lack of adhesion and a gain of cellular mobility. DSC 3 expression is down-regulated in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumorshowever, the loss of DSC 3 is not due to gene deletion or gross rearrangement of the gene. In this study, we examined the prevalence of epigenetic silencing of DSC 3 gene expression in primary breast tumor specimens. METHODS:We used bisulfite genomic sequencing to analyze the methylation state of the DSC 3 promoter region from 32 primary breast tumor specimens. We also used a quantitative real-time RT-PCR approach, and analyzed all breast tumor specimens for DSC 3 expression. Finally, in addition to bisulfite sequencing and RT-PCR, we used an in vivo nuclease accessibility assay to determine the chromatin architecture of the CpG island region from DSC 3 -negative breast cancer cells lines. RESULTS:DSC 3 expression was downregulated in 23 of 32 (72 %) breast cancer specimens comprising: 22 invasive ductal carcinomas, 7 invasive lobular breast carcinomas, 2 invasive ductal carcinomas that metastasized to the lymph node, and a <b>mucoid</b> ductal <b>carcinoma.</b> Of the 23 specimens showing a loss of DSC 3 expression, 13 (56 %) were associated with cytosine hypermethylation of the promoter region. Furthermore, DSC 3 expression is limited to cells of epithelial origin and its expression of mRNA and protein is lost in a high proportion of breast tumor cell lines (79 %). Lastly, DNA hypermethylation of the DSC 3 promoter is highly correlated with a closed chromatin structure. CONCLUSION:These results indicate that the loss of DSC 3 expression is a common event in primary breast tumor specimens, and that DSC 3 gene silencing in breast tumors is frequently linked to aberrant cytosine methylation and concomitant changes in chromatin structure...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} proved that protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase type IVAmember 3 (PTP 4 A 3, PRL- 3) {{plays a major}} role in the metastasis of gastric cancer, especially to local lymph nodes. The objective of the current study was to assess the expression of PTP 4 A 3 in gastric cancer in correlation with chosen anatomoclinical parameters and patients' survival. Atotal of 71 patients with gastric carcinomas were divided according to Lauren's, Goseki's, Bormann's and Kubo's classifications. The level of PTP 4 A 3 was determined immunohistochemically using a mouse monoclonal anti-PTP 4 A 3 antibody (clone 3 B 6, anti-human PTP 4 A 3, Attogen Biomedical Research, USA). A statistically significant correlation was observed between PTP 4 A 3 and Kubo's classifications (p= 0. 0454) and on the verge of statistical significance with Lauren's classification (p= 0. 0503). The expression of the protein was associated more with the poorly-differentiated <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and diffused-type carcinoma (58 % of cases). We demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between local lymph node involvement and positive expression of PTP 4 A 3 in the primary tumour (p= 0. 0000). The current study seems to prove that PTP 4 A 3 may have a significant impact on the lymphatic spread of gastric carcinoma. The protein expression is also significantly associated with gastric carcinomas having a worse prognosis, although patients' survival rate showed lack of correlation with PTP 4 A 3 expression...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rectal cancer {{accounts}} for the largest distribution within one anatomical region of the large bowel, with approximately one third of all CRC located within the rectum. The Golden standard treatment of primary rectal cancer is curative surgical resection; however, a fine balance remains between disease cure and restoration of gastrointestinal continuity. Combined modality has proven efficacy in many malignant tumors with advantage of organ preservation. Methods: Forty nine (49) patients with low rectal carcinoma were included in a prospective study, between Jan 2007 and Jan 2012. Preoperative chemoradiation was administrated to all patients and subjected to different techniques of sphincter saving surgery. Stage I and Stage IV disease at diagnosis {{were excluded from the}} study. Results: Forty nine patients were included in the study. 27 (55 %) patients were male and 22 (45 %) were female; the age range s from 23 years to 70 years with the median age 46 years. The main presenting symptoms were bleeding per rectum and tenesmus, Stage II 18 patients (36. 7 %), stage III 31 patients (63. 3 %). Complete clinical and pathological response in 3 patients (6 %), and complete clinical response with only microscopically residual carcinoma in 20 patients (41 %), partial response in 18 patients (36. 7 %), and no significant response in 8 patients (16 %) 7 from 8 were <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Low anterior resection (LAR) in 22 patients (44. 9 %), Hartman’s procedure in 4 patients (8. 1 %), Coloanal pull-through (COP) was done in 19 patients (38. 9 %) and perineal colostomy in 4 patients (8. 1 %). For patients with colo-anal pull-through technique complete dehiscent and retraction observed in 2 cases, Major leakage in one case, stenosis in 4 cases. Conclusion: There is tendency of colorectal cancers to affect younger groups. Most patients presented in advanced stage. Neadjuvant chemo radiation is an excellent tool in sphincter saving surgery. Coloanal pull-through technique is not a wide ly spread technique for low rectal cancer with good oncological safety and acceptable functional outcome. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gap {{junctional}} {{intercellular communication}} (GJIC) {{has been proposed}} as a cellular mechanism for tumour suppression and there is experimental {{evidence in support of}} this. If aberrant GJIC contributes to the formation of human breast tumours, one might expect that the connexins (gap junction proteins) expressed by epithelial cells in normal human breast would be down-regulated in tumour epithelial cells, or that tumour cells might show aberrant expression of other connexin family members. This study examines the immunocytochemical expression of connexins 26 (Cx 26) and 43 (Cx 43) in normal human breast, 11 benign breast lesions, two special-type carcinomas, and 27 invasive carcinomas of no special histological type (NST). Cx 26 generally was not expressed at detectable levels in normal human breast, but punctate Cx 43 immunostaining of the myoepithelial cells was found. Cx 43 staining of the myoepithelium was also a feature of the benign lesions and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In general, the epithelial cells of benign lesions failed to stain for either connexin. Similarly, a lobular carcinoma did not express Cx 26 or Cx 43, but there was punctate Cx 43 in the epithelial cells of a <b>mucoid</b> <b>carcinoma.</b> Cx 26 was up-regulated in the carcinoma cells of 15 of the 27 invasive NST carcinomas, although the staining was usually cytoplasmic and heterogeneous. Cx 43 was expressed by stromal cells, possibly myofibroblasts, in all NST carcinomas. Furthermore, there was heterogeneous Cx 43 expression in the carcinoma cells of 14 of the 27 NST carcinomas and the staining was often intercellular and punctate, characteristic of functional connexins. Up-regulation of Cx 26 and/or Cx 43 in the carcinoma cells of over two-thirds of invasive lesions of NST is not necessarily inconsistent with a tumour suppressor role for GJIC. However, the role of gap junctions in the formation and progression of solid human tumours is likely to be more complex than indicated from experimental systems...|$|E
