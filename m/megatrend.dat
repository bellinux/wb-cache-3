40|$|Background: <b>Megatrends</b> are {{long-lasting}} global {{developments in}} society, technology, economy and political conditions that their effects are {{not restricted to}} a particular geographic area. In future studies, <b>megatrends</b> in social, technology, environment, politics, and values (STEEP-V) should be considered. Material and Methods: The <b>megatrends</b> shaping healthcare {{in the new millennium}} were selected from the future studies. Trend analysis (macro to micro approach) was used to emerge key fields of action or areas of innovation in healthcare and related technologies that might be reflected in the health policies of I. R.

High capacities for innovation in emerging health technologies, policies for health insurance, paradigm shift from volume to value in healthcare delivery, and infrastructure for participatory medicine were found in the health policies of I.

However, more emphasis should be paid on mobile health (m-Health), medical tourism, community-based medicine, systems medicine, personalized medicine, transformation of big data to knowledge and geriatric health in the health policies of I.
