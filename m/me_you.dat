25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E

25|$|Heywood's {{first play}} {{may have been}} The Four Prentises of London (printed 1615, but acted some fifteen years earlier). This tale of four {{apprentices}} who become knights and travel to Jerusalem may have been intended as a burlesque of the old romances, {{but it is more}} likely that it was meant seriously to attract the apprentice spectators to whom it was dedicated. Its popularity was satirized in Beaumont and Fletcher's travesty of the middle-class taste in drama, The Knight of the Burning Pestle. Heywood's two-part history plays Edward IV (printed 1600), and If You Know Not <b>Me,</b> <b>You</b> Know Nobody, or, The Troubles of Queene Elizabeth (1605 and 1606) concern, respectively, The Wars of the Roses and the life of the Queen contrasted with that of the preeminent merchant and financier Thomas Gresham.|$|E
25|$|Like in English, Dutch has {{generalised}} the dative {{over the}} accusative case for all pronouns, e.g. Du me, je, Eng <b>me,</b> <b>you,</b> vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir. There is one exception: the standard language prescribes {{that in the}} third person plural, hen is to be used for the direct object, and hun for the indirect object. This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians, and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers. Consequently, the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage, with hun being more common. The shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use.|$|E

A sequence similar to the Zapruder film, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with Jacqueline Kennedy also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a political cartoon.
