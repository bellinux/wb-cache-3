5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the <b>murders,</b> <b>and</b> was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family <b>murders,</b> <b>and</b> prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|The {{link between}} the <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> Child's Play 3 by the news media {{directly}} led to the delay of the release certification for both Natural Born Killers and Reservoir Dogs.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea of the}} book was proposed to García Márquez by the former minister for education Maruja Pachón Castro and Colombian diplomat Luis Alberto Villamizar Cárdenas, {{both of whom were}} among the many victims of a Pablo Escobar's attempt to pressure the government to stop his extradition by committing a series of kidnappings, <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> terrorist actions.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the <b>murders,</b> <b>and</b> the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the <b>murders,</b> <b>and</b> that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} {{that they would}} be killed {{as a result of the}} <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> insisted they were willing to die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope and ski masks at Walmart to use in a robbery or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E

5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he claims, {{is due to}} a government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual <b>murders,</b> <b>and</b> accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
5|$|Full Disclosure Report is a 2005 mockumentary, pseudo-documentary {{set in the}} Saw franchise, {{taking place}} between the events of Saw and Saw II, around {{one year after the}} {{beginning}} of the Jigsaw murders, following television host Rich Skidmore as he commentates on the <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> the police work in the-yet unresolved case. Donnie Wahlberg appears as Detective Eric Matthews, prior to his appearance in Saw II.|$|E

5|$|His admissions {{were not}} {{produced}} by oppression or coercive conduct {{on the part}} of the Gardaí. Neither were the admissions produced as a result of anything in the nature of a bribe or inducement. There was no deliberate attempt to frame Dean Lyons. However, Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to the manner in which he was interviewed by gardaí. He wished to associate himself with the <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí.|$|E
5|$|In the announcement, McHugh {{denied that}} the move was made in {{response}} to several high-profile misconduct allegations leveled against soldiers from the base in the Afghanistan War such as the Maywand District <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> the Kandahar massacre.

Lanza became Commanding General of I Corps in 2014.|$|E

50|$|On October 29, 2009, {{the jury}} {{returned}} 44 guilty verdicts for first degree <b>murder</b> <b>and</b> four for manslaughter, {{believed to be}} the largest number of murder convictions ever produced from a single criminal proceeding in Canada.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 March 1997, Sylvia Sheils and Mary Callinan were found dead in No.1 Orchard View, Grangegorman, Dublin 7. They were found by Ann Mernagh, another {{resident}} of the house, who raised the alarm at No.5 Orchard View. The house was a two story end of terrace house owned by the Eastern Health Board, and was used to provide sheltered accommodation for outpatients of St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital. The entire Orchard View area was completely demolished 15 years after the <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> is now an empty plot surrounded by a wall.|$|E
5|$|Some biographers' {{accounts}} {{speculated that}} the opportunity for {{one or more of}} the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder.

Some guards who had not participated in the <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Sara B. Charno, making it her first writing {{contribution}} to the series. The episode was directed by Rob Bowman. Charno initially developed a story revolving around the concept of 50 year old <b>murders</b> <b>and</b> the transfer of genetic memory. This was later combined with a separate concept about a female serial killer. Glen Morgan and James Wong, who had written for The X-Files before, provided additional contributions to the story. The script was revised shortly before shooting, resulting in newer scenes being added, such as the scene where BJ attacks Mulder.|$|E
