5|$|The <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> at Krečane near Baćin was {{discovered}} in 1997, two years after Croatian authorities recaptured the area in Operation Storm. The <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> contained 56 bodies, 36 of which were identified. The remaining twenty were buried in a common grave at the Catholic cemetery in Hrvatska Dubica.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the takeover of the village by the JNA and the paramilitaries, 1,341 civilians were forced to leave Lovas. The local Roman Catholic church of St. Michael was torched and 261 houses destroyed. In 1995, the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and the gradual restoration of Croatian control in the region was agreed between Croatian authorities and Croatian Serbs in the region through the Erdut Agreement. United Nations experts began exhuming victims from a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> in Lovas on 2 June 1997. Sixty-eight bodies, including those of people killed in Lovas, were ultimately recovered from the <b>mass</b> <b>grave,</b> and ten more were recovered from nearby individual graves. The exhumed victims were reburied on 21 March 1998. A monument to the civilian victims was erected at the site of the <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> on 27 May 1999, as was a cross to mark the location of the minefield. Another <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> containing the bodies of six individuals was discovered in nearby Jelaš Forest, along with three individual graves. Similar to the other burial sites, the victims buried there included those killed in Lovas, as well as others, killed elsewhere in the area. Lovas was rebuilt after the war, but its population declined by one third compared to the pre-war level.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was {{commissioned}} by the U.S. federal government in 1912 to memorialize the 1,616 Confederate soldiers buried in a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> at Indianapolis' Greenlawn Cemetery. When the dead were reinterred at Crown Hill National Cemetery beginning in 1928, the monument was moved to its current location in Garfield Park.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the ousted Yugoslav government. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> for the victims and pour quicklime on the bodies to speed up decomposition. The following day, relatives {{of one of the}} victims informed the Germans of what had transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the <b>mass</b> <b>grave,</b> and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. Mladen Lorković, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador Siegfried Kasche that the Croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Serb forces, the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets. The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed, while 1,341 civilians were forced to leave their homes. The bodies {{of the victims were}} retrieved from a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> and ten individual graves in 1997. Lovas was rebuilt after the war, but its population size shrunk by one third compared to its pre-war level.|$|E

The <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> mostly included the remains of Shia Muslims and ethnic Kurds killed for opposing the regime between 1983 and 1991, she said.|$|R
50|$|The 2011 Durango massacres were {{a series}} of mass murders that {{occurred}} in 2011. According to El Universal and Yahoo! News, at least 340 bodies {{have been found in}} <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> around the city of Durango as of February 2012; These <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> are the first of their kind in the state of Durango and third of their kind in Mexico. These <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> had more bodies than the 2011 Tamaulipas massacre of 189 bus passengers. Since April 2011, there have been 7 <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> found around Durango. One of these <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> was found in a vacant auto repair lot in Durango with 89 bodies. One of the bodies identified was Alfonso Peña, the former mayor of Tepehuanes Municipality, Durango.|$|R
5|$|Further killings {{occurred}} on 21 February 1992, when four non-Serb civilians were arrested by Croatian Serb {{forces and the}} SDG and killed in the training centre after being interrogated. The four were subsequently buried in a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> in Daljski Atar. One more Hungarian civilian was murdered by the Serbian State Security Service—with SDG assistance—after inquiring about her relatives {{who were killed in}} November 1991. Her body was thrown down a well in Dalj Planina. With her murder, the total number of civilians killed in Erdut between November 1991 and June 1992 reached 37, of which 22 were Hungarians and 15 were Croats.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he {{was not prepared to}} implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, bodies {{believed}} to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found. Once the grave was opened, the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains (Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, Tsarevitch Alexei, the four Grand Duchesses, Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia; the family's doctor, Yevgeny Botkin; their valet, Alexei Trupp; their cook, Ivan Kharitonov; and Alexandra's maid, Anna Demidova) the grave held only nine. Alexei and, according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples, Anastasia were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this, however, and claimed it was Maria's body that was missing. The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the <b>mass</b> <b>grave.</b> They estimated {{the height and width}} of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact. A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did.|$|E
25|$|Some of the sites, {{such as the}} <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> in Maribor, {{include some}} of the largest <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> in Europe. Nearly 600 such sites have been {{registered}} by the Commission on Concealed <b>Mass</b> <b>Graves</b> in Slovenia, containing the remains of up to 100,000 victims.

5|$|In October 1998, three {{bodies were}} {{retrieved}} from a well in Erdut. Days later, more bodies were retrieved from a well in Daljski Atar, where {{a total of}} 23 victims were found. A total of 32 sets of human remains were recovered {{in the village of}} Ćelije by 2012.

5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{rumors of}} her {{possible}} escape circulated after her death, {{fueled by the}} fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of Communist rule. The <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> near Yekaterinburg which held the remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991, and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007. Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved. Forensic analysis and DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918.|$|E

5|$|The Baćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 83 civilians just outside the village of Baćin, near Hrvatska Dubica, committed by Croatian Serb paramilitaries. The killings took place on 21 October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Most of the civilians were Croats, but they also included two ethnic Serbs, taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Baćin and the nearby village of Cerovljani. The civilians {{were killed in the}} area of Krečane, at the very bank of the Una River, and their bodies were left unburied for two weeks. Most of them were subsequently bulldozed into a shallow <b>mass</b> <b>grave,</b> while a number of the bodies were thrown into the river.|$|E
5|$|When Andersen {{returned}} to Norway after the German surrender in 1945, {{he had hoped}} to reunite with his wife Ruth. Instead, he discovered that his wife had been arrested by the Germans on 9 May 1944. She had been taken to Møllergata 19, tortured during her captivity and executed at Grini detention camp by Sonderkommando Hans on 21 July 1944 together with five others. They were buried in a <b>mass</b> <b>grave</b> but her body was exhumed and identified on 25 May 1945. Ruth's sister together with Ruth's friend Hertha Bergstrøm organized a proper funeral.

50|$|The debate {{surrounding}} <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> amongst epidemiologists includes {{whether or}} not, {{in a natural}} disaster, to leave corpses for traditional individual burials, or to bury corpses in <b>mass</b> <b>graves.</b> For example, if an epidemic occurs during winter, flies {{are less likely to}} infest corpses, reducing the risk of outbreaks of dysentery, diarrhea, diphtheria, or tetanus, so the use of <b>mass</b> <b>graves</b> is less important. A research published in 2004 indicates that the health risks from dead bodies after natural disasters are relatively limited.|$|R
