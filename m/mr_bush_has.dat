50|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> {{started a}} new and ugly cold war and he clearly intends to {{transform}} it into a hot one, sooner rather than later; the media and political hype will translate into real aggression, bringing death, misery and destruction to yet another Middle East state.

2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill Clinton {{did not have a}} {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the Clinton administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> could <b>have</b> done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> was." ...|$|R

5000|$|On August 11, 2005, President George W. Bush {{announced}} {{his intention to}} nominate John J. Danilovich to be the second Chief Executive Officer of the MCC [...] following an initial period of what many {{considered to be a}} slow and rocky start for the corporation. [...] The Wall Street Journal opined that the “effort is in trouble. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> sought far less funding for his Millennium Challenge Corp. than he initially promised to request from Congress; lawmakers have given even less money than he has requested; the agency has awarded grants to just five countries, and critics say those it has given are too small to alter the fortunes of the recipients. This means that John Danilovich, the former oil shipping executive and Republican activist who took over the agency this week, figures he has less than nine months to restore its reputation — and, in the view of its supporters, save it from becoming a footnote in America’s efforts to fight poverty overseas.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} two {{paragraphs}} of his op-ed, Wilson relates his perspective to the Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War:I was convinced before the war {{that the threat of}} weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein required a vigorous and sustained international response to disarm him. Iraq possessed and had used chemical weapons; it had an active biological weapons program and quite possibly a nuclear research program—all of which were in violation of United Nations resolutions. Having encountered Mr. Hussein and his thugs in the run-up to the Persian Gulf war of 1991, I was only too aware of the dangers he posed.But were these dangers the same ones the administration told us about? We have to find out. America's foreign policy depends on the sanctity of its information. For this reason, questioning the selective use of intelligence to justify the war in Iraq is neither idle sniping nor [...] "revisionist history", as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> suggested. The act of war is the last option of a democracy, taken when there is a grave threat to our national security. More than 200 American soldiers have lost their lives in Iraq already. We have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a column}} {{published}} {{six months before}} the Iraq invasion titled [...] "Wimps on Iraq", Kristof stated [...] "To us the existing Iraq debate seems largely beside the point; the real issue isn't whether we want to overthrow Saddam, but what price we would have to pay to get the job done." [...] In the same column, he wrote, [...] "President Bush has convinced me that there is no philosophical reason we should not overthrow the Iraqi government, given that Iraqis themselves would be better off, {{along with the rest of}} the world. But <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> not overcome some practical concerns about an invasion." [...] He concludes, after detailing five practical concerns about invading Iraq, [...] "So if Mr. Bush were really addressing these concerns, weighing them and then concluding that on balance it's worth an invasion, I'd be reassured. But instead it looks as if the president, intoxicated by moral clarity, has decided that whatever the cost, whatever the risks, he will invade Iraq." [...] In a column entitled [...] "The Day After" [...] in September 2002, during a reporting visit to Iraq, he declared: [...] "In one Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy, and perhaps a drift toward civil war. For the last few days, I've been traveling in these Shiite cities—Karbala, Najaf and Basra—and the tension in the bazaars is thicker than the dust behind the donkey carts. So before we rush into Iraq, we need to think through what we will do the morning after Saddam is toppled. Do we send in troops to try to seize the mortars and machine guns from the warring factions? Or do we run from civil war, and risk letting Iran cultivate its own puppet regime?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{high-profile}} political figures, including Laura Bush, former White House Spokesman Scott McClellan, {{and world}} {{leaders such as}} Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Australian Prime Minister John Howard have also voiced encouragement. Laura <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> perhaps been the strongest proponent of Rice's candidacy. On CNN's The Situation Room on January 17, 2006, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> implicated Rice when asked if she thought the United States would soon have a female president, stating: [...] "I'd love to see her run. She's terrific." [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> then turned to advocacy during an interview on CNN's Larry King Live on March 24, 2006, in which she stated that Rice would make an [...] "excellent president," [...] and that she wished Americans could [...] "talk her into running." [...] However, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> also stated that Rice will not run for president [...] "probably because she is single, her parents are no longer living, she's an only child. You need a very supportive family and supportive friends to have this job." ...|$|R

Hope produced a [...] "spirit" [...] extra which was exactly the same as the photograph he had sent Hope and on it were the words [...] "Dear friend Wood". The psychical researcher Whately Carington wrote regarding the exposure [...] "any reasonable person will say that <b>Mr</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> proved his case." [...] In 1921, Mr DeVaga, a friend of the magician Harry Houdini, attended a sitting with Hope. DeVaga found the dark conditions in the room suspicious and suspected that Hope had switched a plate.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{her sister}} Belle Spore Tunison, [...] "although a woman of varied interests, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> never <b>had</b> the {{slightest}} inclination towards art--either theoretically or in practice--until {{after the death of}} her mother, Mrs. M. L. Spore, in 1919. She gave up her dental practice then and went to Guam to spend six months with her brother, Lieut. Comm. James Sutherland Spore, who was governor general at that time, and there she began her first painting." [...] After some further travels abroad, she settled in New York City and rented a studio in Greenwich Village.|$|R
5000|$|After the 9/11 Commission {{issued its}} report, the Jersey Girls {{pressured}} the Administration to follow its recommendations. They specifically commended the Commission for not politicizing blame in the report. [...] "The USS Cole was bombed under Clinton's watch, and 9/11 happened under Bush's watch," [...] said Rosemary Dillard. [...] "I don't blame either administration; I blame {{the people who}} were reporting to them." [...] As the 2004 election neared, the widows criticized Bush for the failure to enact the recommendations of the commission; many interpreted this as an endorsement of Bush's opponent John Kerry; the New York Times reported, [...] "In a statement clearly meant to influence voters in next week's election, the group did not explicitly endorse Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, but said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> 'allowed members of his own party to derail the legislative process.'" [...] There were other 9/11 victim's families who supported the Bush campaign. For example, Debra Burlingame, whose brother flew in the plane that was crashed into the Pentagon, responded to the widows: [...] "The Jersey Girls criticized President Bush because he wasn't rounding up Arabs in airport lounges before Sept. 11. These are the same people who are now decrying the use of the Patriot Act." ...|$|R

50|$|On 1 May 1780 John Roe {{went through}} a {{marriage}} ceremony, in the meeting house, with Isabel Morris, of the parish of St Mary, Nottingham. Later Elizabeth Morris (sister to Isabel) was similarly joined with Thomas Bush. On 20 April 1785 the churchwardens of St Wilfrids accused Isabel Morris (using her maiden name, rather than Mrs Roe), before the Church Court at Southwell Minster, of having three illegitimate children and Elizabeth Morris (<b>Mrs</b> <b>Bush)</b> of <b>having</b> one such child. The ostensible reason must have been that the illegitimate offspring would become a burden on the parish. The two mothers failed to appear at Southwell to answer the charges, and in February 1786 letters of excommunication against them were issued by the vicar, James Bingham. On Sunday 5 March the curate of Calverton, Ephraim Rogerson read out the order in church. As the two women {{did not apply to}} have the excommunication lifted within forty days, the Archbishop of York asked the Crown to issue writs of excommunicato capiendo to the Civil Courts to imprison the women, and they were taken to the county gaol, without any prospect of ever being released.|$|R

Noelia Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> said: “While <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> respects the right of all Americans to express their opinions, she, too, has opinions and believes {{it would be inappropriate}} to turn a literary event into a political forum.” Parini was disgusted by this decision: [...] "For poets to remain silent at a time of national crisis is unconscionable," [...] he said.
