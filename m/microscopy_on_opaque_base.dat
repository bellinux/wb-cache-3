50|$|Photocathodes {{divide into}} two broad groups; {{transmission}} and reflective. A transmission type is typically a coating upon a glass window {{in which the}} light strikes one surface and electrons exit from the opposite surface. A reflective type is typically formed <b>on</b> an <b>opaque</b> metal electrode <b>base,</b> where the light enters and the electrons exit from the same side. A variation is the double reflection type, where the metal base is mirror-like, causing light that passed through the photocathode without causing emission to be bounced back for a second try. This mimics the retina on many mammals.|$|R
40|$|Rendering {{refractive}} caustics from transparent objects <b>on</b> <b>opaque</b> objects is computationally intensive. This paper {{presents a}} fast rendering technique for transparent objects and refractive caustics due to transparent objects <b>on</b> the <b>opaque</b> object. To calculate {{the intensities of}} caustics, we set virtual planes around the opaque object and store the intensities of caustics on the virtual planes as textures. Caustics are then rendered by using these textures. Our implementation, which additionally uses a GPU accelerator, enables us to render refractive caustics at interactive frame rates. We demonstrate this interactive rendering additionally for translation, rotation of both transparent objects and opaque objects, {{as well as for}} changing light and viewing directions...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{energy saving}} {{potential}} of commercial building by living wall and green façade system using Envelope Thermal Transfer Value (ETTV) equation in Sub-tropical climate of Australia. Energy saving of four commercial buildings was quantified by applying living wall and green façade system to the west facing wall. A field experimental facility, from which temperature data of living wall system was collected, was used to quantify wall temperatures and heat gain under controlled conditions. The experimental parameters were accumulated with extensive data of existing commercial building to quantify energy saving. Based on temperature data of living wall system comprised of Australian native plants, equivalent temperature of living wall system has been computed. Then, shading coefficient of plants in green façade system has been included in mathematical equation and in graphical analysis. To minimize the air-conditioned load of commercial building, therefore to minimize the heat gain of commercial building, an analysis of building heat gain reduction by living wall and green façade system has been performed. Overall, cooling energy performance of commercial building before and after living wall and green façade system application has been examined. The quantified energy saving showed that only living wall system <b>on</b> <b>opaque</b> part of west facing wall can save 8 - 13 % of cooling energy consumption where as only green façade system <b>on</b> <b>opaque</b> part of west facing wall can save 9. 5 - 18 % cooling energy consumption of commercial building. Again, green façade system on fenestration system on west facing wall can save 28 - 35 % of cooling energy consumption where as combination of both living wall <b>on</b> <b>opaque</b> part of west facing wall and green façade on fenestration system on west facing wall can save 35 - 40 % cooling energy consumption of commercial building in sub-tropical climate of Australia...|$|R

This study also examines impacts on a firm's demand and profits by using opaque selling in addition to regular selling from both analytical and empirical perspectives.

50|$|Another ongoing area of {{research}} is to use materials that optically route light in order to re-use {{as much of the}} signal as possible. One potential improvement is to use microprisms or dichromic mirrors to split the light into R, G and B, instead of absorbing the unwanted colors in a filter. A successful system would improve efficiency by three times. Another would be to direct the light that would normally fall <b>on</b> <b>opaque</b> elements back into the transparent portion of the shutters.|$|R
5000|$|PepsiCo {{introduced}} the first two-liter sized soft drink bottle in 1970. The bottle {{was invented by}} {{a team led by}} Nathaniel Wyeth of DuPont, who received the patent in 1973. In 1985, a three-liter bottle appeared on supermarket shelves. The design is still used to this day by some bottlers. Most modern-day two-liter bottles are one piece of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) with a base that is molded with a radial [...] to provide strength for the bottom and the ability to stand upright. Most early two-liters had a separate <b>opaque</b> <b>base</b> glued to the hemispherical bottom of the clear PET flask. This base had a coaxial corrugation and drain holes. It was abolished in the 1990s, in part due to difficulties recycling the two separate plastics.|$|R

50|$|After cleaning, an <b>opaque</b> <b>base</b> coat {{of powder}} {{is applied to}} the glass {{substrate}} as the initial, most important layer of UV protection. Once the powder attracts, the product is heated to activate the process of gelling, which secures the adhesive bond. It is crucial to control the amount of powder that goes on to the surface. With too little, the coating becomes transparent and the protection is diminished. Too much can create a dripping effect or disperse uneven amounts, leading {{to one side of the}} glass container being heavier than the other. In the case of powder coating nail polish and other cosmetics bottles, experienced powder coaters typically use a highly chemical-resistant form of powder, which makes it impervious to the aggressive chemicals inherent with polish and primer.|$|R

Positive sepia prints, generally made <b>on</b> <b>opaque</b> paper, were typically used {{as an alternative to}} positive blueline Diazo prints.|$|R
