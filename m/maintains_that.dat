Some ontologists <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> there are no composite material objects at all. Some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> organisms are the only composite material objects.

50|$|The term {{electronic}} {{civil disobedience}} and hacktivism {{may be used}} synonymously, although some commentators <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> {{the difference is that}} ECD actors don’t hide their names, while most hacktivists wish to remain anonymous. Some commentators <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> ECD uses only legal means, as opposed to illegal actions used by hacktivists. It is also <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> hacktivism is done by individuals rather than by specific groups. In reality the distinction between ECD and hacktivism is not clear.|$|R
5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; he <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society {{in an effort to}} improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot {{met with}} Aruban {{investigators}} in the Netherlands and denied {{that what he}} said on the tape was true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time.

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5000|$|While some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Christ merely {{descended into}} the [...] "limbo of the fathers", others, notably theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (inspired by the visions of Adrienne von Speyr), <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> {{it was more}} than this and that the descent {{involved}} suffering by Jesus. [...] Some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> this is a matter on which differences and theological speculation are permissible without transgressing the limits of orthodoxy. However, Balthasar's point here has been forcefully condemned by conservative Catholic outlets.|$|R

5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E

Hines Interests, the property management firm for the building, gives a floor count of 74, while architect Skidmore, Owings and Merrill gives a floor count of 75. Emporis and other building database sites usually give the floor count as 70, while other sources state 73 stories. This table uses the floor count of 73 as stated officially by the building's owner.|$|E
50|$|Many authors <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the pre-tribulation rapture {{doctrine}} {{originated in}} the eighteenth century, with the Puritan preachers Increase and Cotton Mather, and was then popularized in the 1830s by John Darby.

50|$|Zhu Xi <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> {{all things}} are brought into being by the union of two {{universal}} aspects of reality: qi, sometimes translated as vital (or physical, material) force; and li, sometimes translated as rational principle (or law). The source and sum of li is the Taiji (Wade-Giles: T‘ai Chi), meaning the Supreme Ultimate. The source of qi (Wade-Giles: ch‘i) is not so clearly stated by Zhu Xi, leading some authorities to <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> he was a metaphysical monist and others to <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> he was a metaphysical dualist.|$|R

Reyes, however, wakes up moments later {{in the same room}} all alone. Running to the door, she discovers that the hospital is floating in a dark void. She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They assume that they are dead. Reyes, however, <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> they are still alive.|$|E
5|$|Cimon, on {{the other}} hand, {{apparently}} believed that no further free space for democratic evolution existed. He was certain that democracy had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E

50|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Ammon {{had ceased}} to exist as a distinct nation by this time, and that the designation of Ammonite as applied to Timothy is geographic rather than ethnic; the account of Justin Martyr (who <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Ammonites were numerous in his period) call this hypothesis into question.|$|R

5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They {{contribute}} towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect.

5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E

He praised her for spreading the message of Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning. In the Raëlian hierarchy, she is one level below Raël {{and serves as a}} spokesperson for the movement. As a leader, she has attempted to rehabilitate the swastika, one of the group's symbols.

5|$|In July 2006, an {{advertising}} {{campaign in the}} Netherlands was released in which a white model dressed entirely in white and a black model dressed entirely in black {{was used to compare}} Sony's new Ceramic White PSP and the original Piano Black PSP.
