500|$|To {{the north}} of the river bank {{northwest}} of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about [...] and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the 20thcentury it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) in combination with yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and quaking-grass (Briza media). Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species rough <b>marsh-mallow</b> (Althaea hirsuta) and nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum), also present.|$|E
60|$|And {{in those}} days the spring-time was as joyful as it is now, and sent the blood {{coursing}} in just the same fashion. The afternoon sky was blue with piled white clouds sailing through it, and the southwest wind came like a soft caress. The new-come swallows drove to and fro. The reaches of the river were spangled with white ranunculus, the marshy places were starred with lady's-smock and lit with <b>marsh-mallow</b> wherever the regiments of the sedges lowered their swords, and the northward-moving hippopotami, shiny black monsters, sporting clumsily, came floundering and blundering through it all, rejoicing dimly and possessed with one clear idea, to splash the river muddy.|$|E

50|$|Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries {{is listed}} as a Special Area of Conservation by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, a public body that advises the Welsh Government on {{international}} nature conservation. The area conserved includes sea inlets, tidal rivers, estuaries, mud flats, sand flats, lagoons (including saltwork basins), salt marshes, salt pastures, salt steppes, shingle, sea cliffs and islets. The sand and mud flats have large numbers of bivalve molluscs including the edible cockle. The large shallow inlets and bays provide habitat for {{a great variety of}} marine invertebrates. The saltmarshes have biodiverse communities of glasswort (Salicornis species), dwarf eelgrass (Zostera noltei), sea rush (Juncus maritimus) and <b>marsh-mallow</b> (Althaea officinalis) and all the wildlife they support. A primary reason for the listing is the presence in the bay of the twait shad (Alosa fallax), a migratory fish.|$|E

30|$|Yet, Schott {{remained}} a self-critical realist and remarked (Schott 1661, preface {{of the whole}} work p.)(5 v°): “Quod (sc. consilium) si non assecutus omnino videbor, considera LECTOR, non me hibisco gracili, vel scirpo fiscellam contexere, sed numeris, schematibus, et apodixibus Mathematicis, quae nec Natura, nec Ars protulit sine nodis ac spinis.” (“Should I {{not seem to have}} completely reached this aim, note reader that I do not weave a small basket using thin <b>marsh-mallow</b> or bulrush but numbers, figures, and mathematical demonstrations that neither nature nor art brought about without knots and thorns.”).|$|E
40|$|Naeff {{report their}} {{research}} on students ’ responses to both lecture con-tent and instructor when that instructor uses PowerPoint slides to pre-sent course material. Their students demonstrated some ambivalence toward the software. However, many writers {{on the subject}} of PowerPoint are less sanguine about its use and more critical of its misuse. The most recent salvo in the skirmish over presentation software comes from Edward Tufte (2003), guru of graphic design, who has recently published a monograph critiquing the “cognitive style ” of PowerPoint. With its predesigned templates and auto-content features, Tufte charges, PowerPoint encourages a “foreshortening of evidence and thought, ” and “a deeply hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content ” (p. 4). Because that soft-ware is “entirely presenter-oriented, and not content-oriented, not audience-oriented, ” Tufte charges that it leads users to “a preoccupation with for-mat ” rather than ideas, a phenomenon he terms PowerPoint “Phluff” (p. 4). And he reinforces the comment with a visual of the jarred <b>marsh-mallow</b> goo immediately to the right of his paragraph. Author Ian Parker (2001), writing for The New Yorker, is similarly con-cerned about the effect of PowerPoint on thinking. He charges that the software “edits ideas, ” and that its template structure, with heading...|$|E
