500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, which were {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Nico Rosberg expressed delight about his victory, but also remembered the events of Paris which, as he put it, rendered [...] "everything relative". Replying to Brundle's notion that driving {{the way he did}} earlier in the season would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank you very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> piece of advice, I could figure that out for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E
500|$|The most {{meaningful}} {{outcome of the}} Franklin expedition was the mapping of several thousand miles of hitherto unsurveyed coastline by expeditions searching for Franklin's lost ships and crew. As Richard Cyriax noted, [...] "the loss of the expedition probably added much more [...] knowledge than its successful return would have done". At the same time, it largely quelled the Admiralty's appetite for Arctic exploration. There was a gap of many years before the Nares expedition and when Nares declared there was [...] "no thoroughfare" [...] to the North Pole, his words {{marked the end of}} the Royal Navy's historical involvement in Arctic exploration, {{the end of an era}} in which such exploits were widely seen by the British public as worthy expenditures of human effort and monetary resources. As a writer for The Athenaeum put it, [...] "We think that we can fairly make out the account between the cost and results of these Arctic Expeditions, and ask whether it is worth while to risk so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> which is so difficult of attainment, and when attained, is so worthless." [...] The navigation of the Northwest Passage in 1903–05 by Roald Amundsen with the Gjøa expedition effectively ended the centuries-long quest for the Northwest Passage.|$|E

6000|$|... "The fifteenth of May, my lord. I'm afraid Mr Watts' Patriot 'll be too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> her; <b>that's</b> av' he'll run kind; but he don't do that always. Well, {{good morning}} to your lordship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! How is {{he going}} to earn it--writing poetry? They don't pay <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> kind of writing, to my way of thinking." ...|$|E
60|$|I didn't care very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> but as {{it seemed}} that he had {{something}} particular to say I went up the ladder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> as {{anything}} else. It's {{something to be}} agreed with, on a subject that occupies so much of one's thoughts.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fault {{has been}} too <b>much</b> ours <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> We should have left this alone, and not have pressed it. We have meant it for the best, dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nootka sighed. [...] "I wish I {{could love}} my country like you; but your country sticks. Mine melts away--most of it--every hot sun-time; {{and it is}} not easy to care <b>much</b> <b>for</b> things <b>that</b> melt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] said Warner, with a {{smile that}} seemed moulded in marble--"that we all have to thank you very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> telegram." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There doesn't {{appear to}} be {{anything}} very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> boat, and she'll probably clear for the north to-morrow," [...] he said. [...] "You had better get your things together." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> domestic. The unheard-of {{horrors of}} the Boong-jee-gop, coupled with the {{tremendous}} energy of the final [...] "go!" [...] was {{more than he could}} stand. He went--meekly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, you'd better quit. I {{could get}} you with the ax, if I wanted, but I've not <b>much</b> use <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> I'd sooner you stopped here while I light out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; Frederick {{is not a}} man to whine and complain; he has too <b>much</b> spirit <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> If {{the girl}} likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I, {{any more}} than for the island of Madagascar, nor so <b>much</b> neither; <b>for</b> <b>that</b> has been a {{fortunate}} island to me more than once, as thou knowest, William," [...] said I.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one would}} blame you very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> I am sure," [...] she said cheerfully. [...] "You are {{frightening}} yourself needlessly. I {{will speak to}} Father, and he shall help you." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR OLIVER. [Aside.] I {{forgive him}} everything!--[Aloud.] But, Sir, when I take a whim in my head, I don't value money. I'll give you as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> as {{for all the}} rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right ho, Jeeves. So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> then. Now here's {{something}} else: You {{noticed that}} I said I {{was going to}} put this project through tomorrow, and no doubt you wondered why I said tomorrow. Why did I, Jeeves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Stuff!' ejaculated Mr. Pearson. 'It's <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> one; and <b>that</b> one blowed--nothin' but a shell--not a thing inside. And {{eighteen}} hundred dollars!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> saying <b>that!</b> I hope it {{will pass}} off in unclouded brilliancy; it will, if I can make it. Why, hallo! They're {{on the other side}} of the street yet, and looking about as if they were lost." ...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the given}} strategies, CONABIO has {{established}} the Invasive Species Program, which represents a national database {{on the foreign}} species with invasive potential, as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> those <b>that</b> are established as those {{that have yet to}} settle and represent a risk to the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> then," [...] said he, provokingly contemptuous. [...] "If {{you will}} be as amiable {{in the matter of}} the supper I shall be glad to {{terminate}} an acquaintance which I can see no honour to myself in pursuing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But wait a bit," [...] the Oysters cried, [...] "Before we {{have our}} chat; [...] For {{some of us are}} out of breath, [...] And all of us are fat!" [...] "No hurry!" [...] said the Carpenter. [...] They thanked him <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith! I don't {{blame the}} girls <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> was a confoundedly ungentlemanly trick of yours, and I'll thank {{you not to}} lay any of the blame of it on me; I've got as much as I can carry without that," [...] said the tall figure, {{stalking}} away alone.|$|E
60|$|This was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Jean-Marie. <b>That</b> a place should so {{transform}} the most excellent of men transcended his belief. Paris, he protested, was even an agreeable place of residence. 'Nor when I {{lived in that}} city did I feel much difference,' he pleaded.|$|R
60|$|I am <b>much</b> {{interested}} <b>for</b> <b>that</b> best of men, Mr. Wood; I hope he is {{in better}} health and spirits than when I saw him last.--I am ever, my dearest friend, your obliged, humble servant, R. B.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has it indeed!" [...] she objected. [...] "You think I've {{never had}} a young man, eh? Perhaps you're right. Haven't found <b>much</b> time <b>for</b> <b>that</b> sort of rubbish. Anyway, this is where I hop on a trolley car." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Henry, I drink yours in this pint bumper, {{and upon}} my knee; and I would do as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> young gentleman"--(looking at Albert)--"and the squire {{of the green}} cassock too, holding it for green, as the colours are not to my eyes {{altogether}} clear and distinguishable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who, I!" [...] said Dame Nelly. [...] "Nay, I scorn {{the proud}} princox too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> Do you know, he {{made all the}} folk in the Ward stand cap in hand to him, my poor old John Christie and all?" [...] Here her {{recollection}} began to overflow at her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Chester crept {{off to his}} garret chamber with a very sullen face. He was too used {{to being}} sent to bed without any supper to care <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} he was hungry. But his whole being was in a tumult of rebellion over the injustice that was meted out to him.|$|E
6000|$|This was too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Jean-Marie. <b>That</b> a place should so {{transform}} the most excellent of men transcended his belief.

60|$|Beatrice looked despairingly at her aunt, well {{knowing what}} her answer would be, {{that it would}} not be at all too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> her, <b>that</b> she should be very glad to see her former neighbours, and that it would be a great treat to Henrietta and Fred.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>much</b> better <b>for</b> <b>that</b> poor {{young man}}'s sake." [...] The poor {{young man was}} of course Cousin Henry. [...] "But I could not interfere. I could only hear what I did hear,--and wait. Then the dear old man died!" ...|$|R
