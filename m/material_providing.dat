25|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} {{is formed}} in flat sheets {{in a variety}} of thicknesses and colors. As flat sheets, PVC is often expanded to create voids in the interior of the <b>material,</b> <b>providing</b> additional thickness without additional weight and minimal extra cost (see Closed-cell PVC foamboard). Sheets are cut using saws and rotary cutting equipment. Plasticized PVC is also used to produce thin, colored, or clear, adhesive-backed films referred to simply as vinyl. These films are typically cut on a computer-controlled plotter (see Vinyl cutter) or printed in a wide-format printer. These sheets and films are used to produce a wide variety of commercial signage products, including car body stripes and stickers.|$|E

50|$|Chemical looping {{combustion}} (CLC) is {{a technological}} process typically employing a dual fluidized bed system (circulating fluidized bed process) where a metal oxide is {{employed as a}} bed <b>material</b> <b>providing</b> the oxygen for combustion in the fuel reactor. The reduced metal is then transferred to the second bed (air reactor) and re-oxidized before being reintroduced back to the fuel reactor completing the loop.|$|E
50|$|When made of textile fabric, pot-holders {{typically}} have an inner layer of a <b>material</b> <b>providing</b> thermal insulation sandwiched between more colorful or decorative outsides. The {{most common type}} commercially available nowadays has {{the form of a}} square, with a side length varying from 5 in to 10 in and slightly rounded corners, and a textile loop at one of the corners for hanging.|$|E

It is suitable temporary <b>material</b> <b>providing</b> there are no biting forces on it. It is also contraindicated if the final restorative material is composite because eugenol adversely effects the bond/polymerization process. Examples brands: Kalzinol, Sedanol.|$|E

50|$|The hairy mussel {{is found}} around {{the coasts of}} Tasmania and {{southern}} and eastern Australia {{as far north as}} Cairns. It lives on exposed reefs and among rocks and seaweed in the intertidal and subtidal zone, attaching itself to hard surfaces using its byssus threads. It is an important constituent of the seabed fauna where it forms dense beds of tangled <b>material</b> <b>providing</b> a habitat for other species.|$|E
50|$|On {{the outside}} of the hull, the wire is snipped and the joints filled and sanded over. The outside of the joint, or entire hull, may be fiberglassed and glued as well, {{providing}} additional strength. The combination of fiberglass tape and epoxy glue results in a composite <b>material</b> <b>providing</b> an extremely strong joint, something close to 8-10 times the strength of fastenings and timber framing that might have been used in more conventional plywood construction.|$|E
50|$|Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom {{has twice}} been banned in Australia. The Home Affairs Minister, Brendan O'Connor, asked the Classification Review Board to {{reassess}} the decision; however, the review {{failed to find}} any fault in the classification. The film was banned in 1997, and was released after two failed attempts in September 2010, when the ACB classified an uncut version of Salò R18+, mainly due to extra <b>material</b> <b>providing</b> greater context.|$|E

50|$|No script, intertitles, or {{production}} {{credits for}} the film survived. By examining the footage frame by frame, and by hiring a lip reader to determine the dialogue, Museum of Modern Art curators reconstructed the planned film's narrative. As well as the footage, nearly 100 still images of the interracial production were recovered from within the unedited <b>material,</b> <b>providing</b> evidence of an historic effort. The photos show two white directors, Edwin Middleton and T. Hayes Hunter as well as white crewmembers.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{widespread}} use of powder diffraction is in the identification and characterization of crystalline solids, each of which produces a distinctive diffraction pattern. Both the positions (corresponding to lattice spacings) and the relative intensity of the lines in a diffraction pattern are indicative of a particular phase and <b>material,</b> <b>providing</b> a [...] "fingerprint" [...] for comparison. A multi-phase mixture, e.g. a soil sample, will show more than one pattern superposed, allowing for determination of the relative concentrations of phases in the mixture.|$|E

50|$|The {{energy loss}} of a {{backscattered}} ion is dependent on two processes: the energy lost in scattering events with sample nuclei, and the energy lost to small-angle scattering from the sample electrons. The first process {{is dependent on the}} scattering cross-section of the nucleus and thus on its mass and atomic number. For a given measurement angle, nuclei of two different elements will therefore scatter incident ions to different degrees and with different energies, producing separate peaks on an N(E) plot of measurement count versus energy. These peaks are characteristic of the elements contained in the <b>material,</b> <b>providing</b> a means of analyzing the composition of a sample by matching scattered energies to known scattering cross-sections. Relative concentrations can be determined by measuring the heights of the peaks.|$|E
