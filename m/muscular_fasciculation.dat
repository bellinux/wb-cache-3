40|$|This report {{refers to}} a female Pinscher treated at the Veterinary Hospital of the Botucatu School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry (FMVZ) -São Paulo State University (UNESP), Botucatu, 14 hours after a {{suspected}} spider envenoming. The animal showed spastic limbs, dyspnea, salivation, hypothermia, <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculation,</b> non-responsive mydriasis, and claudication of the right hindlimb. The spider was later identified by the Center for the Study of Venoms and Venomous Animals-CEVAP/UNESP, Botucatu as Phoneutria nigriventer. The treatment with potent analgesic was efficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{clinical}} investigation {{on the new}} long acting cholinesterase inhibitor "Ubretid" showed {{that it could be}} employed for tornicising the bladder and ureteral musculature. Clinical improvements of symptoms and signs including cystometrograms were observed in 7 of 8 patients with mild bladder neck sclerosis, 5 of 8 patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction and 1 of 4 patients with vesicoureteral reflux. A dose of 5 mg. (one tablet) once a day by mouth seemed to be adequate. Maintenance on 5 mg. every other day may be desirable in chronic cases. No marked by-effects such as intestinal spasms, vomiting, excessive sweating, increased saliva secretion, <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculation</b> and cholinergic crisis were encountered in this study...|$|E
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} survey on {{the prevalence of}} acute pyrethroid poisoning in cotton farmers was conducted in 1987 and 1988. A total of 3113 pyrethroid spraymen (2230 men (71. 6 %) and 883 women (28. 4 %] were interviewed after spraying and followed up for 72 hours. Adverse effects of pyrethroid exposure were found in 834 of them (26. 8 %) manifested as abnormal facial sensations, dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, or loss of appetite. Only 10 subjects, who developed significant systemic symptoms and had signs of listlessness or <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculation,</b> were diagnosed as having mild occupational acute pyrethroid poisoning with a prevalence of 0. 31 % in subjects exposed to pure pyrethroids and 0. 38 % in subjects exposed to pyrethroid organophosphate mixtures. Measurements of pyrethroid concentrations in {{the air of the}} breathing zone, in skin pads, and in urine samples showed that dermal contamination is the main route of exposure to pyrethroids in cotton growers. Preventive measures are recommended...|$|E
50|$|In animal studies, {{parenteral}} administration of TMA-containing extracts from Neptunea to mice, cats and fish mainly show effects involving skeletal muscles: there are <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculations,</b> convulsions, loss of balance, motor paralysis and ultimately cessation of respiration.|$|R
25|$|Supporters of {{the death}} penalty agree that the use of pancuronium bromide is not {{absolutely}} necessary in the lethal injection protocol. Some supporters believe that the drug may decrease <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculations</b> when the potassium is given, but this has yet to be proven.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two phases}} to the depolarizing block. During phase I (depolarizing phase), they cause <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculations</b> (muscle twitches) {{while they are}} depolarizing the muscle fibers. Eventually, after {{sufficient}} depolarization has occurred, phase II (desensitizing phase) sets in and the muscle is no longer responsive to acetylcholine released by the motoneurons. At this point, full neuromuscular block has been achieved.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the level of anesthesia attained in Xenopus laevis frogs using a propofol bath administration. Thirty-three nonbreeding female Xenopus laevis frogs were used. At 175 mg/l, all frogs died after bath administration. An appropriate anesthetic dose was determined to be 88 mg/l for 15 min. After administration of this dose, the acetic acid test, withdrawal reflex, righting reflex, heart rate, and respiratory frequency were used to evaluate central nervous system depression. Pharmacokinetics of propofol were calculated after blood concentration determination by tandem liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses. Short-duration anesthesia (less than 30 min) was obtained, and in many frogs, <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculation</b> was seen during the acetic acid test. The area under the time–concentration curve (AUC 0 –t) was 24. 07 μg·min/ml, and AUCinf was 24. 71 μg·min/ml. The elimination half-life was 1. 18 h. When administered as a single-bath immersion for 15 min, propofol does not appear to be a safe and effective anesthetic for Xenopus laevis frogs, due to a narrow dose–effect window, short duration, and shallow level of anesthesia obtained...|$|E
40|$|On 39 {{cases of}} {{parathion}} poisoning treated with PAM (pyridine- 2 -aldoxime methiodide) the author obtained the following results. 1. From cholinesterase determinations and clinical findings PAM {{has been found}} to be the most effective drug available at present for the treatment of parathion poisoning. 2. The effect appears promptly within 30 [...] 40 minutes of the treatment. 3. By administering PAM such symptoms as disturbance of consciousness, <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculation,</b> salivation, bronchial secretion, convulsions, vomiting, and rasping in the lung, all disappear easily. Apart from these there may persist for quite same time such subjective symptoms as headache, miosis, pallor, quick breathing, speech difficulty, slow pupillary reflex, and numbness of limbs, but these are not dangerous. 4. If no improvement at all occurs after the administration of PAM, the case may be suspected as not paration poisoning. 5. As for the method of administration, 1. 0 g PAM (40 ml 2. 5 % aqueous solution) is administered intravenously, and if no prompt effect appears another dose of 1. 0 g PAM will be sufficient. 6. Occasionally vomiting accompanies the PAM injection, but it is considered as due to parathion, and there can be observed otherwise no other side-effect. 7. There is no need of concurrent use of atropine, and even in severe case the dose of atropine should be limited to 0. 5 - 1. 0 mg to suppress secretion. The use of a large amount of atropine, on the contrary, brings about the danger of atropine poisoning. 8. In extremely severe cases where even 2. 0 g PAM shows little effect, PAM in the amount up to 4 - 5 g may be additionally given along with atropine...|$|E
40|$|Monofluoracetato de sódio (MF) foi identificado, por cromatografia, em três das doze plantas que causam morte súbita em bovinos no Brasil, incluindo Palicourea marcgravii, a mais importante desse grupo. Uma lesão considerada típica por alguns autores para intoxicação foi¹ a degeneração hidrópico-vacuolar dos túbulos uriníferos contorcidos distais (DHV). O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar se a ingestão de MF induz sinais clínicos e lesões similares às observadas nos bovinos intoxicados pelas plantas que causam morte súbita. Seis vacas receberam, por via oral, 0, 5 e 1, 0 mg/kg de MF diluídos em 50 mL de água destilada. Clinicamente, os animais apresentaram taquicardia, jugular repleta com pulso venoso positivo, respiração abdominal, ligeira perda de equilíbrio, por vezes cambaleavam, deitavam e apoiavam a cabeça no flanco. Na fase final (agônica), todos os animais caíam em decúbito lateral, esticavam os membros, faziam movimentos de pedalagem, apresentavam opistótono, nistagmo, mugidos e a morte ocorria em 2 - 14 minutos. À necropsia verificaram-se aurículas, jugulares, ázigos e pulmonares moderadamente ingurgitadas. Observaram-se ainda leve a moderado edema da {{subserosa}} nos locais de fixação da vesícula biliar no fígado, além de leve edema entre o duodeno e o pâncreas. O exame histopatológico revelou, em todos os animais, desde leve a acentuada DHV das células epiteliais dos túbulos uriníferos contorcidos distais associada à cariopicnose. Com relação à ultraestrutura, observou-se vacuolização do citoplasma devido ao acúmulo de água. Vacuolização e necrose de coagulação individual ou de grupos de hepatócitos e leve congestão hepática secundários à estase venosa também foram observados. DHV tem sido observada em casos de envenenamento por outras substâncias, porém nestes não está restrita aos túbulos distais e não se observa cariopicnose. Este estudo demonstra que a DHV dos túbulos renais de bovinos pode ser causada pelo envenenamento por MF e, por analogia, essa substância deve ser considerada como um dos fatores importantes, senão o mais significativo, implicado na morte dos animais que ingerem plantas que causam morte súbita no Brasil. Isso indica que estudos, que envolvam metabolização de MF por bactérias ruminais, teriam grande aplicabilidade econômica, uma vez que pelo menos 500. 000 bovinos morrem anualmente intoxicados por plantas do grupo das que causam morte súbita no Brasil. Sodium monofluoroacetate (MF) was identified, by cromatography, {{in three}} of the 12 plants that cause sudden death in cattle in Brazil, including Palicourea marcgravii, the most important plant of this group. A special kind of hydropic-vacuolar degeneration (HVD) of the distal convoluted uriniferous tubules was considered typical for the poisoning by some authors. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify if the ingestion of MF causes similar clinical signs and lesion in cattle poisoned by plants that cause sudden death. Six cows received orally 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/kg of M diluted in 50 mL of distilled water. Clinically the animals presented tachycardia, engorgement and positive pulse of the jugular vein, abdominal breathing, swaying gait, subtle unbalance, and recumbency with head placed the on the flank. In the agonal phase all the animals in lateral recumbence presented <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculation,</b> tonic contraction, peddling movements, opisthotonus, nystagmus, and died between 2 and 14 minutes. At postmortem examination, the heart auricles, jugular and pulmonary veins were moderately distended and engorged with blood. Slight to moderate edema of the subserosa was seen around the gall bladder and the duodenum near to the pancreas. At light microscopy, HVD associated with nuclear picnosis of the epithelial cells of the distal convoluted uriniferous tubules was present in all animals. Ultrastructurally, the cell lesion represents formation of cytosolic vacuoles, likely due to accumulation of water. Coagulation necrosis of individual or groups of hepatocytes and slight hepatic congestion secondary to the venous stasis were also observed. Hydropic-vacuolar degeneration has been observed in cases of poisoning by many substances, which cause acute tubular nephrosis, however not restricted to the distal renal tubules and without nuclear picnosis. This study demonstrates that the HVD in the kidney can be caused by MF and, in analogy, the compound should be considered responsible for the death of cattle that ingest toxic plants which cause sudden death in Brazil. Our results can be supportive to studies that will focus on the degradation of MF by rumen bacteria, what might have economic implications, as at least 500. 000 cattle die annually by sudden death causing toxic plants in Brazil...|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Carmichael, Gorham, and Biggs {{experimented with}} anatoxin-a. They {{introduced}} toxic cultures of Anabaena flos aquae into the stomachs {{of two young}} male calves, and observed that <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculations</b> and loss of coordination occurred {{in a matter of}} minutes, while death due to respiratory failure occurred anywhere between several minutes and a few hours. They also established that extensive periods of artificial respiration did not allow for detoxification to occur and natural neuromuscular functioning to resume. From these experiments, they calculated that the oral minimum lethal dose (MLD) (of the algae, not the anatoxin molecule), for calves is roughly 420 mg/kg body weight.|$|R
40|$|Type E botulism, one of {{the least}} common forms of botulinal {{intoxication}} on the East Coast of the United States, is described for two elderly patients with chronic underlying disease. Both patients consumed tainted kapchunka, a salted, ungutted whitefish. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were prominent, but neurologic complaints, although noted soon after the consumption of the fish in one patient, did not progress until late {{in the course of the}} patient's illness. One patient exhibited both urinary retention, which was reported mainly in one outbreak of type E botulism (M. G. Koenig, A. Spickard, M. A. Cardella, and D. E.

50|$|Anatoxin-a, {{also known}} as Very Fast Death Factor (VFDF), is a secondary, bicyclic amine {{alkaloid}} and cyanotoxin with acute neurotoxicity. It was first discovered in the early 1960s in Canada, and was isolated in 1972. The toxin is produced by seven different genera of cyanobacteria and {{has been reported in}} North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and New Zealand. Symptoms of anatoxin exposure include loss of coordination, <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculations,</b> convulsions and death by respiratory paralysis. Its mode of action is through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) where it mimics the binding of the receptor's natural ligand, acetylcholine. As such, anatoxin-a has been used for medicinal purposes to investigate diseases characterized by low acetylcholine levels. Due to its high toxicity and potential presence in drinking water, anatoxin-a poses a threat to animals, including humans. While methods for detection and water treatment exist, scientists have called for more research to improve reliability and efficacy. Anatoxin-a is {{not to be confused with}} anatoxin-a(S), another potent cyanotoxin that has a similar mechanism of action to that of anatoxin-a and is produced by many of the same cyanobacteria genera, but is structurally unrelated.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY This {{thesis is}} {{a report of the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the potentiation of succinylcholine (SCh), by hexafluorenium (Hf). Chapter I gives a survey of the existing publications devoted to Hf, from which it appears that several investigators are convinced that the potentiating action of this drug is due to an inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Our clinical experience with Hf led us to doubt this conclusion; <b>muscular</b> <b>fasciculations</b> were never observed, and bradycardia and salivation but seldom. In chapter II, a description is given of the experiments we performed, in order to investigate the validity of the theory of cholinesterase inhibition. Sections A and B of this chapter are devoted to a description of experiments performed on rabbits and mice. From the results of these, it is evident that Hf potentiates the action of SCh in these animals. In chapter II, section C, the results are given of experiments, carried out on rabbits, to determine the degree of cholinesterase inhibition produced by Hf. These clearly demonstrate, that the dose required for the potentation of SCh will produce little or no cholinesterase inhibition. Section D of chapter II gives a description of experiments performed on frog muscles. The results demonstrate that Hf does not potentiate the depolarizing effects of SCh. This conclusion gains considerable support from the results of experiments performed on cat muscles, which are reported in section E. Chapter III is devoted to a discussion {{of the results of the}} experiments, and to the general conclusions which may be drawn from them. These are: 1. The muscular relaxation, produced by succinylcholine, is independent of the depolarizing action of this agent. 2. Hexafluorenium potentiates the relaxant effects of SCh, but not the depolarization. 3. This potentiation by Hf is not due to an inhibition of cholinesterase. 4. These characteristic properties make the combination of Hf and SCh almost ideal, for the production of muscular relaxation during operations. ...|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{represents the}} most common motoneuron disorder in adulthood. It is characterized by selective degeneration of the motoneurons. About 10 % of patients have a genetically determined ALS. Clinically, ALS is characterized by coexistence of signs of the first motoneuron, such as spasticity and hyperreflexia, {{as well as the}} second motoneuron, such as <b>muscular</b> atrophy and <b>fasciculations.</b> If such signs are present in at least three regions and if other possible causes have been excluded, a definite diagnosis of ALS can be made based on the revised El-Escorial criteria. Initial manifestations are often focalized and generalization develops during the course. The glutamate antagonist riluzole is worldwide the only approved ALS treatment. However, symptomatic treatments to ameliorate spasticity, drooling, speech and swallowing problems, and assisted ventilation to treat respiratory failure are essential...|$|R
40|$|Diazinon (DZN) is a {{synthetic}} organophosphorus (OPs) insecticide {{widely used in}} agricultural and household applications. OPs, particularly DZN, are highly lipid soluble liquids. Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) {{has been shown to}} reduce toxicity caused by some lipid soluble agents. We evaluated the antidote effect of ILE on acute toxicity of DZN. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley female rats weighting 200 - 250 g were treated orally with dose of 480 mg/ kg of DZN gavaged at the volume of 0. 5 mL/kg. Thirty minutes after administration of DZN, two groups were treated by either ILE 10 % (ILE 10) or normal saline (NS) (16 mL/kg) (NS 16) that were infused for the duration of 15 minutes. Another two groups were also treated by either ILE 20 % (ILE 20) or NS (10 mL/kg: NS 10) as above. The changes in body weight, diarrhea score, <b>muscular</b> power, <b>fasciculation,</b> convulsions and mortality rate of the animals were all monitored immediately after infusions and then every 6 h up to 48 h.
