5|$|Op zoek naar Evita (Looking for Evita) was {{produced}} in the Netherlands in 2007, followed by Op zoek naar Joseph (Looking for Joseph) in 2008, Op zoek naar <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> (Looking for <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins)</b> in 2009 and Op zoek naar Zorro (Looking for Zorro) in 2011 and even Op zoek naar Annie (Looking for Annie) in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Travers' working {{relationship}} with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, {{given the nature of}} the <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, in 1964, <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> is to {{have its}} world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> {{with a lack of}} enthusiasm, {{particularly}} during the animated sequences. She gradually warms {{to the rest of the}} film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, it was {{revealed}} that Lansbury had joined the cast of the upcoming movie <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> Returns. It is a sequel to the Academy Award-winning 1964 film, set 20 years later in Depression-era London. Filming began at Shepperton Studios that month and the film is due for release in December 2018.|$|E
5|$|The film also depicts Travers' Aunt Ellie (her mother's sister), {{who comes}} to help the family when her father becomes terminally ill, as Travers' model for <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins,</b> with her even using several of Poppins' catchphrases from the film. In fact, Travers {{identified}} her great aunt Helen Morehead (her mother's aunt), {{as the model for}} Poppins.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Travers is {{irritated by}} what she {{perceives}} as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team that are developing <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.|$|E
5|$|Travers' {{difficult}} {{childhood in}} Allora, Queensland, Australia, is depicted through flashbacks, {{and is the}} inspiration for much of <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins.</b> Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated firings, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother to attempt suicide. Goff died {{at an early age}} from tuberculosis when Travers was seven years old.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures {{released}} a trailer {{for the film}} on July 10, 2013. Saving Mr. Banks held its world premiere at the London Film Festival on October 20, 2013. On November 7, 2013, Walt Disney Pictures held the film's U.S. premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre during the opening night of the 2013 AFI Film Festival, the same location where <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> premiered. The original film was also screened for its 50th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Disney {{produced}} <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins,</b> {{based on}} the book series by P. L. Travers; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although Travers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights. The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.|$|E
5|$|Saving Mr. Banks is a 2013 period drama film {{directed}} by John Lee Hancock from a screenplay written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. Centered {{on the development}} of the 1964 film <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins,</b> the film stars Emma Thompson as author P. L. Travers and Tom Hanks as filmmaker Walt Disney, with supporting performances by Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Farrell. Deriving its title from the father in Travers' story, Saving Mr. Banks depicts the author's fortnight-long meetings during 1961 in Los Angeles, during which Disney attempts to obtain the screen rights to her novels.|$|E
5|$|The road still attracts notable residents. In 2002, Robert B. Sherman, {{composer}} of the musicals Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins,</b> {{moved to}} an apartment on Park Lane {{following the death of}} his wife. He enjoyed the views of Hyde Park and in 2003 painted an eponymous portrait, Park Lane. The business mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed has offices in 55 and 60 Park Lane. Trevor Rees-Jones, the only survivor of the car crash that killed al-Fayed's son Dodi Fayed and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, briefly recuperated in a flat on Park Lane following the accident.|$|E
5|$|Born in Chicago in 1901, Disney {{developed}} an early interest in drawing. He took art classes {{as a boy}} and {{got a job as}} a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, Walt developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, his first highly popular success; he also provided the voice for his creation in the early years. As the studio grew, Disney became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Fantasia, Pinocchio (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950) and <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> (1964), the latter of which received five Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Audience tastes {{were fairly}} eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} films in their respective years of release, with the trend {{coming to an end}} with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins,</b> My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, the Dutch {{language}} production {{opened at}} the Fortis Circustheater in The Hague (Scheveningen) and was presented by Disney Theatrical directly and Joop van den Ende Theaterproducties/Stage Entertainment. Noortje Herlaar portrays <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> and William Spaaij portrays Bert. The actress who {{plays the role of}} <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> was found in a TV-show: Op zoek naar <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> (Searching for <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins).</b> This production closed on August 28, 2011.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> is {{a musical}} {{with music and}} lyrics by the Sherman Brothers, with {{additional}} music and lyrics by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, and a script by Julian Fellowes. The musical {{is based on the}} similarly titled <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> children's books by P. L. Travers and the 1964 Disney film, and is a fusion of various elements from the two.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Walt Disney was a guest, {{primarily}} {{to promote his}} production of <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins.</b> Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 110 free admission tickets to Disneyland for his friends and one for his wife, but {{later in the show}} Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge, at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins.</b>|$|E

25|$|London {{has been}} a popular {{location}} for children's (and especially Disney) films over the last 40 years. The animated features Peter Pan (1953), One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) and Basil, the Great Mouse Detective (known in North America as The Great Mouse Detective) (1986) were all set in the city, as were <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> (1964) (#1 in U.S.) and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971).

25|$|In 1993, {{theatrical}} producer Cameron Mackintosh met P.L. Travers {{and acquired}} {{the rights to}} develop a stage play adaptation of her <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> books. She only agreed to a stage production {{as long as the}} creators were all English, and no one who had worked on the film. She died in 1996. In 2001, Mackintosh and the head of Disney Theatrical Thomas Schumacher opened talks on a possible collaboration, so that the stage play would {{be able to use the}} songs from the Disney film. With both sides committed, a preliminary outline of the show was written in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Her role as {{the title}} {{character}} in Bride of Frankenstein (1935) brought her recognition. She played supporting roles through the 1940s and 1950s. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Come to the Stable (1949) and Witness for the Prosecution (1957), the last of twelve films in which she appeared with Laughton. Following Laughton's death in 1962, Lanchester resumed her career with appearances in such Disney films as <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> (1964), That Darn Cat! (1965) and Blackbeard's Ghost (1968). The horror film Willard (1971) was highly successful, {{and one of her}} last roles was in Murder by Death (1976).|$|E
25|$|However, most major-market 21st-century {{productions}} {{have taken}} a safe route, with revivals of familiar fare, such as Fiddler on the Roof, A Chorus Line, South Pacific, Gypsy, Hair, West Side Story and Grease, or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Wicked and Fun Home), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (The Producers, Spamalot, Hairspray, Legally Blonde, The Color Purple, Xanadu, Billy Elliot, Shrek, Waitress, and Groundhog Day). Some critics {{have argued that the}} reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins</b> and The Little Mermaid), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.|$|E
25|$|Notable cast {{replacements}} include Mig Ayesa, {{who played}} Galileo, taking over from Tony Vincent. Mazz Murray {{took over the}} role of Killer Queen after Sharon D. Clarke's departure in April 2004. Murray left the production in August 2011, which made her the longest running principal cast member, although she left the production briefly in September 2010 for maternity leave. Brenda Edwards, who was an X-Factor semi-finalist in 2005, is currently performing the role of Killer Queen. On 22 September 2008 I'd Do Anything semi-finalist, Rachel Tucker, began performing in the role of Meat. She left the production on 19 September 2009. The role was then taken on by Irish born performer Louise Bowden, who had already performed in several prolific musicals including Mamma Mia!, Guys and Dolls and <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins.</b> Bowden unexpectedly quit the production in May 2010. It was then left to Amanda Coutts to perform the role Meat. Coutts was originally Bowden's understudy. The West End production featured a nine piece live band under the musical direction of Stuart Morley.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{became a}} success even before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theater on October 15, 1997 in previews with the {{official}} opening on November 13, 1997. On June 13, 2006, the Broadway production moved to the Minskoff Theatre {{to make way for}} the musical version of <b>Mary</b> <b>Poppins,</b> where it is still running. It is now Broadway's third-longest-running show in history. The show debuted in the West End's Lyceum Theatre on October 19, 1999 and is still running. The cast of the West End production were invited to perform at the Royal Variety Performance 2008 at the London Palladium on December 11, in the presence of senior members of the British Royal Family.

International productions include a British at the Lyceum Theatre in London, a Canadian at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto, a Mexican in Mexico City, and a South African in Johannesburg, among others. The first ever UK tour opened at Bristol Hippodrome on August 31, 2012.|$|E
