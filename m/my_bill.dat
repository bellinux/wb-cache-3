500|$|Southerners, however, {{saw that}} Douglas' attempt was {{unlikely}} to result in legalization of slavery. While it allowed Nebraska to determine whether slavery would be legal there when it became a state, slavery was still forbidden under the Missouri Compromise {{as long as it}} remained a territory. If no slaveholders were allowed in the territory, it would be exceedingly unlikely that the state's voters would allow for slavery in their constitution. Following this line of thought, Dixon drafted an amendment to Douglas' bill that would repeal section eight of the Missouri Compromise, the section that prohibited slavery north of latitude 36°30'. After a promise of support from Tennessee senator James C. Jones, Dixon introduced the amendment on January 16, 1854. This forced Douglas to confront the Missouri Compromise issue outright, and two days later, he visited Dixon to discuss his position. Douglas was reluctant to repeal the Compromise, but was ultimately convinced by Dixon's logic. He concluded the interview by exclaiming [...] "By God, Sir, you are right. I will incorporate it in <b>my</b> <b>bill,</b> though I know it will raise a hell of a storm." [...] Over the next several days, Douglas incorporated Dixon's suggestion and other pro-slavery measures into the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which President Franklin Pierce signed into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E

There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments., and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
