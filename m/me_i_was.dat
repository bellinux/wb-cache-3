5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E
60|$|Shall I {{sneak up}} near to them, keeping my satchel in my hand? I wonder, do they see me? Can they see me, a mere thing like <b>me?</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> within ten feet of them, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{certain that they}} cannot see <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and <b>I</b> feel it, {{absolutely}} invisible.|$|R

25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] because when I did that song, to <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> singing about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E

500|$|Rhodes had {{a tattoo}} of a 142-word {{quotation}} inked onto his leg in November 2008; the passage was originally written by peace activist Marian Williamson. It took five hours to inscribe onto Rhodes' leg. Rhodes {{said he had}} the tattoo done because [...] "I had a few knock-backs when I was younger, when people were telling <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too small, but I’ve always been determined to prove them wrong and I just feel this quotation is appropriate {{for me and my}} life." ...|$|E

Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it.

He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll pardon <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best." ...|$|E
