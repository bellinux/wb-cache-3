5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a <b>Morbillivirus</b> similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E

Recently, we have shown that human signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) is a cellular receptor for measles virus. In this study, we examined whether canine distemper and rinderpest viruses also use canine and bovine SLAMs, respectively, as cellular receptors. The Onderstepoort vaccine strain and two B 95 a (marmoset B cell line) -isolated strains of canine distemper virus caused extensive cytopathic effects in normally resistant CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells after expression of canine SLAM. The Ako vaccine strain of rinderpest virus produced strong cytopathic effects in bovine SLAM-expressing CHO cells. The data on entry with vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes bearing measles, canine distemper, or rinderpest virus envelope proteins were consistent with development of cytopathic effects in SLAM-expressing CHO cell clones after infection with the respective viruses, confirming that SLAM acts at the virus entry step (as a cellular receptor). Furthermore, most measles, canine distemper, and rinderpest virus strains examined could any use of the human, canine, and bovine SLAMs to infect cells.

40|$|The <b>morbilliviruses</b> {{measles virus}} (MeV) and canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) both rely on two surface glycoproteins, the attachment (H) and fusion proteins, to promote fusion activity for viral cell entry. Growing evidence suggests that <b>morbilliviruses</b> infect multiple cell types by binding to distinct host cell surface receptors. Currently, the only known in vivo receptor used by <b>morbilliviruses</b> is CD 150 /SLAM, a molecule expressed in certain immune cells. Here we investigated the usage of multiple receptors by the highly virulent and demyelinating CDV strain A 75 / 17. We based our study {{on the assumption that}} CDV-H may interact with receptors similar to those for MeV, and we conducted systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis on CDV-H throughout one side of the beta-propeller documented in MeV-H to contain multiple receptor-binding sites. Functional and biochemical assays performed with SLAM-expressing cells and primary canine epithelial keratinocytes identified 11 residues mutation of which selectively abrogated fusion in keratinocytes. Among these, four were identical to amino acids identified in MeV-H as residues contacting a putative receptor expressed in polarized epithelial cells. Strikingly, when mapped on a CDV-H structural model, all residues clustered in or around a recessed groove located on one side of CDV-H. In contrast, reported CDV-H mutants with SLAM-dependent fusion deficiencies were characterized by additional impairments to the promotion of fusion in keratinocytes. Furthermore, upon transfer of residues that selectively impaired fusion induction in keratinocytes into the CDV-H of the vaccine strain, fusion remained largely unaltered. Taken together, our results suggest that a restricted region on one side of CDV-H contains distinct and overlapping sites that control functional interaction with multiple receptors...|$|R
40|$|Measles virus (MV) and canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) are <b>morbilliviruses</b> that cause acute illnesses and several persistent central nervous system infections in humans and in dogs, respectively. Characteristically, the cytopathic effect of these viruses is the formation of syncytia in permissive cells. In this study, a vaccinia virus expression system was used to express MV and CDV hemagglutinin (HA) and fusion (F) envelope proteins. We found that cotransfecting F and HA genes of MV or F and HA genes of CDV resulted in extensive syncytium formation in permissive cells while transfecting either F or HA alone did not. Similar experiments with heterologous pairs of proteins, CDV-F with MV-HA or MV-F with CDV-HA, caused significant cell fusion in both cases. These results indicate that in this expression system, cell fusion requires both F and HA; however, the functions of these proteins are interchangeable between {{the two types of}} <b>morbilliviruses.</b> Human-mouse somatic hybrids were used to determine the human chromosome conferring susceptibility to either MV and CDV. Of the 12 hybrids screened, none were sensitive to MV. Two of the hybrids containing human chromosome 19 formed syncytia following CDV infection. In addition, these two hybrids underwent cell fusion when cotransfected with CDV-F and CDV-HA (but not MV-F and MV-HA) glycoproteins by using the vaccinia virus expression system. To discover the viral component responsible for cell specificity, complementation experiments coexpressing CDV-HA with MV-F or CDV-F with MV-HA in the CDV-sensitive hybrids were performed. We found that syncytia were formed only in the presence of CDV-HA. These results support the idea that the HA protein is responsible for cell tropism. Furthermore, while the F protein is necessary for the fusion process, it is interchangeable with the F protein from other <b>morbilliviruses...</b>|$|R

The use of different receptors {{by the human}} pathogen MV has been studied extensively; the current consensus is that wild-type MV uses signalling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, also known as CD 150) as its receptor on the lymphoid cells that are its main target during infection (Erlenhoefer et al., 2001; Hsu et al., 2001; Tatsuo et al., 2000) and another, as-yet-unidentified protein to attach to endothelial and respiratory mucosal cells (Andres et al., 2003; Takeuchi et al., 2003). Cell culture-adapted strains of MV use the ubiquitously expressed protein CD 46 as a receptor (Dörig et al., 1993; Naniche et al., 1993). Little {{is known about the}} receptors for other <b>morbilliviruses,</b> although we have shown previously that CD 46 is not a receptor for virulent or vaccine strains of RPV (Galbraith et al., 1998). Recently, Yanagi and co-workers showed that RPV (cell culture-adapted) and CDV (cell culture-adapted and wild-type) both show improved infection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines permanently expressing SLAM (Seki et al., 2003; Tatsuo et al., 2001). This suggested that SLAM may be a receptor for several, if not all, <b>morbilliviruses.</b> However, cell culture-adapted RPV efficiently infects CHO, Vero and many other common cell-culture lines; given the previous observations that the use of CD 46 as a receptor by MV {{turned out to be a}} result of tissue-culture adaptation, I sought to test whether wild-type RPV uses SLAM as its receptor. We have established rescue systems for both the Plowright vaccine strain (Plowright & Ferris, 1962) of RPV (RBOK) and the virulent parent from which it was derived, Kabete O (KO) (Baron & Barrett, 1997; Baron et al., 2005).

40|$|AbstractThe nucleocapsid protein (N) of <b>morbilliviruses</b> is {{not only}} a major {{structural}} protein but also the most abundant protein made in infected cells. We overexpressed the N proteins of Rinderpest virus and Peste des petits ruminants virus in E. coli, which assemble into nucleocapsids in the absence of viral RNA that resemble nucleocapsids made in the virus-infected cells. Employing these assembled structures resembling subviral particles, we studied the induction of both the antibody response and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in a murine model (BALB/c). A single dose of the purified recombinant nucleocapsids of both viruses {{in the absence of an}} adjuvant induces a strong CTL response. The CTLs generated are antigen specific and cross-reactive with respect to each virus and, furthermore, this CTL response is MHC class I restricted. Based on the prediction for H- 2 d-restricted T-cell motifs we tested the lysis of transfected P 815 (H- 2 d) cells expressing a nine amino acid potential CTL epitope, by splenic T cells in vitro restimulated with bacterially expressed RPV or PPRV N proteins. We extended our study to the bovine system both to analyze the immunogenicity of these recombinant proteins in the natural hosts and to show that PBMC from cattle vaccinated with Rinderpest vaccine proliferate in vitro, in response to restimulation with soluble nucleocapsid proteins. Furthermore, the murine CTL epitope functions in the bovine system as a cytotoxic T-cell epitope.
