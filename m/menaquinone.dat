5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier coenzyme Q10 (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as <b>menaquinone,</b> in addition to ubiquinone.|$|E

25|$|Many bacteria, such as Escherichia coli {{found in}} the large intestine, can {{synthesize}} vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7 or MK-7, up to MK-11), but not vitamin K1 (phylloquinone). In these bacteria, <b>menaquinone</b> transfers two electrons between two different small molecules, during oxygen-independent metabolic energy production processes (anaerobic respiration). For example, a small molecule with an excess of electrons (also called an electron donor) such as lactate, formate, or NADH, {{with the help of}} an enzyme, passes two electrons to <b>menaquinone.</b> The <b>menaquinone,</b> {{with the help of an}}other enzyme, then transfers these two electrons to a suitable oxidant, such fumarate or nitrate (also called an electron acceptor). Adding two electrons to fumarate or nitrate converts the molecule to succinate or nitrite plus water, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{attributed}} the potential {{health benefits of}} vitamin K beyond its function to activate hepatic coagulation factors. Moreover, several {{studies have suggested that}} <b>menaquinones,</b> also known as vitamin K 2, may be more effective in activating extra-hepatic vitamin K-dependent proteins than phylloquinone, also known as vitamin K 1. Nevertheless, present dietary reference values (DRV) for vitamin K are exclusively based on phylloquinone, and its function in coagulation. The present review describes the current knowledge on <b>menaquinones</b> based on the following criteria for setting DRV: optimal dietary intake; nutrient amount required to prevent deficiency, maintain optimal body stores and/or prevent chronic disease; factors influencing requirements such as absorption, metabolism, age and sex. Dietary intake of <b>menaquinones</b> accounts for up to 25 % of total vitamin K intake and contributes to the biological functions of vitamin K. However, <b>menaquinones</b> are different from phylloquinone with respect to their chemical structure and pharmacokinetics, which affects bioavailability, metabolism and perhaps impact on health outcomes. There are significant gaps in the current knowledge on <b>menaquinones</b> based on the criteria for setting DRV.

Methods We investigated the association between intake of phylloquinone and <b>menaquinones</b> with PAD in a prospective cohort with 36, 629 participants. Occurrence of PAD was obtained by linkage to national registries. Baseline intake of phylloquinone and <b>menaquinones</b> was estimated using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio's for the association. Results During 12. 1 years (standard deviation 2. 1 years) of follow-up, 489 incident cases of PAD were documented. <b>Menaquinones</b> intake was associated with a reduced risk of PAD with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 71, 95 % CI; 0. 53 – 0. 95 for the highest versus lowest quartile. A stronger association was observed (p interaction 0. 0001) in participants with hypertension (HRQ 4 versus Q 1 0. 59; 95 % CI 0. 39 – 0. 87) or diabetes (HRQ 4 versus Q 1 0. 56; 95 % CI 0. 18 – 1. 91), though confidence intervals were wide in the small (n =  530) diabetes stratum.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{investigate}} whether dietary phylloquinone and <b>menaquinones</b> intakes {{are related to}} risk of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We used data from a prospective cohort study in 38, 094 Dutch men and women, aged 20 – 70 years. Dietary phylloquinone and <b>menaquinones</b> intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Diabetes case patients were ascertained mainly via self-report and verified against medical records. RESULTS — During 10. 3 years of follow-up, 918 incident cases of diabetes were documented. In a multivariate model adjusting for diabetes risk factors and dietary factors, phylloquinone intake tended to be associated (P � 0. 08) with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 81 (95 % CI 0. 66 – 0. 99) for the highest versus the lowest quartile. For <b>menaquinones</b> intake, a linear, inverse association (P � 0. 038) with risk of type 2 diabetes was observed with an HR of 0. 93 (0. 87 – 1. 00) for each 10 -�g increment in the multivariate model.

40|$|CONTEXT: The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is {{a cluster}} of {{metabolic}} abnormalities and is associated with increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Phylloquinone, <b>menaquinones,</b> and vitamin K status are associated with several components of MetS, but the association with MetS has hardly been studied to date. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine whether the intake and/or status of vitamin K is associated with MetS and its components. DESIGN: This study comprised two cohorts, one of 402 women and one of 400 men (age 40 - 80 y). At followup 625 participants were still alive and willing to participate. Data were analyzed both cross sectionally and longitudinally with Poisson and linear regression adjusted for multiple confounders. Baseline phylloquinone/menaquinone intakes were measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire and vitamin K status with serum desphospho-uncarborxylated matrix-Gla protein level. RESULTS: At baseline 270 (34. 5 %) participants had MetS and 171 (35. 7 %) at followup. Cross sectionally, high <b>menaquinones</b> intakes were associated (P(trend) =. 08) with a lower prevalence of MetS with a prevalence ratio (PR) of 0. 74 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 54 - 1. 03) for the highest vs the lowest tertile. At followup, the highest tertiles of <b>menaquinones</b> intake (PR = 0. 62; 95 % CI, 0. 40 - 0. 95) and vitamin K status (PR = 0. 57; 95 % CI, 0. 38 - 0. 87) were associated (P(trend) =. 01) with a lower occurrence of MetS. These associations were mainly driven by relations with lower triacylglycerol concentrations for <b>menaquinones</b> and lower waist circumference for vitamin K status.
