In this paper, {{we present}} recent work carried on µKlaim, a core {{calculus}} that retains {{most of the}} features of Klaim: explicit process distribution, remote operations, process mobility and asynchronous communication via distributed tuple spaces.

Pattern matching is orthogonal to the underlying computational paradigm of µKlaim, but affects its expressive power.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel matching-adjusted approach to indirectly compare survival estimates for competitive treatment options. Using patient-level {{data for the}} treatment arm and summary patient characteristics and survival outcomes for the comparator, matching variables prognostic for survival are chosen. A program involving an extension of a common SAS ® 9. 2 procedure, PROC SURVEYSELECT, is applied to select 1000 random repeated sub-samples from the original population with the same distribution of <b>matched</b> <b>variables.</b> Using Output Delivery System (ODS) and survival analysis procedures, the survival estimates are computed for each bootstrapped sample and a 95 % confidence interval (CI) is inferred around {{the mean of the}} sampled survival estimates. These outcome measures may then be compared to those reported for the comparator treatment. In the absence of head-to-head randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, comparative effectiveness of treatment outcomes can be evaluated using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison, which accounts for observed differences between populations and results in an effect of treatment exposure on survival outcomes less likely due to confounders...|$|E

Males (relative to females) appear to match fewer characteristics when contacting potential love interests. Conversely, age interaction effects demonstrate that males in their late 60 ’s are increasingly more selective (than females) regarding who they contact.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIdiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is reportedly {{associated with an}} increased risk of lung cancer. However, few studies have explored whether IPF affects the long-term survival of lung cancer patients. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the characteristics of lung cancer in IPF patients and impact of IPF on lung cancer survival. MethodsSeventy IPF patients with histologically proven lung cancer were identified through a search of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital database between 2003 and 2012. Of these, 33 patients who had undergone surgery were matched with 66 patients who had lung cancer without IPF. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> included age, sex, histologic type, and lung cancer stage. ResultsOf the 70 subjects, 94 % were male, and the mean age was 70 years (range, 46 – 90). In total, 81 % of the tumors were located in the lung periphery, and 56 % were in the lower lobe. The majority of cancers (70 %) were observed in the fibrotic area on chest computed tomography scans. The most frequent histologic type was squamous cell carcinoma (40 %). Among surgically treated patients (33 cases and 66 controls), the 5 -year survival rates were 38 % for lung cancer patients with IPF and 73 % for those without IPF (p =  0. 001). ConclusionsSquamous cell carcinoma was the most common type of lung cancer in IPF patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if the consumption of certain foods during the year prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 D) was associated with the risk of developing T 1 D in children and youth residing in Prince Edward Island, Canada. METHODS: Cases (n = 57) consisted of newly diagnosed patients with T 1 D during 2001 to 2004. Controls (n = 105) were randomly selected from the province's population, and matched to cases by age at diagnosis and sex. Food consumption in cases and controls was assessed using two previously validated food frequency questionnaires, and a survey was developed to collect information on potential environmental and genetic risk factors. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was nine years, and 67 % of cases were male. After controlling for the <b>matched</b> <b>variables</b> and four significant environmental and genetic risk factors (family members with T 1 D, the number of infections during the first two years of life, place of residence, and father's education) in the final logistic regression model, the consumption of regular soft drinks (OR = 2. 78, 95 % CI = 1. 21, 6. 36) and eggs (OR = 2. 50, 95 % CI = 1. 09, 5. 75) were significant risk factors of T 1 D, when consumed once per week or more often.

40|$|Background: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) has {{not only}} been associated with best functional outcomes but also with higher dislocation risk when compared with bipolar hemiarthroplasty (HA). The functionality and {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) of patients treated with THA or HA for intracapsular hip fracture (IHF) have been scarcely investigated in comparison with the preoperative status. Methods: Two comparable groups of 60 patients with an IHF who had undergone either THA or bipolar HA were created matching several preoperative characteristics. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> included age, gender, body mass index, surgical delay, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, comorbidity, cognitive status, educational status, prefracture functional status, and radiographic fracture classification. Patients were prospectively followed up for 1 year using telephone interviews. Results: The ambulatory ability (5 -item scale) and ADL Index significantly decreased in both the groups in comparison with the prefracture status at the 4 -month and 1 -year follow-up. The need for walking aids (5 -item scale) at 4 months was significantly higher among patients who had undergone HA. Lower scores on the ADL Index were recorded among patients with HA in comparison with those with THA at 4 months and 1 year. No significant differences in ambulatory ability, complication rate, and mortality were detected between the 2 groups although HA and THA were associated with a tendency to a higher prevalence of general and local complications, respectively. Conclusion: THA provides better short-term results in terms of ADLs and allows early discontinuation in the use of walking aids as compared with bipolar HA in elderly cognitively intact patients with IHF...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The authors {{sought to}} define which guideline-advocated therapies are {{associated}} with the greatest benefit with respect to 6 -month survival in patients hospitalised with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors conducted a nested case-control study of ACS patients within the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events cohort between April 1999 and December 2007. The cases were ACS patients who survived to discharge but died within 6 months. The controls were patients who survived to 6 months, matched for ACS diagnosis, age and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score. Rates of use of evidence-based medications and coronary interventions (angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery) were compared. Logistic regression including <b>matched</b> <b>variables</b> was used, and the attributable mortality from incomplete application of each therapy was calculated. A total of 1716 cases and 3432 controls were identified. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention were associated with the greatest 6 -month survival benefit (OR for death 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 39 to 0. 90) and 0. 57 (0. 48 to 0. 72), respectively). Statins and clopidogrel provided the greatest independent pharmacologic benefit (ORs for death 0. 85 (0. 73 to 0. 99) and 0. 84 (0. 72 to 0. 99)) with lesser effects seen with other pharmacotherapies.

40|$|We {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} whether diabetes {{is associated with}} progression in coronary plaque components. We identified 142 study subjects undergoing serial coronary computed tomography angiography. The resulting propensity score was applied 1 : 1 to match diabetic patients to non-diabetic patients for clinical risk factors, prior coronary stenting, coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and the serial scan interval, resulting in the 71 diabetes and 71 non-diabetes patients. Coronary plaque (total, calcified, non-calcified including fibrous, fibrous-fatty and low attenuation plaque [LAP]) volume normalized by total coronary artery length was measured using semi-automated plaque software and its change overtime between diabetic and non-diabetic patients was evaluated. The matching was successful without {{significant differences between the}} two groups in all <b>matched</b> <b>variables.</b> The baseline volumes in each plaque also did not differ. During a mean scan interval of 3. 4  ±  1. 8 years, diabetic patients showed a 2 -fold greater progression in normalized total plaque volume (TPV) than non-diabetes patients (52. 8  mm(3) vs. 118. 3  mm(3), p =  0. 005). Multivariable linear regression model revealed that diabetes was associated with normalized TPV progression (β 72. 3, 95 %CI 24. 3 - 120. 3). A similar trend was observed for the non-calcified components, but not calcified plaque (β 3. 8, 95 %CI - 27. 0 - 34. 7). Higher baseline CAC score was found to be associated with total, non-calcified and calcified plaque progression. However, baseline non-calcified volume but not CAC score was associated with LAP progression. The current study among matched patients indicates diabetes is associated with a greater plaque progression.

40|$|International audienceObjectives: Craving {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the development and maintenance of alcohol dependence and in relapse after periods of abstinence. Anti-craving compounds, such as acamprosate, naltrexone or serotonergic compounds, are found to be only moderately effective. These moderate effects might be due to inadequate matching of specific patients to specific treatments. In 1999, Verheul et al. proposed a three-pathway model of craving in alcoholics, which hypothesised that reward drinkers would better respond to naltrexone, relief drinkers to acamprosate and obsessive drinkers to serotonergic compounds. However, these matching hypotheses are not yet validated. This article reviews the literature on predictors and <b>matching</b> <b>variables</b> of the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions in alcohol dependent patients directed at the reduction of craving and the prevention of relapse. Methods: Studies were selected through a literature search in September 2004, focusing on <b>matching</b> or predicting <b>variables</b> for anti-craving compounds in the treatment of alcoholics. <b>Matching</b> or predicting <b>variables</b> were categorised as either phenotypic (e. g., level of baseline anxiety), endophenotypic (e. g., physiological cue reactivity) or genetic (e. g., m opioid receptor polymorphisms). Results: Studies using clinical or phenotypic effect modifiers have produced inconsistent and rather disappointing results. In contrast, the predictive value of genetic effect modifiers are quite promising (e. g., m opioid receptor polymorphisms). No studies that looked at endophenotypic predicting or <b>matching</b> <b>variables</b> were identified. Conclusion: It is concluded that phenotypic <b>matching</b> <b>variables</b> might be too distal, i. e., far removed from the pathogenic process, and that matching research should shift its attention toward more proximal variables (e. g., genetic and endophenotypic variables) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{demonstrated}} a relationship between the clinical syndrome of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypertension. There is also an excess of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in subjects with OSA, but studies examining important clinical endpoints of cardiovascular disease, e. g. left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in OSA subjects have produced conflicting results. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects clinically silent abnormalities relating to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease, which are seen as small areas of high signal foci in deep white matter (DWM) and lacunae. These lesions are permanent and known to be associated with stroke, age, hypertension, LVH and carotid atherosclerosis. We performed a case control study of cerebral MRI in patients with OSA and closely matched controls. 37 sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness were matched to 37 controls without evidence of OSA on a sleep study. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension and history of ischaemic heart disease. 24 -hour ABP recordings were performed in all subjects, and before treatment in the patients with OSA.

Lacunae/high signal foci in DWM were present in 15 (40 %) OSA subjects and 19 (51 %) controls, despite significant increases in mean daytime diastolic blood pressure (5. 0 mmHg,p< 0. 05) and nighttime diastolic (7. 8 mmHg,p< 0. 001) and systolic blood pressures (11. 7 mmHg,p< 0. 05).

We compare the freedom from atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing both methods with identical lesion sets. MethodsRadiofrequency ablation was used to create full Cox maze lesions in 56 patients between January 2002 and February 2005; these patients were matched with those who underwent the standard cut-and-sew method. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> were gender (33 male, 23 female, both), age (67. 5 vs 67. 2 years), New York Heart Association class (mean 2. 28 vs 1. 96), atrial fibrillation type (37 paroxysmal, 19 continuous, both), and concomitant mitral valve surgery (37 in both). Hypertension, preoperative left atrial size, and preoperative duration of atrial fibrillation were similar between groups. ResultsWhen compared with matched controls, fewer patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation were free from atrial fibrillation at dismissal (63 % vs 88 %; P =. 0039) and at last follow-up (62 % vs 92 %; P =. 016). According to logistic regression for matched pairs, patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation were 4. 5 {{times more likely to}} be in atrial fibrillation at dismissal (95 % confidence intervals [CI], 1. 8, 10. 9) and 5 {{times more likely to be}} in atrial fibrillation at follow-up (95 % CI, 1. 4, 17. 3). No other covariate was associated with atrial fibrillation status at hospital dismissal or follow-up.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control study of patients with OSA attending a specialist sleep clinic and matched control subjects drawn from the normal community. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness, matched to 45 control subjects without excessive sleepiness or evidence of OSA on a sleep study. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All subjects underwent 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings (before treatment in OSA patients) and sagittal T 1, axial T 2, and coronal dual echo cerebral MRI imaging to detect clinically silent abnormalities related to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease; areas of high signal foci in deep white matter (DWM), lacunae, and periventricular hyperintensity. Lacunae/high signal foci in DWM and/or periventricular hyperintensity were present in 15 (33 %) OSA subjects and 16 (35 %) controls, despite significant increases in mean daytime diastolic blood pressure (4. 6 mmHg, p< 0. 05), and both nighttime diastolic (7. 2 mmHg, p< 0. 001) and systolic blood pressures (9. 2 mmHg, p< 0. 05) in OSA subjects. These data exclude more than a 17 % excess prevalence of MRI detected minor cerebrovascular disease in the OSA patients, with 95 % confidence.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{considerable}} debate regarding {{the relationship between}} obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypertension. It is unclear whether OSA is an independent vascular risk factor as studies attempting to assess this association have produced conflicting results because of confounding variables such as upper body obesity, alcohol, and smoking. A case-control study of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure was undertaken in patients with OSA and matched controls to assess whether OSA is an independent correlate of diurnal hypertension. METHODS: Forty five patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness were matched with 45 controls without OSA in a sleep study. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol, cigarette usage, treated hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease. Upper body obesity was compared by waist:hip and waist:height ratios; 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed (before treatment for OSA) in all subjects. RESULTS: Patients with OSA had significantly increased mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) during both daytime (87. 4 (10. 2) versus 82. 8 (9. 1); p= 0. 03, mean difference 4. 6 (95 % CI 0. 7 to 8. 6) and night time (78. 6 (9. 3) versus 71. 4 (8. 0); p< 0. 001, mean difference 7. 2 (95 % CI 3. 7 to 10. 6)), and higher systolic blood pressure at night (119. 4 (20. 7) versus 110. 2 (13. 9); p= 0. 01, mean difference 9. 2 (95 % CI 2. 3 to 16. 1)). The nocturnal reduction in blood pressure ("dipping") was smaller in patients with OSA than in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with closely matched control subjects, patients with OSA have increased ambulatory diastolic blood pressure during both day and night, and increased systolic blood pressure at night.

We performed a case control study of 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in patients with OSA, compared to closely matched controls from the general population, to assess whether OSA is an independent contributor to diurnal hypertension. 45 sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness were matched to 45 controls without evidence of OSA on a sleep study. <b>Matched</b> <b>variables</b> included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension and history of ischaemic heart disease. Upper body obesity was measured using waist:hip and waist:height ratios. 24 -hour ABP recordings were performed in all subjects, and before treatment in the patients with OSA. Compared to controls, OSA patients had significantly increased mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during both the daytime (87. 4 (10. 2) versus 82. 8 (9. 1) mmHg, p< 0. 05) and night-time (78. 6 (9. 3) versus 71. 4 (8. 0), p< 0. 001), and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) at night (119. 4 (20. 7) versus 110. 2 (13. 9), p< 0. 05). There was less nocturnal reduction in SBP ("dipping") in patients with OSA (day to night fall SBP, 13. 5 v 21. 0 mmHg, p< 0. 005). The relatively increased nocturnal SBP in patients with OSA persisted briefly into the morning. Compared to closely matched control subjects, patients with OSA have increased DBP during both day and night, and increased SBP at night. The magnitude, of these differences is such that by extrapolation it should carry increased relative risk of cardiovascular morbidity. Further studies are required to establish whether cardiovascular morbidity is in fact raised and whether treatment of OSA reduces blood pressure and its complications...|$|E
