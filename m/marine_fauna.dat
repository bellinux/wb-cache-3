25|$|Agriculture was {{introduced}} to the region around 400 AD to the present. Poor soil and the unreliability of rainfall reduced the viability of agriculture as a reliable subsistence pattern. Throughout the course of the occupation of Chibuene, the inhabitants practiced a broad subsistence economy with the utilization of domestic animals, <b>marine</b> <b>fauna,</b> and wild plant life to augment agricultural production. Of particular significance to the site was the distinctive emphasis on <b>marine</b> <b>fauna</b> in the diets of the inhabitants. The 1995 excavations from a Swedish sponsored team revealed a rather high proportion of fish remains in comparison to sites in South Africa. The faunal remains of shark and turtle were notable features of the site. Shark fishing and turtle hunting are subsistence strategies more associated with East African, or Swahili coast, sites beginning in the first millennium, revealing a closer affinity of Chibuene to sites further north than the southern interior.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{potential}} abandonment of Chibuene, the surrounding region saw a dramatic shift to increased agricultural subsistence. At {{the same time}} of this shift, {{it is evident that}} the site began to become under the influence of Manyikeni, a Zimbabwean stone complex 50km northwest of the site. Chibuene appeared to have become a tributary and redeveloped under the influence of Manyikeni. The increased use of agriculture likely served as an adaptive strategy {{to make up for the}} decreased availability of trade in the region. Furthermore, the climactic composition of the region largely remained the same as the previous occupation with sparse and unreliable rainfall, combined with low nutrient soil, further suggesting a relationship. Domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats remain in the faunal assemblages, suggesting their continued use as a buffer during periods of lower agricultural production. In addition, <b>marine</b> <b>fauna</b> remained an important part of the diets of individuals occupying the site.|$|E

60|$|Turning to the sea, we {{find the}} same law. No two <b>marine</b> <b>faunas</b> are more distinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, {{than those of the}} eastern and western shores of South and Central America; yet these great faunas are {{separated}} only by the narrow, but impassable, isthmus of Panama. Westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends, with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the Pacific, with another and totally distinct fauna. So that here three <b>marine</b> <b>faunas</b> range far northward and southward, in parallel lines not far from each other, under corresponding climates; but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they are wholly distinct. On the other hand, proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts, until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and distinct <b>marine</b> <b>faunas.</b> Although hardly one shell, crab or fish is common to the above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fish range from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the Pacific {349} and the eastern shores of Africa, on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude.|$|R

40|$|The Devonian to Permian ostracode assemblages in Belgium may be {{subdivided}} in {{six major}} groups characterizing non-marine through «brackish» and shallow marine into deep marine shelf and «basin» environment. A broad-brush review of their stratigraphical distribution reveals that mixed <b>marine</b> <b>faunas</b> {{are the most}} widely extended in the Devonian and Carboniferous. Following the Caledonian orogeny there are tendencies towards «brackish-water» (oligohaline?) assemblages during the Lower Devonian. But since the Givetian also open marine shelf associations are found and even Entomozoans and Thuringian-type ostracodes (indicative for «deep shelf» to «basin») in the Upper Frasnian and basal Upper Famennian. This succession suggests a transgressive trend for the overall depositional environment, reaching its acme in the Late Devonian. The subsequent regressive tendency starts in the late Famennian (Fa 2 c) and Dinantian with the frequent occurrence of mixed marine assemblages which alternate {{in time and space}} with open <b>marine</b> shelf <b>faunas.</b> The culmination of this overall regression in Westphalian times is marked by the successive appearance of «brackish- water» and non-marine ostracode assemblages followed by the disappearance of, respectively, the mixed <b>marine</b> <b>faunas</b> (base Westphalian C) and «brackish-water» ostracodes (Upper Westphalian C). The isolated occurrence of a «brackish-water» ostracode in the red beds of the Thuringian reflects a short- lived marine incursion during that period. Some examples of shallow marine nearshore («mixed marine» and «brackish-water») assemblages from the Upper Famennian to Permian are shown, which have been dated by miospores...|$|R

The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base giving way upwards into sandstones. Just before the paleogene which included the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent, marine Upnor Beds were deposited in Surrey. In the paleogene, Southern England slightly rose and the seas retreated and reddish and mottled clays of the Reading Beds were deposited by a large river sand delta system including {{across much of the}} Weald (which covers much of Sussex and Kent as well). [...] Later, a rise in sea level, around 50 million years ago caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the London Clay across the county. The London Clay is a bluish-grey marine clay with isolated pockets of fossils especially where chalkier.
