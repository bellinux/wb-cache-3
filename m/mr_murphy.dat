ODOT hoped that establishing US-412 in Oklahoma would generate new recreational traffic, thus benefiting the state economically. The new western terminus was to become the US-183/US-270 junction in Woodward; from there, the highway extended for [...] to the east, exiting the state in West Siloam Springs. The Transportation Commission approved the recommendation unanimously.|$|E

It has reduced the people to a state of utter despair. Each town in the district is forced to bring a certain quantity to the headquarters of the Commissary every Sunday. It is collected by force; the soldiers drive the people into the bush; if they will not go they are shot down, their left hands being cut off and taken as trophies to the Commissary. The soldiers do not care whom they shoot down, and they most often shoot poor, helpless women and harmless children. These hands--the hands of men, women and children--are placed in rows before the Commissary, who counts them to see the soldiers have not wasted the cartridges. The Commissary is paid a commission of about a penny per pound upon all the rubber he gets; it is, therefore, to his interest to get as much as he can." ...|$|E

6000|$|Murphy, {{according}} to his biographer, “possessed {{the first and second}} floors of a very pleasant, neat house, where there was a long gravel walk in the garden; {27b} and though his library had been much diminished, yet, in the remaining part, he took care to reserve the Elzevir editions of the classics. Mrs. Mangeon (the mistress of the house) was a neat and intelligent woman, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Murphy</b> secured her friendship by giving her son a presentation to Christ’s Hospital. Anne Dunn, his own servant-maid, was an excellent servant, honest, faithful, and attentive; so that, what with the services he had rendered to the mistress of the house, and what with the intrinsic fidelity of his female domestic, he could put the whole family into a state of requisition, and command an elegant table, as well as ready attention, upon any particular occasion. Such was the situation of a man of genius, and an author, in the decline of a long life, and in a country at the highest pitch of grandeur and wealth. But it must be remembered, that the comforts he possessed were not derived from the profits of literature.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{inference}} I {{would draw}} from {{this class of}} phenomena is, that a superior intelligence has guided the development of man in a definite direction, and for a special purpose, just as man guides the development of many animal and vegetable forms. The laws of evolution alone would, perhaps, never have produced a grain so well adapted to man's use as wheat and maize; such fruits as the seedless banana and bread-fruit; or such animals as the Guernsey milch cow, or the London dray-horse. Yet these so closely resemble the unaided productions of nature, that we may well imagine a being who had mastered the laws of development of organic forms through past ages, refusing to believe that any new power had been concerned in their production, and scornfully rejecting the theory (as my theory will be rejected by many who agree with me on other points), that in these few cases a controlling intelligence had directed {{the action of the}} laws of variation, multiplication, and survival, for his own purposes. We know, however, that this has been done; and we must therefore admit the possibility that, if we are not the highest intelligences in the universe, some higher intelligence may have directed the process by which the human race was developed, by means of more subtle agencies than we are acquainted with. At the same time I must confess, that this theory has the disadvantage of requiring the intervention of some distinct individual intelligence, to aid in the production of what we can hardly avoid considering as the ultimate aim and outcome of all organized existence--intellectual, ever-advancing, spiritual man. It therefore implies, that the great laws which govern the material universe were insufficient for his production, unless we consider (as we may fairly do) that the controlling action of such higher intelligences is a necessary part of those laws, just as the action of all surrounding organisms is one of the agencies in organic development. But even if my particular view should not be the true one, the difficulties I have put forward remain, and I think prove, that some more general and more fundamental law underlies that of [...] "natural selection." [...] The law of [...] "unconscious intelligence" [...] pervading all organic nature, put forth by Dr. Laycock and adopted by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Murphy,</b> is such a law; but to my mind it has the double disadvantage of being both unintelligible and incapable of any kind of proof. It is more probable, that the true law lies too deep for us to discover it; but there seems to me, to be ample indications that such a law does exist, and is probably connected with the absolute origin of life and organization.

5000|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} {{that at least}} some if not all of the disappearances were due to a possible serial killer, acting either alone or with an accomplice, in the Leinster area in the 1990s.

He was attempting to strangle her in a wooded area of the Wicklow Mountains at night when he was surprised by two hunters who happened upon the scene and intervened, saving the woman. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Murphy</b> has maintained that he is unconnected with the disappearances and has been questioned on the cases on numerous occasions by the police. To date there has been no solid evidence connecting <b>Mr.</b> <b>Murphy</b> with the disappearances. [...] It is widely known, though, that <b>Mr</b> <b>Murphy,</b> a carpenter, had completed some work in a shop owned by Ms. Jacob's grandmother. Ms. Jacob's mother was interviewed on the Ray Darcy show saying that they knew Ms. Jacob's killer and that it wasn't Larry Murphy. Other commentators frequently cite that since Larry Murphy was imprisoned throughout most of the 2000s no other women have disappeared until 2012.
