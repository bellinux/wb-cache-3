5000|$|In the CD era (post 1983), the {{top line}} Nakamichi {{products}} were termed the [...] "Dragon." [...] The Dragon-CT turntable ("Computing Turntable") automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records {{by moving the}} platter in two dimensions. The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD, and holds multiple CDs. The Dragon cassette deck used a special microprocessor controlled azimuth adjustment called Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction (NAAC) {{to find the best}} sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. The solution (thought by some to be a gimmick) was to automate the <b>manual</b> <b>turnover</b> of tape; in other words eject the tape and flip it around to maintain proper tape head alignment. Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the Akai GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to [...] "actually" [...] use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The two {{tracks on}} Cook's {{binaural}} discs had different equalization curves. The RIAA equalization standard {{had not yet}} been adopted when Cook began his work. The bass turnover of 500 Hz on both tracks and the rolloff of 0 on the inside band and -11 on the outside band were meant to allow for greater modulation in the recording. As the two pickups required two preamps and HiFi preamps of the day included <b>manual</b> settings for <b>turnover</b> and rolloff, the difference in equalization was not a particular burden. Nevertheless, Cook designed and sold a two-channel preamp meant for binaural playback. While this preamp did not allow for the <b>manual</b> setting of <b>turnover</b> and rolloff of other manufacturers' disks, it did work for Cook-type binaural records. Livingston had also come out with a [...] "stereophonic" [...] integrated amplifier (i.e., including the preamps) by 1954.|$|R
