40|$|Abstract. In this {{research}} we present multi-body dynamics analysis {{can be applied}} in product development using {{a case study of}} a Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) with a spring-actuated linkage, which can save time and cost considerably. In particular, we demonstrate how to evaluate and improve durability of the MCCB based on multi-body dynamics and finite element simulation given SM 45 C steel used for the MCCB links. Toward this goal, a 3 D MCCB dynamic model is first developed and dynamic forces are analyzed by using the multi-body dynamics software, ADAMS. Finite element simulation is then performed to examine <b>maximum</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stresses</b> considering deflections and dynamic loads. Further, mechanical properties of SM 45 C steel are measured experimentally from tensile and fatigue tests. As a result, we verify that stress loads acting on the latch pin of the spring-actuated linkage are critically higher, which ultimately leads to a low-cycle fatigue fracture of the pin. Based on our analytically estimated <b>maximum</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stresses</b> in the MCCB and experimentally measured mechanical properties of SM 45 C steel, we evaluate design durability and improve our design. As a result, using a 4 mm diameter pin and modifying SM 45 C with heat treating that includes quenching and tempering, we successfully achieve a MCCB product development, which provides sufficient strengths to prevent yielding and fatigue failures from repeated dynamic loads...|$|R

50|$|Both the {{bending moment}} and the shear force cause {{stresses}} in the beam. The stress due to shear force is maximum along the neutral {{axis of the}} beam (when {{the width of the}} beam, t, is constant along the cross section of the beam; otherwise an integral involving the first moment and the beam's width needs to be evaluated for the particular cross section), and the maximum tensile stress is at either the top or bottom surfaces. Thus the <b>maximum</b> <b>principal</b> <b>stress</b> in the beam may be neither at the surface nor at the center but in some general area. However, shear force stresses are negligible in comparison to bending moment stresses in all but the stockiest of beams as well as the fact that stress concentrations commonly occur at surfaces, meaning that the maximum stress in a beam is likely to be at the surface.|$|E
