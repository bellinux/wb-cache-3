5000|$|All the schemes {{of basic}} and {{supplementary}} pensions in France {{work on the}} method of distribution. The schemes redistribute every year, {{in the form of}} pensions paid to retirees, contributions received that year from the assets. If the rules of the various pension plans in France correspond to different concepts, however they are based on common principles. All schemes incorporate mechanisms of solidarity: solidarity between generations (principle of distribution) and solidarity within a single generation (large redistributions between different occupational groups and gender). These principles of solidarity occurs both in the regimes, between the regimes and beyond regimes at the national level. There are transfers between the schemes, and therefore solidarity between the basic schemes, as well as mechanisms for schemes coordination. Solidarity at the national level consists of the <b>minimum</b> <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> assigned to all seniors who have limited resources, paid by the solidarity fund retirement (which also pay some family benefits), but also of state subsidies granted to certain regimes (farmers, SNCF, RATP, mining, marine ...), and finally of various taxes allocated to pensions. The retirement system in France is organized into three levels: a compulsory system, a scheme often mandatory, and optional arrangements.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{economic}} {{developments in}} Slovenia during 1990 – 96. Slovenia experienced its first positive real GDP growth in 1993. Real GDP grew by 1. 3 percent. This modest recovery began under the impetus of buoyant domestic demand, which grew by 8 Â¼ percent; real foreign demand contracted by 6 Â½ percent owing to a recession in Western markets. Despite {{the growth in}} real aggregate demand by more than 2 percent, the output response was dampened as domestic demand growth spilled primarily into a boom in consumer goods imports.

40|$|The topicality of the {{research}} subject. The foundations of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> scheme based on notional accounts, {{also referred to as}} the "notional defined contribution" or "non-financial defined contribution" (NDC) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> scheme, were laid in Sweden in 1994, when the prevailing view was that a sus­tainable defined-contribution PAYG <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> scheme is impossible. Since then, the NDC system modifications have been implemented in several countries; since 2000, this scheme is also part of the Latvian pension system and works significantly better than {{the other part of the}} pension system - the funded pension scheme. However, the sustainability of NDC scheme is still being questioned. To prevent the NDC pension system sustainability problems, the authors (Pukis, M., & Dundure, I., 2012) in their publication "The Sustainability of the Pension System in Latvia" and (Dundure, I., 2015), the article "Sustainable <b>Old-age</b> <b>Pension</b> System by Developing Notional Defined Contribution Pension Scheme" have proposed a modified NDC model that provides sustainability of the pension system considering the known risks inherent in the pension system. The aim of the paper is to research and analyse the conditions for building a sustainable pension system by developing a Notional Defined Contribution pension scheme and working out an adjusted (modified) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> calculation formula. In order to achieve the above mentioned aim, the authors set the following tasks:Define the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system based on NDC principles;Define the primary objectives of pension systems and perform analysis of pension adequacy;Define the conditions for achieving a sustainable <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system based on NDC principles;Develop an adjusted (modified) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> calculation formula based on NDC principles. In order to achieve the established aim and tasks, the following scientific research methods have been used in the work: analytical method, comparative method, logically and abstractedly constructive method. The analytical method and the comparative method are employed for conducting pension adequacy analysis and examination of pension capital indexation and indexation of pensions after retirement, as well as for the purpose of studying the Notional Defined Contribution pension system. The logically and abstractedly constructive method is employed for making forecasts and defining the main research results – the conditions for ensuring pension system sustainability that have been determined by the authors in the course of {{the research}}.

Using survey data collected by the authors, this paper examines a host of factors which influence migrant workers’ participation in the old-age scheme. The result shows that individual characteristics, employment status, attitudes toward old-age support and perception of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system significantly differentiate two groups of migrant workers between those that have participated in and their counterparts who have not participated in the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> schemes.

The <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant is the second-largest social grant {{in terms of the number}} of recipients and the largest when it comes to the monetary cost for the national government. The study looked at households in Kwakwatsi township receiving an <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant as the main source of income. The state’s <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant is used only for sustenance, and for buying basic household necessities. Food is the biggest household expenditure for pension grant recipients. The pension grant is also used to support additional family members, thereby reducing its distributional impact. Households spend the grant mainly on products that support the daily functioning of the household.

The basic <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> is NIS 1,531 a month, which rises to NIS 1,617 a month after the pensioner turns 80. A seniority increment is added based on the amount of years the pensioner paid contributions, up to a maximum of 50% of the basic pension. Additional increments are available to those living with spouses who do not qualify for an <b>old-age</b> <b>pension,</b> dependent children, and those who are not entitled to a pension or only a small pension which they must first waive. Income supplements to ensure a minimal standard of living are available to those with no additional sources of income other than an <b>old-age</b> <b>pension.</b> Health insurance contributions are deducted from pensions, as well as increments and supplements. Salaried employees not covered by collectively-bargained pension plans with unions are legally required to have private pension plans to which employers must contribute to, and most self-employed persons are also legally required to have private pensions.|$|R

Based on data collected from 1991 - 2009, this analysis centers on the system’s patterns of development and identifies four main attempts to reform the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system. Economic performance, demographic aging, domestic political constellations, and external influence are traditionally thought to be responsible for the pension system reforms. Qualitative data analyses and in-depth interviews have been used to test these explanations. This analysis did not confirm the hypotheses, but it revealed that fiscal constraints and international technical assistance were the main factors behind reforms during the first two chronological attempts to change the system. Political factors and liberal economic ideology influenced the patterns of <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> policy development from 2004 – 2008, while the negative outcomes of the Russian-Georgian War and World Financial Crisis are currently the major obstacles for comprehensive pension reforms. The limitations of this study suggest that in order to clarify the exact nature of <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system, shorter time periods and separate reform initiatives should be investigated...|$|R
