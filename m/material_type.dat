25|$|More {{sophisticated}} algorithms {{depend on}} the <b>material</b> <b>type</b> covered. Organic compounds might be searched for {{on the basis of}} certain molecular fragments. Inorganic compounds, on the other hand, might be of interest with regard to a certain type of coordination geometry. More advanced algorithms deal with conformation analysis (organics), supramolecular chemistry (organics), interpolyhedral connectivity (‘non-organics’) and higher-order molecular structures (biological macromolecules). Search algorithms used for a more complex analysis of physical properties, e.g. phase transitions or structure-property relationships, might apply group-theoretical concepts.|$|E

40|$|Outdoor scene {{classification}} {{is challenging}} due to irregular geometry, uncontrolled illumination, and noisy reflectance distributions. This paper discusses a Bayesian approach to classifying a color {{image of an}} outdoor scene. A likelihood model factors in the physics of the image formation process, the sensor noise distribution, and prior distributions over geometry, <b>material</b> <b>types,</b> and illuminant spectrum parameters. These prior distributions are learned through a training process that uses color observations of planar scene patches over time. An iterative linear algorithm estimates the maximum likelihood reflectance, spectrum, geometry, and object class labels for a new image. Experiments on images taken by outdoor surveillance cameras classify known <b>material</b> <b>types</b> and shadow regions correctly, and flag as outliers <b>material</b> <b>types</b> that were not seen previously. 1...|$|R
2500|$|The bulk {{analysis}} of oil, which yields a complicated mixture of organic compounds, obscures {{much of the}} valuable information. Switching to compound-specific study greatly expanded our understanding of hydrogen isotopes of oil. Analyzing deuterium content at the compound level avoids problems from differences in exchange rates, simplifies sources and products relationships, and draws a much more detailed picture. δD of n-alkanes are generally thought to be representative of oil as they are the major components. Schimmelmann et al. confirmed that alkane fractions have almost the same D/H ratios as whole oils. Depending on source <b>material</b> <b>type</b> and maturity, δD of n-alkanes can vary from -100‰ to -180‰. A common phenomenon of various oil and matured rock derived n-alkanes is a trend of increasing δD with chain length. For example, Li et al. analyzed oils from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin and found δD increased between 20‰ and 40‰ from C13 to C27. This [...] "isotope slope" [...] is an artifact of kinetic fractionation associated with thermal cracking of carbon chains. [...] This trend has been experimentally reproduced and theoretically modeled by Tang et al.|$|E
60|$|It chanced, also, {{that this}} {{afternoon}} {{some of the}} male workers had added to their usual solidity a singular trance-like intoxication. It had often struck him before {{as a form of}} drunkenness peculiar to the St. Kentigern laborers. Men passed him singly and silently, as if following some vague alcoholic dream, or moving through some Scotch mist of whiskey and water. Others clung unsteadily but as silently together, with no trace of convivial fellowship or hilarity in their dull fixed features and mechanically moving limbs. There was something weird in this mirthless companionship, and the appalling loneliness of those fixed or abstracted eyes. Suddenly he was aware of two men who were reeling toward him under the influence of this drug-like intoxication, and he was startled by a likeness which one of them bore to some one he had seen; but where, and under what circumstances, he could not determine. The fatuous eye, the features of complacent vanity and self-satisfied reverie were there, either intensified by drink, or perhaps suggesting it through some other equally hopeless form of hallucination. He turned and followed the man, trying to identify him through his companion, who appeared to be a petty tradesman of a shrewder, more <b>material</b> <b>type.</b> But in vain, and as the pair turned into a side street the consul slowly retraced his steps. But he had not proceeded far before the recollection that had escaped him returned, and he knew that the likeness suggested by the face he had seen was that of Malcolm McHulish.|$|E
60|$|It is {{my private}} opinion that, at {{this period of}} his life, Hollingsworth was fast going mad; and, as with other crazy people (among whom I include humorists of every degree), it {{required}} all the constancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him an intolerable bore. Such prolonged fiddling upon one string--such multiform presentation of one idea! His specific object (of which he made the public more than sufficiently aware, {{through the medium of}} lectures and pamphlets) was to obtain funds for the construction of an edifice, with a sort of collegiate endowment. On this foundation he purposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental culture of our criminal brethren. His visionary edifice was Hollingsworth's one castle in the air; it was the <b>material</b> <b>type</b> in which his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself; and he made the scheme more definite, and caught hold of it the more strongly, and kept his clutch the more pertinaciously, by rendering it visible to the bodily eye. I have seen him, a hundred times, with a pencil and sheet of paper, sketching the facade, the side-view, or the rear of the structure, or planning the internal arrangements, as lovingly as another man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be happy with his wife and children. I have known him to begin a model of the building with little stones, gathered at the brookside, whither we had gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time. Unlike all other ghosts, his spirit haunted an edifice, which, instead of being time-worn, and full of storied love, and joy, and sorrow, had never yet come into existence.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new media types, many seemingly without counterparts in the non-digital world, challenges the readiness of existing knowledge organization schemes to accommodate them. A knowledge organization scheme based on a faceted analysis of existing classes of bibliographic materials is likely to accommodate new developments better than one based {{on a list of}} unanalyzed <b>material</b> <b>types.</b> The faceted analysis undertaken here, in which seven facets are recognized (content, generation of content, recording of content, publication/distribution, physical characteristics, perception/use, and relationships) shows the inadequacy of the traditional view of the bibliographic community of a fundamental distinction between content and carrier; interaction between content and carrier is common and enters into the characterization of <b>material</b> <b>types.</b> The facet analysis is validated by applying it to two new <b>material</b> <b>types,</b> wikis and blogs...|$|R
30|$|Currently 42 <b>material</b> <b>types</b> {{are listed}} in the {{database}} ([URL] The <b>type</b> of <b>material</b> may bias, or result in greater scatter of, estimates of direction (e.g., Castro and Brown (1987); Pavón-Carrasco et al.

We have broadly split materials into archeological and volcanic and these two categories {{are listed in}} the magnetic data results table (‘Archeo/volcanic’, Additional file 1 : Table S 1). This distinction is based upon composition (for example, lavas have naturally complex mineralogy that are varied and vastly different to fired clay) and to possible differences in the paleomagnetic results obtained by archeological and volcanic materials (see references above). The majority of <b>material</b> <b>types</b> listed in the database are archeological. Currently, only three are volcanic: lavas, volcanic ash deposits, and ‘other or unspecified volcanic’.
