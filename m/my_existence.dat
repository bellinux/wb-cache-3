500|$|I was {{the only}} one who asked for a rise, and Gilbert was furious with me. [...] All the time we were rehearsing [...] he never spoke to me, and only {{acknowledged}} <b>my</b> <b>existence</b> by sometimes saying sneeringly: 'Make way for the High-Salaried Artiste!' ...Passing storms like this did occasionally ruffle the course of our friendship, but on the whole it flowed on deep and strong.|$|E

500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of <b>my</b> <b>existence.</b> You're not going to see me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
2500|$|Living in reclusion, Nadir Afonso defined {{himself in}} 2006 as [...] "Portuguese {{and a son}} of the inner country. I learned from {{tradition}} to be humble, to praise the masters, and to live these eighty-six years with the simplicity that my lowly status has always guaranteed me. To do a balance of <b>my</b> <b>existence</b> and of my work now is absurd." [...] He spent {{the last three decades}} of his life painting, exhibiting, and writing with regular and growing comfort. He was twice married, with five children, born between 1948 and 1989.|$|E
2500|$|Melville House and the Homestead, {{visited by}} {{over a million}} people from {{numerous}} countries around the world, {{has been described as}} [...] "...this shrine, where lingers the spirit of the great inventor". At a farewell dinner at Brantford's Kerby House as Melville was preparing to depart for Washington, D.C., the elder Bell addressed the invited banquet guests, saying [...] " [...] could not come to us, so we resolved to go to him. [...] I now confidently feel that my sojourn in Brantford will outlive <b>my</b> <b>existence</b> because under yon roof of mine the telephone was born".|$|E

Ataliba continues {{to try to persuade}} Alzira to marry Gusmano, without success, until suddenly Zamoro enters. [...] Believing that it is his ghost, Alzira is skeptical, but realizes that he is still alive.

2500|$|While at Harrow, Byron became {{close to}} John FitzGibbon, second Earl of Clare, and with George John, fifth Earl De la Warr, and Byron {{retained}} memories of both. Clare {{in particular was}} Byron's favourite, and, after one meeting {{in which they could}} spend only five minutes together, Byron afterwards could [...] "hardly recollect an hour of <b>my</b> <b>existence</b> which could be weighted against them". Byron had other friends at Harrow, including John Wingfield, Edward Noel Long, (grandson of Edward Long) and George, Duke of Dorset, all of who appear in Byron's Childish Recollections. [...] Only Long would continue to Cambridge with Byron. These friendships meant a lot to Byron, and when his friends started dying he claimed that [...] "some curse hangs over me. I never could keep alive even a dog that I liked, or that liked me". Not all of Byron's relationships encouraged him to stay at the school. Byron's early loves included Mary Duff and Margaret Parker, his distant cousins, and Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at Harrow. Byron refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 due to his love for Chaworth. In Byron's later memoirs, according to Byron's biographer Fiona MacCarthy, [...] "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings". He returned to Harrow in January 1804. By Easter of that year he had begun to correspond with his half-sister, Augusta. His early letters to her illustrate his earnest desire to establish an affectionate friendship with 'a Friend to whom I can confide.' ...|$|E

He was a great man in his way. I don't know much of his history. I suppose he began like other people; took fine words for good, ringing coin and noble ideals for valuable banknotes. He was a great master of both, himself, by the way. Later he discovered--how am I to explain it to you? Suppose the world were a factory and all mankind workmen in it. Well, he discovered that the wages were not good enough. That they were paid in counterfeit money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure of it, Miss Ellison--as sure as I am of <b>my</b> own <b>existence.</b> For {{anyone who knows}} {{him to have a}} doubt is {{absolutely}} absurd. A finer young fellow than Reuben {{it would be hard to}} find." ...|$|R
60|$|As for OUR OWN EXISTENCE, we {{perceive}} it so plainly and so certainly, that it neither needs nor {{is capable of}} any proof for nothing can be more evident to us than our own existence. I think, I reason, I feel pleasure and pain: can any of these be more evident to me than <b>my</b> own <b>existence?</b> If I doubt of all other things, that very doubt makes me perceive <b>my</b> own <b>existence,</b> and will not suffer me to doubt of that. For if I know I feel pain, it is evident I have as certain perception of <b>my</b> own <b>existence,</b> as {{of the existence of}} the pain I feel: or if I know I doubt, I have as certain perception of the existence of the thing doubting, as of that thought which I CALL DOUBT. Experience then convinces us, that we have an INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE of our own existence, and an internal infallible perception that we are. In every act of sensation, reasoning, or thinking, we are conscious to ourselves of our own being; and, in this matter, come not short of the highest degree of certainty.|$|R
