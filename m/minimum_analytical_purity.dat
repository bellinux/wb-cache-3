40|$|One {{of the big}} {{problems}} of chemical analysis is to ensure its quality and to increase the confidence in the analytical results yielded by a chemical or instrumental analysis. The new internal norms for animal products quality (ANSVSA order 51 / 2005 regarding {{the performance of the}} analytical methods of analysis and data interpretation), aligned to EU requirements, required a unique system of inspection. These requirements stipulate the obligation of the laboratories inspecting animal products to validate each assay method, adapted to the particular type of sample. We therefore aimed to validate the chromatographic method of determining the linoleic acid from meat products. The parameters determined for the validation of this method were in agreement with SR EN ISO/CEI 17025 : 2005 and refer to: accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, precision, limit of detection and limit of quantification. For validation we only used reference materials and certified standards of <b>analytical</b> <b>purity.</b> We also calculated the incertitude for the validated method. The control diagrams obtained during two months show that the 0. 01176 reproducibility of the equipment was higher than the repeatability (r) of 0. 0079; 95. 60 % tracing and ± 0. 69 µg/g incertitude for linoleic acid determination.

These requirements stipulate that the laboratories for feed control must have validated methods for each sample assay. We therefore proposed to validate two chromatographic methods (HPLC and GC) for vitamin E and linolenic acid from the polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched feeds for layers supplemented with 250 ppm vitamin E. The determined parameters were in agreement with SR EN ISO / CEI 17025 : 2005 as follows: exactness, reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, detection limit, quantification limit. We used for validation only certified reference materials and blanks, of <b>analytical</b> <b>purity.</b> We determined the incertitude for each validated method.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to emphasize the fact that while consistent interest has been paid to the industrial use of chitosan, minor attention has been devoted to spread the knowledge of a good characterization of its physico-chemical properties. Therefore, the paper attempts to critically comment on the conflicting experimental results, highlighting the facts, the myths and the controversies. The goal is to indicate how to take advantage of chitosan versatility, to learn how to manage its variability and show how to properly tackle some unexpected undesirable features. In the sections of the paper various issues that relate chitosan properties to some basic features and to advanced solutions and applications are presented. The introduction outlines some historical pioneering works, where the chemistry of chitosan was originally explored. Thereafter, particular reference is made to <b>analytical</b> <b>purity,</b> characterization and chain modifications. The macromolecular characterization is mostly related to molecular weight and to degree of acetylation, but also refers to the conformational and rheological properties and solution stability. Then, the antimicrobial activity of chitosan in relation with its solubility is reviewed. A section is dedicated to the formulation of chitosan biomaterials, from gel to nanobeads, exploring their innovative application as active carrier nanoparticles. Finally, the toxicity issue of chitosan as a polymer and as a constructed nanomaterial is briefly commented in the conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Very small {{analytical}} masses (mg to ng) are {{dictated by}} modern analytical instruments, {{either because of}} their high sensitivity, analytical protocols or {{because of the small}} sampling volume of micro-beam techniques. But small sample masses can create problems when trace elements are major constituent in some minerals (e. g. PGE as PGM) and are irregularly distributed in samples or reference materials. Accidental inclusion or exclusion could change the spatial concentration realised simply due to spatial heterogeneity issues [1, 2]. Such effects influence mass balance calculation and element budgets. Recommended minimum mass for reference materials is generally determined by analysing smaller sample mass until variance become unacceptable. Is there a way to determine minimum sample mass directly related to RM heterogeneity? And is it identical for all analytes, or unique for each analyte, in each sample? In order to systematically investigate these questions, pressed-pellets of PGE-bearing reference materials (CHR-Bkg, CHR-Pt+, MASS- 1, MASS- 3, WMS- 1, WMS- 1 a) were analysed with an EDAX EAGLE III micro-XRF. Approximately 10 000 contiguous measurements were made with a beam of 50 µm covering a total area of about 25 mm 2. Up to 25 analytes were measured including precious metals. Reproducibility was determined by analyzing the same location 1 000 times. In order to express the empirical heterogeneity, Angle Measure Technique (AMT) was employed [2]. The AMT transform describe the elemental map complexity as a function of geometrical scale from local to global. AMT provides a quantitative measure of the empirical heterogeneity for each element, RM, or analytical sample. From such results a <b>minimum</b> <b>analytical</b> mass for each analyte is proposed to ensure that analytical results are representative {{all the way down to}} the scale of RM fields-of-view. The proposed technique offers the advantage of defining the effective minimum mass for each analyte with better elemental sensitivity by allowing for a more meaningful estimation of the global <b>minimum</b> <b>analytical</b> mass.

Then the corresponding 500  µl solution was evenly applied on half-filter paper discs using a micropipette, respectively. The other half of the remaining filter paper was treated with 500  µl ethanol alone and used as a control. The filter papers were air-dried for about 5  min to evaporate the solvent completely and full discs were subsequently remade by attaching treated halves to untreated halves with clear adhesive tape. Each remade filter paper disc was tightly fixed onto the bottom of a petri dish (Ф 12.5  cm) daubed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)on the inside wall to prevent the insects from escaping. For the rutin, the appropriate amount of powder was evenly spreaded on the half filter paper (Ф 12.5  cm) according to the rate of 10, 30 and 90  g/m 2. The other half of the remaining filter paper was untreated as a control. Twenty unsexed L. serricorne adults were then released {{at the center of the}} filter paper disc.

40|$|Analytical {{electron}} microscopy {{is used to}} identify, localize and quantify chemical elements in biological samples with the aim to correlate the element distribution in cells and tissues with the particular functional state. Energy dispersive electron probe X-ray microanalysis of freeze-dried cryosections {{is considered to be}} the most efficient technique with respect to spatial analytical resolution and detection limit. The potentialities and limitations of this technique are illustrated by results from 3 current research projects: Element compartmentation in hepatocytes, cytotoxicity of an organotin compound, and calcium movements during osmoregulation of epithelia. At present, the absolute detection limit is 170 atoms in a <b>minimum</b> <b>analytical</b> volume of 30 x 30 x 100 nm(3). X- ray microanalysis of cryosections from biological samples is limited by ice crystal growth during cryofixation and by the poor X-ray collection efficiency in most electron microscopes.

30|$|All the {{chemical}} reagents used as reference substances {{and for the}} preparation of microbiological media were of <b>analytical</b> <b>purity</b> (Avantor Performance Materials, Poland). One type of microbiological media was bought as ready made-to-order preparations (BTL, Poland). The second one was prepared in a laboratory. The ordered medium contained neither organic carbon nor nitrogen nor sulphur that could be available for fungi, as it was assumed {{on the basis of}} the list of ingredients provided by the manufacturer. However, the absence of these elements was confirmed indirectly by inoculating the selected species of moulds on this medium (without an organic material sample). No growth was observed after 2  weeks of incubation. The goal of the experiment was to ensure that the main nutrient for moulds was the model organic materials, which was placed on the surface of the medium. Firstly, this was a way to confirm that the chosen mould really has the cellulolytic or proteolytic activity (when it can grow on cellulose, silk, parchment or wool substrate, respectively). Furthermore, the application of media without organic nutrients makes it very probable that the volatiles emitted by moulds originated mostly from the enzymatic decomposition of the organic material and not from the metabolism of sugar which is usually in the media. Media were prepared in the shape of a slope (using 5  ml of medium) inside 20  ml sterile vials designed for headspace (HS) sampling. One type of medium used for cultivation of moulds was a modified version of Weary and Canby’s medium (W&C) [33, 34].
