40|$|Abstract. Steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> is {{the main}} method for {{determining}} chloride diffusivity of cementitious materials. In this paper a modified steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> was introduced. The conductivity of anolyte is tested to calculate chloride concentration therefore the time consuming work for determining chloride concentration directly is avoided and the steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> is simplified. A series of concrete mixes with different water cement ratio and different mineral admixtures were tested with the modified steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test.</b> An equation for calculation of chloride concentration using conductivity of anolyte is given. Experimental {{results show that the}} modified steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> is effective and convenient. Probable experimental errors caused by determining chloride concentration directly are averted by conductivity determining...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chloride ion {{migration}} tests, or so called electrical accelerated tests, for testing chloride diffusion coefficient of cementitious materials are reviewed. The {{ion migration}} theory of electrical accelerated tests is presented. Four main representative measures, chloride penetration test, steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test,</b> unsteady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> and salt saturated conductivity test, are introduced and their theoretical calculations of chloride diffusion coefficient are described. Through {{analysis of the}} theoretical calculations, it could be found that all electrical accelerated tests are based on ion migration theory although different suppositions are adopted. Steady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> is the most suitable measure to determine chloride diffusion coefficient among the migration tests. DCIPT, DRCM and DSSCT calculated by chloride penetration test, unsteady state <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> and salt saturated conductivity test {{could be used to}} identify the resistance to chloride ion penetration of cementitious materials but are not the real diffusion coefficient...|$|E
40|$|Polymer surface {{coatings}} {{are commonly used}} to enhance the corrosion resistance of concrete structures in saline environments to ionic diffusivity; this diffusivity can be determined by <b>migration</b> <b>tests.</b> This paper presents the simulation {{of the effects of}} the {{surface coatings}} on <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> by solving the Nernst-Planck/Poisson model using both finite-difference method and finite-element method. These two numerical methods were compared in terms of their accuracy and computational speed. The simulation results indicate that the shapes of ionic profiles after <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> depend on the effectiveness of surface coatings. This is because highly effective surface coatings can cause a high ionic concentration at the interface between coating and concrete. The simulation results were also compared to homogenized cases where a homogenized diffusion coefficient is employed. The result shows that the homogenized diffusion coefficient cannot represent the diffusivity of the surface-coated concrete...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic stir bars {{coated with}} {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) were applied for sorption of migration-relevant compounds in food packaging contact media. The loaded stir bars were re-extracted with solvents {{as well as}} by thermal desorption. A mix of polar and non-polar compounds relevant for <b>migration</b> <b>testing</b> at concentrations of 1 and 0. 1 ppm respectively were used for method development. The PDMS stir bar extraction method was optimized in terms of sorption time, sample volume, re-extraction conditions and NaCl and ethanol concentration. As a result the recoveries determined for each compound were lower than calculated. The limits of detection were between 1 and 100 ppb and the reproducibility of the method was estimated for the investigated compounds between 3 and 49 %. NaCl or ethanol addition did not increase the recovery rates. In comparison to alternative extraction methods (e. g. LLE or SPE) the SBSE method showed lower recoveries especially for polar compounds. However, the detection limits were sufficient for <b>migration</b> <b>testing.</b> Due to fact that the developed SBSE method is time efficient this method will be interesting for routine <b>migration</b> <b>testing</b> of food packaging materials...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigated}} if overall <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> procedures {{could also}} be used to test for the migration of specific substances from plastics. The overall <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> procedure used was the evaporative gravimetric method used with volatile food simulants. Thirty food-contact substances (additives and monomers) were tested for their chemical stability and volatile loss during the heated evaporation stage of the overall migration procedure. Eighteen of the 30 were determined in an acceptable yield. It is concluded that in the list of approximately 620 European Union substances that have specific migration limits of 5 mg kg - 1 or higher, and based on considerations of stability and volatility, more than half could be amenable to control using overall migration methodology. This is particularly the case for inert plastics with low intrinsic overall migration values of oligomers. This means that based on the overall <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> result found, testing laboratories could decide on a case-by-case basis if known additives and starting substances are covered by the overall migration result and no separate testing would be required for specific migration, with time and resource cost savings...|$|E

40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{is widely}} used as a {{packaging}} material {{for all kinds of}} foodstuff. Low diffusivity of the polymer combined with the limited number of additives and their low concentrations lead to very limited mass transfer (migration) of monomers, catalysts, or impurities from the PET polymer into food. This mass transfer (migration) for monomers, oligomers, catalysts, additives and non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) is discussed within this study. Based on the data given in the scientific literature it could be concluded that overall <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> as well as specific <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> for monomers and catalysts, like ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, iso-phthalic acid and antimony are superfluous, because their migration limits cannot be exceeded, even if worst case conditions and swelling simulants like 95 % ethanol are applied. A more suitable procedure for evaluation of the food law compliance of PET is the determination of migration relevant substances in PET and calculation of their migration by use of migration models. In addition, the analytical screening for low molecular weight migrants (like NIAS) gives an additional safety factor, because such NIAS were not determined using the conventional <b>migration</b> <b>testing</b> procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{apparent}} (Dapp) {{and effective}} (Deff) migration coefficients obtained in chloride <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> are investigated in this study. The presented Dapp profiles in concrete {{show that the}} apparent migration coefficient is strongly concentration-dependent. As demonstrated, the binding of chlorides is very low at low free-chloride concentrations and therefore the chloride penetration front progresses throughout the concrete only slightly retarded by the binding. The diffusion flux during <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> is shown to be insignificant compared to the migration flux. The DRCM coefficients obtained from the Rapid Chloride <b>Migration</b> (RCM) <b>tests</b> {{are found to be}} equal to the computed Dapp at the locations of the chloride penetration fronts, which gives evidence that the DRCM represents only the migration coefficient at the front. A very good linear trend is found between the DRCM obtained from the traditional RCM model, and the Deff obtained from the chloride transport model which includes non-linear chloride binding and concentrations in non-equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) {{in contact}} with food must {{comply with the requirements}} laid down in the European Regulation (EU) 10 / 2011, which specifies conditions for <b>migration</b> <b>tests.</b> For real contact times longer than 30 days, accelerated <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> are performed at elevated temperatures for a maximum of 10 days at 60 °C. These conditions should represent the end of the shelf life (e. g. 365 days at 23 °C) and are calculated using the Arrhenius equation {{on the basis of a}} default activation energy of 80 kJ/mol. However, for PET, it is well known that the activation energy is strongly dependent on the molecular size of the migrant. Small molecules like acetaldehyde have activation energies in PET of ~ 80 kJ/mol. For larger molecules like 2 -aminobenzamide with a predicted activation energy of diffusion of 134. 4 kJ/mol, the storage times at 60 °C and 40 °C equivalent to the migration after 1 year at 23 °C are 0. 85 and 18. 9 days, respectively. These findings were confirmed by experimental <b>migration</b> <b>tests.</b> For 2 -aminobenzamide, migration for 10 days at 60 °C corresponded to a storage time at 23 °C of 11. 7 years, which is significantly higher than the long-term storage of more than 6 months as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 10 / 2011. For larger molecules, the corresponding storage times at 23 °C would even be longer, thus overestimating by far the migration at the end of shelf life. Contact conditions of 10 days at 60 °C are too severe for PET. Migrant-specific and polymer-specific diffusion parameters should therefore be considered when designing accelerated <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> for long-term applications...|$|R

40|$|In a {{concrete}} <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> the ionic species are present {{either in the}} boundary layer or in the pore solution and they flow as is indicated by the Nernst–Planck equation. This equation supposes that the flux of each ion is independent of every other one. However, due to ion–ion interactions there are ionic fields that affect the final flux producing an additional voltage known as the membrane potential. In order to understand this phenomenon, this paper describes a theoretical and experimental investigation {{of the implications of}} the membrane potential on the migration of chlorides in concrete. A new electrochemical test has been carried out and its results were compared with a numerical simulation. From the results it has been proved that the voltage drop during a <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> is not linear and changes during the test. Thus the Nernst–Planck equation may be applied to the simulation of migration of any ionic species through a saturated porous medium by using the non-linear voltage to represent all the microscopic interactions in a macroscopic way. The results may be used to improve the reliability of the ASTM C 1202 chloride <b>migration</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|Progress {{in three}} areas has {{provided}} analytical methods and understanding {{to assist in}} migration testing for compliance with European Community Directives on food contact materials. A simple <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> has been developed to indicate {{whether or not a}} food makes fatty contact with plastics. This test is then used to guide the initial choice of appropriate food simulants. The Karl Fischer technique for water determination has been used to eliminate the need to humidity condition plastics in overall migration testing. This results in more rapid and more reliable migration testing. Finally, the stability of 'positivelist' monomers and other starting substances has been examined in food simulants. This identifies those substances which, for reasons of reactivity, may not be expected to survive a <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> and for which, therefore, migration testing as such is inappropriate. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|To assure {{consumer}} protection, {{the transfer}} of constituents from plastic food contact materials to the food {{is limited by the}} Plastic Directive 2002 / 72 /EC. To show the conformity of materials with this directive, the overall and specific migration of certain monomers and additives has to be tested. The performance of laboratories during <b>migration</b> <b>testing</b> can be the source of large errors and can only be checked by the the use of reference materials with known migration values. The availability of Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) for specific <b>migration</b> <b>testing</b> would help ensuring consistent, uniform and reliable measurements. Also, they would have an important value for the validation of alternative, cost saving and rapid migration methods, both by experimentation and by predictive mathematical modelling. The main objective of EU project G 6 RD-CT- 2000 - 00411 'Specific Migration' was to develop the know-how and the ability to produce CRMs for specific <b>migration</b> <b>testing.</b> A broad range of molecular sizes from the rather volatile styrene (104 Daltons) and the small caprolactam (113 daltons) to the large Irgafos 168 (647 Daltons) and different polarities from the very polar caprolactam to the non-polar additives are represented. Several contact times and temperatures have been evaluated: 20 to 100 °C. 2 hours to 10 days The 6 candidate CRMs contain three polyolefins and three non-polyolefins Of the 7 migrants present in the 6 materials, 4 have specific migration limits Of the remaining three migrants Irgafos 168 is a frequently used processing stabiliser, DPBD is the test substance for the fatty contact test EN 14481, styrene is a monomer always present in polystyrenes and is discussed as a substance to be regulated by an SML in future (Synoptic Document, May 2003). Our feasibility study gives the basis for future production of very useful CRMs for specific <b>migration</b> <b>testing</b> as well as determination of additive content in the material.

40|$|Measuring {{the overall}} {{migration}} from ploymers using {{the olive oil}} method can lead to oil absorption problems at higher temperatures.

40|$|Fertility is {{a highly}} complex {{biological}} function that depends on several properties of spermatozoa that are necessary for them to overcome various barriers in the female reproductive tract to reach the fertilisation site. This ability has been evaluated in vitro using cervical mucus migration tests. Head morphology has been widely studied, and various studies have reported correlations between head morphology and motility, fertility and DNA fragmentation. In the present study, we first evaluated {{the relationship between the}} ability of ram spermatozoa to overcome the mucus surrogate barrier in an in vitro <b>migration</b> <b>test</b> and sperm head morphology. Sperm motility (determined by computer-aided sperm analysis) and the acrosomal status, viability and mitochondrial status (determined by flow cytometry) of control and migrating spermatozoa were assessed. Principal component analysis and clustering analysis of the values for the morphometric parameters assessed defined three cell subpopulations. One of these subpopulations, namely spermatozoa with a short and wide head, was absent from samples collected after conclusion of the <b>migration</b> <b>test.</b> Second, we evaluated relationships among head morphology characteristics, the ability to penetrate the artificial mucus and fertility. We did not find any correlation between fertility and the number of spermatozoa that migrated, whereas there was a negative correlation between the proportion of spermatozoa with a short and wide head in the fresh sperm sample and fertility. In conclusion, the head morphology of spermatozoa was associated with their ability to overcome a mucus barrier in a <b>migration</b> <b>test,</b> and the relative size of the non-migrating subpopulation was negatively related to male fertility.

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays {{the use of}} {{biodegradable}} plastic in the food industry has increased dramatically. Because of its outstanding characteristics, i. e. environmental friendliness and non-toxicity, researchers are interested in studying how to improve the properties of plastic, especially polylactic acid or PLA, which is very fragile and intolerant to high impact force. Attempts {{have been made to}} improve the weak points of PLA by mixing PLA with epoxidized natural rubber. The natural rubber goes through an epoxidation process, resulting in epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) as the finished product. ENR contains epoxy groups which can efficiently react with PLA. Ratios of PLA and ENR employed in this study were 50 : 50, 60 : 40, 70 : 30, 80 : 20 and 90 : 10. In addition to finding a suitable ratio between PLA and ENR, the mixtures were subjected to <b>migration</b> <b>tests</b> according to the guidelines specified in European Commission Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 in order to prove whether the mixed materials are safe and suitable for consumer use. <b>Migration</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted by soaking samples in four different food simulants – 10 % (v/v) ethanol in aqueous solution, 3 % (w/v) acetic acid in aqueous solution, 20 % (v/v) ethanol in aqueous solution and vegetable oil – for 24 h at 40 °C. The results showed that the PLA/ENR blends at every ratio had an overall migration amount of less than 10 mg/dm 2 in three of the sample simulants, while the overall migration from materials soaked in vegetable oil exceeded this standard. <b>Migration</b> <b>tests</b> of one of the sample blends conducted at 100 °C for 2 h showed similar results.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{theoretical}} {{model for the}} Rapid Chloride <b>Migration</b> <b>test</b> is presented. This model accounts for the non-linear chloride binding isotherm and the non-equilibrium conditions between the free- and bound-chloride concentrations in concrete. The new system of equations is solved numerically and compared to a simplified analytical solution, revealing a good agreement. Subsequently, numerical simulations are applied to experimental data on chloride concentration profiles in concrete obtained elsewhere. The binding parameters, the chloride mass transfer coefficient and the effective diffusion coefficient of chloride are estimated with these simulations. The non-linear binding coefficients correspond well to experimental data found in literature. The chloride mass transfer coefficient reveals a tendency to decrease in time during the application of electrical field across a concrete sample.

40|$|In {{this study}} the Rapid Chloride <b>Migration</b> <b>test</b> (RCM) {{standardized}} as NT Build 492 and BAW-Merkblatt is reviewed. Since the traditional natural diffusion tests are laborious, time consuming and costly, {{they are not}} always preferred from a practical point of view. To overcome these disadvantages, several accelerated tests have been developed. Among the accelerated chloride migration tests, the Rapid Chloride <b>Migration</b> <b>test</b> (RCM) {{seems to be the}} most promising test to use in the prediction of the chlorides progression into concrete. Nevertheless, because of deficiencies in the theoretical background, the test has received some criticism. The largest issue of the test concerns the assumption of the chloride concentration profile in concrete after the <b>migration</b> <b>test.</b> The 2 ̆ 2 S - shaped 2 ̆ 2 abrupt chloride penetration front, assumed in the theoretical model, has not been observed in reality. This leads to a wrong estimation of the chloride ion migration coefficient – DRCM. Moreover, the effect of the polarization of electrodes used in the test and the differences in the quality of concrete from the inner layers (the tested part of concrete in the RCM test) and outer layers (the concrete which is the real barrier against the chlorides test) have not been studied sufficiently and are considered having a significant effect on the RCM test results. The investigations presented in this paper include results of the measurements of the polarization of electrodes, the influence of curing of concrete on the quality of concrete cover, the differences in quality between concrete in the inner and outer layers and the discussion of the consequences of assuming an incorrect chloride penetration front in the RCM model.
