5000|$|TFO (Télé-Française d'Ontario) {{shut down}} its 3 full power <b>analogue</b> <b>{{transmitter}}s</b> in Sudbury, ON, Hawkesbury, ON, and Pembroke, ON, {{along with one}} lower <b>analogue</b> power <b>transmitter</b> on July 31, 2012. According to TFO, the transmitter towers are owned by TV Ontario, which began decommissioning them on July 31, 2012, thus the TFO transmitters had to shut down. After July 31, 2012, TFO only had some low power <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> remaining.|$|R
50|$|The main {{transmitter}} in Toronto {{uses the}} call sign CICA-DT, with its rebroadcasters using CICO-DT, {{followed by a}} number to denote their status as rebroadcasters. Many <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> had used the CICA-TV and CICO-TV callsigns, and CICE-TV, in the same manner, until the shutdown of TVO's remaining <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> on July 31, 2012.|$|R

2500|$|The CRTC {{ordered that}} in 28 [...] "mandatory markets", full power over-the-air <b>analogue</b> {{television}} <b>transmitters</b> had to cease transmitting by August 31, 2011. Broadcasters could either continue serving those markets by transitioning <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> to digital or cease broadcasting over-the-air. Cable, IPTV, and satellite services {{are not involved}} or affected by this digital transition deadline.|$|R
2500|$|On July 17, 2012, the CRTC {{approved}} the shut down of CBC's <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters,</b> noting that [...] "while the Commission has the discretion {{to refuse to}} revoke broadcasting licences, even on application from a licensee, it cannot direct the CBC or any other broadcaster to continue to operate its stations and transmitters." [...] On July 31, 2012, at around 11:59p.m. in each time zone, the remaining 620 <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> were shut down, leaving the network with 27 digital television transmitters across the country, and some transmitters operated by some affiliated stations.|$|R
50|$|UTV was {{the last}} of the ITV {{stations}} to cease broadcasting on <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The <b>analogue</b> signal was closed at just after 11:35 pm on Tuesday 23 October 2012.|$|R
50|$|The main {{television}} {{channels of}} the ARD are the nationwide Das Erste and seven regional channels {{operated by the}} different regional broadcasting institutions. These channels were available on the <b>analogue</b> terrestrial <b>transmitters</b> until the shutdown of the <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> started in 2003. Das Erste and the third programmes, like the radio stations, are principally funded by licence fees, with a very limited amount of on-air advertising.|$|R
50|$|On July 31, 2012, CBC / SRC and TVOntario {{shut down}} {{all of their}} <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters,</b> {{resulting}} in a combined total of 21 transmitters shutting down from the channel 52 to 69 range.|$|R
50|$|On September 19, 2005, {{the island}} of Gotland became the first region to have its <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> turned off. This {{continued}} during the autumn when the Gävle and Motala transmitters were shut down.|$|R
50|$|After the closedown of the <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> and the {{termination}} of TV4's public service obligations, {{the pattern of the}} local stations is due to a major overhaul which will see the number of local stations increase.|$|R
25|$|In {{markets where}} a digital {{transmitter}} was installed, existing coverage areas {{were not necessarily}} maintained. For instance, the CBC implemented a digital transmitter covering Fredericton, New Brunswick {{in the place of}} the existing transmitter covering Saint John, New Brunswick and Fredericton, and decided to maintain analogue service to Saint John. According to CBC's application for this transmitter to the CRTC, the population served by the digital transmitter would be 113,930 people versus 303,465 served by the existing <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitter.</b> In Victoria, the replacement of the Vancouver <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> with digital ones only allowed only some northeastern parts of the metropolitan area (total population 330,000) to receive either CBC or Radio-Canada.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{reportedly}} due {{to federal}} funding reductions to the CBC in April 2012, the CBC made substantial budget cuts in their transmitting budget, including shutting down CBC's and Radio-Canada's remaining <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> on July 31, 2012. This included shutting {{down all the}} remaining CBC and Radio-Canada's rebroadcasters that had been [...] "held over" [...] using <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> during 2011-12. All {{of them have been}} decommissioned by the CBC, leaving rural Canadians and U.S. border regions with no free over-the-air CBC coverage, and those viewers have been instructed to subscribe to a cable or satellite provider or have been directed to the website available through pay internet providers.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{previously}} served by repeaters for CBC Television and TVO: CBLT-TV-2 and CICO-TV-13, respectively. Both repeaters {{were shut down}} following the 2012 closing of all CBC <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters,</b> several of which were also used by TVO.|$|R
40|$|A new {{implementation}} of a Coriolis mass-flow meter transmitter is described. It is based on digital components, and has improved performance compared with the commercial, mostly <b>analogue,</b> <b>transmitter</b> using the same flowtube (transducer). Improvements are found in flowtube control, measurement precision, and performance with two-phase and partially-empty conditions, including batching from empty. The new transmitter {{is viewed as a}} second-generation sensor validation (SEVA) demonstrator, in which experience from validating the commercial <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitter</b> has led to a redesign using digital technology. The resulting SEVA transmitter provides improved measurement performance and reduced vulnerability to fault conditions, as well as on-line estimates of measurement quality and fault compensation (Henry and Clarke, Control Engineering practice, 1 (4) (1993) 585 - 610) ...|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to federal}} funding {{reductions}} to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC's and Radio-Canada's remaining <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> on July 31, 2012. [...] None of CBC or Radio-Canada's rebroadcasters {{were converted to}} digital.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to budget}} cuts handed {{down on the}} CBC in April 2012, the CBC has {{announced}} several austerity measures to keep the corporation solvent and in operation; this included {{the closure of the}} CBC and Radio-Canada's remaining <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters,</b> including CFLA-TV, on July 31, 2012.|$|R
5000|$|... "We are electing {{to delete}} these <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{from the main}} licence {{with which they are}} associated. These <b>analogue</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{generate}} no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown." ...|$|R
