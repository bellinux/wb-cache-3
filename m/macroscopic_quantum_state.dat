40|$|Unlike mathematics, {{in which}} the notion of truth might be abstract, in physics, the {{emphasis}} must be placed on algorithmic procedures for obtaining numerical results subject to the experimental verifiability. For, a physical science is exactly that: algorithmic procedures (built on a certain mathematical formalism) for obtaining verifiable conclusions from a set of basic hypotheses. By admitting non-constructivist statements a physical theory loses its concrete applicability and thus verifiability of its predictions. Accordingly, the requirement of constructivism must be indispensable to any physical theory. Nevertheless, {{in at least some}} physical theories, and especially in quantum mechanics, one can find examples of non-constructive statements.

40|$|International audienceModern {{developments}} in condensed matter and cold atom physics {{have made the}} realization of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> in the laboratory everyday practice. The ready availability of these states suggests the possibility of experimentally investigating different proposals for the mechanism of <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> reduction. One such proposal is the hypothesis of Penrose and Di´osi, according to which <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> reduction is {{a manifestation of the}} incompatibilty of general relativity and the unitary time evolution of quantum physics. Dimensional analysis suggests that Schr¨odinger cat type states should collapse on measurable time scales when masses and lengths of the order of bacterial scales are involved.

We then extent Penrose's analysis to superpositions of mass current carrying states, and we apply this to the flux quantum bits realized in superconducting circuits.

40|$|The {{functionality}} {{of logic}} and memory elements in current electronics {{is based on}} multi-stability, driven either by manipulating local concentrations of electrons in transistors, or by switching between equivalent states of a material with a degener- ate ground state in magnetic or ferroelectric materials. Another possibility is offered by phase transitions with switching between metallic and insulating phases, but classical phase transitions are limited in speed by slow nucleation, proliferation of domains and hysteresis. We can in principle avoid these problems by using <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> for switching, but microscopic systems suffer from decoherence which prohibits their use in everyday devices. <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>states,</b> such as the superconducting ground state have the advantage that on a fundamental level they do not suffer from decoherence plaguing microscopic systems.
