50|$|Mammalian nuclear DNA may sustain {{more than}} 60,000 damage episodes per cell per day, as listed with {{references}} in DNA damage (naturally occurring). If left uncorrected, these adducts, after <b>misreplication</b> past the damaged sites, can {{give rise to}} mutations. In nature, the mutations that arise may be beneficial or deleterious — this {{is the driving force}} of evolution. An organism may acquire new traits through genetic mutation, but mutation may also result in impaired function of the genes, and in severe cases, cause the death of the organism. In the laboratory, however, mutagenesis is a useful technique for generating mutations that allows the functions of genes and gene products to be examined in detail, producing proteins with improved characteristics or novel functions, as well as mutant strains with useful properties. Initially, the ability of radiation and chemical mutagens to cause mutation was exploited to generate random mutations, but later techniques were developed to introduce specific mutations.|$|E
40|$|The <b>misreplication</b> of damaged DNA is an {{important}} biological process that produces numerous adverse effects on human health. This report describes the synthesis and characterization of a non-natural nucleotide, designated 3 -ethynyl- 5 -nitroindolyl- 2 ′-deoxyriboside triphosphate (3 -Eth- 5 -NITP), as a novel chemical reagent that can probe and quantify the <b>misreplication</b> of damaged DNA. We demonstrate that this non-natural nucleotide is efficiently inserted opposite an abasic site, a commonly formed and potentially mutagenic non-instructional DNA lesion. The strategic placement of the ethynyl moiety allows the incorporated nucleoside triphosphate to be selectively tagged with an azide-containing fluorophore using ‘click’ chemistry. This reaction provides a facile way to quantify the extent of nucleotide incorporation opposite non-instructional DNA lesions. In addition, the incorporation of 3 -Eth- 5 -NITP is highly selective for an abasic site, and occurs even {{in the presence of}} a 50 -fold molar excess of natural nucleotides. The biological applications of using 3 -Eth- 5 -NITP as a chemical probe to monitor and quantify the <b>misreplication</b> of non-instructional DNA lesions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Mouse skin tumors contain {{activated}} c-H-ras oncogenes, often {{caused by}} point mutations at codons 12 and 13 in exon 1 and codons 59 and 61 in exon 2. Mutagenesis by the noncoding apurinic sites can produce G [...] >T and A [...] >T transversions by DNA <b>misreplication</b> with more frequent insertion of deoxyadenosine opposite the apurinic site. Papillomas were induced in mouse skin by several aromatic hydrocarbons, and mutations in the c-H-ras gene {{were determined to}} elucidate the relationship among DNA adducts, apurinic sites, and ras oncogene mutations. Dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P), DB[a,l]P- 11, 12 -dihydrodiol, anti-DB[a,l]P- 11, 12 -diol- 13, 14 -epoxide, DB[a,l]P- 8, 9 -dihydrodiol, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro-DMBA consistently induced a CAA [...] >CTA mutation in codon 61 of the c-H-ras oncogene. Benzo[a]pyrene induced a GGC [...] >GTC mutation in codon 13 in 54 % of tumors and a CAA [...] >CTA mutation in codon 61 in 15 %. The pattern of mutations induced by each hydrocarbon correlated with its profile of DNA adducts. For example, both DB[a,l]P and DMBA primarily form DNA adducts at the N- 3 and/or N- 7 of deoxyadenosine that are lost from the DNA by depurination, generating apurinic sites. Thus, these results {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>misreplication</b> of unrepaired apurinic sites generated by loss of hydrocarbon-DNA adducts is responsible for transforming mutations leading to papillomas in mouse skin...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the {{situation}} with organic compounds, metals do not show a high correlation between carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. An agent may be mutagenic by causing <b>misreplication</b> of DNA due to alterations of the DNA template, decreased fidelity of DNA polymerase, or inhibition of the proofreading of DNA replication. In addition, bacteria have an inducible, error-prone DNA repair system (SOS repair) whose activity results in mutagenesis. In the best studied example of metal mutagenesis, chromate, {{there is little evidence}} for the involvement of the SOS system. Metals may act as comutagens by inhibiting the repair of damage to DNA caused by another agent. This has been demonstrated for arsenite. Comutagens would not be detected by standard screening methods...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco smoking {{increases}} the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to <b>misreplication</b> of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{develops}} when cells {{no longer}} follow their normal pattern of controlled growth. In the absence or disregard of such regulation, resulting from {{changes in their}} genetic makeup, these errant cells acquire a growth advantage, expanding into precancerous clones. Over the last decade, many studies have revealed the relevance of genomic mutation in this process, be it by <b>misreplication,</b> environmental damage, or a deficiency in repairing endogenous and exogenous damage. Here, we discuss homologous recombination as another mechanism that {{can result in a}} loss of heterozygosity or genetic rearrangements. Some of these genetic alterations may play a primary role in carcinogenesis, but {{they are more likely to}} be involved in secondary and subsequent steps of carcinogenesis by which recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed. Patients, whose cells display an increased frequency of recombination, also have an elevated frequency of cancer, further supporting the link between recombination and carcinogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to {{the solar}} {{ultraviolet}} spectrum that penetrates the Earth's stratosphere (UVA and UVB) causes cellular DNA damage within skin cells. This damage is elicited directly through {{absorption of energy}} (UVB), and indirectly through intermediates such as sensitizer radicals and reactive oxygen species (UVA). DNA damage is detected as strand breaks or as base lesions, the most common lesions being 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 OHdG) from UVA exposure and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from UVB exposure. The presence of these products in the genome may cause misreading and <b>misreplication.</b> Cells are protected by free radical scavengers that remove potentially mutagenic radical intermediates. In addition, the glutathione-S-transferase family can catalyze the removal of epoxides and peroxides. An extensive repair capacity exists for removing (1) strand breaks, (2) small base modifications (8 OHdG), and (3) bulky lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers). UV also stimulates the cell to produce early response genes that activate a cascade of signaling molecules (e. g., protein kinases) and protective enzymes (e. g., haem oxygenase). The cell cycle is restricted via p 53 -dependent and -independent pathways to facilitate repair processes prior to replication and division. Failure to rescue the cell from replication block will ultimately lead to cell death, and apoptosis may be induced. The implications for UV-induced genotoxicity in disease are considered...|$|E
40|$|Mutagenesis at 3,N 4 -ethenocytosine (epsilonC), a nonpairing {{mutagenic}} lesion, {{is significantly}} enhanced in Escherichia coli cells pretreated with UV, alkylating agents, or H 2 O 2. This effect, termed UVM (for UV modulation of mutagenesis), {{is distinct from}} known DNA damage-inducible responses, such as the SOS response, the adaptive response to alkylating agents, or the oxyR-mediated response to oxidative agents. Here, we have addressed the hypothesis that UVM results from transient depletion of a mismatch repair activity that normally acts to reduce mutagenesis. To test whether the loss of mismatch repair activities results in the predicted constitutive UVM phenotype, E. coli cells defective for methyl-directed mismatch repair, for very-short-patch repair, or for the N-glycosylase activities MutY and MutM were treated with the UVM-inducing agent 1 -methyl- 3 -nitro- 1 -nitrosoguanidine, with subsequent transfection of M 13 viral single-stranded DNA bearing a site-specific epsilonC lesion. Survival of the M 13 DNA was measured as transfection efficiency, and mutation fixation at the lesion was characterized by multiplex sequencing technology. The results showed normal UVM induction patterns in all the repair-defective strains tested. In addition, normal UVM induction was observed in cells overexpressing MutH, MutL, or MutS. All strains displayed UVM reactivation, the term {{used to describe the}} increased survival of epsilonC-containing DNA in UVM-induced cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the UVM response is independent of known mismatch repair systems in E. coli and may thus represent a previously unrecognized misrepair or <b>misreplication</b> pathway...|$|E
