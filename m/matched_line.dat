40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} palmprint recognition, one of {{the most}} reliable personal identification methods in the biometric technology. In this paper, a new approach to the palmprint matching by constructing local and global line feature structures is presented. The datum point of palmprint acts as an important registration due to its remarkable advantage about its spatial location. Initially we define all possible local line feature structures constructed with adjacent lines, around datum point. Through a first level match using these local line feature structures, we get best <b>matched</b> <b>line</b> features. Using these best <b>matched</b> <b>line</b> features, we construct a global line feature structure of palmprint with datum point as reference. This global line feature structure is spread across in four quadrants, datum point being the origin. We then carry out a second level match using this global structure of palmprint to reliably determine its uniqueness. The two levels of matching using local and global line feature structures helps in effective palmprint recognition. With several palmprint images, we tested out proposed verification system and the experimental result shows that the performance of our algorithm is good...|$|E

It detects a pixel-change and DSM-change {{from two}} orthoimages and two DSMs, then it extracts the polygons in elevation-changed areas. Pixel-change is detected by using least squares fitting technique. This method can extract the visible changed areas between two orthoimages, while DSM-change is detected by difference DSM. From these two changes, polygons in elevation-changed areas are extracted using the longest <b>matched</b> <b>line</b> selection techniques. This method can automatically detect not only visible changed {{areas such as}} vegetated areas, new road construction areas and so on, but also elevation-changed areas such as new building construction, land improvement areas and so on with footprint polygon extraction.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an {{algorithm}} for determining 3 D motion and structure from correspondences of line segments between two perspective images. To our knowledge, this paper is the first investigation of use of line segments in motion and structure from motion. Classical methods use their geometric abstraction, namely straight lines, but then three images are necessary for the motion and structure determination process. In this paper we show {{that it is possible}} to recover motion from two views when using line segments. The assumption we use is that two <b>matched</b> <b>line</b> segments contain the projection of a common part of the corresponding line segment in space, i. e. they overlap. Indeed, this is what we use to match line segments between different views. This assumption constrains the possible motion between two views to an open set in motion parameter space.

40|$|Recognising {{an object}} from its shape is an {{important}} yet difficult problem in Computer Vision. Typically we wish to find {{the location of a}} particular object model in a given image. All attempts at this problem involve significant computation, often {{in the form of a}} hypothesis and test or tree pruning procedure. Our approach considers recognition as a combinatorial optimisation problem, in that we wish to find an optimal matching between a set of object model features and image features. Using straight line features provides for the modelling of almost any shape, and methods exist for extracting of line segments from images. Local search algorithms are a class of combinatorial optimisation algorithms that iteratively move through a space of candidate solutions in order to find the solution with the least cost.

40|$|This paper takes {{advantage}} of the complementary characteristics of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to provide periodic corrections to Inertial Navigation System (INS) alternatively in different environmental conditions. In open sky, where GPS signals are available and LiDAR measurements are sparse, GPS is integrated with INS. Meanwhile, in confined outdoor environments and indoors, where GPS is unreliable or unavailable and LiDAR measurements are rich, LiDAR replaces GPS to integrate with INS. This paper also proposes an innovative hybrid scan matching algorithm that combines the feature-based scan matching method and Iterative Closest Point (ICP) based scan matching method. The algorithm can work and transit between two modes depending on the number of <b>matched</b> <b>line</b> features over two scans, thus achieving efficiency and robustness concurrently. Two integration schemes of INS and LiDAR with hybrid scan matching algorithm are implemented and compared. Real experiments are performed on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for both outdoor and indoor environments.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the problem of mobile-robot {{localization}} in struc-tured environments. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to localize the four-wheeled mobile robot equipped with encoders for the wheels and a laser-range-finder (LRF) sensor. The LRF is used to scan the environment, which is described with line segments. A prediction step is performed by simulating the kinematic model of the robot. In the input noise covariance matrix of the EKF the standard deviation of each robot-wheel’s angular speed is estimated as being proportional to the wheel’s angular speed. A correction step is performed by minimizing the difference between the <b>matched</b> <b>line</b> segments from the local and global maps. If the overlapping rate between the most similar local and global line segments is below the threshold, the line segments are paired. The line parameters ’ covariances, which arise from the LRF’s distance-measurement error, comprise the output noise covariance matrix of the EKF. The covariances are estimated with the method of classic least squares (LSQ). The performance of this method is tested within the localization experiment in an indoor structured environment. The good localization results prove the applicability of the method resulting from the classic LSQ for the purpose of an EKF-based localization of a mobile robot...|$|E

Field matching is performed by the radiographers during each session on a <b>match</b> <b>line</b> drawn on the patient's skin. Field edge positions were assessed in the cranial match plane of tangential breast fields and supraclavicular-axillary fields using an electronic portal imaging device and <b>match</b> <b>line</b> markers placed on the skin of the patients. The mean gap/overlap of the four fields for individual patients during each treatment session, derived from 374 marker projections, was + 0. 5 mm indicating that no systematic gap or overlap was observed. The uncertainty in the position of the four fields with respect to the match plane ranges from 3. 1 to 5. 1 mm (1 SD) for the individual patients. Gaps and overlaps between fields were also related to an absolute <b>match</b> <b>line</b> position, found by comparison of simulator and portal images, showing a small systematic uncertainty of 2. 4 mm and a standard deviation of 3. 3 mm.
