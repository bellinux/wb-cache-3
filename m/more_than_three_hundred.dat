Equally ground-breaking has been his contribution to the comparative law of security interests and to the comparative law of contract, as it is demonstrated by the fact that Bussani was invited twice to participate in European-wide projects financed by the European Commission for the harmonization of contract law. With Ugo Mattei (UC Hastings, Ca., and Turin U., Italy), Bussani developed an innovative comparative law methodology, mixing Rudolf B. Schlesinger’s and Rodolfo Sacco’s revolutionary findings on comparative legal studies. This new methodology is embodied in ‘The Common Core of European Private Law Project’, a project which aims to unearth, through an approach based on factual questionnaires, what is common and what is divergent between European private laws. A network of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hundreds</b> European and non-European scholars participates in the project, and the latter’s results are collected in volumes published by Cambridge University Press in a peer-reviewed series named after the title of the project itself, under the direction of Bussani and Mattei.

40|$|Resistance of {{micro-organisms}} to disinfection {{is frequently}} {{associated with the}} presence of biofilms on surfaces. To partially overcome biofilms resistance to biocides alternative strategies are being developped. So a wealth of biological antibiofilm agents are under development in the research laboratories but there are only few products on the market and none of them proved to be universal antibiofilm molecules. However, most of these antibiofilm agents may benefit from the "swimmers" approach that would act synergistically by allowing a better infiltration and/or an in situ delivery in the targets biofilms. The goal of the project, Greenswimmers 1, is to identify the "best" bacteria for this purpose of infiltration and biocide delivery. In this technical report we explain how we evaluated the efficiency of swimmers with respect to infiltration of Stapyloccocus Aureus biofilms. This evaluation relies on the kinematics properties of swimmers and on the kinematics of the porous network created by the swimmers, in interaction with the biofilm. Practically, we addressed the tracking of the swimmers with the successful multiple particle tracking algorithm, U-Track, we improved in order to exploit the information from two channels of the biofilm video under the microscope. We also combined swimmers detection and poresegmentation for a more robust estimation of pores. A first step in pore segmentation consists in partitioning the images from the movies with superpixel decomposition. Eventually, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hundreds</b> movies were analyzed for eight species and several strains of each of them. Parameters such as speed, persistence, pore area, e-DNA proportion were estimated from the data...|$|R

40|$|We reprove {{in modern}} terms and extend to {{arbitrary}} dimension a classical result of Enrico Bompiani on algebraic surfaces X ⊂ P r having very degenerate osculating spaces. Let X ⊂ P r {{be an integral}} nondegenerate projective variety of dimension n defined over the field C. In order to introduce the osculating space of order m to a smooth point p ∈ X, fix a lifting U ⊆ C n − → C r+ 1 0 t ↦−→ of a local parametrization of X centered in p and define T(m, p, X) to be the linear span of the points [pI(0) ] ∈ P r, where I is a multi-index such that |I | ≤ m. The starting point of our research was the following result, which we read in a recent paper by Luca Chiantini and Ciro Ciliberto (see [3], Proposition 2. 3) : Proposition 1. Let X ⊂ P r be a smooth variety and let p ∈ X be a general point. Assume that dim T(m, p, X) = dim T(m+ 1, p, X) = h. Then X ⊆ P h. Our natural question was: can one go a little bit further? Namely, if the dimension of the osculating space at a general point does not increase too much while passing from order m to order m + 1, what can one say about the projective geometry of X? Following a suggestion of Ciro Ciliberto, to whom we are grateful, we looked for an answer among the works of Bompiani (see [2]). Enrico Bompiani (1889 – 1975) was a student of Guido Castelnuovo and in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hundreds</b> papers intensively studied the differential geometry of projective varieties; in particular, he deeply investigated the p(t...|$|R

40|$|Black people’s {{history in}} the past centuries has being portrayed as people that lack the acumen to build any civilization of its own. The {{knowledge}} of the Black history has so far being said to be crude or savage {{and do not have}} a place in civilization. To some extent some historians presented Black history started after the invasion of Europeans and Arabian of the so called “Africa” continent. The purpose of this presentation is to show by way of historical arts, scriptures, utterances of few world leaders, historical findings and evidences that Blacks had civilizations that was the greatest and the oldest and the most inventive of all the highest civilization and antiquities. It flourished for over three centuries which set a pattern of example for people near and far. Historical evidences have shown that Black history eclipsed by far what had been written down by European invasion of the “Africa” continent. Before the invasion of Europeans in the fourteenth century, Blacks had civilization like the Nubian Empire now called Sudan. Historical facts pointed out facts of purely black society that mastered the act of craftsmanship of an advance civilization contrary to what was written as a dark people who leaved in caves and trees. Today there are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>hundreds</b> pyramids and remnants of destroyed civilization in Nubia. Kemet civilization now called Egypt, which in retrospect of the word Kemet means: “Land of the Black”. The world current perception of this land today is considered to be closely related to Arabian. Distancing herself from the original architect of Kemet civilization, which was created by Black civilization as scriptures and historical evidences revealed. The Songhay Empire now annexed in Mali, produced the richest man to ever walk the surface of the earth. His fortune was in tons of gold, silver and many more earthly possessions. All of these empires and kingdoms thrived from somewhere around the seventh century onto the fourteen century. In conclusion one would be tempted to ponder over certain concerns about Black history and their invaders; why were ancient black civilization neglected or destroyed or not mentioned in the history books by their invaders? Why was the names of ancient Black Kingdom and Empire changed? Why European did invaded Africa? Was it in searched of knowledge or to decimate the Black Hebrew Israelites that fled to Kingdom and Empire in Africa? It is becoming evidently clearer that we need a censure of European idea of Black history...|$|R
