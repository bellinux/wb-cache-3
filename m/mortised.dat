Two of the house posts are named the [...] "king post" [...] (Acehnese: tameh raja) and [...] "queen post" [...] (Acehnese: tameh putrou) respectively. Both are located between the middle section and the front section, the [...] "king post" [...] on the right (north) side, the [...] "queen post" [...] on the left (south) side. A small piece of gold is inserted into the [...] "queen post", either at its top or on one of the floor binders when <b>mortised</b> through the [...] "queen post" [...] and fixed by the wooden tenon. These posts are set as if they are still living trees, with the trunk base at the bottom and crown tip above. The last to be built are the roof plates.

Woodcarving decorations are not part of the construction phase, as such constructions are added much later.|$|E

Unlike the lower section, longer sections were sandwiched between the end sections. (This enables friction to help tie the monument together.) The new cover of the sarcophagus consisted of a single large light grey granite slab. Twenty-two bas-relief stars inside circles were added above the lip of the lid.
