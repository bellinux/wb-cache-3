5|$|As in {{previous}} generations, Nintendo provided {{strong support for}} its new console with popular first-party franchises like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokémon, among others. To appeal to casual and non-gamers, Nintendo developed a group of core Wii games, consisting of Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, and Wii Music, where players <b>make</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motion-sensing abilities of the console and its peripherals to simulate real world activities. With the exception of Wii Music, the games and their sequels have all been highly successful.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Kuwait by neighbouring Iraq in 1991, a total of eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War.

Shortly after the Gulf War, the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993, at which point {{it had been the}} last of the three V-bombers in operational service; retiring nine years after the last Vulcan, although the Vulcan had survived longer in its original role as a bomber.|$|E
