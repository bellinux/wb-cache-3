50|$|Most of the {{finishing}} processes are pressure or force controlled, as against the surface or cylindrical grinding processes which are displacement controlled. In all cases, the process leaves its signature on the surface. Classical examples of pressure-controlled finishing processes are honing, lapping and super-finishing. In {{the last few}} decades, attention of researchers has turned towards non-traditional methods of finishing the surfaces. One such process is magneto-rheological abrasive finishing in which abrasive mixed with magneto-rheological (MR) fluid is used. Kordonski and Jacobs (1996) developed a setup in which magnetically stiffened <b>magneto-rheological</b> <b>fluid</b> mixed with abrasives is made to flow over a moving flat rigid wall and the polishing happens at a converging gap formed by the surface to be finished and a moving wall. Now it finds an interesting industrial application in polishing of optical lenses. The major advantage is that the abrasive medium exhibits higher yield strength when subjected to increased magnetic field. Apart from the ways of introducing the abrasive mixed MR fluid, the relative motions between the work piece and abrasive medium are imparted in different ways; using reciprocation, rotation or combination of both. Reciprocation motion has been employed in magneto-rheological abrasive finishing by Jha and Jain (2004). Seok, et al. (2007) employed MR fluid alone for the fabrication and finishing of curved silicon-based micro-structures. While Sadiq and Shunmugam (2009a,b) used both reciprocation and rotation, Dass et al. (2010) later investigated the process with rotary motion imparted to the abrasive medium by rotating magnetic field. In general, researchers working with MR fluid based finishing processes have studied the improvement in surface finish with process variables such as abrasive size, abrasive concentration, magnetic strength, reciprocation speed, rotational speed and processing time, taking work pieces with different initial roughness. Many results have been published mainly on surface finish improvements in terms of Ra and subsequently the study has been extended to include Rmax, Rz , etc. It {{is interesting to note}} that these parameters, characterizing the profile in the height direction, are derived from the same profile and hence are correlated. These roughness parameters do not reveal the nature of the profile and the changes happening to it with time for a given set of process parameters. Studies on material removal during the magneto-rheological abrasive finishing have also been reported. The metal removal is measured by weighing the work piece before and after processing.|$|E

This paper presents a review on defects and failures of <b>magneto-rheological</b> <b>fluid</b> in engineering applications.

In connection with this, <b>magneto-rheological</b> <b>fluids</b> with a low viscosity in the off-state without compromising other properties of the formulations (e. g., sedimentation of the dispersed magnetic particles, liquid state of the carriers in a broad range of temperatures) are often required for specific applications. In this regard, ionic liquids of low viscosity can be very useful in the development of such <b>magneto-rheological</b> <b>fluids.</b> Thus, this contribution reports on the magnetorheological properties of iron(II, III) oxide particles dispersed in the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium thiocyanate (a low viscosity ionic liquid) in the temperature range from 20 °C to 80 °C. The experimental results have revealed that the apparent viscosity of the dispersion slightly changes with the temperature when a constant magnetic field is applied and its value mainly depends on the shear rate and the strength of the magnetic field. The viscosity of the dispersion remains practically unmodified with both the temperature and the magnetic field intensity as the magnetic saturation of the material is reached; in this regime the viscosity will only depend on the applied shear rate. In contrast, the yield stress values of the dispersion as well as the corresponding shear stress vs. shear rate curves have shown an inverse behavior with temperature for a constant magnetic field...|$|R
