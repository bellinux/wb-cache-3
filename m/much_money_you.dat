500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not <b>much</b> <b>money.</b> <b>You</b> have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and we split the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E

[...] Although known as an easygoing person outside of the court, Eusebio presided over it with a firm demeanor. [...] "No one got away from the court," [...] Eusebio said. [...] "It didn't matter how popular you were or how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> made. In that court, everyone was the same." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah, sir,' replied Hans calmly, 'in {{order to}} have gained so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> must have lain awake all night, but I have earned a hundred times that amount while I was {{sleeping}} soundly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind, it {{is partly}} {{for your sake}} that I give in," [...] she said. [...] "It would be lovely to have you come, but you would spend far too <b>much</b> <b>money.</b> <b>You</b> really mean it all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was silence}} for a few minutes; then Ole said: [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> do <b>you</b> require {{to pay for your}} father's farm and set {{yourself}} up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, mother!" [...] Laura cried, {{embracing}} {{her friend}} hastily. [...] "It was your money, not mine. Never speak about that again. How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> have <b>you</b> saved?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{the little}} ones," [...] he continued, {{suddenly}} checking {{himself in his}} tirade, [...] "must not be made to suffer like the grown-up folks. They, at least, are innocent of it all. Young lady, I'd do more for the kids than I'd do for the war--and I'll do it willingly, of my own accord. Tell me, then, how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> got and I'll give you the boys' suits at cost price. I'll do more; for every five suits you buy from me at cost, I'll throw an extra one in, free--Jake Kasker's own contribution." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a {{headpiece}} on you! Game! 'Xactly. That's what it was--the sort of silliness gentlemen {{will get}} up among themselves {{to play at}} adventure. A treasure-hunting expedition. Each of them put down so <b>much</b> <b>money,</b> <b>you</b> understand, to buy the schooner. Their agent in the city engaged me and the skipper. The greatest secrecy and all that. I reckon he had {{a twinkle in his}} eye all the time--and no mistake. But that wasn't our business. Let them bust their money as they like. The pity of it was that so little of it came our way. Just fair pay and no more. And damn any pay, much or little, anyhow--that's what I say!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the hour}} of death, and in the day of judgment; then the one thing which you will care to think of (if you can think at all then, as too many poor souls cannot, and {{therefore}} had best think of it now before their wits fail them)--the one thing which you will care to think of, I say, will be--not, how clever you have been, how successful you have been, how much admired you have been, how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> have made:- 'Of course not,' you answer; 'I shall be thinking {{of the state of}} my soul; whether I am fit to die; whether I have faith enough to meet God; whether I have good works enough to meet God.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I'm a Dutchman if I thought {{business}} {{was so big}} with a stand! I can't see what made the other feller give it up. How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> did <b>you</b> take in altogether?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is embarrassing," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "But {{you refuse}} to see my point of view, {{so there is no}} use in {{discussing}} it. Now please forget all about it, and consider me at your service concerning this [...] . this project of yours. I know more about cocoanut-planting than you do. You speak like a capitalist. I don't know how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> have, but I don't fancy you are rolling in wealth, as you Americans say. But I do know what it costs to clear land. Suppose the government sells you Pari- Sulay at a pound an acre; clearing will cost you at least four pounds more; that is, five pounds for four hundred acres, or, say, ten thousand dollars. Have you that much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And as it {{had been}} the night before, so it was now. The Genie brought the princess, and she and Jacob Stuck feasted {{together}} until nearly midnight. Then, again, the door opened, and the beautiful servant-lad came with the tray and something upon it covered with a napkin. Jacob Stuck unfolded the napkin, and this time it was a cup made of a single ruby, and filled to the brim with gold money. And the wonder of the cup was this: that no matter how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> took out of it, it was always full. [...] "Take this," [...] said Jacob Stuck, [...] "to remind you of me." [...] Then the clock struck twelve, and instantly all was darkness, and the Genie carried the princess home again.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the devil}} (who is {{always trying to}} slander God to us) whispers to them, as he did to Eve, [...] "How unreasonable! how hard on you. People {{say that this is}} wrong, and you must not do it, and yet how {{pleasant}} it must be! How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> might get by it--how much wiser, and cleverer, and more able to help yourself you would become, if you went your own way, and did what you like. Surely God is hard on you, and grudges you pleasure. Never mind--don't be afraid. Surely you can judge best what is good for you. Surely you know your own business best. Use your own common sense and do what you like, and what you think will profit you. Are you to be a slave to old rules which your parents or the clergyman taught you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll see the {{property}} this afternoon," [...] he promised. [...] "If your statement is {{borne out by}} the facts, I am willing to come in with <b>you.</b> How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> do <b>you</b> require from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear chap, I don't {{know what}} on earth you're talking about. How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> do <b>you</b> think I've got? Four hundred pounds a year, and no {{prospect}} of ever making more unless I sweat for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How much?" [...] {{says the}} Grand Inquisitor: for the formula of {{interrogation}} used to be, {{when a new}} boy came to the school, [...] "What's your name? Who's your father? and how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> have <b>you</b> got?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, what I'm {{going to}} say is in your interest, and you've got to believe that I have some {{authority}} for saying it. I can't tell you just how much, for I don't know as I know myself exactly. But I {{think you can get}} back if you work it right. Of course, you can't get back for nothing. It's going to cost you something. It's going to cost you all you've brought with you,"--Pinney watched Northwick's impassive face for the next change that should pass upon it; he caught it, and added--"and more. But I happen to know that the balance will be forthcoming when it's needed. I can't say how I know it, for I don't exactly know how I know it. But I do know it; and you know that it's for you to take the first step. You must say how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> brought with you, and where it is, and how it can be got at. I should think," [...] said Pinney, with a drop in his earnestness, and as if the notion had just occurred to him, [...] "you would want to see that place of yours again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is my duty, Marian," [...] he said gravely, [...] "to {{speak of}} the {{statement}} you made last night. We need not allude to the painful scene which took place then: better let that rest and be forgotten as soon as possible. But the discovery {{of what you have}} been doing without my knowledge has cost me a sleepless night {{and a great deal of}} anxiety. I wish to reason with you now quite calmly and dispassionately; and I trust you will remember that I am older and have far more experience of the world than you, and that I am a better judge of your interests than you yourself can possibly be. Ahem! I have been this morning to the City, where I saw Mr. Conolly, and endeavored to make him understand the true nature of his conduct toward me--and, I may add, toward you--in working his way clandestinely into an intimacy with you. I shall not describe to you what passed; but I may say that I have found him to be a person with whom you could not hope for a day's happiness. Even apart from his habits and tastes, which are those of a mere workman, his social (and, I fear, his religious) views are such as no lady, no properly-minded woman of any class, could sympathize with. You will be better able to judge of his character when I tell you that he informed me of his having taken care, before making any advances to you, to ascertain how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> had. He boasted in the coarsest terms of his complete influence over you, evidently without a suspicion of the impression of venality and indelicacy which his words were calculated to make on me. Besides, Marian, I am sure you would not like to contract a marriage which would give me the greatest pain; which would offend my family; and which would have the effect of shutting you out from all good society." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} with what I took for the accent of grim menace. [...] "That's a pity." [...] He paused, then, unrelenting: [...] "How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> have <b>you</b> got, Captain?" [...] he inquired with awful directness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, and now, Honoria, if {{you will}} only have {{patience}} and put up with things for a while, you shall be rich enough; I will make <b>money</b> for <b>you,</b> as <b>much</b> <b>money</b> as <b>you</b> want. I have many friends. I have not done so badly at the Bar this year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead as a door nail," [...] replied Mr. Cox, promptly. [...] "I’d {{no idea he}} {{was such}} a {{delicate}} little man. What am I to do? Every moment adds to my danger. I must fly. How <b>much</b> <b>money</b> have <b>you</b> got?" ...|$|R
