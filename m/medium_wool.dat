5|$|Breeds {{are often}} {{categorized}} by {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major <b>medium</b> <b>wool</b> breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E

40|$|Freshwater is an {{increasingly}} scare resource that is extensively used in textile wet-processing. In seeking to identify alternative low freshwater usage coloration technology {{this study examined}} the potential use of seawater (SEAW) as the dyeing <b>medium</b> for <b>wool</b> coloration using a range of reactive dyes. Initially the dyeing behaviour of the wool fabric in simulated seawater (SSW) was compared against conventional dyeing from distilled water (W) using alpha-bromoacrylamide-based Lanasol dyes and sulphatoethylsulphone-based Remazol dyes. These preliminary studies demonstrated that comparable coloration performance could be acheived in the SSW medium based on the assessment of the dye exhaustion, dye fixation, colour yiel and levelness. Subsequent 'real' seawater dyeing studies of wool, using Mauritian seawater, with the lanasol and Remazol reactive dyes again confirmed that comparable coloration performance, based on the dye exhaustion, dye fixation, colour yield and levelness, could be achieved, highlighting again the potential for substituting freshwater with much more plentiful seawater as the dyeing medium...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{panels are}} used to {{overcome}} noise problems; {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the acoustical properties of particleboard made from Betung bamboo (Dendrocalamus asper). The acoustic parameters measured were the transmission loss (TL) value and sound absorption coefficient. Particleboards of two different densities (0. 5 g/cm 3 and 0. 8 g/cm 3) that were made with three particle sizes (fine, <b>medium,</b> and <b>wool</b> or excelsior) were used in this study. The sound TL value was measured in a reverberation room, while the sound absorption coefficient was determined using the impedance tube method. A single-number rating of sound transmission class (STC) was determined based on TL measurements. The results showed that sound TL and STC values of medium-density particleboard (0. 8 g/cm 3) were better than low-density (0. 5 g/cm 3) board. However, low-density particleboard performed well as sound absorber panels. Generally, the boards absorbed sound at low (1000 Hz) and reflected sound at middle frequencies. The sound absorption coefficient was better with the fine- and medium-sized particles than with the wool size; meanwhile, boards made from wool- or excelsior-sized particles possessed higher TL and STC values...|$|R

5000|$|The Southdowns {{had long}} dark brown or black legs, matured early, {{produced}} {{the best of}} mutton and a fine quality of <b>medium</b> <b>wool.</b> The original Hampshire was larger, coarser, but hardier, slower to mature, with inferior flesh, and a longer but coarser wool. The Southdown had always been remarkable for its power of transmitting its special characteristics to its progeny by other kinds of sheep, and hence it soon impressed its own characteristics on its progeny by the Hampshire. The horns of the original breed have disappeared; the face and legs have become dark, the frame has become more compact, the bones smaller, the back broader and straighter, the legs shorter, and the flesh and wool of better quality, while the superior hardiness and greater size, {{as well as the}} large head and Roman nose of the old breed, still remain. Hampshires of the 1890s matured early and fattened readily. They clipped from 6 to 7 pounds of wool, suitable for combing, which was longer than Southdown wool, but less fine.|$|E
5000|$|Aubusson is {{well known}} for its {{tapestry}} and carpets, which have been famous throughout the world since the 14th century. Its origins were born with the arrival of weavers from Flanders, who took refuge in Aubusson around 1580. There is a famous collection of Aubusson tapestries at Vallon-Pont-d'Arc. The style of the tapestries produced has changed through the centuries, from scenes of green landscapes through to hunting scenes. In the 17th Century, the Aubusson and Felletin workshops were given [...] "Royal Appointment" [...] status. A downturn in fortunes came after the French revolution and the arrival of wallpaper. However, tapestry made something of a comeback during the 1930s, with artists such as Cocteau, Dufy, Dali, Braque, Calder and Picasso being invited to Aubusson to express themselves through the <b>medium</b> of <b>wool.</b> Aubusson tapestry still thrives today, preserving a range of traditional skills. In 1983, l’Atelier Raymond Picaud chose Burhan Doğançay's Ribbon Series as a tapestry subject. Coventry cathedral's famous Christ in Glory tapestry, designed by artist Graham Sutherland, was woven in nearby Felletin. Installed in 1962, this was the world's largest vertical tapestry up until the 1990s.|$|R

40|$|The carcass characteristics, meat {{quality and}} {{specific}} muscle enzyme activity were studied in 342 Merino wether hoggets representing 7 bloodlines comprising 2 superfine lines, 2 fine wool lines, 2 <b>medium</b> <b>wool</b> lines and 1 broad wool line over 2 years. All animals were supplemented at pasture for 5 weeks before slaughter with high energy pellets. Fat {{levels in the}} superfine bloodlines based on total tissue depth over the 12 th rib, 110 mm from the midline were much greater than in other lines. This also applied to fat depth measured over the longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LL) muscle {{for one of the}} superfine bloodlines when adjusted to the same carcass weight. Differences in LL muscle dimensions were minor, although the broad wool bloodline had a lower depth which translated into a smaller cross-sectional area. Significant differences were detected between bloodlines for muscle pH with superfine animals having the highest values for the LL. The differences for the semitendinosus muscle were less consistent between bloodlines, but of the bloodlines the broad wool line had the lowest pH levels in both muscles. There were few differences between bloodlines for the meat colour parameters measured on the LL. In the second year, muscle samples were taken to determine the activity of fructose 1, 6 -bis-phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) and the concentration of myoglobin, indicators of anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Samples from 50 carcasses were selected from a <b>medium</b> <b>wool</b> and a superfine bloodline (2 × 25) based on LL muscle pH values. Of the enzymes, only ICDH activity was different between the 2 bloodlines, with muscle from the <b>medium</b> <b>wool</b> bloodline having a significantly higher activity than muscle from the superfine bloodline. This indicates a greater aerobic capacity in the muscle of the <b>medium</b> <b>wool</b> bloodline. The significantly lower muscle pH for <b>medium</b> <b>wool</b> bloodline was mirrored by a lower glycolytic capacity expressed as the LDH/ICDH ratio with a correlation of 0. 46. Thus in this dataset, a high pH is related to a change in energy metabolism as reflected by the aerobic/anaerobic capacity of the muscle and this may be a reflection of a change in fibre type frequency, but this remains to be validate...|$|E

We took portions of the trickling filters which degraded LADPEDS, shook the organisms from the solid support (polyester), and found that growth in suspended culture in LADPEDS-salts medium occurred only {{in the presence of}} some solid support (polyester fleece or glass wool), though little biomass was immobilized on the support. The end products in suspended culture were identical with those from the trickling filters. There was low plating efficiency of LADPEDS-grown cultures on complex medium, and no picked colony or mixture of colonies grew in LADPEDS-salts-glass <b>wool</b> <b>medium.</b> However, selective plates containing LADPEDS-salts medium solidified with agarose yielded LADPEDS-dependent, pinpoint colonies which could be picked singly and subcultured in selective liquid medium. Isolate DS- 1 was a bacterium which showed 93 % sequence homology (16 S ribosomal DNA) to its nearest phylogenetic neighbor, an α-proteobacterium. Strain DS- 1 grew heterotrophically in LADPEDS-salts-glass <b>wool</b> <b>medium</b> and converted the set of aryl-substituted alkanes to the corresponding aryl-substituted carboxylic acids of shorter chain length. Similarly, strain DS- 1 grew heterotrophically with commercial LAS, converting it to a set of sulfophenylcarboxylates.

50|$|The {{creative}} {{partnership between}} the tapestry establishment and visual artists, through which paintings were translated into textile form, continued to flourish; tapestries were woven from designs by artists Václav Špála, František Süser, and many others. The ensuing 1930s were marked by a minimalist artistic expression, distinctive of functionalist-style carpet designs. During World War I, the manufactory's art production stagnated {{due to the lack}} of fine-quality material for tapestry weaving. In 1946, a new management was appointed to the plant and its specialization was expanded to include the restoration of historical tapestries and production of handwoven carpets. The following year saw the establishment of cooperation with foreign companies, among them the French traditional tapestry workshop in Aubusson. In the 1950s, a tapestry was made for the Triennale in Milan from a design by Pravoslak Kotík and another piece was produced from a pattern by Ludmila Kybalová for the World's Fair Expo '58 in Brussels. In the 1960s, the manufactory collaborated with the textile designer Antonín Kybal and a sizable group of his students. Jan T. Sryček, the current director of the Moravská Gobelínová Manufaktura, was also enrolled in Kybal's studio at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague. Sryček has been representing the manufactory's modern history from the early 1990s. Apart from textile design work, Sryček also initiated the Actual Textile Art project.
