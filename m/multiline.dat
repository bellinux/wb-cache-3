40|$|Resistance (R) genes protect plants very {{effectively}} from disease, {{but many of}} them are rapidly overcome when present in widely grown cultivars. To overcome this lack of durability, strategies that increase host resistance diversity have been proposed. Among them is the use of <b>multilines</b> composed of near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing different disease resistance genes. In contrast to classical R-gene introgression by recurrent backcrossing, a transgenic approach allows the development of lines with identical genetic background, differing only in a single R gene. We have used alleles of the resistance locus Pm 3 in wheat, conferring race-specific resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici), to develop transgenic wheat lines overexpressing Pm 3 a, Pm 3 c, Pm 3 d, Pm 3 f or Pm 3 g. In field experiments, all tested transgenic lines were significantly more resistant than their respective nontransformed sister lines. The resistance level of the transgenic Pm 3 lines was determined mainly by the frequency of virulence to the particular Pm 3 allele in the powdery mildew population, Pm 3 expression levels and most likely also allele-specific properties. We created six two-way <b>multilines</b> by mixing seeds of the parental line Bobwhite and transgenic Pm 3 a, Pm 3 b and Pm 3 d lines. The Pm 3 <b>multilines</b> were more resistant than their components when tested in the field. This demonstrates that the difference in a single R gene is sufficient to cause host-diversity effects and that <b>multilines</b> of transgenic Pm 3 wheat lines represent a promising strategy for an effective and sustainable use of Pm 3 alleles...|$|R

The second {{objective is}} to understand the molecular interactions between rice and BPH. We should not only accelerate research on map-base cloning of BPH resistance genes, but also pay attention to and the genome and genetics of BPH itself. The BPH genome was sequenced and genomes of BPH and its endosymbionts revealed complex complementary contributions for host adaptation (Xue et al. 2014).

While transgenic plants with introduced Bt genes have been deployed in several crops on a global scale, the alternative genes have received considerably less attention. The protease inhibitor and lectin genes largely affect insect growth and development and, in most instances, do not result in insect mortality. The effective concentrations of these proteins are {{much greater than the}} Bt toxin proteins. Therefore, the potential of some of the alternative genes can only be realized by deploying them in combination with conventional host plant resistance and Bt genes. Genes conferring {{resistance to}} insects can also be deployed as <b>multilines</b> or synthetic varieties. Initial indications from deployment of transgenics with insect resistance in diverse cropping systems in USA, Canada, Argentina, China, India, Australia, and South Africa suggest that single transgene products in standard cultivar backgrounds are not a recipe for sustainable pest management. Instead, a much more complex approach may be needed, one which may involve deployment of a combination of different transgenes in different backgrounds. Under diverse climatic conditions and cropping systems of tropics, the success in the utilization of transgenics for pest management may involve decentralized national breeding programs and several small-scale seed companies. While several transgenic crops with insecticidal genes have been introduced in the temperate regions, very little has been done to use this technology for improving crop productivity in the harsh environments of the tropics, where the need for increasing food production is most urgent.

Greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), is an important insect pest of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, in the United States. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach has been used to manage greenbug. Greenbug biotype formation renders resistant sorghums ineffective as an IPM component. <b>Multilines</b> have been used to prolong duration of resistance genes for pathogens in small grains and may contribute to the effective management of greenbug biotypes. Five biotype E greenbug resistant and susceptible sorghum genotype mixtures were studied. These mixtures were evaluated in greenhouse experiments from 1993 to 1995 and field experiments on the Texas A&M University Research Farm near College Station, TX during 1994 and 1995. Greenhouse experiments assessed effects of mixtures on greenbug and field experiments evaluated mixture effects on greenbug in the presence and absence of natural enemies. Effects were measured by assessment of greenbug abundance, vegetative response, and grain yield data. Greenbug abundance trends in greenhouse experiments suggested plant mixtures containing 25 % or less resistant plants were less effective for managing greenbugs than those mixtures containing at least 50 % resistant plants. Plants of all mixtures were statistically equal for plant height and insect damage. Data. indicated plant height may have confounded results in the greenhouse experiments. Considering plant height results, mixtures containing 75 % resistant plants may be equal to sorghum stands of all resistant plants for greenbug management in seedling sorghum. Greenbug abundance was significantly reduced in treatments where natural enemies were allowed access, suggesting natural enemies prevented greenbug from reaching economic levels in field experiments. Greenbug abundance and plant damage data indicated a plant mixture containing 25 % resistant plants was least effective managing greenbug. Treatments which allowed natural enemies access to greenbug had significantly taller plants, greater plant masses, and grain yield than those in which natural enemies were excluded. Plant height, plant mass, and grain yield data were inconclusive for determining statistical differences between mixtures. Experiments do suggest mixtures containing a minimum of 50 % resistant plants may be as effective as all resistant stands experiencing moderate greenbug pressure...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal, uniform, race-non-specific or stable {{resistance}} can {{be discerned}} according to Van der Plank, from vertical, differential, race-specific or unstable resistance by a test {{in which a}} number of host genotypes (cultivars or clones) are tested against a number of pathogen genetypes traces of isolatest. If the total non-environmental variance in levels of resistance is due to main effects only differences between cultivars and differences between isolates) the resistance and the pathogen many (in the broad sense) are horizontal in nature. Vertical resistance and pathogenicity are characterized by the interaction between host and pathogen showing up as a variance compenent in this test due to interaction between cultivars and isolates. A host and pathogen model was made in which resistance and pathogenicity are governed by live polygenic loci. Within the host the resistance genes show additivity. Two models were investigated in model I resistance and pathogenicity genes operate in an additive way as envisaged by Van der Plank in his horizontal resistance. Model II {{is characterized by a}} gene-for-gene action between the polygenes of the host and those of the pathogen. The cultivar isolate test in model I showed only main effect variance. Surprisingly, the variance in model II was also largely due to main effects. The contribution of the interaction to the variance uppeared so small, that {{it would be difficult to}} discern it from a normal error variance. So-called horizontal resistance can therefore be explained by a polygenic resistance, where the individual genes are vertical and operating on a gene-for-gene basis with virulence genes in the pathogen. The data reported so far support the idea that model II rather than model I is the realistic one. The two models also revealed that populations with a polygenic resistance based on the gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared with the addition model, while its stability as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher compared to those with an additive gene action. Mathematical studies of Mode too support the gene-for-gene concept. The operation of all resistance and virulence genes in a natural population is therefore seen as one integrated system. All genes for true resistance in the host population, whether they are major or minor genes are considered to interact in a gene-for-gene way with virulence genes either major or minor, in the pathogen population. The models revealed other important aspects. Populations with a polygenic resistance based on a gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared to populations following the addition model. The stability, as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher in the interaction model than in the addition model. The effect of a resistance gene on the level of resistance of the population consists of its effect on a single plant times its gene frequency in the population. Due to the adaptive forces in both the host and the pathogen population and the gene-for-gene nature of the gene action an equilibrium develops that allows all resistance genes to remain effective although their corresponding virulence genes are present. The frequencies of the resistance and virulence genes are such that the effective frequencies of resistance genes tend to be negatively related to the magnitude of the gene effect. This explains why major genes often occur at low frequencies, while minor genes appear to be frequent. It is in this way that the host and the pathogen, both as extremely variable and vigorous populations, can co-exist. Horizontal and vertical resistance as meant by Van der Plank therefore do not represent different kinds of resistances, they represent merely polygenic and oligogenic resistances resp. In both situations the individual host genes interact specifically with virulence genes in the pathogen. Van der Plank's test for horizontal resistance appears to be a simple and sound way to test for polygenic inheritance of resistance. The practical considerations have been discussed. The agro-ecosystems should be made as diverse as possible. <b>Multilines,</b> polygenic resistance, tolerance, gene deployment and other measures should be employed, if possible in combination...|$|R
