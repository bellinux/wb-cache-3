500|$|John F. Stossel {{was born}} on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago's {{affluent}} North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as [...] "the superstar of the family", commenting, [...] "While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School." [...] Stossel characterizes himself as having been [...] "an indifferent student" [...] while in college, commenting, [...] "I daydreamed through half <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> at Princeton, and applied to grad school only because I was ambitious, and grad school seemed like the right path for a 21-year-old who wanted to get ahead." [...] Although he had been accepted to the University of Chicago's School of Hospital Management, Stossel was [...] "sick of school" [...] and thought taking a job would inspire him to embrace graduate studies with renewed vigor.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Laffer curve" [...] was {{reportedly}} coined by Jude Wanniski (a writer for The Wall Street Journal) after a 1974 dinner {{meeting at the}} Two Continents Restaurant in the Washington Hotel with Arthur Laffer, Wanniski, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy press secretary Grace-Marie Arnett. In this meeting, Laffer, arguing against President Gerald Ford's tax increase, reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate the concept. Cheney did not accept the idea immediately, but it caught the imaginations of those present. Laffer professes no recollection of this napkin, but writes: [...] "I used the so-called Laffer Curve {{all the time in}} <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> and with anyone else who would listen to me".|$|E

I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> before." ...|$|E

60|$|High in my attic room I bent {{above my}} {{manuscript}} with a fierce resolve. From eight {{o'clock in the}} morning until half past twelve, I dug and polished. In the afternoon, I met <b>my</b> <b>classes.</b> In the evening I revised what I had written and in case I did not go to the theater or to a lecture (I had no social engagements) I wrote until ten o'clock. For recreation I sometimes drove with Dr. Cross on his calls or walked the lanes and climbed the hills with my brother.|$|E
60|$|TUESDAY. - I {{got your}} letter to-day, {{and was so}} glad thereof. It was of good omen to me also. I worked from ten to one (<b>my</b> <b>classes</b> are {{suspended}} now for Xmas holidays), and wrote four or five Portfolio pages of my Buckinghamshire affair. Then I went to Duddingston and skated all afternoon. If you had seen the moon rising, a perfect sphere of smoky gold, in the dark air above the trees, and the white loch thick with skaters, and the great hill, snow-sprinkled, overhead! It was a sight for a king.|$|E
60|$|As {{a citizen}} with a known {{habitation}} I {{was permitted to}} carry away books from the library, and each morning from eight until half-past twelve I sat at my desk writing, tearing away at some lecture, or historical essay, {{and once in a}} while I composed a few lines of verse. Five afternoons in each week I went to <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> and to the library, returning at six o'clock to my dinner and to my reading. This was my routine, and I was happy in it. My letters to my people in the west were confident, more confident than I ofttimes felt.|$|E

60|$|The ninety dollars which I {{gained from}} {{this series of}} lectures was, let me say, the less {{important}} part of my victory, {{and yet it was}} wondrous opportune. They enabled me to cancel my indebtedness to the Doctor, and still have a little something to keep me going until <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> began in October, and as my landlord did not actually evict me, I stayed on shamelessly, fattening visibly on the puddings and roasts which Mrs. Cross provided and dear old Mary cooked with joy. She was the true artist. She loved to see her work appreciated.|$|E

Most of the boys are afraid to speak to her, she's so distant. She just says 'Yes,' or 'No,' when you ask her anything. She's religious--goes to prayer meeting and Sunday school. About a dozen boys go to prayer meeting just because she goes and sings. Her folks live in Waverly, but she boards with her aunt, Mrs. Brown. Now, that's all I can tell you about her. She's in some of <b>my</b> <b>classes,</b> but I dassent talk to her." ...|$|E

Those prints are not of much use, therefore, to my special classes. Most of them have passed beyond the stage of being taught by pictures, though they like to look at them. But Mrs. Palmer has been using them constantly with the girls' classes, and so with the less advanced classes throughout the school.|$|E

60|$|I {{turned a}} page or two, and {{instantly}} my mental horizon widened. When I {{had finished the}} Artist of the Beautiful, the great Puritan romancer had laid his spell upon me everlastingly. Even as I walked homeward to my lunch, I read. I ate with the book beside my plate. I neglected <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> that afternoon, {{and as soon as}} I had absorbed this volume I secured the other and devoted myself to it with almost equal intensity. The stately diction, the rich and glowing imagery, the mystical radiance, and the aloofness of the author's personality all united to create in me a worshipful admiration which made all other interests pale and faint. It was my first profound literary passion and I was dazzled by the glory of it.|$|E
60|$|And how I did cram! I had two years' {{new work}} {{to do in a}} third of a year. For five weeks I crammed, until {{simultaneous}} quadratic equations and chemical formulas fairly oozed from my ears. And then the master of the academy took me aside. He was very sorry, but he was compelled to give me back my tuition fee and to ask me to leave the school. It wasn't a matter of scholarship. I stood well in <b>my</b> <b>classes,</b> and did he graduate me into the university he was confident that in that institution I would continue to stand well. The trouble was that tongues were gossiping about my case. What! In four months accomplished two years' work! It would be a scandal, and the universities were becoming severer in their treatment of accredited prep schools. He couldn't afford such a scandal, therefore I must gracefully depart.|$|E
60|$|All day I was at <b>my</b> <b>classes</b> or in {{quest of}} my new lodging; and though the hour of our {{customary}} walk hung miserably on my hands, I cannot say but I was happy on the whole to find my way cleared, the girl again in proper keeping, the father satisfied or at least acquiescent, and myself free to prosecute my love with honour. At supper, as at all our meals, it was James More that did the talking. No doubt but he talked well, if anyone could have believed him. But I will speak of him presently more at large. The meal at an end, he rose, got his great coat, and looking (as I thought) at me, observed he had affairs abroad. I took this for a hint that I was to be going also, and got up; whereupon the girl, who had scarce given me greeting at my entrance, turned her eyes on me wide open, with a look that bade me stay. I stood between them like a fish out of water, turning {{from one to the}} other; neither seemed to observe me, she gazing on the floor, he buttoning his coat: which vastly swelled my embarrassment. This appearance of indifferency argued, upon her side, a good deal of anger very near to burst out. Upon his, I thought it horribly alarming; I made sure there was a tempest brewing there; and considering that to be the chief peril, turned towards him and put myself (so to speak) in the man's hands.|$|E

60|$|I was {{far from}} being a native of these parts, springing, as I did, from an unmixed lowland stock. But an uncle of mine, Gordon Darnaway, after a poor, rough youth, and some years at sea, had married a young wife in the islands; Mary Maclean she was called, the last of her family; and when she died in giving birth to a daughter, Aros, the sea-girt farm, had {{remained}} in his possession. It brought him in nothing but the means of life, as I was well aware; but {{he was a man who}}m ill-fortune had pursued; he feared, cumbered as he was with the young child, to make a fresh adventure upon life; and remained in Aros, biting his nails at destiny. Years passed over his head in that isolation, and brought neither help nor contentment. Meantime our family was dying out in the lowlands; there is little luck for any of that race; and perhaps my father was the luckiest of all, for not only was he one of the last to die, but he left a son to his name and a little money to support it. I was a student of Edinburgh University, living well enough at my own charges, but without kith or kin; when some news of me found its way to Uncle Gordon on the Ross of Grisapol; and he, as he was a man who held blood thicker than water, wrote to me the day he heard of my existence, and taught me to count Aros as my home. Thus it was that I came to spend my vacations in that part of the country, so far from all society and comfort, between the codfish and the moorcocks; and thus it was that now, when I had done with <b>my</b> <b>classes,</b> I was returning thither with so light a heart that July day.|$|E
