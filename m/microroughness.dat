40|$|This study {{examines}} the rainfall-induced change in soil <b>microroughness</b> of a bare smooth soil surface in an agricultural field. The majority of soil <b>microroughness</b> {{studies have focused}} on surface roughness on the order of ∼  5 – 50  mm and have reported a decay of soil surface roughness with rainfall. However, there is quantitative evidence from a few studies suggesting that surfaces with <b>microroughness</b> less than 5  mm may undergo an increase in roughness when subject to rainfall action. The focus herein is on initial <b>microroughness</b> length scales on the order of 2  mm, a low roughness condition observed seasonally in some landscapes under bare conditions and chosen to systematically examine the increasing roughness phenomenon. Three rainfall intensities of  30, 60, and 75  mm h − 1 are applied to a smoothened bed surface in a field plot via a rainfall simulator. Soil surface <b>microroughness</b> is recorded via a surface-profile laser scanner. Several indices are utilized to quantify the soil surface <b>microroughness,</b> namely the random roughness (RR) index, the crossover length, the variance scale from the Markov–Gaussian model, and the limiting difference. Findings show a consistent increase in roughness under the action of rainfall, with an overall agreement between all indices in terms of trend and magnitude. Although this study is limited to a narrow range of rainfall and soil conditions, the results suggest that the outcome of the interaction between rainfall and a soil surface can be different for smooth and rough surfaces and thus warrant the need for a better understanding of this interaction...|$|E

40|$|Ion beam {{sputtering}} {{has been}} applied for polishing, figuring and multilayer coating on silicon and quartz glass Substrates for the fabrication of x-ray mirrors. For high-performance x-ray optics extremely low <b>microroughnesses</b> of the substrates have to be achieved. Particularly for low d-spacing multilayers (d = 1 [...] . 2 nm) even small improvements of the surface quality result in significant performance gains of the mirrors. By ion beam polishing silicon substrate surfaces could be smoothed from 0. 18 nm rms to 0. 11 rim rms (AFM scan length = 5 mu m). Furthermore figuring of spherical substrates into elliptical or parabolic surface contours has been developed and applied. Spherical quartz glass substrates with initial rms roughnesses of 0. 73 nm and 0. 52 nm show reduced roughnesses after figuring and multilayer coating of 0. 26 nm and 0. 10 nm using AFM scan lengths of 20 pm and 5 pm, respectively. The testing of the ion beam figured mirrors for the application as parallel beam and focussing optics shows very promising results: The comparison of collimating mirrors, produced either by ion beam figuring or bending, shows very similar x-ray intensities.

The {{focusing}} {{performance of}} X-ray optics (conveniently {{expressed in terms}} of HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon scattering caused by the <b>microroughness</b> of reflecting surfaces. In particular, the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS), the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also in the hard X-ray band (i. e. beyond 10 keV). In order to ensure the imaging quality at all energies, clear requirements have to be established in terms of reflecting surfaces <b>microroughness.</b> Methods.

Evaluate the efficacy of each polishing technique {{on the basis of}} published Ra data; 3. Identify a polishing technique, which allows obtaining Ra values and a morphologic surface able to prevent bacterial adhesion. METHODS: 21 zirconia platelets (1 cm x 0. 7 cm thickness 1 mm). Samples were subjected to 5 different polishing methods from 5 different operators. Each operator realized 4 samples. <b>Microroughness</b> measurements and statistical analysis of the data obtained and Morphological analysis by SEM took place at the “Centro Grandi Strumenti” of the University of Modena. RESULTS:Data indicate that all polishing techniques are operator-dependent and the final result can be affected by several variables. Such variables not only led to significant differences between operators but also among samples of the same group. Ra values were reported to be ≥ 0. 3 μm. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The polishing techniques not result sufficiently efficacious to reduce Ra surface values of zirconia; surfaces tested are characterized by Ra medium values > 0. 2 µm; values over 0. 2 µm are not able to prevent bacterial adhesion to the same surface; 2. Low Ra values not necessarily correspond with a smooth surface, as indicated by SEM analysis. This shows that a polish zirconia surface can present irregularities anyway; 3.
