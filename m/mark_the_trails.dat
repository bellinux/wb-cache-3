50|$|One of {{the goals}} of the project was to {{generate}} social capital by engaging cooperation between local institutions and social groups. Project included: planning <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> publicizing an informative booklet and map in printed and electronic version, building an interactive website of <b>the</b> project, <b>marking</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> sites and opening <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> to <b>the</b> public with a walk around the city, publicizing teacher's materials.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Buckeye <b>Trail</b> Association, a {{non-profit}} volunteer organization, maintains and develops <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> is identified by blue blazes, 2 x 6 in, on trees or poles.

A double blaze with no offset simply means pay attention - <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> route may not be obvious.|$|R

5000|$|At a hash, one or {{more members}} ("hares") lay a trail, which is then {{followed}} by {{the remainder of the}} group (the [...] "pack" [...] or [...] "hounds"). Sawdust, flour, chalk, and toilet paper are used to <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> periodically ends at a [...] "check" [...] and the pack must find where it begins again; often <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> includes false trails, short cuts, dead ends, back checks, and splits. These features are designed to keep the pack together despite differences in fitness level or running speed, as front-runners are forced to slow down to find the [...] "true" [...] trail, allowing stragglers to catch up.|$|R
50|$|At the {{intersection}} of English and Avon avenues <b>the</b> Pleasant Run <b>Trail</b> diverges from <b>the</b> creek and is routed along the sidewalks on English Avenue to Pleasant Run Parkway North Drive. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> continues west between the parkway and the creek to Keystone Avenue, at which point it is again routed on sidewalks south on Keystone and east on Prospect Street until it again meets the creek. There are signs <b>marking</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in those locations where it uses city sidewalks.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a marked}} hiking trail that goes up Maple Mountain and affords great {{views of the}} water, Salt Spring Island and the distant snowy peaks of the mainland. To get to the trailhead, follow Osborne Bay Road north toward Crofton and turn right on Chilco Road. Follow Chilco {{to the very end}} and park there. Walk past the yellow gate.

60|$|At boughs' ends, {{where the}} anthropoid swings from one tree to another, there is most to <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> but least {{to point the}} {{direction}} of the quarry; for there the pressure is downward always, toward the small end of the branch, whether the ape be leaving or entering a tree. Nearer the center of the tree, where the signs of passage are fainter, the direction is plainly marked.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Oregon <b>Trail</b> Memorial Association {{became part}} of the newly formed American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA) in 1940, a group meant to be broader in scope than the OTMA. A 1942 joint {{financial}} statement of both organizations reveals that it still held 7,212 half dollars. It was selling 1936 and 1937-D half dollars in 1943. A letter to the editor in the September 1943 issue of The Numismatist stated that the group was selling the pieces at $5 to finance stakes made of Oregon wood with which to <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trail.</b> <b>The</b> sum of five dollars, which included membership, paid for a coin at a time, the letter noted, when the pieces were selling at $1.50 from dealers.|$|R
40|$|The bison {{were the}} first through Cumberland Gap, finding a break carved by wind and water in the Appalachian Mountain chain. Then Native Americans {{followed}} {{what they called the}} Warrior's Path when traveling between the Ohio Valley and the Shenandoah. In 1775, Daniel Boone was hired to <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Boone's Wilderness Road, which brought wagons and a flood of European settlers across the Appalachians, was "the way west" until the mid- 19 th century...|$|R
50|$|A miller {{wished to}} marry his {{daughter}} off, {{and so when}} a rich suitor appeared, he betrothed her to him. One day the suitor complained that the daughter never visited him, {{told her that he}} lived in the forest, and overrode her reluctance by telling her he would leave a trail of ashes so she could find his home. She filled her pockets with peas and lentils and <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> with them as she followed the ashes.|$|R
50|$|White {{rectangles}} {{and metal}} disks <b>mark</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> From south to north, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> visits {{a number of}} high points with ledge-top views including Diamond Hill 481 ft, also known for its defunct ski area; Sunset Rock, Wampum Rock, Knuckup Hill, Outlook Rock, Pinnacle Hill, Goat Rock, High Rock, Pierce Hill, Allen Ledge, Bluff Head, and Moose Hill, <b>the</b> <b>trail's</b> high point. <b>The</b> Warner <b>Trail</b> also visits a number of bodies of water and passes through three state forests (Wrentham State Forest, F.

50|$|The GTA {{originated}} {{from a similar}} trail in France established about 1970, and {{is part of a}} network of European long-distance footpaths traversing the Alps. During the mid-1970s, a group of Turin mountain-hiking enthusiasts expanded the concept of a long-distance path following the Piedmontese Alpine arc around the Rivista della Montagna and libreria della Montagna. The volunteers later formed the Associazione GTA. The associated organized overnight accommodations and <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> attracting public funds. From 1981 to 1989 a hiking guide was published in book form, and in 1982 a formal tour was organized to publicize <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|R
