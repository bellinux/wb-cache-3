25|$|Toxic {{substances}} and poisons (like atropine) can {{significantly reduce the}} range of aperture. Pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar side-effects.

Atropine is also used {{in such a way}} but its effects can last up to 2 weeks, along with the mydriatic effect; it produces cycloplegia (a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects). This effect goes away after 8 hours. Other medications offer the contrary effect. Pilocarpine is a <b>miotic</b> (induces miosis); it can make a pupil as small as 1mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics.

In combination with atenolol <b>miotics</b> or adrenaline show an additive effect. Phillips et al. (1967) published the first report of the ocular hypotensive effect of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol). Subsequently several other compounds in this pharmacological class were studied, and a similar effect was found, examples being practolol, oxprenolol, and atenolol (Vale an...|$|R
5000|$|Albrecht von Graefe (1828-1870) (Germany) Along with Helmholtz and Donders, {{one of the}} 'founding fathers' of {{ophthalmology}} as a specialty. He was {{a brilliant}} clinician and charismatic teacher who had an international influence {{on the development of}} ophthalmology, and was a pioneer in mapping visual field defects and diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. He introduced a cataract extraction technique that remained the standard for over 100 years, and many other important surgical techniques such as iridectomy. He rationalised the use of many ophthalmically important drugs, including mydriatics and <b>miotics.</b> He also was the founder of one of the earliest ophthalmic societies (German Ophthalmological Society, 1857) and one of the earliest ophthalmic journals (Graefe's Archives of Ophthalmology). He was probably the most important ophthalmologist of the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Spherical {{lenses and}} <b>miotic</b> eye drops can provide relief in {{some types of}} {{horizontal}} strabismus by biasing the neural link between convergence (orienting the lines of sight for near objects) and accommodation (focusing), and prism lenses can relieve diplopia (double vision) by refracting the visual axis, but these treatments don’t address the underlying muscular imbalance, and are not further considered here.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{correction}} for presbyopia varies {{among those with}} certain professions and those with <b>miotic</b> pupils. In particular, farmers and homemakers seek correction later, whereas service workers and construction workers seek eyesight correction earlier. Scuba divers with interest in underwater photography may notice presbyopic changes while diving before they recognize the symptoms in their normal routines due to the near focus in low light conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Clinical exam {{may reveal}} sectoral paresis of the iris {{sphincter}} or vermiform iris movements. The tonic pupil may become smaller (<b>miotic)</b> over time which {{is referred to}} as [...] "little old Adie's". Testing with low dose (1/8%) pilocarpine may constrict the tonic pupil due to cholinergic denervation supersensitivity. A normal pupil will not constrict with the dilute dose of pilocarpine. CT scans and MRI scans may be useful in the diagnostic testing of focal hypoactive reflexes.|$|E
40|$|Correspondence/Book reviews {{continued}} use of pilocarpine might have inhibited pupillary dilatation and clear photography, and this of course did sometimes happen.

40|$|Medications used {{to treat}} {{glaucoma}} can have clinically im-portant systemic effects in some patients; these effects may not be recognized in elderly patients who have chronic medi-cal problems and who are taking several systemic medica-tions.

Reports of adverse systemic effects from <b>miotics,</b> such as pilocarpine, are rare, although cardiovascular decompensa-tion has been seen in patients with acute angle closure who were given excessive doses before surgery. Topical sympa-thomimetic agents such as epinephrine may increase ventric-ular extrasystoles and have, on occasion, caused severe hy-pertensive reactions.

40|$|Abstract. Uveitis {{has been}} {{reported}} in association with a variety of topical, intraocular, periocular, and systemic medications. To establish causality of adverse events by drugs, in 1981, Naranjo and associates proposed seven criteria, which are related to the frequency and documentation of the event; circumstances of occurrence, recovery, and recurrence; and coexistence of other factors or medications. Rarely does a drug meet all seven criteria. The authors review reports of drug-associated uveitis, applying the seven criteria and examining possible mechanisms. Only systemically administered biphosphonates and, perhaps, topical metipranolol meet all seven criteria. Systemic sulfonamides, rifabutin, and topical glucocorticoids fulfill at least five criteria.

50|$|Apraclonidine may {{be useful}} in the {{diagnosis}} of Horner's syndrome. In Horner's syndrome, the sympathetic innervation to the pupillary dilator muscle is lost. The affected pupil is thus <b>miotic</b> and the pupillary dilator responds to denervation by increasing α1 receptors. Apraclonidine is useful in this case due to its weak α1-adrenergic properties. When applied to the denervated (and thus hyper-sensitive) pupillary dilator muscle, a super-normal dilatory response is generated in which the pupil dilates to a degree greater than that which would be seen in a non-denervated muscle. This causes the reversal of anisocoria that is characteristic of Horner's.|$|E
50|$|Lens {{subluxation}} is {{also seen}} in dogs and {{is characterized by}} a partial displacement of the lens. It can be recognized by trembling of the iris (iridodonesis) or lens (phacodonesis) and the presence of an aphakic crescent (an area of the pupil where the lens is absent). Other signs of lens subluxation include mild conjunctival redness, vitreous humour degeneration, prolapse of the vitreous into the anterior chamber, and an increase or decrease of anterior chamber depth. Removal of the lens before it completely luxates into the anterior chamber may prevent secondary glaucoma. A nonsurgical alternative involves the use of a <b>miotic</b> to constrict the pupil and prevent the lens from luxating into the anterior chamber.|$|E

40|$|In the rat eye, intracameral {{injections}} of substance P in doses of 10 - 30 pmol caused a maximal long-lasting miosis and a {{leakage of plasma}} proteins into the aqueous humor, indicating {{a breakdown of the}} blood-aqueous barrier. Neurokinin A seemed equipotent to SP, but calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) (17 pmol) caused neither miosis nor protein leakage into the aqueous humor. The same result was obtained when CGRP was administered intravenously. Intracameral injection of capsaicin caused only a transient miosis which could not be repeated with further injections, even though the pupillary sphincter was still able to react to exogenous SP. Antidromic electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve caused plasma extravasation in the skin and a breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier with an increased protein content in the aqueous humor. The stimulation did not affect the pupil size. The results indicate that in rat eyes SP and NKA are <b>miotics,</b> but the amounts that can be released from sensory nerve endings are too small to cause persistent miosis. These peptides are more likely {{to play a role in}} the neurogenic breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier. CGRP at the same dose affects neither the pupillary sphincter muscle nor the barrier...|$|R
40|$|IN a {{previous}} communication (Romano and Jackson, 1964), the observation {{was reported that}} phakic cases of primary open-angle glaucoma undergoing treatment with strong <b>miotics,</b> mostly phospholine iodide, presented changes in {{the configuration of the}} anterior chamber after a variable period of therapy. These consisted of increasing bowing-forwards of the iris (physiological iris bombe) and a clinical impression of actual diminution of the depth of the anterior chamber. No accurate measurements of depth were available at the time to support this impression. It had further been observed that a correlation appeared to exist between the occurrence of these changes, particularly if they were of a severe degree, and failure of control or unsatisfactory control of the glaucoma, in the absence of peripheral anterior synechiae or of definite angle closure by contact. The results of measurements carried out in a comparable group of patients are presented in an effort to ascertain whether this correlation can be confirmed.
