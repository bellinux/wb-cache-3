5000|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> {{have been}} {{replaced}} by silicon diodes in most devices, however there are certain applications where the replacement of <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> with silicon units has proven impractical. These are mostly in electroplating, aluminium smelting and similar high-current low-voltage industrial applications, where the lower forward voltage drop of <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> is more important than their reverse breakdown voltage.|$|R
5000|$|Many purpose-designed transformer-rectifier ("Rectiformer") {{units were}} {{specifically}} designed around {{the characteristics of}} <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> and substituting silicon rectifiers would necessitate replacing the complete assembly. As {{is the case with}} many other industrial processes, it is often considerably cheaper and more convenient to pay someone to manufacture replacement [...] "legacy" [...] <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> than to replace the rectiformer. Hence, <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> are still manufactured in small quantities today.|$|R
50|$|As {{solid-state}} <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> {{became available}} for low-voltage rectification in the 1920s, mercury arc tubes became limited to higher voltage and especially high-power applications.|$|R
50|$|A <b>metal</b> <b>rectifier</b> is {{an early}} type of {{semiconductor}} rectifier in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium. They were used in power applications to convert alternating current to direct current in devices such as radios and battery chargers. Westinghouse Electric (1886) was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers, under the trade name Westector (now used as a trade name for an overcurrent trip device by Westinghouse Nuclear).|$|E
50|$|A {{selenium}} rectifier {{is a type}} of <b>metal</b> <b>rectifier,</b> invented in 1933. They were used in power supplies for electronic equipment, and in high current battery charger applications until they were superseded by silicon diode rectifiers in the late 1960s. The arrival of the alternator in some automobiles was the result of compact, low cost, high current silicon rectifiers. These units were small enough to be inside the alternator case, unlike the selenium units that preceded silicon devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of a}} <b>metal</b> <b>rectifier</b> is related to modern semiconductor rectifiers (Schottky diodes and p-n diodes), but somewhat more complex. Both selenium and copper oxide are semiconductors, in practice doped by impurities during manufacture. When they are deposited on metals, it would be expected that {{the result is a}} simple metal-semiconductor junction and that the rectification would be a result of a Schottky barrier.However, this is not always the case: the scientist S. Poganski discovered in the 1940s that the best selenium rectifiers were in fact semiconductor-semiconductor junctions between selenium and a thin cadmium selenide layer, generated out of the cadmium-tin metal coating during processing.In any case the result {{is that there is a}} depletion region in the semiconductor, with a built-in electric field, and this provides the rectifying action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> {{consist of}} washer-like discs of {{different}} metals, either copper (with an oxide layer {{to provide the}} rectification) or steel plated with selenium, interspersed with aluminium discs (which were often of a larger size, to provide cooling).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> {{were also}} used as {{envelope}} detector (AM demodulator) diodes in radio receivers. The WX6 Westector was a typical example. It was about {{the size and shape}} of an AAA battery, with threaded posts at each end to which connections were made.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to later}} silicon or {{germanium}} devices, copper-oxide rectifiers {{tended to have}} poor efficiency, and the reverse voltage rating was rarely {{more than a few}} volts. A number of rectifier discs would need to be used in series to provide an adequate reverse breakdown voltage figure - a bridge rectifier for a 12V battery charger would often use 12 <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Selenium rectifiers were generally more efficient than metal-oxide types, and could handle higher voltages. However, considerably more skill was required for their construction.|$|R
50|$|Both {{glass and}} <b>metal</b> {{envelope}} <b>rectifiers</b> may have control grids inserted between the anode and cathode.|$|R
50|$|The Schottky diode (named after German {{physicist}} Walter H. Schottky), {{also known}} as hot carrier diode, is a semiconductor diode formed by the junction of a semiconductor with a metal. It has a {{low forward voltage drop}} and a very fast switching action. The cat's-whisker detectors used {{in the early days of}} wireless and <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers</b> used in early power applications can be considered primitive Schottky diodes.|$|R
25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for battery chargers and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} derived of distributing the stage {{capacitances}} of a single-phase cascade generator which minimises the output ripple caused by load current. The {{design of a}} generator must also {{take account of the}} voltage-regulation characteristic, and a procedure is outlined for optimising the generator performance. The characteristics of symmetrical cascade generators are analysed, and a new fullwave circuit of improved regulation characteristics is described. The presence of stray capacitance between the feed and load columns of the generator causes output ripple and loss of output voltage; the amplitude of ripple due to this cause is calculated. At low load currents the limitation upon performance is imposed by the characteristics of the rectifying components. This has been examined for the case of <b>metal</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> It is shown that the minimum output ripple obtainable is determined by the reverse conductivity of the rectifiers; the voltage regulation depends, upon the ratio of forward to reverse conductivity...|$|R
