5|$|Congregation Beth Israel in Meridian, Mississippi, is a Reform Jewish {{congregation}} {{founded in}} 1868 {{and a member}} of the Union for Reform Judaism. The congregation's first permanent house of worship was a Middle Eastern-style building constructed in 1879. The congregation <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> building built in the Greek Revival style in 1906, and in 1964 moved to a more modern building, out of which they still operate.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, three kakapo {{were moved}} from Resolution Island {{to the nature}} reserve of Little Barrier Island {{north-east}} of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three kakapo were <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, {{despite the presence of}} feral cats for part of the intervening period.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, {{daughter}} Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It was cold and lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> suburb, Pearce.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1951, the Medical Survey Office {{was formed}} {{on the station}} as a unit of RAF Home Command. The office was {{responsible}} for all medical records, which were transferred from the RAF Records Office. It was <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> building in November but was relocated to RAF Innsworth on 16 May 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} vehicle requirements at Arriva's Warnham (Horsham) garage, {{which took}} over three of Tillingbourne's former routes, led to criticism from {{residents in the}} area and the suggestion that the site should be closed and operations <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> location. The depot, buses and operation were sold by Arriva to Metrobus in September 2009, who moved all operations to their garage in Crawley and closed the site.|$|E

5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open field of battle, with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover {{the location of a}} cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to be burned.|$|E
5|$|During this {{stint in}} Florida, LeDuc made a scripted turn from face to heel. Garvin claimed that LeDuc was aligned with heel manager Sonny King, but LeDuc denied the claim. Garvin then showed video footage {{to prove that}} LeDuc had secret {{dealings}} with King. LeDuc responded by attacking Garvin {{in front of the}} crowd, solidifying a heel turn for LeDuc. In a storyline several months later, LeDuc and King Curtis Iaukea attacked Buddy Rogers, a veteran then working as a face. The injuries Rogers received were said to be so severe that he was forced to retire, although, in reality, Rogers had simply <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> wrestling promotion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1908, after three years with Rangers, Speirs <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> Glasgow-based club, Clyde, which later played in the First Division. Clyde's Shawfield Park ground was three miles from Speirs' home in Govanhill, in the Rutherglen area of the city, where Speirs' {{grandparents}} and father lived. Clyde had finished 17th in 1907–08, one point ahead of bottom side Port Glasgow. Speirs played only 14leaguegames for Clyde but helped them to their highest league position of third, three points behind winners Celtic. Clyde lost to Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-final, following a replay. It was Speirs' only season with Clyde, during which he scored a total of 10goals from 20appearances.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, {{destined for}} All Nippon Airways. The {{aircraft}} was the 91st 767-300ER {{ordered by the}} Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> area in the Everett factory which occupied {{about half of the}} previous floor space. The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent.|$|E
5|$|The National Historic Landmarks in Indiana {{represent}} Indiana's {{history from}} the Native American era to its early European settlers and motor racing. There are 42 National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) in the state, which are located in 23 of its 92 counties. They illustrate the state's industrial and architectural heritage, as well as battles, circuses, education, and several other topics. One of the NHLs in the state has military significance, fourteen are significant examples of different architectural styles, nine are associated with significant historical figures, and one is an archaeological site. Two NHL properties, both ships that were formerly located in Indiana, were later <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> state.|$|E
5|$|The {{funds from}} the robbery were {{originally}} kept {{at the house of}} Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. The mattress was <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked there. Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory. The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof.|$|E

5|$|Though Ziegfeld {{anticipated}} {{opening his}} new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat, the epic {{nature of the}} work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out-of-town tryouts. Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about the serious tone of the musical (he strongly disliked the songs Ol' Man River and Mis'ry's Comin' Around), Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita, a musical by Kern's collaborator Guy Bolton. When Rio Rita proved to be a success, Show Boats Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> theatre.|$|E
5|$|Yerevan Square, {{where the}} robbery took place, was renamed Lenin Square by the Soviet {{authorities}} in 1921, {{and a large}} statue of Lenin was erected in his honor in 1956. Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery, Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honor in Pushkin Gardens, near Yerevan Square. Created by the sculptor Iakob Nikoladze, it was removed during Stalin's rule, and Kamo's remains were <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> location. The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991—one of the final moments of the Soviet Union—and replaced by the Liberty Monument in 2006. The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland {{by the middle of}} 1958. By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US131 was <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Cathedral's {{original}} {{copy of the}} 1215 charter has been held by the county since 1215; it was displayed in the Common Chamber in the cathedral before being <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> building in 1846. Between 1939 and 1940 the copy was displayed in the British Pavilion at the 1939 World Fair in New York City, and at the Library of Congress. When the Second World War broke out, Winston Churchill wanted to gift the charter to the American people, hoping that this would encourage the United States, then neutral, to enter {{the war against the}} Axis powers, but the cathedral was unwilling and the plans were dropped. After December 1941, the copy was stored in Fort Knox, Kentucky for safety, before being put on display again in 1944 and returned to Lincoln Cathedral in early 1946.|$|E
5|$|Police {{seized a}} rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three pistols {{from the men}} {{at the time of the}} arrest. They were {{detained}} in Bells, Tennessee for a few days before being <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> facility. During interrogation, the men told authorities of their plan to kill Obama. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives handled the initial federal investigation of the case. The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have found no evidence that anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E

30|$|If a {{legitimate}} client and the AP communicate on a static channel, jammers can easily identify the channel and can jam that channel indefinitely. Hopping methods usually require legitimate users <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> channel {{in order to}} avoid the jammer. There are two approaches to avoid jamming: proactive and reactive. Our proposed scheme follows the reactive approach, and in our scheme, each user node and the AP <b>move</b> <b>to</b> <b>another</b> channel only after finding that the current channel is jammed.|$|R
