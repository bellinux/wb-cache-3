25|$|Despite not forcing {{anything}} {{into the}} mouth, mouth corsets are usually {{very effective in}} gagging the victim. This {{is due to the}} fact that the chin piece prevents the wearer from opening their mouth and dislodging the gag, and the lacing at the back of the corset holds the gag tightly against the mouth, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer's cheeks.|$|E
25|$|The purges {{affected}} {{the leadership of}} the VVS. In June 1941, 91 per cent of major formation leaders had been in place for just six months. With the exception of Major General Aleksandr Novikov, commanding the Leningrad District, most would fail in their posts and pay for that failure with their lives. A critical operational omission of the VVS was the failure to disperse its aircraft. Soviet aircraft was left closely ‘bunched’ into groups, and lined up on airfields, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> easy target for the Germans.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{airborne}} FACs was a timely one. The other four TACPs of the 620th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron had joined its original two parties in ground forward air control as the U.S. military scrambled to form TACPs. Their utility was limited because the FAC had {{to remain with}} his MRC108 radio jeep while ordering air strikes, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> visible target for enemy shellfire. The radios were fragile, and they were easily damaged by jolting and vibration. By 11 July 1950, {{only three of the}} radio jeeps were still working.|$|E

Curtis called Davis' 3rd Division to Ruddick's field during the night. When Davis arrived he was put in line {{to the left of}} Carr. Sigel marched the 1st and 2nd Divisions in circles all night but finally had them camp near Pratt's Store. Asboth, who was wounded in the last action of the day, {{believed}} that the United States Army's position was hopeless and pressed Curtis several times during the night to retreat. Though his army was now cut off from Missouri, Curtis refused to consider retreat and confidently predicted victory in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu's {{ambition}} to unite these sociological traditions, {{which had been}} widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between {{those who argue that}} the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider dispositions, he is <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Although Boas was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{specific}} {{contribution to}} the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.|$|E

25|$|Highway536 {{followed}} {{what is now}} Sudbury Municipal Road24, travelling {{north from}} Highway17 (now Sudbury Municipal Road 55) near Lively to the mines in Creighton. The former highway has been supplanted by the Northwest Bypass, which is designated as Highway144. Highway536 travelled north from Highway17, passing through the community of Lively, where it was known as Main Street. As it left Lively, it began <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> gradual curve towards the northeast, passing through Dog Patch and skirting {{the southern edge of}} the Creighton Mine. It eventually curved east briefly before making a quick 90degree curve north into the mining town of Creighton. This curve was located at the modern interection with Wellington Street, and was replaced with an intersection upon the completion of the Northwest Bypass (Highway144) in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games, and Hodges writing for a Western {{audience}} encourages players to do so.) Players can also {{agree to a}} draw at any time, or if the game reaches a position such that the winning condition is impossible to fulfill for either player (called 持将棋 jishōgi, as in standard shogi). (In practice, positions that cannot be won without the other side <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> obvious blunder are also considered as jishōgi, such as a king with only his lion blocked from getting near the enemy king by two side movers on adjacent ranks.) Under the historical rules, this means that no legal series of moves can lead to all of one player's royal pieces being captured; under the Japanese Chu Shogi Association's rules, this additionally means that no legal series of moves can lead to one player being left with only a king, or with no royal pieces. In professional play, drawn games are replayed with opposite colours.|$|E
