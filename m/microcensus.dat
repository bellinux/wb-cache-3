The empirical investigation draws on data from the scientific-use-files of the micro-censuses from the years 1976 to 2004. While part-time and marginal employment rates of mothers have increased in recent years, their full-time employment rates have decreased. Particularly, the least educated mothers show dramatic reductions in their working hours over time. Full-time employment is most common among highly educated mothers and the “dual breadwinner model” is most common among highly educated couples.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{question}} as to the determinants of the search for self-employment instead of a job in dependent employment is analysed. Among other things it is tested whether in the group of jobseekers, the unemployed are more likely than the economically active or other non-active people to seek work on a self-employed basis and in what way the determinants of the search for a self-employed activity instead of an employed one have developed {{in the first half of}} the 1990 s. The study is based on the individual data of the <b>microcensuses</b> of 1991, 1993 and 1995 and thus permits representative empirical statements concerning the extent and the socio-economic structure of the potential of people willing to become self-employed. The study shows that the number of people seeking a self-employed activity first fell and then rose again in the period under observation. In 1995 more than 5. 3 million people in Germany were seeking a new job, 177, 000 or 3 % of whom were seeking a self-employed activity. The unemployed make up an increasing share of the number of jobseekers wishing to become self-employed. One result of the econometric analysis is that the socio-economic structure of the people seeking a self-employed activity is in some cases closer to the structure of the self-employed than to that of those in dependent employment. Thus for example more men than women and more master craftsmen than journeymen were seeking a self-employed activity. Furthermore it is not possible to reject the hypothesis that in 1995 there were no longer any differences between the economically active and the unemployed of the same age, gender and vocational training as regards the desire to become self-employed. In contrast, two and four years previously the tendency towards becoming self-employed was clearly lower in the group of unemployed than in the group of the economically active.

40|$|By {{arranging}} the <b>Microcensus</b> (the German Labour Force Survey) {{as a set}} of panel data it is possible to carry out longitudinal analyses. As participation in the survey is obligatory by law, the cases of non-response are minimal. For that reason the number of cases available is comparably high, so that analyses are even possible for small groups. This applies, for instance, to such a sub-population as the hidden labour force - an unused potential of the labour market that can contribute to securing the labour supply. The aim of this feasibility study is to assess whether the <b>Microcensus</b> Panel 2001 - 2004 can be used for the analysis of the hidden labour force. Due to the kind of data the study sets up the priority in the estimation of the discouraged workers, which might be understood as a subgroup of the hidden labour force. Discouragement has been defined according to the characteristics 'desire for work', 'looking for a job', and availability. The results show {{that it is possible to}} identify the discouraged workers in the <b>Microcensus</b> 2001 - 2004. However the analysis is limited by spatial mobility because the <b>Microcensus</b> has been designed as an area sample and is characterised by the fact that households which move elsewhere are no longer interviewed. As a result, only persons who do not move are covered by the <b>Microcensus.</b> As mobility is probably related to the labour market status this feature of the sampling might cause biased panel estimation. Unfortunately the panel weights are only of limited use as well. In addition, because of the high requirements of anonymisation, only the transition between 2002 and 2003 can be analysed.

40|$|The German <b>microcensus</b> is a {{rotating}} panel in which respondents are interviewed once {{per year for}} four years in a row. Recently, the <b>microcensus</b> panel 1996 - 1999 has been made available for scientific usage. This paper discusses {{the potential of the}} <b>microcensus</b> panel for inves-tigations in the field of fertility research. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we demonstrate how the data can be transformed into spell format so that event history models can be applied. Respondents become “under observation” when they are interviewed for the first time in 1996. The “risk set” are female respondents aged 16 - 38 who are childless at first interview. They contribute exposure time to our investigation until the last interview is conducted or have a first child. Based on this data set up, we have estimated a first birth model. Estimates are very much in line with previous findings on fertility behavior in Germany. But even though that our first investigations provide reasonable results, there are several shortcomings of the data, which we also discussed: First, fertility histories are not surveyed in the <b>microcensus.</b> As others have done before, we have reconstructed fertility careers of female respondents based on the ages and numbers of the children who live in the same family unit. This procedure gives fairly good results for female respondents who are below age 39 at time of interview. Older respondents, and therefore fertility at higher ages, cannot be investigated with this data. A second drawback is that there are no monthly employment histories available. However, information on the employment status at time of interview can be used. We assumed here that the employment status that we measure at time of interview is fixed for the period of twelve months after interview. This is a very strong assumption for some indicators, such as unemployment. However, for other employment indicators (such as whether the person is working in a public or private enterprise, whether the working contract is term-limited or not) this assumption should not be problematic. A third downturn of the data is panel-attrition. The <b>microcensus</b> is a household-survey. When respondents leave the household, they are not surveyed any longer. This involves that panel-attrition is related to residential mobility. In a ‘sensitivity analysis’ we show that panel attrition does not seem to bias our investigations. The paper concludes with a critical discussion on the scope and limits of the <b>microcensus</b> panel for fertility investigations. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} labour market entrants because {{changes in the}} supply- and demand-side are more immediate with labour market entry cohorts (Gangl 2003 a). Since the <b>Microcensus</b> lacks information on the first job, I approximated tertiary graduates’ labour market entrance with the age group  30 – 34. In order to grasp the magnitude of higher education expansion and increasing graduate competition, the age group is slightly older than the typical graduation age. This is because a considerable proportion of German higher education students graduate well into their thirties (Müller and Wolbers 2003) and students increasingly graduate in later ages across birth cohorts (Hillmert and Jacob 2004). 1 Due to gender segregation in the German labour market, all analyses are conducted separately for men and women.

40|$|Data are {{available}} {{for the first time}} for the year under report 2008 on the biological number of children of women from the comprehensive <b>Microcensus</b> sample. Previously, only the ongoing birth statistics provided information on cohort fertility as a total fertility rate of the synthetic female cohorts. Since both benchmarks bear different types of insecurity, a comparison is to provide important information on the quality of these indicators. This article shows that the average number of children per woman in the dataset of the <b>Microcensus</b> 2008 and the cohort fertility rate in the birth statistics show a highly similar course of cohort fertility. Whilst the agreement for the female cohorts in the new Länder (former GDR without Berlin East) and in Germany as a whole is almost complete, the values in the old Länder (Western Germany without Berlin West) are further apart. A major cause of this evidently lies in the high proportion of female immigrants in the old Länder. Some of the women who immigrated into the former territory of Federal Republic already gave birth to their children before entering Germany. These births could not be taken into account in the ongoing birth statistics, whilst the <b>Microcensus</b> provided information on all children born, regardless of where they were born. These survey-related deviations can be largely reduced if the comparison with the cohort fertility rate of the birth statistics is based not on the average number of children of all women, but only on the number of children of women who were born in Germany or who immigrated below the age of 26. The share of female migrants was low in the new Länder and did not impact cohort fertility. All in all, the comparison showed that both sets of statistics provide data with a good degree of concurrence on the fertility of the birth years from 1933 to 1992 for Germany as a whole, {{as well as for the}} old and the new Länder.

30|$|The {{accuracy}} {{of the level of}} account flows obtained from the <b>Microcensus</b> is questionable, since working-time account flows are only captured if they are the main reason for varying working hours, and hence the flows are likely to be biased downwards.

The trend is then combined with the cycles to obtain gross in- and outflows and the net flow on working-time accounts per period is obtained from the difference between the latter; see Weigand et al.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} {{revision of the}} employment figures in the national accounts - which occurred basically {{as a result of}} a better recording of marginal part-time employment - had an effect on the estimation of the hidden labour force. For this the IAB concept of the hidden labour force, which is based on a dependence on the business cycle, was examined both analytically and empirically. The mathematical-statistical analysis proves that it is not possible to assume a priori that the hidden labour force was incorrectly estimated as a result of the under-recording of marginal part-time employment. It is more a matter of an empirical issue which must clarify whether the bias of marginal part-time employment in the <b>microcensus</b> follows a certain pattern. Only if this bias is dependent on the business cycle in a certain way would the estimation of the hidden labour force be affected by it. In the empirical part of the paper the figures of the <b>microcensus,</b> which forms the data basis for the estimation of the hidden labour force, were compared with equivalent figures from the socio- economic panel on marginal part-time employment. By means of regression analysis a test was carried out for the entire group of people in marginal part-time employment to ascertain what pattern the under-recording in the <b>microcensus</b> follows. According to the empirical results the bias tends to point more to an over-estimation of the hidden labour force. In view of a weak data basis, however, the result is still subject to some reservations. In particular it is still necessary to obtain a confirmation based on similar disaggregated data, by age, gender etc. as that on which the IAB estimate of the hidden labour force is based.
