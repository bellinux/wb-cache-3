40|$|The {{feasibility}} of an adjustable mould tool for solid antenna reflector dishes for space application {{is part of}} the Advanced Systems and Technology Program (ASTP), Phase 3. For ground station antennas an adjustable mould called 'Bed of Nails' concept, has already been successfully applied. Objective of the reporter study was to investigate a concept to produce solid reflectors with different shapes for space application with very good surface accuracy. The adjustable mould should be used for curing composite materials by autoclave treatment under heat and pressure. The results of the concept selection investigation was the bed of nails concept together with a thermoplast <b>mould</b> <b>skin.</b> Backed by creep behaviour tests of the thermoplast and trials on the model mould, the appropriate parameters were found to form the thermoplast <b>mould</b> <b>skin</b> over the contour-giving nailheads. Once formed at a temperature of around 200 C, the <b>mould</b> <b>skin</b> remains stable during the reflector curing process. The design of the real adjustable mould (see figure below) was updated according to the results of the trials and the mechanical and thermal analyses of the mould. Summing up the results of the trials with the model mould was found that requirement for the contour accuracy can be fully met. The RMS-values of the formed thermoplast <b>mould</b> <b>skin</b> were between 20 and 40 #mu#m and for the elegant breadboard reflector panel less than 44 #mu#m.

50|$|The {{trapezoidal}} wings {{were built}} up with heavy gauge <b>moulded</b> plywood <b>skins,</b> supported by wooden ribs, using NACA 633-618 {{at the root}} changing smoothly to NACA 4415 at the tip. Large metal plate air brakes are fitted well aft of the main spar at approximately ¾ chord, in already turbulent air flow, to reduce drag. Roll control is provided by ailerons in the trailing edges of the outer wings (the SZD-24-2 Foka 2 was fitted with reduced area ailerons to reduce drag, but rollcontrol was dramatically reduced).|$|R
40|$|Two {{grades of}} 30 weight% short fiber {{reinforced}} polypropylene were processed by conventional injection <b>moulding</b> (<b>skin</b> core fiber orientation) and push pull technology (high and uniform fiber orientation in flow direction) to plates. Samples {{were taken out}} to determine fiber orientation, mean fiber length, static mechanical properties as well as creep-compliance curves parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction. The creep compliances parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction were modeled using the elementary volume concept (EVC) which assumes that a single elementary volume consisting of a matrix part and a composite part {{can be used to}} reproduce the mechanical performance of a short fiber composite. The EVC predicts that the time dependent creep of a short fiber composite depends only on the creep of the pure polymer matrix, fiber volume content, aspect ratio and stiffness of both matrix and fiber. The creep compliance parallel to the flow direction is significantly smaller than perpendicular to it. The measured creep behavior is well reproduced by calculated creep compliances derived by the EVC for the first 2 decades but for longer times experimental data are overestimated. Obviously the presence of fibers generates boundary conditions which change the creep kinetics of the matrix part. The calculated creep curves perpendicular to the flow direction are systematically smaller than the measured curves. However, this can be overcome by the introduction of an adhesion factor which reduces the reinforcement efficiency of the composite part, thus accounting for different fiber matrix adhesions. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

50|$|For smaller areas {{which do}} not require the bolus to be <b>moulded</b> over the <b>skin,</b> Perspex can be used. The use of Perspex bolus is {{advantageous}} for electron set-ups because it is transparent. Since the f.s.d, for most electron fields is 95 cm, so that {{the movements of the}} couch are not isocentric, inaccuracies may arise for aligning angled fields when opaque bolus is inserted.|$|R
5000|$|The most revolutionary boat of {{this period}} was the {{lightweight}} New Zealand Result which was cold <b>moulded</b> with 2 <b>skins</b> of Kahikatea glued together and nailed to lightweight Mangeao bent steamed frames every 21 1/2 inches. At 6 ft 3inches Result was narrower than the conventional boats but still had the same full bow sections typical of the displacement style boats. Result had spaceframes of wood to support the mast and centreboard. In any breeze over 10 knots it was faster than any previous 18s because of its planing ability.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a process for}} utilising the waste that remains {{when all of the}} economically reclaimable materials have been recovered from automobiles that have reached the end of their lives. This waste material, known as automotive shredder residue (ASR), is currently disposed of in landfill sites but forthcoming environmental legislation in the European Union and elsewhere will drastically restrict the amount that can be disposed of in this way. By 2015, 80 % of the ASR currently going to landfill must be recycled. The dual injection moulding process is used to <b>mould</b> a <b>skin</b> of virgin polymer over a compound containing the ASR which forms the core of a new component. Polypropylene (PP) was used as the skin material and also as the material to compound with the ASR. A 50 %/ 50 % mix by volume of PP and ASR granules was found to produce good results as the core material. Experiments were performed to vary the skin to core ratio in order to establish the effect of varying the proportion of ASR on the mechanical proper-ties of mouldings. It was found that mouldings produced containing 25 % by volume of ASR were visually excellent due to the pure PP skin. Inclusion of higher proportions of ASR by decreasing the skin:core thickness ratio was found to produce "breakthrough" of the ASR particles into the skin and test results were highly inconsistent. Using smaller proportions of ASR can be predicted to produce better mechanical properties but would have been contrary to the aim of developing a process capable of disposing of large quantities of ASR. It is concluded that recycling of ASR by using it as a core material in the dual injection moulding process is a feasible option for mouldings requiring good visual appearance but is not suited to components requiring significant strength.
