50|$|The first {{synthesis}} of thiosulfinates {{was reported in}} 1947 by Cavallito and coworkers by oxidation of the corresponding disulfides. One example of a moderately stable thiosulfinate is the tert-butyl derivative, (CH3)3CS(O)SC(CH3)3. This thiosulfinate can be obtained in optical purity by catalytic asymmetric oxidation of di-tert-butyl disulfide with hydrogen peroxide. Upon heating, (CH3)3CS(O)SC(CH3)3 decomposes into tert-butanethiosulfoxylic acid (CH3)3CSSOH) as shown by trapping studies. In a similar manner racemic methyl methanethiosulfinate (CH3S(O)SCH3) {{can be obtained by}} peracetic acid oxidation of dimethyl disulfide. Methyl methanethiosulfinate decomposes thermally giving methanesulfenic acid (CH3SOH), the simplest sulfenic acid, as well as thioformaldehyde (CH2=S). Methyl methanethiosulfinate can also disproportionate to a 1:1 mixture of dimethyl disulfide and <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> (CH3SO2SCH3) and rearrange via a Pummerer rearrangement to CH3S(O)CH2SSCH3). An unusual three-membered ring thiosulfinate (a dithiirane 1-oxide) has been prepared through rearrangement of a 1,3-dithietane. A related compound, 3-(9-triptycyl)dithiirane 1-oxide, was prepared by the reaction of (9-triptycyl)diazomethane and S8O. The X-ray structure of the dithiirane 1-oxide reveals a significantly lengthened sulfur-sulfur bond (2.119(3)Å). Thiosulfinates have also been invoked as intermediates in the oxidation of thiols to sulfonic acids.|$|E

The binding of [14 C]N-ethylmaleimide to the Cys 65 mutant was inhibited in the predsence of tetracycline.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) regulates {{a number}} of {{essential}} physiological processes by activating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to produce the second messenger cGMP. The mechanism of NO sensing was previously thought to result exclusively from NO binding to the sGC heme; however, recent studies indicate that heme-bound NO only partially activates sGC and additional NO {{is involved in the}} mechanism of maximal NO activation. Furthermore, thiol oxidation of sGC cysteines results in the loss of enzyme activity. Herein the role of cysteines in NO-stimulated sGC activity investigated. We find that the thiol modifying reagent <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> specifically inhibits NO activation of sGC by blocking a non-heme site, which defines a role for sGC cysteine(s) in mediating NO binding. The nature of the NO/cysteine interaction was probed by examining the effects of redox active reagents on NO-stimulated activity. These results show that NO binding to, and dissociation from, the critical cysteine(s) does not involve a change in the thiol redox state. Evidence is provided for non-heme NO in the physiological activation of sGC in context of a primary cell culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

40|$|Herein {{we report}} the {{mechanism}} of human acid ceramidase (AC; N-acylsphingosine deacylase) cleavage and activation. A highly purified, recombinant human AC precursor underwent self-cleavage into α and β subunits, similar to {{other members of the}} N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily. This reaction proceeded with first order kinetics, characteristic of self-cleavage. AC self-cleavage occurred most rapidly at acidic pH, but also at neutral pH. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies demonstrated that Cys- 143 was an essential nucleophile that was required at the cleavage site. Other amino acids participating in AC cleavage included Arg- 159 and Asp- 162. Mutations at these three amino acids prevented AC cleavage and activity, the latter assessed using BODIPY-conjugated ceramide. We propose the following mechanism for AC self-cleavage and activation. Asp- 162 likely forms a hydrogen bond with Cys- 143, initiating a conformational change that allows Arg- 159 to act as a proton acceptor. This, in turn, facilitates an intermediate thioether bond between Cys- 143 and Ile- 142, the site of AC cleavage. Hydrolysis of this bond is catalyzed by water. Treatment of recombinant AC with the cysteine protease inhibitor, <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate,</b> inhibited both cleavage and enzymatic activity, further indicating that cysteine-mediated self-cleavage is required for ceramide hydrolysis...|$|E

However, transformed receptors that are treated with MMTS and then separated from low Mr components of cytosol by passage through a column of Sephadex G- 50 have very little DNA-binding activity when DTT is added to regenerate sulfhydryl moities. The receptors will bind to DNA if whole liver cytosol or boiled liver cytosol is added in addition to DTT. The effect of boiled cytosol is mimicked by purified rat thioredoxin or bovine RNase A {{in a manner that}} does not reflect the reducing activity of the former or the catalytic activity of the latter. This suggests that the reported ability of each of these heat-stable peptides to stimulate DNA binding by glucocorticoid receptors is not a biologically relevant action. We suggest that stimulation of DNA binding of partially purified receptors by boiled cytosol does not constitute a reconstitution of a complete cytosolic system in which the dissociated receptor must associate with a specific heat-stable accessory protein required for DNA binding, as has been suggested in the "two-step" model of receptor transformation recently proposed by Schmidt et al...|$|E

Since the myocardial cell damage induced by oxidative stress is associated with abnormalities in Ca 2 ' homeostasis and thiol status, we examined the thiol group dependence and the effects of oxidant species on this enzyme. Sarcolemmal membranes isolated from rat heart were exposed to several types of thiol group modifiers. Alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide or <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate,</b> mercaptide formation withp-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid, and thiol-disulfide exchange with 5, 5 '-dithio-bis(2 -nitrobenzoate) depressed sarcolemmal PLD activity; in all cases the depression was prevented by dithiothreitol. At different concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide the PLD depression correlated well (r= 0. 98) with the decrease in total thiol group content of the membrane. The enzyme activity was not affected by xanthine-xanthine oxidase, a superoxide anion-generating system, but was depressed by hydrogen peroxide (H 202) in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was prevented by catalase as well as by dithiothreitol, but not by D-mannitol.

40|$|International audienceA {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} photooxidation of dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) in aqueous acetonitrile has been established by kinetic modeling the UV absorbance vs. time curves under continuous irradiation. The model, built according to the known solution reactivity of oxysulfur radicals [1], consists of 22 steps involving 6 radical and 10 nonradical species. The first steps of the mechanism are the homolytic cleavage of the DMDS S - S bond with formation of methanethiyl radicals (CH 3 S) followed by addition of these radicals to molecular oxygen. There are photoequilibria between thiyl (CH 3 S), sulfinyl (CH 3 S), and sulfonyl (CH 3 SO 2) radicals and the corresponding molecular species (methyl methanethiosulfinate CH 3 S(O) SCH 3 or MMTSI, <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> CH 3 S(O) 2 SCH 3 or MMTS and methanesulfinic acid CH 3 S(O) OH or MSIA) which appear as long lived intermediates. Reactions of sulfonyl radicals with oxygen lead to methanesulfonic acid (CH 3 S(O) 2 OH) or MSA. Cleavage of sulfonyl radicals gives SO 2 and CH 3, the parent compounds of sulfuric (H 2 SO 4) and methanoic (HCOOH) acids. The predictive power of the model was tested at higher initial concentration of DMDS in anhydrous and aqueous acetonitrile. In these conditions, the proposed mechanism gives a semiquantitative description of {{the course of the}} reaction and reproduces the kinetic behavior of the long lived intermediates. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Many {{studies that}} attempt to design species-specific drugs focus on {{differences}} in the three-dimensional structures of homologous enzymes. The structures of homologous enzymes are generally well conserved especially at the active site, but the amino-acid sequences are often very different. We reasoned that if a non-conserved amino acid is fundamental to the function or stability of an enzyme from one particular species,one {{should be able to}} inhibit only the enzyme from that species by using an inhibitor targeted to that residue. We set out to test this hypothesis in a model system. Results: We first identified a non-conserved amino acid (Cys 14) whose integrity is important for catalysis in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from Trypanosoma brucei. The equivalent residues in rabbit and yeast TIM are Met and Leu, respectively. A Cys 14 Leu mutant of trypanosomal TIM had a tendency to aggregate, reduced stability and altered kinetics. To model the effects of a molecule targeted to Cys 14, we used <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> (MMTS) to derivatize Cys 14 to a methyl sulfide. This treatment dramatically inhibited TIMs with a Cys residue at a position equivalent to Cys 14, but not rabbit TIM (20 % inhibition) or yeast TIM (negligible inhibition), which lack this residue. Conclusions: Cys 14 of trypanosomal TIM is a non-conserved amino acid whose alteration leads to loss of enzyme structure and function. TIMs that have a cysteine residue at position 14 could be selectively inhibited by MMTS. This approach may offer an alternative route to species-specific enzyme inhibition...|$|E

Aldolase from S. aureus was not affected by any of these reagents. Carboxypeptidase-A treatment of rabbit-muscle and T. brucei aldolase inhibited the activity of both enzymes towards fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate (Fru(1, 6) P 2), while the activity towards fructose- 1 -phosphate (Fru- 1 -P) was affected only {{in the case of}} the trypanosomal enzyme. Moreover carboxypeptidase-A treatment reduced the turnover numbers of these two aldolases for both Fru(1, 6) P 2 and Fru- 1 -P to a similar level. Glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate, in the absence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate, also inactivated aldolases from rabbit muscle and T. brucei with second order rate constants of 1054 and 254 min- 1 M- 1, respectively. Using 5, 5 '-dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) with rabbit-muscle aldolase, a total of 4 thiol groups could be titrated per subunit, resulting in a total inactivation. The presence of substrate completely protected the enzyme from inactivation. <b>Methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> also reacted with four cysteine residues, but this led to very little inactivation. This indicates that the inactivation by modification with DTNB is due to conformational changes in the enzyme. In T. brucei aldolase only one thiol group could be titrated with methyl methanesulfonate and there was no loss of activity.

The transport activity of the wild-type protein was resistant to three membrane impermeant MTS-reagents (MTSEA, MTSET and MTSES). In contrast, membrane permeant <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> (MMTS) and TCEP inhibited the transport activity of both the wild-type, {{as well as all}} the single mutant proteins.

Recombinant human ENT 1 (hENT 1), and the four cys-teine-serine ENT 1 mutants, were expressed in nucleoside transport-deficient PK 15 cells and probed with a series of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) sulfhydryl-modifying reagents.

Modification of cysteine 281 correlated with decreased operator binding affinity and decreased inducer association and dissociation rate constants. A monomeric mutant lactose repressor protein (T- 41), containing serine at position 282 in place of tyrosine was purified. The inducer equilibrium binding constant for this monomeric mutant repressor was {{comparable to that of}} the tetrameric wild-type repressor at pH 7. 5, while operator binding was not detectable. In contrast to wild-type repressor, equilibrium and kinetic rate constants for inducer binding to the monomer were largely independent of pH; thus, the quaternary structure of the wild-type repressor is required for the pH-associated effects on inducer binding. From the modification pattern with MMTS, cys 281, adjacent {{to the site of the}} T- 41 mutation, appears to be located on the surface of the monomer in a region crucial for subunit interaction. Cysteine modification and variations in pH elicited alterations in the kinetic and equilibrium parameters for inducer binding to the repressor protein. While operator binding affinity of the repressor and its inducer complex were minimally affected by increased pH, inducer binding was decreased for both unliganded protein and the repressor-operator complex. The cooperativity for inducer binding to the repressor increased with pH. The midpoint for the changes in inducer affinity and cooperativity was pH 8. 3; this value correlates well with cysteine ionization. Theoretical patterns for inducer binding under different conditions have been generated using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for allosteric regulation. Using this analysis, high pH favors the T (high operator/low inducer affinity) state, while modification of cysteine 281 with MMTS elicits a shift into the R (high inducer/low operator affinity) state.

Oxidation of these reduced sulfur compounds in polluted atmospheres and hence the decrease of their harmful and malodorous effects is thus a matter of concern in numerous industrial and water treatment plants. Photocatalytic treatment of gaseous flow polluted by these sulfur compounds has been actively investigated for the last few years. The first part of the paper is devoted to a literature review on the different TiO 2 -based photocatalytic processes designed for the oxidation of these gaseous compounds.

It is demonstrated that the oxidation products are totally different from those obtained with TiO 2. With the photosensitizing materials, singlet oxygen addition is shown to be the major pathway, leading to sulfoxide and sulfone starting from DMS and to <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> starting from DMDS.

These latter products may be accounted for by electron transfer from sulfide or disulfide to photogenerated holes, leading to radical mechanisms. Mineralization to CO 2 and H 2 O is also shown to occur with DMS, but is not favoured under these conditions, due to the absence of water and of a too fast gas hourly space velocity (GHSV).

Thermal stability and guanidine hydrochloride unfolding studies of the mutant proteins shows a destabilization of the protein as a result of mutation. The degree of destabilization depends on the chemical nature of the substituent amino acid in the mutant protiens. ^ Kinetics of folding/unfolding reactions of the proteins were monitored by fluorescence changes using stopped flow mixing to obtain guanidine hydrochloride concentration jumps ending below, within, and above the transition zone. The replacement of Pro- 71 alters the rate on one of the fastest phases, τ 3, while the two other phases, τ 1 2 ̆ 6 τ 2, remain the same. ^ Slow refolding kinetic studies indicate that replacement of Pro- 71 does not completely eliminate the absorbance or fluorescence detected slow phases leading to the conclusion that Pro- 71 is not involved in the generation of the slow phases in the folding kinetics of iso- 1 -cytochrome c. ^ The alkaline conformational change involving the disappearance of the 696 nm absorbance band occurs with increasing pH in the alkaline pH region (Davis et al., 1974).

Mutation of Cys 378 abolished the effect of MTSET on NMBPR binding and indicated that Cys 378 is an extracellular-located residue.

Mutation of Cys 416 abolished the effect of charged sulfhydryl reagents to inhibit NBMPR binding in isolated membranes, and also eliminated transport function supporting a conformational linkage between the fifth intracellular loop and the NBMPR binding domain, and implicates this region in the translocation function of hENT 1. To further confirm the importance of this region, extracellular loop 5 (EL 5) was examined by cysteine scanning mutagenesis as residues in EL 5 were individually mutated to cysteines. Mutation of N 379, F 390, E 391, H 392, and D 393 to cysteine abolished uptake of [3 H] 2 -chloroadenosine indicating their role in the transport mechanism of hENT 1. Treatment of EL 5 mutants with MTSET inhibited NBMPR binding in all but the V 389 C mutant. Co-incubation of NBMPR with MTSET was able to protect N 379 C from thiol modification while co-incubation of adenosine with MTSET protected R 384 C, Y 385 C, and L 386 C from MTSET effects. Our results indicate that adenosine may bind in close vicinity or in direct contact to these residues to prevent MTSET to attain access...|$|E
40|$|The lactose {{repressor}} protein from the mutant E. coli BG 185 contains valine at position 81 instead of alanine (Adler et al., 1972; Muller-Hill et al., 1975). The BG 185 protein exhibits properties {{similar to the}} wild-type repressor-inducer complex. Kinetic measurements suggest that the structural transitions required for inducer binding are markedly impaired by the mutation. The fluorescence spectral shift in response to inducer binding was identical for mutant and wild-type proteins. This identity indicates direct effects of inducer binding on the tryptophan(s) near the sugar binding site rather than environmental changes consequent to conformational shifts. Analogy to the bacterial sugar binding proteins suggests that the alanine to valine change at position 81 in BG 185 repressor yields a molecule that is fixed in a closed, sugar-binding conformation. Serine 193 in the lactose {{repressor protein}} was changed to alanine and threonine to assess the putative role of this residue in allowing/blocking binding of β-substituted D-galactosides. The results demonstrate that the side chain of amino acid 193 does not play a direct role in inducer binding. Cysteine 281 was changed to serine and alanine in order to ascertain the contribution of this residue to the pH effects on inducer binding. A decrease in IPTG binding affinity for both mutants indicates a role for this residue in the optimal function of repressor, but does not account entirely for the pH effects on IPTG binding noted for the wild-type repressor modified with <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate.</b> The energetic contributions of the galactosyl hydroxyl groups of inducers to binding with repressor indicate that the C- 3 and C- 6 hydroxyls contributed <- 2. 3 and - 1. 7 ± 0. 3 Kcal/mol of binding free energy, respectively, whereas the C- 4 hydroxyl provided only a nominal contribution (- 0. 1 ± 0. 2 Kcal/mol). A change in Δ H∘ of ∼- 6 Kcal/mol upon replacement of the O-methyl substituent by S-methyl indicates {{a substantial increase in}} van der Waals' interactions and/or hydrogen bonding in this region of the ligand binding site. Arrhenius plots of kinetic rate constants for the binding of IPTG, methyl-β,D-galactoside, and methyl-β,D-thiogalactoside to the repressor revealed a protein structural transition at 12 ∘ C. All of the experimental data are consistent with the hypothetical sugar-binding site for repressor protein proposed by Sams et al., 1984...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{important}} physiological mediator of vasodilation, platelet aggregation, and neurotransmission. An NO signal regulates these processes by signal transduction through the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), and dysfunction in this pathway manifests in human disease. NO activates sGC several hundred fold to produce the second messenger cGMP, and the mechanism of activation was previously thought to result exclusively from NO binding to the sGC heme. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that heme-bound NO only partially activates sGC and additional NO binding to a nonheme site is required for maximal NO activation. Therefore, understanding the nature the nonheme-NO coordination is crucial to understanding the mechanism of enzyme activation. Thiol oxidation of sGC cysteines results in the loss of enzyme activity, therefore, the role of cysteines in NO-stimulated sGC activity was investigated. We found that the thiol modifying reagent <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> specifically inhibits NO activation of sGC by blocking the non-heme site, which defines a role for sGC cysteine(s) in mediating NO binding. The nature of the NO/cysteine interaction was probed by examining the effects of redox active reagents on NO-stimulated activity. These results show that NO binding to, and dissociation from, the critical cysteine(s) does not involve a change in the thiol redox state. Evidence is provided for non-heme NO in the physiological activation of sGC in context of a primary cell culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These findings have relevance to diseases involving the NO/cGMP signaling pathway. Heme-oxidation also results in the loss enzyme activity and {{may play a role in}} the NO-desensitization of sGC in cardiovascular disease. In vitro, the sGC heme is typically found in the ferrous [Fe(II) ] state, which is activated several hundred fold by NO. Comparatively, the ferric [Fe(III) ] form of sGC is only weakly activated by NO, but the mechanism of this blunted response is not well understood. Specifically, sGC undergoes a reaction with NO termed reductive nitrosylation, where the sGC heme is reduced to the ferrous [Fe(II) ] state; but despite the recovery of the initial heme state, NO-stimulated activity does not recover. We found that the reduction of the sGC heme occurs via a coupled oxidation of an sGC cysteine to a nitrosothiol, and that the S-nitrosation of this key cysteine inhibits the enzymatic response to NO. The data from chapter 2 suggests the mechanism of inhibition may be the oxidation of a cysteine that constitutes the nonheme NO binding site. Thus, thiol-oxidation is at the root of the NO-desensitization of heme-oxidized sGC and the implications to human health and disease are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{studies have}} {{provided}} {{evidence that the}} hsp 70 escort protein Hep 1 is essential for maintaining the solubility of the mitochondrial chaperones Ssc 1 and Ssq 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, {{little is known about}} its metal binding thermostability, and substrate specificity. To characterize these properties, I have demonstrated that the four conserved cysteines in the zinc-finger motif of Hep 1 are required for solubility and zinc binding. Mutation of any one of these cysteines to serine abolished soluble expression in Escherichia coli. In addition, elemental analysis of purified Hep 1 revealed near stoichiometric levels of zinc in purified Hep 1. This zinc could be displaced by the sulfhydryl-reactive agent <b>methyl</b> <b>methanethiosulfonate</b> (MMTS) implicating the cysteines in the zinc motif as ligands for zinc. A possible interaction between yeast Hep 1 and human mitochondrial hsp 70 (mthsp 70) was also examined by measuring the influence of Hep 1 on the solubility of mthsp 70 overexpressed in E. coli. Human mthsp 70 was found predominantly in the soluble faction upon coexpression with yeast Hep 1, whereas mthsp 70 was completely insoluble in the absence of Hep 1. This interaction is thought to be mediated by the mthsp 70 ATPase domain since a mthsp 70 truncation mutant having only its N-terminal ATPase domain was insoluble when overexpressed in E. coli. To examine whether Hep 1 influences mthsp 70 thermostability, the effects of temperature on the CD spectra of purified mthsp 70 and Hep 1 were investigated. Hep 1 exhibited a high melting temperature (Tm > 70 °C), whereas mthsp 70 displayed two transitions (Tm 1 48 °C; Tm 2 78 °C), which were not dramatically altered in the presence of Hep 1. Additional studies characterized the solubility and metal content of the small J-type co-chaperone, HscB, which is thought to regulate the ATPase activity of mthsp 70. Unlike yeast HscB orthologs, human HscB contains a domain with a tetracysteine motif. Human HscB was shown to be localized to the mitochondria and was found to be soluble when overexpressed in E. coli. Magnetospirillum magneticum HscB, which contains an N-terminal Cys-rich domain similar to that of human HscB, was shown to coordinate an iron cofactor in an oxygen-sensitive manner. These findings provide evidence that Hep 1 requires bound zinc to maintain its solubility, that the hsp 70 ATPase domain is responsible for the low solubility of mthsp 70, and implicate a role for escort proteins in regulating the functions of metazoan chaperones. Additionally, they implicate a role for the Cys-rich domain of HscB in metal coordination...|$|E
