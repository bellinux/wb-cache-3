Angered WWE fans subsequently called on WWE to fire Layfield. On April 22, Newsweek reported that Ranallo and WWE [...] "mutually agreed to part ways", and Ranallo released a statement in which he said his departure had [...] "nothing to do with JBL". Layfield released a statement of his own, stating: [...] "Admittedly, I took part in locker room pranks that existed within the industry years ago.

60|$|The {{greater part}} of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad, and if I repent of anything, {{it is very likely}} to be <b>my</b> good <b>behavior.</b> What demon possessed me that I behaved so well?

60|$|All at once, it {{occurred}} to me how very absurd was <b>my</b> <b>behavior</b> in thus tormenting myself with crazy hypotheses as {{to what was going on}} within that drawing-room, when it was at my option to be personally present there, My relations with Zenobia, as yet unchanged,--as a familiar friend, and associated in the same life-long enterprise,--gave me the right, and made it no more than kindly courtesy demanded, to call on her. Nothing, except our habitual independence of conventional rules at Blithedale, could have kept me from sooner recognizing this duty. At all events, it should now be performed.|$|E

40|$|I {{combine the}} power of computing, {{technology}} and “big data ” with possibilities to answer funda-mental questions in social science: relating to human <b>behavior.</b> <b>My</b> research interest is in compu-tational social science: an emerging domain {{at the intersection of}} machine learning, social science, and human computer interaction. Over the past couple of decades, the Internet has enabled great things; it has affected our everyday lives in multiple ways. Online presence is increasingly becoming intertwined with our lives—one in six people in the world visit Facebook at least once a month. Egypt and Haiti demonstrated how technologies like Twitter can bring individuals together, empowering them in times of crisis. In essence, such technological advances bear a relationship with how we frame and refine our social norms as well as a variety of fundamental social and cognitive processes that engender our <b>behavior.</b> <b>My</b> interest is to understand such behavior that characterize our online social lives—both at the macroscopic level of populations, and at the microscopic, i. e., the individual level, by developing computational methods and analyzing large-scale data. Through such understanding of <b>behavior,</b> <b>my</b> goal is to make a difference to real world societal problems, such as ones spanning healthcare, and thereby {{improve the quality of life}} of people in general...|$|R
