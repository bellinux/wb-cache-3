As early as September 1940, Wolfram Sievers, director of the S.S. Ahnenerbe Institute, had warned Blome of the need to expand the production of insecticides to deal with this eventuality. [...] This led Blome to experiment with the dispersal of insecticides, fungicides and nerve gas from aircraft, especially after Hitler had ordered a [...] "drastic increase" [...] in the production of Tabun and Sarin at I.G. Farben's Dyhernfurth factory in eastern Germany. On orders from Himmler in 1944, Blome also tested these on inmates at Auschwitz.|$|E

The aim of this study was to investigate the dimensional stability of two irreversible hydrocolloid materials, Alginoplast and Iralgin after disinfection with 5. 2 % sodium hypochlorite, used with immersion and spraying methods. Material and Methods: In this experimental study, impressions were made of a master mandibular arch (Typodont) containing three stainless steel inserts on the occlucal surface of both mandibular first molars and in the lingual surface of the mandibular central incisors, which served as reference marks for making measurements. Two types of irreversible hydrocolloid (Iralgin and Alginoplast) were tested. 5. 2 % sodium hypochlorite was used in two <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>spraying</b> and immersion to disinfect the samples. The control group was not disinfected. Casts were made of type III gypsum. Stone casts were measured with a Nikon profile projector. Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Witney test were used for statistical analysis using p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: Casts prepared from Alginoplast disinfected by spraying method, were 0. 38 % larger in anteroposterior and 0. 06 % smaller in cross arch dimensions, whereas those prepared from Alginoplast immersed in hypochlorite were 0. 47 % larger in anteroposterior and 0. 11 % smaller in cross arch dimensions. Casts made from Iralgin were smaller after both methods of disinfecting, (0. 01 % smaller in anteroposterior and 0. 001 % smaller in cross-arch dimensions after spraying and 0. 04 % smaller in anteroposterior and 0. 03 % smaller in cross-arch dimensions after immersing in sodium hypochlorite).

40|$|Abstract Background Ultra-low volume (ULV) insecticidal {{aerosols}} dispensed from vehicle-mounted cold-foggers {{are widely}} considered {{the method of}} choice for control of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus during outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya and, more recently, Zika. Nevertheless, their effectiveness has been poorly studied, particularly in Europe. Nearly all published studies of ULV efficacy are bio-assays based on the mortality of caged mosquitoes. In our study we preferred to monitor the direct impact of treatments on the wild mosquito populations. This study was undertaken to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} two widely used space spraying methods to control Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Methods We determined the susceptibility of local Ae. albopictus to deltamethrin by two methods: topical application and the “WHO Tube Test”. We used ovitraps baited with hay infusion and adult traps (B-G Sentinel) baited with a patented attractant to monitor the mosquitoes in four residential areas in Nice, southern France. The impact of deltamethrin applied from vehicle-mounted ULV fogging-machines was assessed by comparing trap results in treated vs untreated areas for 5  days before and 5  days after treatment. Four trials were conducted at the maximum permitted application rate (1  g. ha- 1). We also made two small-scale tests {{of the impact of the}} same insecticide dispensed from a hand-held thermal fogger. Results Susceptibility to the insecticide was high but there was no discernable change in the oviposition rate or the catch of adult female mosquitoes, nor was there any change in the parous rate. In contrast, hand-held thermal foggers were highly effective, with more than 90 % reduction of both laid eggs and females. Conclusions We believe that direct monitoring of the wild mosquito populations gives a realistic assessment of the impact of treatments and suggest that the lack of efficacy is due to lack of interaction between the target mosquitoes and the ULV aerosol. We discuss the factors that influence the effectiveness of both <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>spraying</b> in the context of epidemic situations...|$|E

We are not under anv obligations to any firm for favors even to the extent ot apparatus for experimental work, and hence can name different firms with impartiality. It will be best for each one intending to use such apparatus to get circulars from some of the firms named and select the apparatus that meets the requirements of their particular case as to capacity, cost, etc. The firms we name we believe to be entirely responsible and to manufacture apparatus of excellent quality. The Field Force Pump Co., of Lockport, N. Y., The Nixon Nozzle and Machine Co., Dayton, Ohio, The Gould Manufacturing Co., Seneca Falls, N.

40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the operations of}} the Extended Malaria Control Program which utilizes residual DDT spraying of homes as a method of malaria control. The Extended Program, initiated by the Office of Malaria Control in War Areas, is now being administered by its successor, the Communicable Disease Center of the U. S. Public Health Service. DDT insecticide used as a residual spray in houses is a new weapon of attack against an old enemy [...] MALARIA. When solutions or emulsions of DDT are sprayed on walls and ceilings, an almost invisible residual deposit of DDT crystals is left on the surface. Malaria mosquitoes and other insects which come in contact with these crystals are poisoned. They die later if they have received a sufficient exposure. This method of killing insects is especially valuable in malaria control activities because mosquitoes inside houses are the ones which are most likely to bite malaria sufferers and thus become infected. These infected mosquitoes have ample opportunity to rest on treated surfaces in houses sprayed with DDT and be killed before they can spread the disease to uninfected persons. This is the basic principle of malaria control through residual spraying. DDT residual spraying is a new insecticidal technique. Before it could be put to extensive use in malaria control programs, it has been necessary to develop new formulas, make changes in spraying equipment, and devise new <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>spraying.</b> This handbook supplies detailed information about formulas used for concentrates and spray mixtures, latest spraying methods, care and use of equipment, and safe practices in handling DDT in U.

The volume distribution <b>of</b> a <b>spray</b> is the best qualitative and quantitative way to evaluate spray coverage for many applications The experimental acquisition of the volume distribution was acquired by a number <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> and techniques. Three of these techniques were directly carried out and compared in a one-to-one comparison for this study. The methods investigated were Mechanical Patternation (MP), Laser Sheet Imaging (Mie scattering), and Phase Doppler Interferometry (Artium and TSI systems). The baseline measurement for this study was the mechanical patternation of a hydraulic, low capacity, flat spray nozzle. The direct one-to-one comparison of these three measurement techniques allowed for the development of a direct comparison techniques. The volume and area weighted volume distributions resulted in good agreement over spray plume area once proper weighted and collapsing methods were implemented...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the grant {{is to develop a}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>spraying</b> materials on a substrate in a controlled manner to eliminate the waste inherent in present plating processes. The process under consideration is magnetically controlled plasma spraying. The project continues to be on schedule. The field equations have been developed and were reported in the April [...] June 1994 Progress Report. The equations for the external magnetic field were reported in the July [...] September 1994 progress report. The field equations have been cast in a format that allows solution using Finite Element (FE) techniques. The development of the computer code that will allow evaluation of the proposed technique and design of an experiment to prove the proposed process is underway. The basic numerical technique was reported in the October [...] December 1994 progress report, and code development and verification are underway (see Attachment 1) ...|$|R
