Veronica Mars {{has often been}} compared to Whedon's series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with some even calling it the successor to the latter. Whedon had previously praised the first season on the weblog Whedonesque, saying that Veronica Mars was the [...] "Best. Show. Ever." [...] and that [...] " [...] never gotten more {{wrapped up in a}} show [...] wasn't making, and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> than those." [...] Whedon also gave a glowing review of the first season for Entertainment Weekly, writing that [...] "Season 1 works as mystery, comedy, and romantic drama, often simultaneously. But what elevates it is that in a TV-scape creepily obsessed with crime-solving, VM actually asks why." [...] Upon being asked about Whedon's praise, Jason Dohring, who plays Logan, said in an interview: ...|$|E
500|$|Veronica Mars {{was also}} {{positively}} received by other writers. Joss Whedon, {{who made a}} guest appearance in the second-season episode [...] "Rat Saw God", {{said that it was}} the [...] "Best. Show. Ever. Seriously, I've never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn't making, and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> than those [...] These guys know what they're doing on a level that intimidates me. It's the Harry Potter of shows." [...] Kevin Smith, who guest starred in the episode [...] "Driver Ed", said that Veronica Mars was [...] "hands-down, the best show on television right now, and proof that TV can be far better than cinema." [...] Stephen King described the series as [...] "Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is Veronica Mars so good? It bears little resemblance to life as I know it, but I can't take my eyes off the damn thing." [...] Ed Brubaker called it [...] "the best mystery show ever made in America." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Q-Tip {{was upset}} over the album's {{shelving}} {{and felt that}} although Reid {{did not know how}} to market it, his label released OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2003: [...] "hose are the kinds of sounds that are on Kamaal the Abstract. <b>Maybe</b> <b>even</b> a little <b>more</b> out [...] Kamaal was just me, guerrilla". While it did not receive an official release, advanced promotional copies made their way into the public, leaking to the Internet.|$|R

Du-shik earned a diploma equivalency while {{in jail and}} is congratulated by his superior, who feels that <b>maybe</b> he needs <b>even</b> <b>more</b> education to run the territory. He asks Du-shik to start writing in English, and then tells him {{that he needs to}} go to college.|$|R
500|$|In the Fall 1996 {{issue of}} Raritan Quarterly Review, Stephen D. Cox, freely admitting to never having read the book, {{nonetheless}} called Terhune a [...] "hack writer" [...] who lacked [...] "storytelling skill" [...] and denounced Lad: A Dog as non-literature with [...] "sentences [...] are insufferably stilted and hammy" [...] and [...] "have {{a tendency to}} wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions." [...] Terming it a [...] "socially interesting" [...] work, he concedes that the novel has maintained [...] "intense and long-lasting" [...] interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and [...] "desire to have a collie dog." [...] He quotes Irving Litvag, author of Terhune's biography The Master of Sunnybank, stating that Lad [...] "became the dog we always wanted to have and never did. <b>Maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> than that—maybe he became the friend we always waited to find, or even the brother, or the father." [...] In You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film, Timothy Morris felt the novel had [...] "dated badly" [...] due to changes in American society, and while he stated that he enjoyed the work, in comparing it to Anna Sewell's Black Beauty he faults Lad: A Dog for lacking an [...] "autobiographical frame" [...] and for leaving readers guessing {{as to what is}} happening.|$|E
500|$|The Open Door {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on twelve reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". IGN music reviewer Ed Thompson felt that [...] "The Open Door is {{everything that you}} could ever want in a follow-up album—and more" [...] and added that despite Moody's exit from the band, the remaining members [...] "have not missed a beat." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "When the pain takes over her corseted soul, [...] she just overdubs her big bodice-ripping voice into a choir." [...] Additionally, {{he added that the}} [...] "best songs are the creepiest", and concluded; [...] "Obviously, Lee has got a touch of the magnetic and destructive herself. But that's what makes the breakup songs on The Open Door feel mighty real." [...] Jon Dolan of Entertainment Weekly explained the record is [...] "more personal and, by accessing a deeper emotional palette, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> universal". Blender gave a positive review, confessing, [...] "Denser and more scuzzed-up than Fallen, the album amps everything up to gloriously epic, over-the-top proportions". Billboard said, [...] "Those who embraced Fallen will doubtlessly fall even harder into The Open Door." [...] Spins Mellisa Maerz rated the album with four stars out of five and commented, [...] "A post-dysfunctional kiss-off that builds from ethereal Sunday-mass uplift into full-eff-you guitar dirges, revealing an angrier, more self-assured Lee who waxes sardonic [...] but still misses the comfort in being sad".|$|E

30|$|Takatsukasa’s arrival was the {{opportunity}} for the school to expand its curriculum, offering courses to women similar to Takatsukasa, who had {{decided to take the}} tonsure later in their teens and twenties, after having attended high school or college. Six women joined Takatsukasa in the expanded curriculum that first year. This increase signified a larger change in demographics of women becoming Pure Land nuns, as Takatsukasa’s life story demonstrates – from younger, junior high and high school aged women to women in their late teens and twenties who had already completed high school and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> college. <b>More</b> work {{needs to be done to}} unearth more concrete, less anecdotal evidence of this demographic change, however.|$|R
5000|$|We {{can find}} the name of jagaddal as a village as long as 460 years ago in written records but the place {{is thought to be}} more 100 to 150 years older or <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> much <b>more</b> than that. Bipradas Pipalai (1545 AD) in his work [...] "Manasha Mangal" [...] tells us through his protagonist {{character}} [...] "Chand Sadagar" [...] about Jagatdal."Chand Saudagar mentions in his [...] "Kabi Kankan Chandi", Jagaddal as one of the places passed by him in his voyage down the Bhagirathi (the Hooghly) and where he saw many palatial buildings built by Brahmins and Kayasthas.

5000|$|The {{first goal}} {{of our new}} German {{creation}} of art ... has surely been achieved. Analogous to the recovering of architectural art which began here in Munich, here also started the purification {{in the sphere of}} painting and sculpture, that <b>maybe</b> had been <b>even</b> <b>more</b> devastated. The whole swindle of a decadent or pathological trend-art has been swept away. A decent common level has been reached. And this means a lot. Only out of this can the truly creative genius arise." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{analysis}} of science fiction historians Alexei and Cory Panshin, the story typified an attitude of de Camp remarkable for the genre of the time: [...] "In the proto-ecological universe projected by de Camp, to be human ... was a natural state of being which we might share {{with a wide variety}} of creatures. ... e Camp was capable of imagining what previously would have been thought of as lesser beings– a tribe of mutated baboons in 'The Blue Giraffe' (Astounding, Aug 1939) ... as being as decent, rational and civilized as most men manage to be, and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{house was}} {{big enough for a}} hotel; it was a hundred feet long and fifty wide, and ten feet high, from ground to eaves; but from the eaves to the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet, or <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>more.</b> This roof was of ancient mud-colored straw thatch a foot thick, and was covered all over, except in a few trifling spots, with a {{thriving}} and luxurious growth of green vegetation, mainly moss. The mossless spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion of bright new masses of yellow straw. The eaves projected far down, like sheltering, hospitable wings. Across the gable that fronted the road, and about ten feet above the ground, ran a narrow porch, with a wooden railing; a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon the porch. Above were two or three other little windows, one clear up under the sharp apex of the roof. Before the ground-floor door was a huge pile of manure. The door of the second-story room {{on the side of the}} house was open, and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow. Was this probably the drawing-room? All of the front half of the house from the ground up seemed to be occupied by the people, the cows, and the chickens, and all the rear half by draught-animals and hay. But the chief feature, all around this house, was the big heaps of manure.|$|E

2500|$|The separatists {{deny that}} the war is over, and guerrilla warfare {{continues}} throughout the North Caucasus. Colonel Sulim Yamadayev, Chechnya's second most powerful loyalist warlord after Kadyrov, also denied {{that the war is}} over. In March 2007, Yamadayev claimed there were well over 1,000 separatists and foreign Islamic militants entrenched in the mountains of Chechnya alone: [...] "The war is not over, the war is far from being over. What we are facing now is basically a classic partisan war and my prognosis is that it will last two, three, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> five <b>more</b> years." [...] According to the CIA factbook, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement, although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus. The overall security situation in Chechnya remains exceedingly difficult to accurately report due to the near monopoly the Russian government has on media covering the issue. In May 2007, Amnesty International refuted claims by the government that the conflict has ended, stating [...] "while large-scale military operations have been reduced, the conflict continues." [...] The strength of the separatists has for many years been unknown. Although Russia has killed a lot of separatists throughout the war, many young fighters have joined the separatists.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an e-mail}} dated December 29 sent to HSG {{attorney}} Glenn West, MLB attorney Tom Ostertag instructed HSG that [...] "negotiation toward a definitive purchase agreement {{is to be}} with the winning bidder only", and no other party is to be involved during the exclusive negotiation process. HSG attorney West then emailed the creditors of HSG on New Year's Eve saying [...] "Basically, the response from the MLB was to prohibit us from negotiating with anyone other than Greenberg. Their intent seems to be to lock us into Greenberg even though Crane now has a clearly superior economic deal – and may always have had based on Greenberg's current position. We need help here. Unless the lenders weigh in, {{we are going to be}} stuck negotiating a deal that is clearly worse than Crane's." [...] West also told the creditors that Crane's offer was at least $13 million <b>more</b> and <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> $20 million <b>more</b> than Greenberg's.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{four days}} later, Fox News Channel {{correspondent}} Geraldo Rivera similarly broadcast details from Iraq {{of the position}} and plans of U.S. troops. [...] "Let me draw a few lines here for you," [...] he said, making on-camera marks in the sand. [...] "First, I want to make some emphasis here that these hash marks here, this is us. We own that territory. It's 40%, <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> a little <b>more</b> than that." [...] At another point, complained a CENTCOM spokesman, Rivera [...] "actually revealed the time of an attack prior to its occurrence." [...] Although Rivera—like Philip Smucker—was not officially embedded, he was swiftly escorted back to Kuwait. A week later, Rivera apologized. [...] "I'm sorry that it happened," [...] he said on Fox News Channel, [...] "and I assure you that it was inadvertent. Nobody was hurt by what I said. No mission was compromised." [...] However, a network review, he admitted, [...] "showed that I did indeed break one of the rules related to embedment." ...|$|R
