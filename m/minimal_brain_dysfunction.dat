30|$|Sepsis {{often is}} {{characterized}} by an acute <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes, which may induce significant alterations in vulnerable areas of the brain. Important mechanisms include excessive microglial activation, impaired cerebral perfusion, blood–brain-barrier dysfunction, and altered neurotransmission. Systemic insults, such as prolonged inflammation, severe hypoxemia, and persistent hyperglycemia also may contribute to aggravate sepsis-induced <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> or injury. The diagnosis of <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in sepsis relies essentially on neurological examination and neurological tests, such as EEG and neuroimaging. A brain MRI {{should be considered in}} case of persistent <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> after control of sepsis and exclusion of major confounding factors. Recent MRI studies suggest that septic shock can be associated with acute cerebrovascular lesions and white matter abnormalities. Currently, the management of <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> mainly consists of control of sepsis and prevention of all aggravating factors, including metabolic disturbances, drug overdoses, anticholinergic medications, withdrawal syndromes, and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Modulation of microglial activation, prevention of blood–brain-barrier alterations, and use of antioxidants represent relevant therapeutic targets that may impact significantly on neurologic outcomes. In the future, investigations in patients with sepsis should be undertaken to reduce the duration of <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and to study the impact of this reduction on important health outcomes, including functional and cognitive status in survivors.|$|R

In 128 septic and sedated patients, we studied <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> including delirium and coma by the evaluation of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Confusion Method Assessment in the ICU (CAM-ICU) after sedation withdrawal and the measurement of serum S 100 B biomarker of brain injury. Serum cortisol and S 100 B were measured within 12 hours after ICU admission and daily {{over the next four}} days. Results. <b>Brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was observed in 50 % (64 / 128) before but in 84 % (107 / 128) of patients after sedation withdrawal, and was more common in the patients older than 57 years (P = 0. 009). Both cortisol (P = 0. 007) and S 100 B levels (P = 0. 028) were higher in patients with than patients without <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Cortisol levels were associated with ICU mortality (hazard ratio = 1. 17, P = 0. 024). Multivariate logistic regression showed that cortisol (odds ratio (OR) : 2. 34, 95 % CI (2. 01, 3. 22), P = 0. 02) and the combination effect of cortisol with age (OR: 1. 004, 95 % CI (1. 002, 1. 93), P = 0. 038) but not S 100 B were associated with <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> Conclusions.

(Psychology) <b>Minimal</b> <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> as a {{diagnostic}} category with specific manifestations {{in terms of}} decreased scholastic ability, deficits in perseptual-motor and attentional functioning, has received {{a great deal of}} attention over the past ten years. However, the precise nature of this condition is still unclear, especially with regards to children diagnosed as having minimal brain dysfunction's response to remedial treatment and medication. From a literature survey it was concluded that there are two groups of children with <b>minimal</b> <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> These groups comply with the definitions made by Kenny, (1980) of a hiperkinotaxic group and a pseudohiperkinotaxic group where the former appear to be a group of children who do not respond to any form of training or treatment without the addition of stimulant medication. The pseudohiperkinotaxic group respond to educational remedial and psychological treatment without stimulant medication, where stimulant medication may even decrease their functional ability. It was hypothesized that because of certain neuro-chemical factors hiperkinotaxic children are less conditionable without stimulant medication, than the pseudohiperkintoxic chirdren.

40|$|Ph. D. (Psychology) Attention deficit disorder, or its {{theoretical}} antecedent <b>minimal</b> <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> {{has been}} the subject of numerous investigations as to the nature and cause of this disturbance that so often affects children. Although the findings of these studies appear to be equivocal as regards the precise cause of the condition, there are numerous indications in the literature that there might indeed be a neurological, albeit a "soft" neurological basis or cause, for this disturbance. A study was performed to test the hypothesis that <b>minimal</b> <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> indeed has its basis in higher cortical dysfunctions as assessed within the context of neuropsychological investigations. In order to perform the study, two measures of neuropsychological functioning, the Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological investigation for children and the Majovski determination of higher cortical functions in children and adolescents were subjected to a determination of its validity within the South African context. Subsequently these tests were applied to two groups of children with organic brain damage, a group of children diagnosed as having <b>minimal</b> <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction,</b> a group of children with emotional disturbance, and a group of normal children. The two groups of organically brain damaged children consisted of a group of children with predominantly left hemispheric brain damage and a group of children with predominantly right hemispheric brain damage.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Delirium and coma are a {{frequent}} source of morbidity for ICU patients. Several factors {{are associated with}} the prognosis of mechanically ventilated (MV) cancer patients, but no studies evaluated delirium and coma (acute <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction).</b> The present study evaluated the frequency and impact of acute <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> on mortality. METHODS: The study was performed at National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We prospectively enrolled patients ventilated > 48 h with a diagnosis of cancer. Acute <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was assessed during the first 14 days of ICU using RASS/CAM-ICU. Patients were followed until hospital discharge. Univariate and multivariable analysis were performed to evaluate factors associated with hospital mortality. RESULTS: 170 patients were included. 73 % had solid tumors, age 65 [53 - 72 (median, IQR 25 %- 75 %) ] years. SAPS II score was 54 [46 - 63] points and SOFA score was (7 [6 - 9]) points. Median duration of MV was 13 (6 - 21) days and ICU stay was 14 (7. 5 - 22) days. ICU mortality was 54 % and hospital mortality was 66 %. Acute <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> was diagnosed in 161 patients (95 %). Survivors had more delirium/coma-free days [4 (1, 5 - 6) vs 1 (0 - 2), p< 0. 001]. In multivariable analysis the number of days of delirium/coma-free days were associated with better outcomes as they were independent predictors of lower hospital mortality [0. 771 (0. 681 to 0. 873), p< 0. 001]. CONCLUSIONS: Acute <b>brain</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in MV cancer patients is frequent and independently associated with increased hospital mortality.

To achieve this, we needed a neuropsychological approach to our patients. We chose to use the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) as our method for evaluating cognitive function. CANTAB is a semi-automated neuropsychological test battery applied on a laptop PC.
