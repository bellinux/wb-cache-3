2500|$|The modern {{movement}} of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair (originally called the Hardoy chair), bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair that turns. It also introduced the first mass-produced plastic chairs such as the Bofinger chair in 1966. Technological advances led to <b>molded</b> <b>plywood</b> and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers.

5000|$|The {{chair was}} {{designed}} using technology for <b>molding</b> <b>plywood</b> that the Eames developed {{before and during}} the Second World War. Before American involvement in the war, Charles Eames and his friend, architect Eero Saarinen, entered a furniture group into the Museum of Modern Art's [...] "Organic Design in Home Furnishings Competition" [...] in 1940, a contest exploring the natural evolution of furniture in response to the rapidly changing world. Eames & Saarinen won the competition. However, production of the chairs was postponed due to production difficulties, and then by the United States' entry into WWII. Saarinen left the project due to frustration with production.|$|R

5000|$|Henry L. Haskell {{devised a}} way to make {{waterproof}} glue in 1913 from a derivative of dried cow blood. He used this adhesive to put together cross-grained thin veneer layers of wood to create a product referred to as a flat sheet [...] "panel"-now known as plywood ("plies" [...] of wood). The plywood was named Haskelite after himself. In 1915, he innovated a method to <b>mold</b> this <b>plywood</b> into three dimensional shapes using heat, hydraulic pressure and his patented waterproof glue.|$|R
500|$|The ITP was a low-wing, mixed {{construction}} monoplane {{with a wooden}} monocoque fuselage made from 'shpon', <b>molded</b> birch <b>plywood.</b> The two-spar metal wing was built in three sections with automatic leading edge slats. The engine radiators were built into the wing center section with intakes in the wing roots while the oil cooler was located under the engine. The curved, one-piece windshield lacked a flat front panel which gave the pilot a rather distorted view. The conventional undercarriage, including the tailwheel, was fully retractable. It carried [...] of fuel in tanks between the spars of the wing center section. The rear fuselage, cockpit and tail resembled that of the Polikarpov I-185.|$|R
30|$|A {{clear cover}} {{at the top}} and bottom of the beam was 20  mm, whereas a clear cover of 15  mm was {{maintained}} on the beam’s vertical sides. All specimens had two circular openings, one in each shear span, that were placed symmetrically about the mid-point of the beam (Fig.  1). The opening size was 140  mm, which corresponded to opening height-to-effective depth ratio of 0.5. The beams were cast in a horizontal position using <b>plywood</b> <b>molds.</b>|$|R

5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', <b>molded</b> birch <b>plywood,</b> {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|R

30|$|Beams {{were cast}} in {{disposable}} <b>plywood</b> <b>molds.</b> The bottom corners were rounded with a radius of 20  mm using wood molding strips {{in order to}} avoid grinding before FRCM installation. The beams were made from two concrete batches.

The average strength of the two batches was 29.13 and 42.91  MPa, respectively, with associated standard deviations of 1.01 and 1.84  MPa.
