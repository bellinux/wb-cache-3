40|$|<b>Mizolastine,</b> an {{antihistamine}} pharmaceutical, {{was found}} to significantly inhibit larval settlement of the barnacle Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite, the bryozoan Bugula neritina, and the polychaete Hydroides elegans with EC 50 values of 4. 2, 11. 2, and 4. 1 mg ml- 1, respectively. No toxicity against the larvae of these three species was observed at the concentration range tested during incubations with <b>mizolastine.</b> To determine whether the anti-settlement activity of <b>mizolastine</b> is reversible, recovery bioassays using these three species were conducted. More than 70 % of the larvae that had been exposed for 4 h to <b>mizolastine</b> at concentrations four-fold greater than their respective EC 50 values completed normal metamorphosis. The results of the recovery bioassay provide evidence that the antisettlement effect of <b>mizolastine</b> is reversible {{in addition to being}} nontoxic. The anti-settlement activities of several intermediates of the synthesis process of <b>mizolastine</b> were also examined. One of the intermediates, 2 -chloro- 1 -(4 - fluorobenzyl) - 1 H-benzo[d]imidazole, inhibited larval settlement and metamorphosis with low toxicity.

40|$|Ventricular arrhythmias {{are rare}} but {{life-threatening}} {{side effects of}} therapy with the second-generation H 1 receptor antagonists terfenadine and astemizole. Blockade of the K+ channels encoded by the Human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene 1 (HERG 1) K+ channels, which is the molecular basis of the cardiac repolarizing current IKr, by prolonging cardiac repolarization, has been recognized as the mechanism underlying the cardiac toxicity of these compounds. In the present study, the potential blocking ability of the novel second-generation H 1 receptor antagonist <b>mizolastine</b> of the HERG 1 K+ channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in HEK 293 cells or constitutively present in SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells has been examined and {{compared to that of}} astemizole. <b>Mizolastine</b> blocked HERG 1 K+ channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes with an estimated IC 50 of 3. 4 [*]μM. <b>Mizolastine</b> blockade was characterized by a fast dissociation rate when compared to that of astemizole; when fitted to a monoexponential function, the time constants for drug dissociation from the K+ channel were 72. 4 ± 11. 9 [*]s for 3 [*]μM <b>mizolastine,</b> and 1361 ± 306 [*]s for 1 [*]μM astemizole. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293 cells) stably transfected with HERG 1 cDNA, extracellular application of <b>mizolastine</b> exerted a dose-related inhibitory action on IHERG 1, with an IC 50 of 350 ± 76 [*]nM. Furthermore, <b>mizolastine</b> dose-dependently inhibited HERG 1 K+ channels constitutively expressed in SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma clonal cells. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that the novel second-generation H 1 receptor antagonist <b>mizolastine,</b> in concentrations higher than those achieved in vivo during standard therapy, is able to block in some degree both constitutively and heterologously expressed HERG 1 K+ channels, and confirm the heterogeneity of molecules belonging to this therapeutical class with respect to their HERG 1 -inhibitory action...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} {{safety and efficacy}} of the H 1 -receptor antagonist <b>mizolastine</b> in the symptomatic treatment of chronic urticaria (CU). Background <b>Mizolastine</b> is a novel second generation antihistamine with additional anti-inflammatory properties which {{has been shown to}} be effective in this condition as well as in allergic rhinitis. As the drug is used for chronic treatment, a detailed study of its efficacy and safety over a prolonged period was warranted. Methods This open label multicentre trial recruited 211 patients suffering from CU (67 % female; mean age 40 +/- 13 years), with greater than or equal to 1 episode/week if untreated. After a 7 -day placebo run-in period, patients received <b>mizolastine</b> (10 or 15 mg) for 12 months. Efficacy was assessed by the patient using daily diary cards and overall condition evaluation at study visits. Clinicians also assessed the same parameters at each visit, and gave a global assessment at study termination. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and laboratory parameters. Cardiac safety was monitored every 4 months using 12 -lead ECGs, with particular attention to QT intervals. Results The trial was completed by 127 patients. <b>Mizolastine</b> reduced overall discomfort from the second week of therapy, and reduced itching and the number and size of wheals, as assessed by the patients. The clinician's assessment of the proportion of patients with > 10 wheals decreased from 42 % to 28 % after 2 months. Clinical assessment also indicated that itch intensity and angioedema were improved by <b>mizolastine,</b> and the improvement was sustained throughout the trial. The investigators estimated that 70 % of patients benefited from therapy. There were no drug-related serious adverse events during the study. The cardiac repolarization assessed according to the QTc intervals was not modified during prolonged administration. Conclusion <b>Mizolastine</b> improves CU symptoms, and these improvements are sustained over 12 months with no loss of drug sensitivity. No specific side-effects are associated with its long-term use in the current study...|$|E
40|$|Background: Second-generation antihistamines (SGAs) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used drugs for AR nowadays. The cost of medicines is very important determinant in drug compliance; selection of low cost quality drugs would thus be helpful in improving compliance. Literature search revealed no such study done in India and the current study was thus planned to compare the variation in the cost of different SGAs used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in India. The study results would help doctors, pharmacists in selecting the least costly options among the available SGAs. Methods: The costs in Indian rupee (INR) of different generic and branded SGAs available in Indian market were referred from CIMS, drug today and the website www. medindiaguide. com. The dose for each drug was taken as per WHO defined daily dose (DDD) for allergic rhinitis. The highest and lowest price for ten tablets/capsules of each SGA manufactured by different pharmaceutical companies was noted. The percentage cost variation and cost ratio were then calculated for each drug. Results: Eight oral SGAs with a total of 1050 oral tablets or capsules manufactured by different companies are available for use in AR in India. The highest number of manufacturers were for levocetirizine (483), and lowest for <b>mizolastine</b> (2). Fexofenadine (INR 123. 56) was the costliest and levocetirizine the cheapest (INR 2. 3) SGA. Maximum variation in price was seen with cetirizine (4300 %). The cost ratio was highest for cetirizine (44), and lowest for <b>mizolastine</b> (1. 1). Cetirizine is the only SGA from the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) 2015 of India; also the only SGA in the DPCO 2013 list of controlled drugs and formulations. Conclusions: There is huge variation in the price of same SGA being manufactured by different companies. Between the least expensive and the most expensive cetirizine, there is a huge cost variation of 4300 %. [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2016; 5 (4. 000) : 1228 - 1233...|$|E

40|$|Background: Since all antihistamines {{are capable}} of {{crossing}} the blood-brain barrier, they may also cause sedation which may impair daily activities such as driving a car. The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} effects of antihistamines on driving ability. Method: A literature search revealed 18 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that applied the on-road highway driving test. In this test, subjects are instructed to drive 100 -km on a public highway with a steady lateral position and a constant speed (95 km/h). Primary outcome measure is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i. e. the weaving of the car. Results: The literature search yielded 18 clinical trials. At therapeutic doses, a single dose of diphenhydramine, emedastine and hydroxizine impaired driving comparable or greater than the effects of BAC 0. 08 %. Clemastine, triprolidine, <b>mizolastine,</b> acrivastine, dexchlorpheniramine CR and mequitazine impaired driving performance to the same extent as BAC 0. 05 %. For <b>mizolastine</b> significant impairment was only seen after higher than therapeutic doses. Results for cetirizine were mixed, illustrating the drug has the potential to impair driving performance, especially in sensitive subjects. Terfenadine, loratadine levocetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, bilastine fexofenadine and rupatadine showed no driving impairment in the standard driving test after acute administration of their recommended dose. Several studies examined subchronic effects of antihistamines on driving performance. After 4 days of daily treatment significant driving impairment was found for emedastine (2 and 4 mg bid), diphenhydramine (50 mg), clemastine (2 mg bid), triprolidine (5 mg bid), after 5 days of ebastine (30 mg), and after 8 days of hydroxyzine (50 mg). Mixed results were found for cetirizine (10 mg), terfenadine (120 mg) and loratadine (20 mg). No significant differences from placebo were observed after 4 days of subchronic treatment with triprolidine (10 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg), fexofenadine (up to 120 mg), and after 8 days of daily treatment with dexchlorpheniramine (6 mg), bilastine (20 and 40 mg), and mequitazine (10 mg). Conclusion: First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. The newer antihistamines such as levocetirizine and fexofenadine that cross to blood brain barrier to a much lesser degree do not show clinically relevant sedation or driving impairment...|$|E
40|$|Histamine H 1 -receptor antagonists are reversible, {{competitive}} inhibitors of {{the actions}} of histamine, a critical mediator in the pathophysiology of the allergic response. This review is mainly devoted to second generation antihistamines that possess a low sedation potential compared with first generation compounds. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of 10 compounds have been updated. Some values are lacking for drugs under development, but also for older antihistamines. Thereafter, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships are reported from published or original documents. A linear pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship has been found for acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, ebastine and terfenadine, whereas nonlinear relationships have been calculated for ebastine (in the dog), levocabastine, <b>mizolastine,</b> noberastine and terfenadine. It must be concluded that this type of approach for therapeutic optimisation is very fruitful and may enable large numbers of clinical studies to be avoided. Trends for the future include: (i) in vitro binding studies with the human H 1 -receptor obtained by molecular biology; (ii) the characterisation of the cytochromes P 450 responsible for the biotransformation of antihistamine; (iii) the calculation of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship in healthy individuals; and (iv) prospective effect-controlled clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims. Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) {{and asthma}} share common mediators, cytokines, and chemokines from mast cells and basophils that {{are central to}} the complex cascade of events involved in the inflammatory response. Histamine is the salient mediator released after immunologic challenge, initiating multiple pathologic processes of the allergic reaction that result in bronchial smooth muscle contraction, vasodilation, mucus hypersecretion, and edema. The recent identification of a fourth histamine receptor has reinforced clinical interest in the pleiotropic effects of histamine and the relative roles of histamine receptors in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. Material and methods. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for the following terms, alone or in combination: allergic rhinitis, asthma, antihistamines, histamine, and histamine receptors, and for the second-generation antihistamines azelastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, <b>mizolastine,</b> and rupatadine. Clinical trials were included that reported results for patients with AR and comorbid asthma who were treated with second-generation antihistamines. The search dates ranged from 1995 through 2010. Clinical studies that were not placebo controlled or double blinded were excluded from this review. Results. A total of 14 clinical trials of second-generation nonsedating antihistamines were included in this review. Conclusion. H 1 -antihistamines have been shown to attenuate the symptoms associated with early- and late-phase allergic reactions. Cumulative clinical evidence indicates that H 1 -antihistamines may have a beneficial effect on asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. Scientific significance. Mechanistic and clinical data suggest that the potential of H 1 -antihistamines to alleviate comorbid asthma symptoms in AR patients should be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|In {{pharmacotherapy}} for bronchitis and asthma, anti-hista-mines and anti-allergic {{drugs can}} be used concomitantly with theophylline (TP) to avoid induction of bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the respiratory tract. Some anti-hista-mines such as azelastine, ketotifen, mequitazine, <b>mizolastine,</b> pemiropast potassium, picumast dihydrochloride, repirinast, temelastine and terfenadine have been reported not to inter-act adversely with TP. 1) However, doqualast accelerated elim-ination of TP by increasing the free fraction in blood, and ke-totifen also decreased the serum level of TP. 2) TP has a nar-row therapeutic range in serum level of 10 — 20 mg/ml and can interact with other drugs in its metabolic process. 1, 3) Since many kinds of anti-allergic drugs have been developed and are commercially available, pharmacokinetic evaluation of the possible interaction between anti-allergic drugs and TP is important. Suplatast (ST), () -[2 -[4 -(3 -ethoxy- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) -phenylcarbamoyl]ethyl]dimethylsulfonium p-toluenesulfo-nate, is a novel anti-allergic drug and can inhibit not only production of IgE antibody but also type I allergic reaction. 4) That means ST can block both {{the first and second}} steps in an allergic reaction. In clinical practice, ST has been used for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhini-tis. Anti-allergic drugs can be administered in association with TP, however, no interaction between ST and TP has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effect of ST on pharmacokinetics of TP in rats. A pharmacokinetic study in vivo was performed, and TP metabolism was also exam-ined in rat-liver microsomes in vitro. Finally, the inhibitory effect of ST and its main metabolite, M 1, on TP metabolism was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Background Chronic {{spontaneous}} urticaria (CSU) is characterised by {{the development}} of crops of red, itchy, raised weals or hives with no identifiable external cause. Objectives To assess the effects of H 1 -antihistamines for CSU. Search methods We searched the following databases up to June 2014 : Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and PsycINFO (from 1806). We searched five trials registers and checked articles for references to relevant randomised controlled trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of H 1 -antihistamines for CSU. Interventions included single therapy or a combination of H 1 -antihistamines compared with no treatment (placebo) or another active pharmacological compound at any dose. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome measures were proportion of participants with complete suppression of urticaria: 'good or excellent' response, 50 % or greater improvement in quality of life measures, and adverse events. We present risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified 73 studies (9759 participants); 34 studies provided data for 23 comparisons. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short-term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate-term). Cetirizine 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term led to complete suppression of urticaria by more participants than was seen with placebo (RR 2. 72, 95 % CI 1. 51 to 4. 91). For this same outcome, comparison of desloratadine versus placebo in the intermediate term (5 mg) (RR 37. 00, 95 % CI 2. 31 to 593. 70) and in the short term (20 mg) (RR 15. 97, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 245. 04) favoured desloratadine, but no differences were seen between 5 mg and 10 mg for short-term treatment. Levocetirizine 20 mg per day (short-term) was more effective for complete suppression of urticaria compared with placebo (RR 20. 87, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 317. 60), and at 5 mg was effective in the intermediate term (RR 52. 88, 95 % CI 3. 31 to 843. 81) but not in the short term, nor was 10 mg effective in the short term. Rupatadine at 10 mg and 20 mg in the intermediate term achieved a 'good or excellent response' compared with placebo (RR 1. 35, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 77). Loratadine (10 mg) versus placebo (RR 1. 86, 95 % CI 0. 91 to 3. 79) and loratadine (10 mg) versus cetirizine (10 mg) (RR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 76 to 1. 43) over short-term and intermediate-term treatment showed no significant difference for 'good or excellent response' or for complete suppression of urticaria, respectively. Loratadine (10 mg) versus desloratadine (5 mg) (intermediate-term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 06) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 71). For loratadine (10 mg) versus <b>mizolastine</b> (10 mg) (intermediate-term), no statistically significant difference was seen for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 16) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 0. 88, 95 % CI 0. 55 to 1. 42). Loratadine (10 mg) versus emedastine (2 mg) (intermediate-term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression (RR 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 39) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 96 to 1. 24); the quality of the evidence was moderate for this comparison. No difference in short-term treatment was noted between loratadine (10 mg) and hydroxyzine (25 mg) in terms of complete suppression (RR 1. 00, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 3. 10). When desloratadine (5 to 20 mg) was compared with levocetirizine (5 to 20 mg), levocetirizine appeared to be the more effective (P value < 0. 02). In a comparison of fexofenadine versus cetirizine, more participants in the cetirizine group showed complete suppression of urticaria (P value < 0. 001). Adverse events leading to withdrawals were not significantly different in the following comparisons: cetirizine versus placebo at 10 mg and 20 mg (RR 3. 00, 95 % CI 0. 68 to 13. 22); desloratadine 5 mg versus placebo (RR 1. 46, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 5. 10); loratadine 10 mg versus <b>mizolastine</b> 10 mg (RR 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 04 to 3. 60); loratadine 10 mg versus emedastine 2 mg (RR 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 07 to 17. 14); cetirizine 10 mg versus hydroxyzine 25 mg (RR 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 25 to 2. 45); and hydroxyzine 25 mg versus placebo (RR 3. 64, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 17. 23), all intermediate term. No difference was seen between loratadine 10 mg versus <b>mizolastine</b> 10 mg in the proportion of participants with at least 50 % improvement in quality of life (RR 3. 21, 95 % CI 0. 32 to 32. 33). Authors' conclusions Although the results of our review indicate that at standard doses of treatment, several antihistamines are effective when compared with placebo, all results were gathered from a few studies or, in some cases, from single-study estimates. The quality of the evidence was affected by the small number of studies in each comparison and the small sample size for many of the outcomes, prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for imprecision (unless stated for each comparison, the quality of the evidence was low). No single H 1 -antihistamine stands out as most effective. Cetirizine at 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term was found to be effective in completely suppressing urticaria. Evidence is limited for desloratadine given at 5 mg once daily in the intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg in the intermediate but not short term was effective for complete suppression. Levocetirizine 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. No difference in rates of withdrawal due to adverse events was noted between active and placebo groups. Evidence for improvement in quality of life was insufficient...|$|E
