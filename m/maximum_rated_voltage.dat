40|$|An SiC {{power device}} {{possesses}} features like high breakdown voltage, fast switching capability, and high temperature operation, {{and is expected}} to be superior to conventional Si power devices. This paper clarifies the switching capability of an SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) in rectification of high frequency ac voltage. The dynamic behavior of the SiC SBD for switching operation is modeled based on semiconductor physics and device structure, and is characterized by its dc current-voltage (I-V) and ac capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics. A C-V characterization system, which measures capacitance using a dc bias voltage corresponding to the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of the SiC SBD, is developed. The C-V characteristics are evaluated through experiments over the rated voltage range. These results explain the punch-through structure and device parameters. The dynamic behavior of the proposed model is validated through experiments on half-wave rectification of ac voltages over a wide frequency range. As a relational expression of voltage, current, and frequency of an applied ac sinusoidal voltage, the performance criterion of the device is established for rectification. The model also quantitatively assesses the switching capability of SiC SBDs. The model and performance criteria are beneficial for circuit design and device evaluation...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} people {{worldwide}} are becoming “carbon conscious”. This means they are becoming increasingly aware of the imminent adverse effects of global warming. Of late {{there has been an}} urgent drive for governments to be on the forefront of all carbon mitigation initiatives. One such drive involves the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change whose parties have been meeting regularly under the banner of Conference of Parties (COP) since 1995. At this conference, parties to the convention review progress made in dealing with climate change. Also key to the deliberations in such meetings are better ways of developing cleaner “carbon free” energy sources. Energy sources of this nature are commonly known as renewable energy sources. In essence global energy trends are constantly moving towards development of more renewable energy sources. It is an undeniable fact that some of viable renewable energy sources especially those with bulk capacity are usually located remotely from load centers. This inevitable reality necessitates the construction of long distance bulk power transmission corridors to link generation sites with load centers. Due to its many inherent advantages over High Voltage Alternate Current (HVAC) for long distance power transmission, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is gradually winning the favor of many utilities. In fact, recent advances in HVDC technology have encouraged many utilities to explore the possibility of harnessing remotely located renewable energy sources which would have otherwise not been viable with HVAC transmission. Through the unfortunate and inevitable phenomenon known as corona effect, overhead HVDC conductors suffer real power losses to the air dielectric surrounding them. Through corona, part of the energy carried on the transmission line is expended through ionization and movement of charges in the air dielectric. This study combined physics, mathematical as well engineering concepts to review corona phenomenon around HVDC lines with specific emphasis on space charge generation and motion within ionized DC fields as well as the influence of temperature on corona discharge or power loss. Also, unlike HVAC, performance of an HVDC system relies heavily on the availability of a reliable and robust telecommunication system. One of the key ways of ensuring reliability of a telecommunication system is by making sure that reliable power supplies are in place to power remote repeater stations. A novel concept of quasi-autonomous corona-based power supply (or QC power supply in short) that works on the principle of magnetohydrodymic (MHD) power generation was developed. A small scale experiment was then designed to assess the feasibility of such power supplies. The experiment was conducted with DC supply of a <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of 30 kVDC and generated up to 6 VDC at an optimum ambient temperature of 23 °C. These results have confirmed that with further development QC power supplies have the potential of proving reliable power to remotely located repeaters or any other small critical loads along the stretch of the HVDC transmission line. Practical HVDC transmission systems operate voltages in the excess of 500 kV. By linear extrapolation of the above mentioned results; one would expect to yield up to 100 -, 120 - and 160 -VDC from a 500 -, 600 - and 800 - kV HVDC system, respectively. Although the study succeeded in conceptualizing a CMHD idea upon which the novel QC power supply was developed, quite extensive and rigorous design, modeling, prototyping and experimentation processes are still required before the first QC power supply can be commissioned on a practical HVDC lin...|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{optimization}} of a photovoltaic system, {{several studies}} show the {{advantage in the}} choice of a distributed structure. For such structures small power converters such as the boosts and buck converters appear as most appropriate. We have analysed the efficiency of small power boost-converters especially dedicated for photovoltaic energy conversion systems working in the middle and high voltage ranges. The setup studied is a photovoltaic generator connected to an AC grid working in 230 Volts via an inverter. More over, we considered the possibility of multiple electrical energy sources as photovoltaic, wind systems in the same energy production system, which obliged an adaptive converter structure. We evaluated the losses in the various stages of a boost converter and point out the importance of the power MOSFET used as the commutation element. New transistors databases obtained from manufacturers show the nonlinear dependency between the resistance drain-source when passing, R dson and the <b>maximum</b> <b>rating</b> <b>voltage</b> when the transistor is off, V dsmax, for all transistor families. Thus nonlinear dependency induces a huge increase of losses with the voltage in the MOSFET, and as a direct consequence in the converter the more as V dsmax is higher. In order to minimize losses of the converter we have designed and realized a new high efficiency version of a Step-Up structure based on a commutation element integrating a low V dsmax voltage MOSFET and very low R dson...|$|R
50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is <b>maximum</b> at <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b> This <b>maximum</b> iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the hysteresis loss and the eddy current loss. Although the hysteresis loss is less than the eddy current loss, it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the hysteresis loss varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy current loss varies with the square.|$|R
5000|$|In non-pacemaker cells (i.e. {{ventricular}} cells) this {{is produced}} predominantly by the activation of Na+ channels, {{which increases the}} membrane conductance (flow) of Na+ (gNa). These channels are activated when an action potential arrives from a neighbouring cell, through gap junctions. When this happens, the voltage within the cell increases slightly. If this increased voltage reaches a certain value (threshold potential; ~-70mV) it causes the Na + channels to open. This produces a larger influx of sodium into the cell, rapidly increasing the voltage further (to ~ +50mV; i.e. towards the Na+ equilibrium potential). However, if the initial stimulus is not strong enough, and the threshold potential is not reached, the rapid sodium channels will not activate and an action potential will not be produced, {{this is known as}} the All-or-none law [...] The slope of phase 0 on the action potential waveform (see figure 2) represents the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>voltage</b> change, of the cardiac action potential and is known as dV/dtmax.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing, as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> continuous current for its <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> operating <b>voltage.</b> From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing was calculated.

As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data on the}} {{propagation}} of streamers in mineral oil {{is important for the}} design of high-voltage systems in the power and pulsed-power industries. In the present study, breakdown voltages and pre-breakdown delay times were measured for planeparallel electrodes, and for two non-uniform electrode arrangements. For each geometry, the breakdown characteristics were determined for impulses of rise-time 100 ns, and also rise-time 1 μs. The <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>voltage</b> rise (dV/dt) was 4 MV/μs. For the non-uniform geometries with inter-electrode gap length of 8. 5 mm, the time to breakdown was 2. 5 - 3 times longer for impulses of rise-time 1 μs than for 100 ns risetime. The time-to-breakdown data suggest that streamer propagation velocity increases with higher values of dV/dt. For example, the estimated propagation velocity for pinplane geometry with a 1 μs rise-time is 10 - 12 km/s. At 100 ns rise-time for the same electrode geometry, the average propagation velocity exceeds 40 km/s. The results are compared with data previously generated in parallel liquid-solid gaps, and it is concluded that the time to breakdown is longer, and that higher applied fields are required to initiate breakdown, in open oil gaps compared to the case when a solid spacer is present. The results presented are intended to provide reference data for designers of oil-immersed, high-voltage systems such as power transformers and pulsed-power supplies...|$|R

Several studies of such compensators have also been conducted to improve the ac network operation during unbal- anced voltage sags. This paper presents a complete control scheme intended for synchronous compensators operating under these abnormal network conditions. In particular, this control scheme introduces two contributions: a novel reactive current reference generator and a new voltage support control loop. The current reference generator has as a main feature the capacity to supply the required reactive current even when the voltage drops in amplitude during the voltage sag. Thus, a safe system operation is easily guaranteed by fixing the limit required current to the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> current. The <b>voltage</b> control loop is able to imple- ment several control strategies by setting two voltage set points.
