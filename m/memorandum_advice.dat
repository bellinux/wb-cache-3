40|$|This paper {{begins with}} a brief {{overview}} of the current teaching and learning aims and assessment in the Human Rights Law course offered at RMIT University. Although this course has been taught on a face to face basis, in future, it will also be offered to on line students. This calls for new teaching and learning and assessment practices which promote deep learning for those enrolled in distance education. After a brief discussion of the theoretical literature relating to assessment, the paper discusses the perceived benefits of introducing an online learning activity relevant to the aims of the course. The paper then outlines the proposed on line activities and the relevant online tools. How the student will engage with the activity is addressed as is student demonstration of discipline based learning. It will be demonstrated that the overhauling of the existing format of the teaching and learning component relating to the <b>memorandum</b> of <b>advice</b> with online tools and exercises will strengthen and enrich the learning process for students enrolled in distance education and will lead to higher order thinking and deep learning...|$|R

50|$|The 1990-1991 Gulf Crisis and War, {{in which}} an American-led {{coalition}} of forces aligned against the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein in response to its seizure of Kuwait, proved an opportunity for al-Ouda and others to tap into an already-existing current of discontent within the Kingdom. When the then-Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz bin Baz issued a fatwa lending Islamic justification for the regime to invite American forces to defend Saudi Arabia from Hussein, al-Ouda {{raised questions about the}} ability of the Saudi military to defend the Kingdom with so much investment in U.S. armaments. During the war, al-Ouda was a moving force behind two reform petitions addressed to the King. The first, in 1991, was known as the Letter of Demands and was signed by leading Saudi religious, mercantile, and socially prominent figures seeking changes in the form of government, notably the establishment of a Shura (consultative) Council. A year later, the second petition, known as the <b>Memorandum</b> of <b>Advice,</b> which was signed by more than one hundred religious scholars, including establishment Ulama, called for a Shura Council as well as media censorship under religious guidance and review of all the kingdom's laws to insure their conformity with Shari'a. Both petitions expressed loyalty to the house of Sa'ud while opposing the lack of representation in the existing government. Meanwhile, audiotapes of al-Ouda's sermons gained wide circulation and encouraged to other opposition voices after the first Gulf War, as the United States military settled in for a long stay at an airbase outside the capital.|$|R
40|$|In 2006, the LWB 236 Real Property A Law {{teaching}} {{team in the}} School of Law at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is {{replacing a}} research essay assessment task with a more authentic assessment task that will better equip students for the real world. The new assessment task is a drafting exercise and <b>memorandum</b> of <b>advice</b> that will embed and assess more lawyering and generic skills. In particular, it will develop legal research skills, legal analysis skills, drafting skills, written communication skills and document management skills. It will also give the {{students the opportunity to}} develop autonomy and self-confidence. In addition to the new assessment task, the teaching team is also implementing a new assessment regime, that is, criterion referenced assessment in accordance with the new QUT Assessment Policy. The outcome of this will be increased validity, reliability and transparency of the assessment task. The criterion referenced assessment sheet was designed to indicate the alignment between the new assessment task and the learning outcomes of LWB 236 Real Property A. The design was informed by a criterion referenced assessment sheet used in a first year undergraduate core law subject, LWB 143 Legal Research and Writing, and the one used in LWB 237 Real Property B, to recognise that law students incrementally develop their skills as they progress through the law degree. The successful implementation of criterion referenced assessment will depend on the measures taken to ensure that there is a shared understanding of the criteria and performance standards between the markers and students. This conference paper will discuss these plans for turning LWB 236 Real Property A into a subject for the real world in 2006...|$|R
50|$|He {{engaged in}} piracy there, plundering both ships and coastal settlements, {{covering}} the {{expenses for the}} re-equipment of his ships at Trebizond with five slave-women, worth in all 164 ducats. Then, de Thoisy decided to continue to the coast of Georgia, hoping to capture vessels carrying silk. Although the Emperor of Trebizond warned him {{that the people of}} Georgia were Christians, de Thoisy went ahead with his campaign, claiming that his orders were to fight all schismatics who did not obey the Pope. However, some Greeks from Trebizond informed Georgians who, when they saw the galley coming, took up arms and waited in ambush. As soon as Thoisy landed at the port of Vaty (Batumi), the ambushers attacked, killing many of his men and taking him captive. The ones who managed to escape fled to the Genoese port of Caffa (modern Feodosiya, Ukraine) and reported to de Wavrin who dispatched the Knight Hospitaller Sir Regnault de Confide to ask the Emperor of Trebizond to mediate Thoisy’s release. The Emperor was quick to send to Georgia and, by these means, Sir Geoffrey was set free. He was put safely on board the galley and sailed to Caffa, capturing on the way two Greek vessels with cargoes of fish. Eventually, de Thoisy's piracy led to a protest from the government of Genoa to the Duke of Burgundy. This forced de Thoisy to return to Constantinople where he was invited by de Wavrin to join the forthcoming expedition with the Hungarians and Vlachs. He preferred to return with his ships to Nice and Villefranche, however. Later, in the 1450s, de Thoisy wrote <b>memoranda</b> of <b>advice</b> to the new Crusade endeavor planned (but never materialized) by Philip III.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{remediation}} {{costs have}} a significant financial impact on both industry and government. It {{has been estimated that}} the costs of complete environmental remediation could run as high as one trillion dollars. Furthermore, 2 ̆ 2 the tax treatment of these costs may vary the total cost by more than a third. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the tax treatment of environmental clean-up costs will have a tremendous financial impact on both the taxpayer and the United States Treasury. In an attempt to alleviate uncertainty surrounding the tax treatment of environmental remediation costs, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Revenue Ruling 94 - 38 on June 3, 1994. However, since its issuance, there has been a question whether Revenue Ruling 94 - 38 was {{a step in the right}} direction with respect to the tax treatment of environmental clean-up costs, leaving behind the uncertainty created by Technical <b>Advice</b> <b>Memoranda</b> (TAMs), also known as Private Letter Rulings, 92 - 40 - 004, 93 - 15 - 004, and 94 - 11 - 002.

5000|$|Caceres is {{described}} as a chauvinist Jew, boastful of his Jewish descent. He joined Antonio Fernandez Carvajal in the acquisition of the Bet Cholim cemetery in London, {{and was one of the}} petitioners who signed the document presented to Oliver Cromwell by Manasseh ben Israel in March 1656. Queen Christina of Sweden is known to have interceded with Cromwell on his behalf for certain commercial privileges in Barbados. At a later date the king of Denmark gave Caceres's brother a letter of recommendation to Charles II of England, which was instrumental in procuring for the Jews in the West Indies an extension of commercial facilities. Simon was one of Cromwell's intelligencers; and there are at least two documents among the Thurloe papers which show that his experience was utilized by the lord protector.

5000|$|As part of {{his efforts}} to {{influence}} the Nazi regime, Goerdeler had sent Hitler long <b>memoranda</b> containing his <b>advice</b> on economic policy, {{and in the second}} half of 1935, wrote up a new draft law on the powers and responsibilities of municipal governments. Despite his early sympathy for the regime and considerable pressure from the National Socialists, Goerdeler always refused to join the NSDAP. By the mid-1930s, Goerdeler grew increasingly disillusioned with the Nazis as it become more and more apparent that Hitler had no interest in reading any of Goerdeler's memoranda, but instead was carrying out economic and financial polices that Goerdeler regarded as highly irresponsible. In addition, the fact that the Nazis in the Leipzig municipal government massively increased the debts owed the city was a major source of worry for Goerdeler. By 1934 he clashed with Hitler over his foreign policy, as Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression treaty with Poland, to which Goerdeler was opposed, demanding annexation of Polish territories. He wrote to Hitler that continued Polish possession of territories in Gdansk Pomerania and Greater Poland was [...] "thorn in country's economic flesh and honour", and that [...] "the German people must fight for security of their existence".|$|R
