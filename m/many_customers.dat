5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport {{was used as a}} pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 19467–48. While there were initially <b>many</b> <b>customers,</b> the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} prompted {{complaints that}} Metro was inconveniencing its <b>many</b> <b>customers,</b> including tourists and other infrequent users, {{who did not}} own a SmarTrip card. In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of credit cards to pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line. One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target. WMATA has since {{announced that it will}} make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay-on-exit parking facilities.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left <b>many</b> <b>customers</b> without phone and electrical service.

And, IrisGL libraries were unsuitable for opening due to licensing and patent issues. These factors required SGI to continue to support the advanced and proprietary Iris Inventor and Iris Performer programming APIs while market support for OpenGL matured.|$|E
