40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{currently}} revising {{the legal framework}} for the processing and free movement of personal data. The revision is motivated by a need to reduce legal fragmentation among Member States and thus to improve {{the right to privacy}} accorded to EU citizens, without impeding the functioning of the internal market. The European Commission (EC) issued its proposal for a General Data Protection Regulation (DPR) 1 in January 2012. The EC proposes a Regulation rather than a Directive, meaning a single piece of legislation directly applicable at national level. The EC proposal contains a number of provisions and exemptions crucial to facilitating vital medical and health research, thus reconciling the social right to better health within a framework of protection of individual rights to privacy. The rapporteur of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee of the European Parliament (EP) produced in January 2013 his draft report on the DPR (the Albrecht Report) 2 with amendments that disturb this balance and dramatically weaken the provisions and exemptions applicable for medical and health research. The Scientifi c Committee for Medical Sciences of Science Europe (<b>MED</b> <b>Committee)</b> wishes to alert the EU institutions to the devastating implications of such amendments, if passed. Our position is in line with many public statements and position papers elaborated by prominent stakeholders from the European medical and health research community 3 on the crucial need to structure a legal framework for data protection which continues to promote medical research in Europe for the benefi t of individuals in society, while ensuring a proportionate requirement for patient privacy. 3 Summary Opinion and Recommendations of the MED Committe...|$|E

40|$|Here, for {{the first}} time, the {{formation}} of adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine from formamide solutions with heating only to 130 degrees C and UV-irradiation {{in the absence of}} minerals or inorganic salts is shown using LC-MS/MS as the analysis technique. The thesis goes on to demonstrate that the product distributions change drastically when the temperature is increased to 160 degrees C from 130 degrees C, specifically that the amount of hypoxanthine increases with the addition of UV light, and the amount of adenine increases with an increase in temperature. Along with showing the formation of purines in these reactions, the identification of pyrimidines was also achieved by GCxGC-MS. GCxGC-MS was also used to study additional samples, specifically bio-oils, where the type of compounds in the samples were easily identifiable, which allowed for a direct comparison between different types of bio-oils (e. g. Douglas-fir bark, Southern pine bark, and a Southern pine bark-wood mixture). <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Thomas <b>M.</b> Orlando; <b>Committee</b> Member: Alfred H.

40|$|This Thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a reconfigurable both in frequency and radiation pattern Annular Slot Antenna (ASA). The antenna is fabricated on Duroid with dielectric constant 6. 15. The ASA operates in three different frequencies: 5. 2, 5. 8 and 6. 4 GHz. The matching at those frequencies is achieved using linear stubs. PIN diodes are used as switches to connect/disconnect the stubs to the microstip feed line. The use of PIN diodes along the slot allows the steering of the radiation pattern and therefore {{the position of a}} radiation pattern null is directed in three pre-selected directions. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Papapolymerou John; <b>Committee</b> Co-Chair: Tentzeris <b>M.</b> Manos; <b>Committee</b> Member: Cressler D.

40|$|The {{impedance}} {{response of}} silicon carbide whisker-alumina composites is investigated utilizing novel stereological techniques {{along with a}} microstructural simulation. The stereological techniques developed allow for a measurement of the trivariate length, radius and orientation distribution of whiskers in the composite from measurements made on two-dimensional sectioning planes. The measured distributions are then utilized in a Monte Carlo simulation that predicts connectivity in the composite for a given volume fraction. It is assumed in the simulation that connectivity factors dominate the electrical response, not interfacial phenomena. The results of the simulation are compared with impedance spectra taken from real samples, and conclusions are drawn regarding {{the nature of the}} impedance response. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Rosario A.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Masters Thesis {{research}} is to evaluate alternative transmission systems from remote wind farms to the main grid using low-frequency AC technology. Low frequency means a frequency lower than nominal frequency (60 / 50 Hz). The low-frequency AC network can {{be connected to the}} power grid at major substations via cyclo-converters that provide a low-cost interconnection and synchronization with the main grid. Cyclo-converter technology is utilized to minimize costs which result in systems of 20 / 16. 66 Hz (for 60 / 50 Hz systems respectively). Low frequency transmission has the potential to provide an attractive solution in terms of economics and technical merits. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Meliopoulos Sakis; <b>Committee</b> Member: Deepakraj <b>M</b> Divan; <b>Committee</b> Member: Taylor Davi...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} the channel assignment problem in single radio multi-channel mobile ad-hoc networks. Specifically, we investigate the granularity of channel assignment decisions that gives the best trade-off in terms of performance and complexity. We present a new granularity for channel assignment that we refer to as component level channel assignment. The strategy is relatively simple, and is characterized by several impressive practical advantages. We also show that the theoretical performance of the component based channel assignment strategy does not lag significantly behind the optimal possible performance, and perhaps more importantly we show that when coupled with its several practical advantages, it significantly outperforms other strategies under most network conditions. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Professor Raghupathy Sivakumar; Committee Member: Professor Douglas <b>M.</b> Blough; <b>Committee</b> Member: Professor Ian F.

Aggression is construed as having two components, {{each of which}} is associated more strongly with either implicit or explicit measures of aggression. A videogame based frustration manipulation was used to elicit hostile aggressive responses in the form of hard force applied to buttons. Instrumental aggression criteria were also assessed in the form of honesty in reporting game outcomes, willingness to pause games while believing that pausing could damage the study results, and willingness to use unfair strategies that are also described as damaging to study results. Differential prediction of these behaviors by implicit and explicit measures of aggression supported a dissociative model of aggression measurement. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Dr. Lawrence R.

40|$|The common {{observation}} that the onset of a core MARFE (edge localized, poloidally asymmetric, highly radiating region) is followed immediately by a High-to-Low confinement mode transition in DIII-D was investigated by comparing a theoretical prediction of the threshold non-radiative power across the separatrix needed to maintain H-mode with an experimental determination of the non-radiative power flowing across the separatrix. It was found that in three shots with continuous gas fueling that the increased neutral influx associated with the MARFE formation caused {{a sharp increase in}} the predicted threshold non-radiative power crossing the separatrix that was required for the plasma to remain in H-mode to a value comparable to the experimental power crossing the separatrix, indicating a theoretical prediction of a H-L transition in agreement with experimental observation. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Dr. Weston <b>M.</b> Stacey; <b>Committee</b> Member: Dr. Cassiano de Oliveira; Committee Member: Dr. John Mandreka...|$|R
40|$|Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) Tags {{have become}} quite {{widespread}} in many {{services in the}} industry such as access control, parcel and document tracking, distribution logistics, automotive systems, and livestock or pet tracking. In these applications, a wireless communication link is provided between a remote transponder (antenna and integrated circuit (IC)) and an interrogator or reader. A suitable antenna for these tags must have low cost, low profile and especially small size whereas the bandwidth requirement (few kilohertz to megahertz) is less critical. In this document, methods to reduce tag size, the performance optimization of the tag by using novel antenna matching techniques for increased operational bandwidth and gain/radiation pattern/radiation efficiency improvement are introduced for 13. 56 MHz HF and 915 MHz UHF RFID tags. In addition, an evaluation of an active 915 MHz UHF RFID field study for container tracking {{at the port of}} Savannah, GA is also presented. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Dr. Manos <b>M.</b> Tentzeris; <b>Committee</b> Member: Dr. John Papapolymerou; Committee Member: Dr. Joy Laska...|$|R

40|$|Synthesis and Pharmacology of Potential Site-Directed Therapeutic Agents for Cocaine Abuse Susanna Moore 235 Pages Directed by Dr. David M. Collard and Dr. Howard M. Deutsch Stimulants such as cocaine {{continue}} {{to dominate the}} nations illicit drug problem. An effective medication for any aspect of cocaine addiction has not been developed. Cocaine binds, although not selectively, to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and disrupts normal dopamine (DA) neurotransmission between neurons. While the dopamine hypothesis for the mechanism of action of cocaine has been widely accepted, cocaine also possesses the ability to block the uptake of serotonin at the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) and norepinephrine at the norepinephrine transporter (NET). The purpose of the work described herein is directed towards synthesizing and testing compounds selective for the DAT, leading to the identification of candidates as potential pharmacotherapies for cocaine dependence. A series of disubstituted and trisubstituted [2. 2. 2] and [2. 2. 1]bicycles were synthesized and tested for inhibitor potency in [3 H]WIN 35, 428 (WIN) binding at the DAT and for inhibition of [3 H]DA uptake. Based on results {{from some of the}} pharmacology data new regio- and stereochemical isomers of bicyclic [2. 2. 1]heptanes and [2. 2. 2]octanes were synthesized. This will lead to further structure-activity-relationships, which will provide {{a better understanding of the}} structural requirements needed to bind at the DAT. Ph. D.

To understand the complete cause of these incidents, {{it is critical to}} examine the drivers perception of these situations. This study involved simulations of multiple driving situations variant on luminance, rate of closure, and vehicle motions. Findings suggest changes in brake onset times of younger drivers based on roles of a lead vehicle. Multiple perceptually different rear end collisions caused participants to alter their brake onset times. The brake onset times were used to analyze braking models, including constant distance and constant tau. Additional analysis included correlations of the effects Useful Field of View and Test Anxiety on brake onset times. Effects identified not only aid in the general understanding of driving behavior, but also facilitate the application of driver assistive systems, which are currently being integrated into production vehicles. <b>M.</b> S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Dr. Gregory <b>M.</b> Corso; <b>Committee</b> Member: Dr. Arthur D.
