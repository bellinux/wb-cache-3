In this paper, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally, amplification through mechanically coupled microbeams. The device is composed of two identical clamped-clamped beams, made of polyimide, connected at their middle through a third beam, which acts as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupler.</b> Each of the clamped-clamped microbeams and the coupler {{are designed to be}} actuated separately, hence providing various possibilities of actuation and sensing. The coupled resonator is driven into resonance near its first resonance mode and its dynamic behavior is explored via frequency sweeps. The results show significant amplification in the resonator amplitude when the signal is measured at the midpoint of the coupler compared with the response of the individual uncoupled beams. The static pull-in characteristics of the resonator are also studied. It is shown that the compliant <b>mechanical</b> <b>coupler</b> can serve as a low-power radio frequency switch actuated at low voltage loads. [2016 - 0100...|$|E

It uses a PrimeSense Carmine 1. 09 sensor for mapping and carries an IR temperature sensor, analog distance sensor, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) inside a protective shell. The first field test succeeded in collecting valuable scientific data but revealed several needed improvements, including more rugged cable connections and <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplers,</b> increased ground clearance, and higher-torque motors for uphill mobility. The second field test significantly improved {{on all of these}} aspects but it traded electrical ruggedness for reduced data collection speed. Data collected by the VolcanoBots, while intermittent, yield the first insights into the cm-scale geometry of volcanic fissures at depths of up to 25 m. VolcanoBot was deployed at the 1969 Mauna Ulu fissure system on Kīlauea volcano in Hawai'i. It collected first-of-its-kind data from inside the fissure system. We hypothesized that 1) fissure sinuosity should decrease with depth, 2) irregularity should be persistent with depth, 3) any blockages in the conduit should occur at the narrowest points, and 4) the fissure should narrow with depth until it is too narrow for VolcanoBot to pass or is plugged with solidified lava. Our field campaigns did not span enough lateral or vertical area to test sinuosity. The preliminary data indicate that 1) there were many irregularities along fissures at depth, 2) blockages occurred, but not at obviously narrow locations, and 3) the conduit width remained a consistent 0. 4 – 0. 5 m for most of the upper 10 m that we analyzed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the modeling, the design and the control of mild hybrid {{electric}} vehicles. The main goal is to develop accurate design tools and methodologies for preliminary system and component level analysis. Particular attention {{is devoted to the}} configuration in which an electric machine is mounted on the rear axle of a passenger car. The use of such a machine in parallel with the internal combustion engine allows one to exploit different functionalities that are able to reduce the overall fuel consumption of the vehicle. In addition, the indirect coupling between the thermal and the electric machine, realized through the road and not by means of <b>mechanical</b> <b>couplers,</b> together with the position of the latter in the overall vehicle chassis system, enables such an architecture to be efficient both from the energy recovery and the full electric driving point of view. Chapter 1 introduces the problem of fuel consumption and emissions reduction in the overall world context and presents the main hybrid architectures available. Chapter 2 is devoted {{to the study of the}} influence of the electric machine position in the powertrain regarding the regenerative braking potentialities concerned. The model considered for the analysis will be described on each of its subcomponents. The braking performance of the vehicle in electric mode is presented considering no losses in the electric powertrain (electric motor, battery, inverter). Chapter 3 is dedicated to the design of an electric machine for a rear axle powertrain. The specifications of such machine are optimized considering both the vehicle and the application under analysis. The design takes into account analytical techniques for the computation of electrical parameters (such as phase and DC currents) and the torque - speed map, as well as numerical ones for its thermal behavior. In Chapter 4 the electrical and thermal characteristics of the designed electric motor are implemented in the model presented in Chapter 2. The overall vehicle model is therefore used both to assess a simple torque split strategy between thermal and electric machine and to perform an optimal sizing of the battery considering all the limitations imposed by the electric powertrain (e. g. maximum currents, maximum temperatures). Chapter 5 makes a step forward and analyzes the different implications that the use of the rear axle electric motor to brake the vehicle has on the vehicle dynamics. Open loop analysis will present a degradation of the vehicle handling comfort caused by the introduction of an oversteering moment to the vehicle. Through the use of a simplified vehicle model, the introduced oversteering yaw moment is evaluated, while a control strategy based on a new stability detector will show how to find a trade off between handling comfort and regenerable energy. At last, Chapter 6 {{deals with the}} problem of longitudinal driving comfort. Drivelines and chassis are lightly damped systems and the application of an impulsive torque imposed by the driver can cause the vehicle longitudinal acceleration (directly perceived by the driver) to be oscillating and non smooth. A sensitivity analysis on a conventional powertrain is presented demonstrating which of the different components are more influential in the different modes of vibration, and possible solutions to improve the driveability are proposed. One of these relates to the use of the rear axle electric machine in order to give more responsiveness to the vehicle. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Chapter 7...|$|R

40|$|Fundamental power {{couplers}} for RF {{particle accelerators}} {{are the most}} important components that interface with the accelerating structures. In the case of superconducting cavities, the main function of providing appropriate power to the cavity’s fields and to the beams is dwarfed by the requirements the couplers must meet to blend harmoniously into the vacuum, cryogenic, and electromagnetic environment. Recently, a lot of {{progress has been made in}} the areas critical to the successful design, construction and operation of fundamental power couplers. Simulations are now routinely performed that allow the prediction of electromagnetic, multipacting, thermal, and <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>couplers.</b> From these studies, better designs have been conceived which can minimize potential problems ahead of construction. Judicious use of materials and the implementation of clean practices and of careful conditioning have gradually increased the power levels at which couplers can safely operate. Machine operation at hundreds of kilowatts has been achieved in CW at KEK and Cornell, and in a pulse mode at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF). Test stand operations in CW have been achieved at the megawatt level (Accelerator for the Production of Tritium) and in pulse mode at a peak power of 2 MW (Spallation Neutron Source, TTF version II). The recent progress indicates that understanding of fundamental power coupler behavior is rapidly increasing and that optimal designs are being developed which will allow routine attainment of the megawatt power levels necessary for high-beam-power machines under construction and under study. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of electric motors and industrial appliances such as pumps, fans, and compressors is rapidly increasing. For instance, the {{integration of}} an electric motor and a centrifugal pump provides cost savings and improved performance characteristics. Material cost savings are achieved when an electric motor is integrated into the shaft of a centrifugal pump, and the motor utilizes the bearings of the pump. This arrangement leads to a smaller configuration that occupies less floor space. The performance characteristics of a pump drive can be improved by using the variable-speed technology. This enables the full speed control of the drive {{and the absence of}} a <b>mechanical</b> gearbox and <b>couplers.</b> When using rotational speeds higher than those that can be directly achieved by the network frequency the structure of the rotor has to be mechanically durable. In this thesis the performance characteristics of an axial-flux solid-rotor-core induction motor are determined. The motor studied is a one-rotor-one-stator axial-flux induction motor, and thus, there is only one air-gap between the rotor and the stator. The motor was designed for higher rotational speeds, and therefore a good mechanical strength of the solid-rotor-core rotor is required to withstand the mechanical stresses. The construction of the rotor and the high rotational speeds together produce a feature, which is not typical of traditional induction motors: the dominating loss component of the motor is the rotor eddy current loss. In the case of a typical industrial induction motor instead the dominating loss component is the stator copper loss. In this thesis, several methods to decrease the rotor eddy current losses in the case of axial-flux induction motors are presented. A prototype motor with 45 kW output power at 6000 min- 1 was designed and constructed for ascertaining the results obtained from the numerical FEM calculations. In general, this thesis concentrates on the methods for improving the electromagnetic properties of an axial-flux solid-rotor-core induction motor and examines the methods for decreasing the harmonic eddy currents of the rotor. The target is to improve the efficiency of the motor and to reach the efficiency standard of the present-day industrial induction motors equipped with laminated rotors...|$|R
