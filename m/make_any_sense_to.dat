5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that}} he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

Ray Bradbury praised the film's photography, but disliked the banality {{of most of the}} dialogue, and believed that the audience does not care when Poole dies. Both he and Lester del Rey were put off by the film's feeling of sterility and blandness in all the human encounters amidst all the technological wonders, while both praised the pictorial element of the film. Del Rey was especially harsh, describing the film as dull, confusing, and boring, predicting [...] "t will probably be a box-office disaster, too, and thus set major science-fiction movie making back another ten years." [...] However, the film was praised by science-fiction novelist Samuel R. Delany who was impressed by how the film undercuts the audience's normal sense of space and orientation in several ways. Like Bradbury, Delany picked up on the banality of the dialogue (in Delany's phrasing the characters are saying nothing meaningful), but Delany regards this as a dramatic strength, a prelude to the rebirth {{at the conclusion of the}} film. Without analyzing the film in detail, Isaac Asimov spoke well of Space Odyssey in his autobiography, and other essays. The film won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation, an award heavily voted on by science fiction fans and published science-fiction writers. James P.

30|$|North and South are {{essentially}} socio-political and economic entities. Therefore, they {{are increasingly being}} defined by their development status. Horowitz (1996) for example, called the North, “industrialized” and wealthy and the South, “under-developed” (Horowitz 1996, 3). He argued that “there is a marked divergence in economic conditions and standards of living between the industrialized and the less developed countries of the world” (p. 3). Pointing to the divergence within these categories Mickelson (2009) argues that “while {{there have always been}} problems with seeing the Global South as some kind of monolith, it is certainly possible to argue that it no longer <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of ‘the south’ when countries like China, India and Brazil appear to be in a completely different category and therefore, need to be treated in a different way” (p. 418). Defining the North-South divide in terms of economic development has led to the conception that the South is inherently problematic and entails several weaknesses. According to Maggie Black (2007), countries needing development have several shortcomings (Quoted in Weiss 2009, p. 272). Calling North the “well-off” and the South “less well-off” and “poor and malnourished”, Reuveny and Thompson (2007) point out that the North sees several problems in regards to the South. They contend that “there are, of course, all sorts of concerns” but the main issues involve violent conflicts, need for external intervention, nuclear proliferation, migration pressures, infectious disease, environmental degradation, global warming, and over-population (Reuveny and Thompson 2007 : 558). It is imperative to note that the above list is symptomatic of some of the negative stereotype that exists within the North about the South, which is also a part of the dichotomy.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{responses to}} {{supply and demand}} shocks in PIIGS countries. We compare the results obtained for PIIGS with those of Germany and the USA, and also with those of France, which despite its government’s efforts demonstrate relatively poor recent economic performance. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to establish whether it is still reasonable to consider PIIGS as a group apart. Our methodological strategy is based on the Okun Law (OL) which is incorporated in a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model with Blanchard-Quah (BQ) restrictions. We address two drawbacks that usually present in the OL: the interdependency problem and the non-stationarity problem. By using a non-parametric representation of OL, we identify the heterogeneity between countries. We build stable VAR models for each of the economies and use the BQ SVAR impulses to analyse the importance of contemporary and long-run effects of supply and demand shocks. The main conclusion of this paper is that it does not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> today <b>to</b> identify PIIGS as a separate group. Additionally, a country that stands out from our analysis is France. The question can thus be posed that if “PIIGS” signifies “countries with poor economic performances” then should not France also belong to this group...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the discretionary accruals of Brazilian public companies would reveal changes as a result of the big four firm that audits them, and whether the companies served by firms of less importance in the sector would denote different behaviors in comparison to those contracting the largest four. For this purpose was formed a sample with 7, 875 observations originating from 44 quarters from the period of 1998 to 2009, emphasizing the non-inclusion of the other years due to the Brazilian IFRS harmonization. Statistical estimations were carried out based on this sample using the panel data approach. The results showed differences in the discretionary accruals regardless of the size of the audit firm, and also indicated adverse patterns between clients of the four largest firms. Thus it was established that for the Brazilian capital market, simple segregation between big four and others does not appear <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense,</b> contrary <b>to</b> the recommendations of literature. Such benchmarking suggests that future surveys conducted in this jurisdiction, which require the use of the auditor control variable, should do so by means of the inclusion of five groups, one for each large auditing company and one for smaller audit firms...|$|R

We must also consider, however briefly, other domains in which progress of the relevant sort seems to have taken place as well as domains where the notion of progress is more controversial.
