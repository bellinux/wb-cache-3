40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are highly complex {{systems and the}} issues related to their safety are of primary importance. Probabilistic safety {{assessment}} {{is regarded as the}} most widespread methodology for studying the safety of nuclear power plants. As maintenance {{is one of the most}} important factors for affecting the reliability and safety, an enhanced preventive maintenance optimization model based on a three-stage failure process is proposed. Preventive maintenance is still a dominant maintenance policy due to its easy implementation. In order to correspond to the three-color scheme commonly used in practice, the lifetime of system before failure is divided into three stages, namely, normal, <b>minor</b> <b>defective,</b> and severe defective stages. When the <b>minor</b> <b>defective</b> stage is identified, two measures are considered for comparison: one is that halving the inspection interval only when the <b>minor</b> <b>defective</b> stage is identified at the first time; the other one is that if only identifying the <b>minor</b> <b>defective</b> stage, the subsequent inspection interval is halved. Maintenance is implemented immediately once the severe defective stage is identified. Minimizing the expected cost per unit time is our objective function to optimize the inspection interval. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models...|$|E
40|$|Separated {{decision-making}} {{for maintenance}} and spare ordering is unrealistic in the industry, so this paper aims to optimize them together. A joint policy of inspection-based preventive maintenance (PM) and spare ordering considering two modes of spare ordering, namely, a regular order and an emergency order, is proposed for single-unit systems using a three-stage failure process. If {{the system is}} recognized {{to be in the}} <b>minor</b> <b>defective</b> stage, the original inspection interval is shortened and a regular order is placed. However, replacement is undertaken preventively or correctively if the severe defective stage is identified or a failure occurs. Depending on the system state and the state of the regular ordered spare when replacement is needed, all possible scenarios are considered to construct optimization model I. The decision variables are the optimal inspection interval and the times of shortening the original inspection interval. Additionally, model II on the basis of an assumption that the spare is always ordered at time 0 is also developed. The results from a numerical example illustrated the applicability and the effectiveness of model I compared to model II, and the irregular inspection policy is validated to be cost-saving compared to the regular inspection policy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIsolates of the Closterovirus, Citrus {{tristeza}} virus (CTV), are {{populations of}} disparate genotypes and defective RNAs developed during {{long periods of}} vegetative propagation of citrus trees. Because {{it has not been}} possible to obtain pure cultures of the virus, it is not known what components of the population are primarily responsible for induction of diseases. We previously developed an infectious cDNA clone from which in vitro-produced RNA transcripts could infect protoplasts (Satyanarayana et al., 1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 7433 – 7438). However, neither the RNA transcripts nor virions from transcript-infected protoplasts were competent for infection of citrus trees. Using a green fluorescent protein-marked virus as inoculum, we found that the ∼ 20 -kb RNA from virions or transcripts of cDNA infected {{only a small percentage of}} protoplasts (∼ 0. 01 %), but virions could infect more than 80 % of the protoplasts. Based on this information, we amplified the virus from the cDNA clone (recombinant virus) by successive passages in protoplasts using virions in crude sap as inoculum. By the third to seventh passages in protoplasts, maximal amounts of recombinant progeny virus were produced, which were used for inoculation of small citrus trees by slashing stems in the presence of virion preparations. A relatively high percentage of plants became infected with the recombinant virus from protoplasts, resulting in the first defined pure culture of CTV in plants. The comparative biology of the pure culture of recombinant CTV with that of the parental population in planta demonstrated that the recombinant virus retained through all of the recombinant DNA manipulations the normal functions of replication, movement, and aphid transmissibility, and had a symptom phenotype indistinguishable from that of the parental population. Additionally, fulfilling Koch's postulates of the first pure culture of CTV in plants suggested that the major genotype of the CTV T 36 population is the primary determinant of the symptom phenotype. We could distinguish no biological contributions resulting from the <b>minor</b> genotypes and <b>defective</b> RNAs of the parental population...|$|R
