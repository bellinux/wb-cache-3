25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

I think we wanted to deliver a lot, and all at once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, saying that when The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife {{thought it}} best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have heard before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E

However, determining PMI is an intricate process because there is still <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know about C. vicina behavior.

2500|$|In 2009, {{at least}} three stores in Seattle were de-branded to remove the logo and brand name, and remodel the stores as local coffee houses [...] "inspired by Starbucks." [...] CEO Howard Schultz says the unbranded stores are a [...] "laboratory for Starbucks". The first, 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea, opened in July 2009 on Capitol Hill. It served wine and beer and hosted live music and poetry readings. It has since been remodeled and reopened as a Starbucks-branded store. Another is Roy Street Coffee and Tea at 700 Broadway E., also on Capitol Hill. Although the stores have been called [...] "stealth Starbucks" [...] and criticized as [...] "local-washing", Schultz says that [...] "It wasn't so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were trying to hide the brand, but trying to do things in those stores {{that we did not}} feel were {{appropriate}} for Starbucks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The science {{revolution}} {{attributed to}} Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered {{a warning to}} the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the sophists, by dramatizing {{a situation in which}} humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, {{the fact that they have}} been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension. Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares [...] "that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random. There is so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot know and cannot control that we should not think and behave as if we do know and can control.|$|E
2500|$|The late philosopher George Molnar (1934–1999) {{published}} {{only four}} philosophical papers on metaphysics in his career, but his {{importance in the}} field should not be underestimated. [...] After {{a return to the}} field, following a self-imposed absence, he was working on a book ("") and continued up until his sudden and untimely death in August 1999. [...] The book remained unfinished until Mumford, who had previously been in contact with Molnar, in the summer of 1999, with the intention of giving feedback on the work (nearing completion), was approached to edit the remaining manuscript into a completed book. [...] Mumford, along with several other figures in the field of metaphysics, including David Armstrong, were involved collaboratively in providing insight on Molnar's work, and as a person, but the editing was left to Mumford, as was the writing of an introductory chapter to correctly present and establish the material laid out - something which Molnar did not get round to doing before his death. [...] Armstrong states, [...] "We can be very grateful to Stephen Mumford for making a volume from the <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have. [...] His excellent introduction serves in place of the introductory chapter that was left unwritten". [...] Mumford had discussed Molnar at a conference on Australian metaphysics, held in Grenoble (9–13 December 1999), but the [...] - organised by Jean-Maurice Monnoyer, entitled [...] "The Structure of the World: Objects, Properties and States of Affairs" [...] - was to be the first official meeting of Mumford and Molnar as well. [...] Mumford had considered this {{to be the end of}} the matter, but, in the spring of 2000, Mumford was contacted again concerning [...] "". [...] This time, however, it was through mutual friend Tony Skillen (lecturer in philosophy at the University of Kent) on behalf of Molnar's former partner Carlotta McIntosh, who had given access to the manuscript and who shared it with Mumford. [...] Although the book was, in places, complete and filled with promise, there was much work to be done on the later chapters - Mumford reflects on a conversation between himself and Armstrong on the way to the Grenoble colloquium, mentioning Molnar's email stating the work was near finished, Armstrong replied: [...] "it was near finished, in his mind". [...] The main theory of powers survives, and with Mumford's help and editorial contribution is readily accessible.|$|E
