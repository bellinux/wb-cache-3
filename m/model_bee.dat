40|$|Abstract. Honeybees {{coordinate}} foraging efforts across vast areas {{through a}} complex system of advertising and recruitment. One mechanism for coordination is the waggle dance, a movement pattern which carries positional information about food sources. However, recent {{evidence suggests that}} recruited foragers may not use the dance’s positional information {{to the degree that}} has traditionally been believed. We <b>model</b> <b>bee</b> colony foraging to investigate the value of sharing food source position information in different environments. We find that in several environments, relying solely on private information about previously encountered food sources is more efficient than sharing information. Relying on private information leads to a greater diversity of forage sites and can decrease over-harvesting of sources. This is beneficial in environments with small quantities of nectar per flower, but may be detrimental in nectar-rich environments. Efficiency depends on both the environment and a balance between exploiting high-quality food sources and oversubscribing them. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is a complete}} case study of transdisciplinary research. The goals were to engage farmers in exploring landscape patterns for perennial agriculture and to assess resulting environmental impacts. Transdisciplinary research involves participants from several academic disciplines and nonacademic stakeholders, who work together toward a single research goal relevant to a societal problem. Participation in transdisciplinary research can be enhanced {{through the use of}} boundary objects, which are conceptual tools that promote cooperation without requiring consensus and that allow meaningful discussion of complex issues. When research explores landscape change, landscapes or landscape representations may be used as boundary objects. Working with farmers in an Illinois watershed, I developed future landscape patterns (FLPs) that include perennial bioenergy crops (PBC) within the corn/soy agricultural matrix to develop societally acceptable PBC farming systems. My results suggest that employing real places, landscape visualizations, and spatially explicit datasets as landscape boundary objects is an effective means of involving stakeholders. Next, I used a spatially explicit <b>model</b> of <b>bee</b> abundance to explore effects on wild bee habitat of the FLP’s crop composition, total PBC area, and landscape configuration. I found that more PBC area enhanced bee habitat. Prairie provided the greatest <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance, followed by switchgrass and then by willow. Landscape configuration altered the proportion of PBC within a given distance from a specific location in the landscape, but did not affect overall <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance {{at the level of the}} watershed. Next, I developed additional FLPs that represent spatial patterns associated with temperate agroforestry: willow/prairie alley cropping and entire-field management. I found that alley crop composition significantly influenced <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance. Specifically, prairie provided the greatest <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance, followed by alley cropping, and then by willow. Entire-field management did not affect overall <b>modeled</b> <b>bee</b> abundance, but did affect distribution of habitat. My results suggest that simply incorporating PBC into the corn/soy agricultural system will enhance wild bee habitat, but that crop composition, area converted to PBC, and agroforestry strategies could further enhance wild bee habitat in agricultural landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Expression {{profile of}} a Laccase 2 {{encoding}} gene during the metamorphic molt in Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera, Apidae). Metamorphosis in holometabolous insects occurs through two subsequent molting cycles: pupation (metamorphic molt) and adult differentiation (imaginal molt). The imaginal molt in Apis mellifera L. was recently investigated in both histological and physiological-molecular approaches. Although the metamorphic molt in this <b>model</b> <b>bee</b> is extremely important to development, it is not well-known yet. In the current study we used this stage as an ontogenetic scenario to investigate the transcriptional profile of the gene Amlac 2, which encodes a laccase with {{an essential role in}} cuticle differentiation. Amlac 2 expression in epidermis was contrasted with the hemolymph titer of ecdysteroid hormones and with the most evident morphological events occurring during cuticle renewal. RT-PCR semiquantitative analyses using integument samples revealed increased levels of Amlac 2 transcripts right after apolysis and during the subsequent pharate period, and declining levels near pupal ecdysis. Compared with the expression of a cuticle protein gene, AmelCPR 14, these results highlighted the importance of the ecdysteroid-induced apolysis as an ontogenetic marker of gene reactivation in epidermis for cuticle renewal. The obtained results strengthen the comprehension of metamorphosis in Apis mellifera. In addition, we reviewed the literature about the development of A. mellifera, and emphasize the importance of revising the terminology used to describe honey bee molting cycles...|$|E
40|$|Nature {{conservation}} and income generation Cue: In the North West province of Cameroon, beekeeping and honey production have, {{in the last}} 20 years, become {{a major source of}} income for the rural poor. Honey from the province is exported to Nigeria and Chad, as well as being sold in towns, cities and villages in Cameroon. Much of this success has come from the work of ANCO, the Apiculture and Natural Conservation Organisation, a local NGO which was established in the area in 1992. For fifteen years it has been training farmers in the production of beehives and other beekeeping equipment, and in beekeeping skills. It has also been working as a marketing organisation for the honey that is produced. Yet despite that success, beekeeping has still not been included in Cameroon?s poverty reduction strategy, which frustrates ANCO?s founder and director, Paul Mzeka. Martha Chindong visited Paul recently at one of ANCO?s training venues, a bee farm, and found out that beekeeping has not only brought financial benefits to the province, but has also helped to protect the environment. But Martha began by pointing out that in fact, harvesting honey from the wild had been practised in the area for hundreds of years ? so why the need to introduce new methods? IN:		?Beekeeping is a very old occupation ?? OUT:		??Thank you for coming. I?m very happy. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 02 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Paul Mzeka, founder of ANCO, an organisation working in the North West province of Cameroon, to promote beekeeping and protection of the environment. He was speaking to Martha Chindong, and the interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mzeka	Beekeeping is a very old occupation in the North West and people do not only harvest from the wild. They keep bees but they keep bees in round hives. Medino did a study in 1987 and found that 30 % of bush fires in the province were caused by bee farmers. Now the reason why this happened was that farmers used naked fire. When they are taking the naked fire to the bush sometimes they accidentally cause a bush fire. When they light to harvest their honey sometimes they set the hive on fire and then start a bush fire. Now what can be done? We have found that the newly introduced type of hive called a Kenya Top-Bar was very suitable for the rural world and also there was need to educate them, to wear a bee suit and to use what is called a smoker. That small device called a smoker, which is now used even by traditional beekeepers who do not agree to our approach but they all accept the use of the smoker which makes them harvest their honey without killing any bees, without being a threat to the environment. It is all spread all over the province now and I think that if another study were to be carried out now it would be discovered that there are very few bush fires arising from honey harvesting. Chindong	Is preventing bush fire the only environmental benefit of ANCO? Mzeka	No, the other environmental benefit {{is the fact that the}} bee family is not reduced by using direct naked fire. Because when you use it, a study done in some country in West Africa showed that harvesting from one hive, between two and three thousand bees are killed. So if you go at that rate you are destroying the very thing that is giving you honey. So one advantage is that farmers do not kill bees and therefore the bee population is increasing, pollination is increasing. The second one is the fact that they have become aware of the link between the honey they have in their hives and the environment, the trees that they have around. So they are now participating in planting trees and many of them are now marketing seedlings, which is an added advantage. They are spreading the idea of environmental protection themselves by selling seedlings. Chindong	We are sitting in a very cool environment with bee hives planted here and there. Are these trees planted here because of these bee hives? Is that what you teach the people? Mzeka	Yes, what you see here, there are eighteen hives and they all have bees. This is what we call a <b>model</b> <b>bee</b> farm. When we bring people to train, we talk about ideas but then we must show in practice what it is that we want them to do. We bring them here and say this farm has these trees because the hives are there. In the dry season the trees give shade to the hives and then the trees also give nectar which the bees need for the honey. So you need also in your farm never to have an exposed farm. The trees do a lot of work for your hives. The temperature of the hive should not be rising and falling, it should always be moderate and the trees will provide that condition. So the trees are here. You see the mango, you see the plum, you see the banana, you see the plantains; all these trees are planted to serve the hive. And then they do protect the environment. Chindong	Let me ask you a very practical question. You say you have eighteen hives here. Is there already honey inside, and when are you going to harvest? Mzeka	There is honey inside, and we are going to harvest towards the end of this month. This is the harvesting season. Chindong	And honey harvested from here can be what quantity? Mzeka	From these eighteen hives we usually harvest and sell, in a good year we sell for 150, 000 CFA. Chindong	Just from these eighteen hives? That is wonderful. Mzeka	Yes from these eighteen hives. And look at the land that is devoted to the hives. A very small piece. That is what we are saying, that government, the eye of those who are taking decisions should be opened to the realities of our rural world. There is this eucalyptus which people can cut down and make plank hives; there is bamboo which they can cut down and make hives. So let us just help them by bringing training to them, and they will carry the other activities without any help. Chindong	Thank you for making yourself available to us. Mzeka	Thank you for coming. I?m very happy. End of track. In North West Cameroon, improved methods of beekeeping are helping to protect forests and generate income...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) are {{attracted}} to those particular inflorescences where other bees are already foraging, {{a process known as}} local enhancement. Here, we use a quantitative analysis of learning in a foraging task to illustrate that this attraction can lead bees to learn more quickly which flower species are rewarding if they forage in the company of experienced conspecifics. This effect can also be elicited by <b>model</b> <b>bees,</b> rather than live demon-strators. We also show that local enhancement in bumble-bees most likely reflects a general attraction to conspecifics that is not limited to a foraging context. Based on the widespread occurrence of both local enhancement and associative learning in the invertebrates, we suggest that social influences on learning in this group may be more common than the current literature would suggest and that invertebrates may provide a useful model for understanding how learning processes based on social information evolve...|$|R

In the hemi-parkinsonian 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion <b>model,</b> subchronic <b>bee</b> venom treatment significantly alleviates contralateral forelimb akinesia and apomorphine-induced rotations. Moreover, a single injection of bee venom reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy, a pharmacological model reminiscent of parkinsonian akinetic deficit. This effect is mimicked by apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) channels, and blocked by CyPPA, a positive modulator of these channels, suggesting the involvement of SK channels in the bee venom antiparkinsonian action. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (basal ganglia output structure) showed no significant effect of BV on the mean neuronal discharge frequency or pathological bursting activity. In contrast, analyses of the neuronal responses evoked by motor cortex stimulation show that bee venom reverses the 6 -OHDA- and neuroleptic-induced biases in the influence exerted by the direct inhibitory and indirect excitatory striatonigral circuits. These data provide the first evidence for a beneficial action of bee venom on the pathological functioning of the cortico-basal ganglia circuits underlying motor PD symptoms with potential relevance to the symptomatic treatment of this disease...|$|R
