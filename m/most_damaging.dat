5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> {{hurricane}} (adjusted for inflation) was Hurricane Katrina of the 2005 season {{which caused}} $108billion in damages (2005 USD).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina, {{one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> natural {{disasters}} in U.S. history, struck early in Bush's second term. Katrina formed in late August during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Agnes of the 1972 {{season was}} the deadliest storm, killing 19people {{as a result}} of heavy flooding. The <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storm was Hurricane Irene, which {{resulted}} in $151 million in damage. Hurricane Hazel caused sustained hurricane-force winds (winds of 75mph (121km/h) or greater) in the state, the only storm during the time period to do so. No storms made landfall in Maryland at hurricane intensity. Since 1950, twelve tropical cyclones have collectively killed 61people.|$|E
5|$|Ned Flanders - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak {{character}} with very strong special attacks. His prayer attack is the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> {{in the game}} as it causes high damage, stuns instantly and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.|$|E
5|$|Percy {{was also}} the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> of the February {{cyclones}} as it battered the Cook Islands, which were still recovering from the impacts of Cyclones Meena, Nancy and Olaf. Percy then devastated the island of Tokelau, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings {{in anticipation of the}} storm, there were no deaths and {{there were only a few}} injuries.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{each trial}} {{included}} the text, “Your {{task is to}} decide which oil rig will receive the <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> from the hurricane.” Following the instructions, participants checked a box indicating which oil rig they believed would receive the <b>most</b> <b>damage.</b> The trials were presented in a different random order for each participant. Finally, participants answered demographic questions and questions related to hurricane experience.|$|R

5|$|The storm {{affected}} {{the town of}} Norfolk, where it became the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storm since 1879. Despite the damage inland, the storm {{is best known for}} the unusually high number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused. One ship, a schooner called the Manantico, capsized, killing the captain and one of its crew members. Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry, and numerous others were put in danger.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> tornado of the {{outbreak}} sequence occurred in Greensburg on the 4th, twenty-five tornadoes were confirmed that day. That number exploded to 84 {{the following day}} (May 5th), with many tornadoes near the affected area from the previous night. Most were in open country, but there were injuries {{in at least two}} spots in Kansas, and one death reported near a county lake in Ottawa County. 14 more tornadoes were confirmed on May 6th in the region before {{the outbreak}} finally ended.|$|E
5|$|Dennis claimed {{at least}} 88 lives: 56 in Haiti, 16 in Cuba, 15 in the U.S. and 1 in Jamaica. Total damages are {{estimated}} at US$4–6billion, including $2.23billion in the United States {{and the rest}} in the Caribbean. Dennis was <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> to Cuba, where the storm wiped out {{a significant portion of}} the citrus crop. As the storm struck near the end of Cuba's dry season, farmers were not yet prepared for the heavy rainfall brought by the storm. In the United States, Dennis drew comparison with Hurricane Ivan of the previous year, but it was both smaller and weaker than Ivan at landfall and caused significantly fewer damages, partly because the region had not yet fully rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|During {{the season}} at least 16 {{people were killed}} from {{tropical}} disturbances whilst overall damage was estimated at $ (2004USD; $ USD). The <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> tropical disturbance was Cyclone Heta which caused at least $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage to six different countries and left three dead. The deadliest tropical disturbance of the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage. Cyclone Ivy also caused 2 deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) worth of damage to Vanuatu. As {{a result of the}} impacts caused by Heta and Ivy, the names were retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.|$|E
5|$|Nationwide, Iris {{damaged or}} {{destroyed}} 3,718homes, directly affecting a total of 21,568people, or 8.5% of the total population. The storm {{damaged or destroyed}} 31schools and 17health facilities, along with 21government buildings. There was about $25million in damage to the transportation sector, including highways and bridges. Iris killed 24people {{in and around the}} country, including the victims of the Wave Dancer shipwreck. Overall damage was estimated at $250million, making it the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storm in the country since Hurricane Hattie in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gene was {{the deadliest}} storm {{as well as}} the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season east of 160ºE. RSMC Nadi monitored Gene as the 12th tropical disturbance, {{as well as the}} fourth tropical cyclone and the third severe tropical cyclone to form west of 160ºE during the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. Gene was also recognised by RSMC Nadi as the fifth tropical cyclone and fourth severe tropical cyclone to form within the South Pacific Ocean during the 2007-08 season.|$|E

5|$|The 1956 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured a {{low number of}} tropical cyclones, although every tropical storm and hurricane affected land. There were twelvetropical storms, a third of which became hurricanes. One of the hurricanes strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} major hurricane, which is a Category3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betsy, which was also the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storm of the season: it destroyed 15,000houses and left $40million in damage in Puerto Rico. Betsy was also the deadliest of the season, having killed 18people in the French West Indies, twofrom a shipwreck in the Caribbean Sea, and 16in Puerto Rico. Tropical Storm Dora struck Mexico in September and killed 27people.|$|E
5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly the <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C., {{were among the}} <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> from a {{tropical}} cyclone in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, United States. Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6, 2003, in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters, it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the season, a {{shift in}} the Hadley Circulation towards the Tasman Sea {{resulted}} in more frequent episodes of strong wind shear and regular pulses of dry air into the deep tropics, significantly hindering tropical cyclogenesis. The below-average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms. Only two systems, Trina and Waka, had significant effects on land. The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was {{regarded as one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> storms in the history of Tonga. Approximately $51.3million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality, the only tropical cyclone-related death of the year, due to cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic storms are {{becoming}} more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs. The <b>most</b> <b>damaging</b> single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157billion of normalized damage.|$|E

25|$|Nui {{suffered}} the <b>most</b> <b>damage</b> {{of the three}} central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu); with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops. Of the three northern islands (Nanumanga, Niutao, Nanumea), Nanumanga {{suffered the}} <b>most</b> <b>damage,</b> with 60–100 houses flooded and damage to the health facility. Vasafua islet, part of the Funafuti Conservation Area, was severely damaged by Cyclone Pam. The coconut palms were washed away, leaving the islet as a sand bar.|$|R
