25|$|The {{development}} of the HSR network in China was initially delayed by a debate over the type of track technology to be used. In June 1998, at a State Council meeting with the Chinese Academies of Sciences and Engineering, Premier Zhu Rongji asked whether the high-speed railway between Beijing and Shanghai still being planned could use maglev technology. At the time, planners were divided between using high-speed trains with wheels that run on conventional standard gauge tracks or <b>magnetic</b> <b>levitation</b> trains that run on special maglev tracks for a new national high-speed rail network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Magnetic Servo Levitation (MSL) is an {{important}} ac-tuation principle with potential applications ranging from ultra-high-precision positioning to high-speed rail systems. This paper describes a nonlinear controller design technique for MSL that has inherent robustness to both parametric uncertainties and un-modeled dynamics. Most of the currently available literature on sliding mode considers nonlinear systems that are linear (affine) in the input action. The proposed technique allows designing sliding-mode controllers for the family of nonaffine problems that have an input nonlinearity algebraically invertible {{with respect to the}} available control action. This differs from the standard approach of input feedback linearization, and is based on a modified sliding condition {{that can be used to}} synthesize a switching control law. An equivalent control term can also be included, substantially en-hancing the performance of the controller. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can achieve excellent tracking at high speeds in a fast-tool servo system actuated by MSL. Index Terms—Equivalent control, fast-tool servo system, input feedback linearization, <b>magnetic</b> servo <b>levitation,</b> nonaffine non-linear systems, sliding-mode control. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} problem {{solution}} affecting {{the magnetic field}} of permanent magnets by change of their position. This article proves the possibility of magnetic field influence on individual construction parts of a positioning mechanism. The {{first part of the}} article deals with the problem of <b>magnetic</b> surface <b>levitation</b> of diamagnetic object and with the description of principle of mechatronic positioning mechanism. Specifically, functions of individual construction parts in term of mechanics are described. Positioning levitating mechanism uses for magnetic field generation the matrix NdFeB 32, which is the matrix of permanent magnets arranged in a particular configuration. Linear actuators working on piezoelectric principle were chosen for magnets positioning. The next part of this article deals with numerical solution of magnetic field using calculation software FEMM, for five different configuration positions of permanent magnets. Using the postprocessor mechanism, outputs, for magnetic induction, for lines of force and for vector fields of each position, are subsequently created. In almost the last part the calculation of energies and forces acting in direction of magnetic field axes X and Y is done. The conclusion involves a summary of the possible influence of magnetic field by the change of magnets position and its subsequent influence on the levitating pyrolitic graphite, which is represented by the diamagnetic object...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an e&# 64256;ort to develop {{closed-loop}} control strategies on computer networks and study their {{stability in the}} presence of network delays and packet losses. An algorithm using predictors was designed to ensure the system stability in presence of network delays and packet losses. A single actuator <b>magnetic</b> ball <b>levitation</b> system was used as a test bed to validate the proposed algorithm. A brief study of real-time requirements of the networked control system is presented and a client-server architecture is developed using real-time operating environment to implement the proposed algorithm. Real-time performance of the communication on Ethernet based on user datagram protocol (UDP) was explored and UDP is presented as a suitable protocol for networked control systems. Predictors were designed based on parametric estimation models. Autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models of various orders were designed using MATLAB and an eighth order AR model was adopted based on the best-&# 64257;t criterion. The system output was predicted several steps ahead using these predictors and control output was calculated using the predictions. This control output output was used in the events of excessive network delays to maintain system stability. Experiments employing simulations of consecutive packet losses and network delays were performed to validate the satisfactory performance of the predictor based algorithm. The current system compensates for up to 20 percent data losses in the network without loosing stability...|$|R

30|$|Maglev {{technology}} is a potential solution for future traffic and ecological challenges because the main advantages of maglev technology are obvious: short trip times due to its high speed and/or high acceleration; {{a high level of}} safety and comfort due to its <b>magnetic</b> guidance and <b>levitation</b> systems; low operating costs due to the low maintenance effort required (as it is contactless) and high efficiency; flexible alignment due to the high gradients because {{there is no need for}} a functional grip between the wheel and the rail; and its eco-friendliness due to its high-efficiency, emission-free system, flexible alignment, low noise, and independence from energy modes [9]. Maglev developers claim that their system can achieve higher speeds and lower energy consumption and life-cycle costs and can take more passengers, while producing less noise and vibration than high-speed rail [10]. Therefore, Maglev transportation has the potential to be more efficient and affordable than alternative technologies for many transportation applications [11].|$|R
