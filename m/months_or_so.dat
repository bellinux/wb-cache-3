Over the next eighteen <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> Thomas stayed in various Al Qaeda safe houses, and is alleged to have made contact with several Al Qaeda officials.|$|E

25|$|Pinto {{described}} his childhood as spartan. In 1521, hoping {{to improve the}} boy's prospects, an uncle took him to Lisbon. There, Pinto was employed in the household service of a noblewoman. After eighteen <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> Pinto fled. At the docks, he {{was hired as a}} ship's boy on a cargo vessel bound for Setúbal. On the way, French pirates captured the ship and the passengers were set upon the shore at Alentejo.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{originally}} {{planned for the}} fourth book to be called A Dance with Dragons with the story picking up {{five years after the}} events of A Storm of Swords (primarily to advance the ages of the younger characters). However, during the writing process it was discovered that this was leading to an overreliance on flashbacks to fill in the gap. After twelve <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of working on the book, Martin decided to abandon much of what had previously been written and start again, this time picking up immediately after the end of A Storm of Swords. He announced this decision, along with the new title A Feast for Crows, at Worldcon in Philadelphia on September 1, 2001. He also announced that A Dance with Dragons would now be the fifth book in the sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenges}} of the global food crisis followed by {{challenges of}} the global financial crisis made room for more integrated policy reforms. Considering the massive economic measures {{that have been taken}} over the past 12 <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> Egyptian economic policymakers score high based on the inside lag, i.e. the lapse of time between the moment that the shock began to affect the economy and the moment that economic (monetary and fiscal) policy as well as the regulatory policy are altered and put into effect in response to the shock to various markets: goods market (real GDP), the labor market (unemployment rate), money market (interest rate and inflation), and the financial (stock and bond) market. Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven—at least partially—by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell. There were falls in stock and bond market prices, and rises in nominal interest rates.|$|E

500|$|Newly hatched chicks {{are active}} and {{can leave the}} nest {{within a few days}} of hatching. They stand about [...] tall at first, weigh , and have {{distinctive}} brown and cream stripes for camouflage, which fade after three <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The male guards the growing chicks for up to seven months, teaching them how to find food. Chicks grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six months; they may remain with their family group for another six <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before they split up to breed in their second season. During their early life, the young emus are defended by their father, who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emus, including the mother. He does this by ruffling his feathers, emitting sharp grunts, and kicking his legs to drive off other animals. He can also bend his knees to crouch over smaller chicks to protect them. At night, he envelops his young with his feathers. As the young emus cannot travel far, the parents must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed. In captivity, emus can live for upwards of ten years.|$|E

[...] During [...] "The Reporter," [...] Parks and Recreation editor Dean Holland {{developed}} an editing technique that would be used {{throughout the rest of the}} series. During the scene in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the reporter, Amy Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which were not going to be used. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage inter-cutting several of the lines into the same scene.|$|E
500|$|The Lunars speak a {{language}} consisting [...] "not {{so much of}} words and letters as tunes and strange sounds", which Gonsales succeeds in gaining some fluency in {{after a couple of}} months. Six <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after his arrival Gonsales becomes concerned about the condition of his gansas, three of whom have died. Fearing that he may never be able to return to Earth and see his children again if he delays further, he decides to take leave of his hosts, carrying with him a gift of precious stones from the supreme monarch of the Moon, Irdonozur. The stones are of three different sorts: Poleastis, which can store and generate great quantities of heat; Macbrus, which generates great quantities of light; and Ebelus, which when one side of the stone is clasped to the skin renders a man weightless, or half as heavy again if the other side is touched.|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension.

500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> He then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more people, I know so much more about the world, and I'm so much more relaxed than I was three or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E
500|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with stage II thymoma in the Season 8 episode [...] "Body and Soul". In {{the end of the}} subsequent episode (in which Wilson and House take an abrupt vacation, and Wilson assumes a much more carefree personality), House performed a CT scan to check the status of the cancer. House's stunned facial expression and silence when the results are displayed seemingly does not bode well for Wilson's future prognosis, which would be revealed in the final two episodes of the series. It is later revealed that Wilson, should he pursue the most extensive treatment, could live for one to three years, perhaps. He opts to cease the intensive chemotherapy treatment after the ultimately unsuccessful first round, choosing {{to make the most of}} the remaining five <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> he would likely have for as long as possible; ultimately, after many tense conversations, House accepts his decision. However, due to the serious vandalism House caused in the toilet system and plumbing, which ultimately destroyed a room containing an MRI scanner (where some of his team members were with a patient), Foreman and the hospital lawyer notify House that the matter became externally known to the police; subsequently, his parole officer had his parole revoked by the court. House must report to prison again to serve the remaining six months of his approximately year-long sentence he got earlier, in the last season, when he ran his car into Cuddy's house. In the series finale, at House's funeral, Wilson gives an honest description of House as opposed to everyone's kind words and gets a text message telling him to [...] "Shut up, you idiot." ...|$|E

Although Zbyszko was billed as the World Heavyweight Champion, he had lost the title to Joe Stecher the previous year. According to one account by the New Zealand Railways Magazine, one of their matches lasted for several hours before ending in a time limit draw which had [...] "gone on for many weary hours and when midnight Saturday chimed and Sunday commenced the match had to cease". Zbyszko later praised Robin's wrestling abilities claiming that few wrestlers could equal Robin for strength and that [...] "with proper training for two <b>months</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> he would be a world-beater".|$|E
