5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern <b>microporous</b> paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>microporous</b> {{material}} where physisorption {{and weak}} van der Waals forces dominate adsorption, the storage density is greatly {{dependent on the}} size of the pores. Calculations of idealized homogeneous materials, such as graphitic carbons and carbon nanotubes, predict that a <b>microporous</b> material with 7Å-wide pores will exhibit maximum hydrogen uptake at room temperature. At this width, exactly two layers of hydrogen molecules adsorb on opposing surfaces with no space left in between.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} {{have developed a}} Fe/N/C catalyst derived from iron (II) acetate (FeAc), phenanthroline (Phen), and a metal-organic-framework (MOF) host. The MOF is a Zn(II) zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) called ZIF-8, which demonstrates a high <b>microporous</b> surface area and high nitrogen content conducive to ORR activity. The power density of the FeAc/Phen/ZIF-8-catalyst {{was found to be}} 0.75 W cm−2 at 0.6 V. This value is a significant improvement over the maximal 0.37 W cm−2 power density of previous M/N/C-catalysts and is much closer to matching the typical value of 1-1.2 W cm−2 for Pt-based catalysts with a Pt loading of 0.3mg cm−2. The catalyst also demonstrated a volumetric activity of 230 A cm−3, the highest value for non-PGM catalysts to date, approaching the U.S. Department of Energy milestone.|$|E
25|$|Fine ground calcium {{carbonate}} (GCC) {{is an essential}} ingredient in the <b>microporous</b> film used in diapers and some building films as the pores are nucleated around the {{calcium carbonate}} particles during the manufacture of the film by biaxial stretching. GCC or PCC {{is used as a}} filler in paper because they are cheaper than wood fiber. In terms of market volume, GCC are the most important types of fillers currently used. Printing and writing paper can contain 10–20% calcium carbonate. In North America, calcium carbonate has begun to replace kaolin in the production of glossy paper. Europe has been practicing this as alkaline papermaking or acid-free papermaking for some decades. PCC used for paper filling and paper coatings is precipitated and prepared in a variety of shapes and sizes having characteristic narrow particle size distributions and equivalent spherical diameters of 0.4 to 3 micrometres.|$|E

2500|$|Zeolites are <b>microporous,</b> {{aluminosilicate}} minerals {{commonly used}} as commercial adsorbents and catalysts. The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that rapidly heating the material, {{believed to have}} been stilbite, produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material. Based on this, he called the material zeolite, from the Greek , meaning [...] "to boil" [...] and , meaning [...] "stone". The classic reference for the field has been Zeolite molecular sieves: structure, chemistry, and use by Donald W. Breck.|$|E
2500|$|Conjugated <b>microporous</b> {{polymers}} (CMPs) are a sub-class of {{porous materials}} {{that are related to}} structures such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks, but are amorphous in nature, rather than crystalline. CMPs are also a sub-class of conjugated polymers and possess many of the same properties such as conductivity, mechanical rigidity, and insolubility. [...] CMPs are created through the linking of building blocks in a π-conjugated fashion and possess 3-D networks. Conjugation extends through the system of CMPs and lends conductive properties to CMPs. Building blocks of CMPs are attractive in that the blocks possess broad diversity in the π units that can be used and allow for tuning and optimization of the skeleton and subsequently the properties of CMPs. [...] Most building blocks have rigid components such as alkynes that cause the microporosity. CMPs have applications in gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis, light emitting, light harvesting, and electric energy storage.|$|E
2500|$|MOFs have {{potential}} as heterogeneous catalysts, although applications {{have not been}} commercialized. [...] Their high surface area, tunable porosity, diversity in metal and functional groups make them especially attractive for use as catalysts. Zeolites are extraordinarily useful in catalysis. Zeolites are limited by the fixed tetrahedral coordination of the Si/Al connecting points and the two-coordinated oxide linkers. [...] Fewer than 200 zeolites are known. [...] In contrast with this limited scope, MOFs exhibit more diverse coordination geometries, polytopic linkers, and ancillary ligands (F−, OH−, H2O among others). It is also difficult to obtain zeolites with pore sizes larger than 1nm, which limits the catalytic applications of zeolites to relatively small organic molecules (typically no larger than xylenes). Furthermore, mild synthetic conditions typically employed for MOF synthesis allow direct incorporation of delicate functionalities into the framework structures. Such a process {{would not be possible}} with zeolites or other <b>microporous</b> crystalline oxide-based materials because of the harsh conditions typically used for their synthesis (e.g., calcination at high temperatures to remove organic templates).|$|E
2500|$|Zeolites are the {{aluminosilicate}} {{members of}} the family of <b>microporous</b> solids known as [...] "molecular sieves" [...] mainly consisting of Si, Al, O, and metals including Ti, Sn, Zn, and so on. The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of a zeolite is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term [...] "8-ring" [...] refers to a closed loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and 8 oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of effects, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure, or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.|$|E
