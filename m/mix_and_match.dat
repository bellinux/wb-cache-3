5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> <b>match</b> old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E

5000|$|Intercultural theater, {{also known}} as {{cross-cultural}} theatre, may transcend time, while <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> cultures or subcultures. <b>Mixing</b> <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> is the unavoidable process {{in the making of}} inner connections and the presentations of inter-culturalities.

500|$|Romanek {{described}} {{working with}} child actors and [...] "knowing {{that the first}} act of the film {{was going to have}} to be carried by 12-year-olds" [...] as probably the most difficult aspect of making the film. He said that most of the rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would be good. At rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> <b>match</b> the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy). He also had them spend time together doing things like playing and talking. He took them to the school location and let them play games together so they could get a better idea of the layout of the place.|$|E
500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences {{of the best}} episodes of Buffy after the series ended. Although Salon.com writer Stephanie Zacharek states [...] "(t)he songs were only half-memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show's regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great", she also asserts that it works [...] "beautifully", paces itself gracefully, and is [...] "clever and affecting". Zacharek's unenthusiastic assessments {{of the music and}} cast's singing abilities were not shared by other writers. Debi Enker in Australia's The Age writes, [...] "Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Tara (Amber Benson) are terrific, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) struggle valiantly, and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) barely sings a note". Tony Johnston in The Sunday Herald Sun writes that Gellar [...] "struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters' Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency The rest of the cast <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> <b>match</b> like ready-made Broadway troupers." [...] Johnston counts [...] "I'll Never Tell" [...] as one of the episode's [...] "standout moments". Connie Ogle in The Miami Herald calls the songs [...] "better and far more clever than most of the ones you'll hear on Broadway these days".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there are}} a large variety of models {{available}} in the Diamond range, many are 'mixed and matched' parts from different Schecter guitars. For example, all [...] "Omen", [...] "C", [...] "Hellraiser" [...] and [...] "Damien" [...] basses have the same body shape, although some have set necks rather than bolt on necks, different finish colors, and different woods. However, Schecter produces many different guitars from {{a smaller number of}} core parts. This <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> <b>match</b> culture has the benefit of allowing guitarists to find a Schecter to fit their exact requirements, but negatively gives less of a 'core product' range as shown by Gibson Guitars who only have a small range of guitars available.|$|E
2500|$|Warzone, {{the title}} of the online {{multiplayer}} component of Killzone 2 has been developed by Guerrilla Games in conjunction with the game's single-player campaign. The online multiplayer gameplay is class-based, meaning the player can choose a class of character which is specialized for a specific role to better suit the player's needs in battle. There are 7 classes in total, in which the player can <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> <b>match</b> a main and sub ability according to their playing style, and can switch abilities upon death. There are 15 weapons available to the player, most of which cannot be used until the player reaches a certain rank. Two of these weapons are secondary firearms, and a further two weapons, the Boltgun and Flamethrower, are exclusive to the downloadable maps [...] "Suljeva Cliffside" [...] and [...] "Arctower Landing".|$|E
2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers to <b>mix</b> <b>and</b> <b>match</b> them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. I wanted something with more flair and elegance. I remember looking at a lot of old Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E
