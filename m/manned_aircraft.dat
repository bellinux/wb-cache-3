5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam catapult. The catapult {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to with unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> were made by the British and the Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the argument over the need for <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft,</b> additional political machinations {{had the effect of}} complicating the project. In September 1957 the Ministry of Supply informed the heads of the aviation companies that the only acceptable proposals would be those issued from teams consisting of more than one company. There were a large number of competing aircraft manufacturing companies in the UK while orders were decreasing, thus the government intended to foster cooperation between certain companies and encourage mergers.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier's {{design was}} derived from the Hawker P.1127. Prior to {{developing}} the P.1127 Hawker Aircraft had been working on a replacement for the Hawker Hunter, the Hawker P.1121. The P.1121 was cancelled after the release of the British Government's 1957 Defence White Paper, which advocated a policy shift away from <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> and towards missiles. This policy resulted in the termination of the majority of aircraft development projects then underway for the British military. Hawker sought to quickly move on to a new project and became interested in Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which did not need runways. According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine this interest may have been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force.|$|E

40|$|Demand and {{interest}} in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for civilian applications, and advances in technology such as development of sense-and-avoid systems, will soon allow UAS to be flown alongside <b>manned</b> <b>aircrafts</b> in non-segregated airspace. An area that can benefit from the application of UAS is the bushfire services sector. Currently such services rely on watchtowers, fixed-wing <b>manned</b> <b>aircrafts</b> and satellite data for reliable information. UAS are a promising alternative to traditional methods of collecting bushfire data. There are several varieties of UAS and each category has certain limitations, hence a combination of multiple UAS with features appropriate for bushfire emergencies can be used simultaneously for collecting valuable data. This paper will describe the general UAS categories, some characteristics of Australian bushfires, and speculate on how a combination of several UAS operating in different airspaces can be of benefit for bushfire response personnel and firefighters...|$|R

25|$|If the Avro 730 had {{proceeded}} into service, {{it would}} have replaced the V bombers as the primary airborne platform {{as a part of}} Britain's nuclear deterrent. In early 1957, the Avro 730 was abruptly cancelled, along with the development of a number of other <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{as a consequence of the}} 1957 Defence White Paper. Part of the reason for the cancellation was the perception that by the time it would enter service, Soviet anti-aircraft capabilities would have improved to the point where it would not be able to succeed in its mission; a preference for missile development over <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> was another factor. A successor high-speed bomber would be developed to meet Air Ministry Specification GOR.339, designated as the BAC TSR-2; however, this too would be eventually cancelled.|$|E

25|$|The Air National Guard {{has been}} under {{pressure}} by active Air Force officials to replace aging and costly F-16s and A-10s, and promoted unmanned aircraft.

While potentially politically motivated, some state governments have voiced apprehension of drones, fearing regulatory restrictions that could cripple a drone's ability to respond during disasters.|$|E

25|$|Although Boulton had {{described}} ailerons in 1864 and then patented them in 1868, {{no one is}} known to have used them in <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> flight until Robert Esnault-Pelterie's glider, 36 years later in 1904 (Renard's 1871 glider flights using pendulum controlled 'winglets' were unmanned). Esnault-Pelterie, a French aeronautical engineer, built a Wright brothers-style biplane glider that year which had first used their wing warping design that he had also copied, but the glider's control in flight was found to be poor and was then changed over to ailerons, although another source states the changeover was due to his view that wing warping was structurally dangerous.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Bossi {{heard of}} an {{airplane}} which had successfully flown while powered only by a 1-horsepower (0.75kW) engine. This prompted Bossi to calculate the minimum power that a <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft</b> would need to fly. The calculation yielded a value of approximately 0.94-horsepower (0.70kW), which convinced Bossi that Human-powered flight might be possible. During a trip to Philadelphia, Bossi tested {{the speed at which}} a glider would take off under tow. The experiment consisted of hiring a professional bicyclist to tow a glider. A spring scale was attached to the tow line to sense the force exerted by the bicyclist. This same experiment procedure was later repeated as part of the development of the Gossamer Condor and the Gossamer Albatross. The results confirmed that a speed at which the necessary lift could be obtained was indeed attainable.|$|E
25|$|Between 1 June 1983 and 1 August 1988 the Delta Darts were {{incrementally}} {{retired and}} sent to the Military Storage and Disposition Center in Arizona. When the need for a high performance Full Scaled Aerial Target Drone was required the USAF began withdrawing Delta Darts from storage. Starting in 1986, 194 of the surviving surplus aircraft were converted into target drones and these were designated QF-106As and used for target practice vehicles under the Pacer Six Program by the Aerial Targets Squadron. The last was destroyed in January 1998. The drones were still capable of being flown as <b>manned</b> <b>aircraft,</b> such as for ferrying to a test; during the test they were flown unmanned. The QF-106 replaced the QF-100 Super Sabre drone; the last shoot down of a QF-106 (57-2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997 after which the QF-106 was superseded by the QF-4S and QF-4E Phantom II drone.|$|E

30|$|A {{study by}} Klebanoff et al. showed that PEMFC could {{successfully}} replace the {{ram air turbine}} (RAT) emergency backup power system [5]. Hence, leading aircraft manufacturers are working on PEMFC-powered propulsions and APUs as part of establishing “more-electric airplanes” [1, 6]. The “more-electric airplanes” will replace the pneumatically powered and hydraulically powered systems (e.g., ECS and cargo doors) with lighter and more efficient electric systems [7]. Consequently, PEMFC is tested for various aeronautic applications, ranging from nose wheel drive motor, hybrid with batteries, exclusively powering small <b>manned</b> <b>aircrafts</b> to emergency power systems [8, 9, 10, 11].|$|R
