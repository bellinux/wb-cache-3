5|$|Greinke was {{selected}} {{in the first round}} of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals, who felt he was a polished player who could move quickly through their system. Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{engaged in}} {{protracted}} {{negotiations with the}} Marlins, during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College, but he eventually signed on August 28, 1999 to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus.</b> His signing bonus was larger than what the Marlins were paying everyone on the Major League roster, except pitcher Alex Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|After the draft, Latos {{demanded a}} $3 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> from the Padres. When the Padres {{did not meet}} his demands, Latos {{enrolled}} at Broward College, a junior college, to pitch for their baseball team. As the Padres retained the right to sign Latos until {{the start of the}} 2007 MLB draft, the Padres sent scout Joe Bochy to observe every start Latos made. Latos had a 10–3 win–loss record and a 2.03 ERA. Feeling that Latos was worth the gamble, the Padres paid Latos $1.25 million a few days before he would have re-entered the draft in 2007.|$|E

50|$|Brandon Williams - After {{completing}} {{his career at}} the University of Wisconsin as the all-time leader in receptions, the smallish/slow Williams still maintained a solid 5th round grade! Fletcher networked hard and aggressive with NFL personnel and took the politics head on, to sell his client as a valued top 100 prospect! Williams received a richer contract (4 year - $2.285 <b>million</b> with a <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> of $675,000 = 571.250 average per year and an 8% increase over the 2005 84th selection) than 83rd selection Anthony Smith (3 year - $1.564 <b>million</b> with a <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> of $521,500), 79th selection Jerious Norwood (4 year - $1.8 <b>million</b> with a <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> of $720,000), and 77th selection Jon Alston (3 year - $1.374 <b>million</b> with a <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> of $550,000).|$|R
5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus,</b> which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus</b> ($2.5 million paid in the first year and $500,000 in the second). The deal paid him $4.3 million the first year, $6.633 million the second year and $6.933 for the third and fourth.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 2012, Cain {{agreed to}} a five-year {{contract}} extension worth a guaranteed $112.5 million through 2017 with an option for 2018, at the time surpassing Kevin Brown for the largest deal for a right-handed pitcher. Cain earned a $5 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus,</b> and earned $20 million each season from 2013–17. His $21 million option for 2018 would vest automatically {{if he was not}} on the disabled list to an elbow or shoulder injury in 2017 and if he reached 400 innings in 2016 and 2017 combined.

5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> <b>bonus,</b> and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E

25|$|After the 2005 season, the Patriots {{chose not}} to place the {{franchise}} tag on Vinatieri as they had the year before, allowing {{him to become a}} free agent. He had visited with the Green Bay Packers, but was set on signing in either a warm-weather climate or a team that plays home games in a dome. On March 22, 2006, Vinatieri signed with the Indianapolis Colts, replacing Mike Vanderjagt who signed with the Dallas Cowboys.
