40|$|In two-player competition, the Bradley-Terry {{model is}} a {{well-known}} probability model. There are several ways of derivation for this model. One of the derivations is given by Lehmann. This derivation can be applied easily for three or <b>more</b> <b>player</b> competition. This probability model is called the Bradley-Terry model based on Lehmann in three or <b>more</b> <b>player</b> competition. In this paper we considere modified Bradley-Terry models which are somewhat similar to the Bradley-Terry model based on Lehmann in three or <b>more</b> <b>player</b> competition, and discuss several properties of these models...|$|R

5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or <b>more</b> <b>players</b> punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E

The Kid insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will blow the whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E
5|$|Even before Bradford City were {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the Football League, the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May. These were followed by four <b>more</b> <b>players</b> joining the club; Sam Bright, George Robinson, Peter O'Rourke and Jimmy Millar. Despite not having enough players to field a full side, four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league management committee meeting, when the club was elected into the Second Division. Money was raised to fund the club, including at least £2,000 from sponsors, a balance of £500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament. Bradford City also took over Manningham's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} season, the {{presidency}} of the club was entrusted to Jean Gavaggio, a chemical engineer at the Boinot factory. Georges Poussard, also a worker in the factory, was appointed as the club's first secretary. The original team played in a fully white strip, and competed in the regional championship of the Ligue de Charentes. In 1929, the Swiss footballer Franchina was named as the club's first manager and the first committee was elected. Throughout the 1930s the club continued to grow in size, enlisting <b>more</b> <b>players</b> and members, despite the team performing relatively poorly in the league.|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or <b>more</b> <b>players</b> withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E

5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or <b>more</b> <b>players.</b> FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
5|$|Oxendine {{accounted}} {{for the majority of}} Virginia Tech's 193 total rushing yards, but Nebraska had many <b>more</b> <b>players</b> run the ball than just Benning, who {{accounted for}} just over one-third of Nebraska's 279-yard rushing total. Scott Frost carried the ball nine times for 62 yards and two touchdowns for the Cornhuskers, and Ahman Green, despite being hampered by his injured foot, managed seven carries for 52 yards. All told, seven Nebraska players managed to carry the ball at least once. Virginia Tech, on the other hand, saw just four players carry the ball, and its No. 2 rusher, Marcus Parker, had eight carries for 22 yards.|$|E
5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the question arises as to whether Bach used one or <b>more</b> <b>players</b> per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E
50|$|However, the UEFA Cup {{took its}} toll on the small Boro squad and their form stuttered towards Christmas.

40|$|In two player competitions, the Bradley-Terry {{model is}} a {{well-known}} probability model. There are several ways of derivation for this model. One of the derivations is given by Lehmann.

In this paper we discuss how to obtain the MLE (maximum likelihood estimator) of the Bradley-Terry model based on Lehmann among three or <b>more</b> <b>player</b> competitions.

5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or <b>more</b> <b>players</b> have the same score when time expires, which causes the round to end in sudden death.|$|E
5|$|World War II meant The Football League was {{suspended}} for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53. However, the war had taken its toll on Arsenal. The club had had <b>more</b> <b>players</b> killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.|$|E
5|$|According to the NPD Group, Brütal Legend sold {{approximately}} 215,000 {{copies in}} the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, {{making it the}} 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were {{not considered to be}} strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven <b>more</b> <b>players</b> away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. According to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 2005–06 season there were some roster changes. Two of the team's top players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon, had to report for compulsory military service. Starting goaltender, Kim Sung-Bae, retired after the previous season. Even though they were missing these players they were noted for having <b>more</b> <b>players</b> with more than 10 goals and 10 assists than in the previous season. With the departure of Song offensive output dropped slightly, the team's top offensive player finished 7th overall in goals with 21. However Martinec won the assists race with 53 and the overall points total with 71. The team shared top spot in the short-handed goals with 2 other teams, scoring 10 {{over the course of the}} season. With a further shortened season of only 34 games the team finished in 5th place and faced the other Korean team, Kangwon Land in the quarter finals. During the regular season Kangwon won 6 of 7 meetings, and the quarter finals were no different. Kangwon swept Halla in 3 games, the final game ending in 3–2 with a last minute desperate bid by Halla to tie the game.|$|E
5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a Plasticine model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that <b>more</b> <b>players</b> could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1884–85, Peel was {{included}} in the team which toured Australia under the management of Alfred Shaw, Arthur Shrewsbury and James Lillywhite. English teams that toured Australia at this time were not composed exclusively of the best cricketers in England. The 1884–85 English team, like most earlier tours, contained only professional cricketers; less usually, the team contained nine players who, critics judged, would likely have been in a full-strength England side. Much of the cricket was overshadowed by off-field clashes with the Australian team that had toured England in 1884; the disputes mainly concerned each team's share of match receipts. Peel was required to bowl a large number of overs; in minor matches, mainly played against the odds (where the opposition teams included <b>more</b> <b>players</b> than the English team), he took 321 wickets at an average of less than five. In first-class matches, he was the leading wicket-taker with 35 wickets, but his average of 19.22 was relatively high.|$|E
