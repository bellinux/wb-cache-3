Alguacil* Abstract The {{generation}} of liquid effluents containing organic and inorganic residues from industries present a potential hazardousness for environment and human health, being mandatory {{the elimination of}} these pollutants from the respective solutions containing them. In order to achieve this goal, several techniques are being used and among them, supported liquid <b>membranes</b> <b>technologies</b> are showing their potential for their application in the removal of metals contained in liquid effluents. Supported liquid membranes are a combination between conventional polymeric membranes and solvent extraction. Several configurations are used: flat-sheet supported liquid membranes, spiral wounds and hollow fiber modules. In order to improve their effectiveness, smart operations have been developed: non-dispersive solvent extraction, non-dispersive solvent extraction with strip phase dispersion and hollow fiber renewal liquid membrane.

40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of effluents from different macrofiltration systems (pressure sand filter and disc filter) used as pre-treatment and <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> (microfiltration and ultrafiltration) was evaluated {{in order to}} determine their possible application as alternatives to disinfection of urban wastewater prior to reutilization. Microbiological quality was determined by reference to nematode egg content, fecal coliforms, E. coli and somatic coliphages. Pathogenic nematode eggs were efficiently retained by the macrofiltration systems. However, since other types of nematode eggs were present in the effluents treated by both systems, the possibility of such infective agents appearing after this type of treatment cannot be discounted. The <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> proved highly efficient at retaining micro-organisms, achieving effluents of excellent {{microbiological quality}}. However, the effluents could not be classified as sterile, since contamination of permeation zones gave rise to the presence of micro-organisms. This result casts doubt on the validity of using the fecal coliform indicator to assess microbiological quality of effluents from these systems. Differences between the two <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> were noted with regard to viral particle retention capacity, with only the ultrafiltration module achieving effluents with total absence of fecal contamination indicators. The macrofiltration systems may present problems when used as pre-treatments to standard disinfection systems (UV radiation, reactive oxidant disinfection).

40|$|Nowadays, several {{applications}} {{for the treatment of}} individual process streams as a source of water and technical fluids reuse are emerging. One of the agro-industrial challenges, apart from obtaining the desired final product, {{is to be able to}} recover or separate intermediate and/or secondary metabolites with added value. In this sense, different membrane techniques such as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO) and pervaporation (PV) can be used to treat these agro-industrial streams (such as milk, beer, wine, fruit juices, among others). Therefore, the industrial application of <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> in some process stages could be a solution, allowing a greater efficiency as well as a circular economic concept of the process. In this work, the state-of-the art of <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> in dairy and wine industry is reviewed in order to account for possible applications of membrane filtrations and to demonstrate their feasibility. Moreover, a market overview, focused on Spain, has been realized to select the most interesting industry between dairy and wine. Then, a scaling-up for those membrane applications has been done and a real chemical process has been simulated for the wine industry. Results showed that there are various possible {{applications for}} <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> in these two industries. In addition, after the scaling-up, it has been demonstrated the feasibility to integrate the processes studied in previous works (published in the literature) into the industrial scale.

Finally, according to the progress reported on both scientific literature and industrial solutions commercialized it can be said that in the next years the membrane providers and the agroindustries will make a step forward in <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> integration in the production processes.

40|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an upcoming}} EPA proposal regarding Free Oil & Grease (FOG) and metal ion content in wastewater effluent, a study was performed for Ford Motor Company that assesses various seconctary wastewater treatment technologies. The three water purification <b>technologies,</b> <b>membrane</b> filtration, biological treatment, and clay media adsorption, were evaluated as secondary water treatment solutions for oily wastewater. Three different types of <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> were tested: polymeric, ceramic, and sintered stainless steel. In regards to FOG, the <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> and the clay media were able to reduce FOG levels below the EPA proposal of 17 mg/L. However, the clay media did not show a strong affinity for metal ions. The <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> were 'lble to reduce all iron levels below the recommended limits (1. 3 mg/L). However, {{they were not able}} to reduce aluminum below the proposed limit (I mg/L). This implies that additional downstream processing would be required to remove the aluminum if the membrane solution was implemented and the regulation passes as proposed. The biological wastewater treatment was not tested during these trials, but was assumed to be able to meet all FOG and metal requirements proposed by the EPA. Based on these experimental results and basic design assumptions, an economic analysis over a ten-year period indicated that the biological waste treatment system was the lowest in costs, followed by the polymeric membranes. The estimated installed and operating costs for both technologies was $ 800, 000 and $ 1, 200, 000 respectively. The nearest alternative solution, the stainless steel membranes, was over 200 % more expensive than the lowest cost option. Based on this economic analysis, Ford should pursue additional research and experiments into the feasibility of using biological wastewater treatment to meet EPA proposed regulations. More specifically, experiments should be conducted to help verify the assumptions used and economic results obtained in this study. As a secondary option, in the absence of additional data, polymeric membranes are recommended as the best solution, despite additional processing needed to remove aluminum ions from water effluent. In addition, the biological waste treatment option has the potential to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurements below the levels seen by any of the <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies.</b> None of the <b>membrane</b> <b>technologies</b> investigated were capable of reducing COD levels below 200 mg/L on a consistent basis, thus indicating that this might be a fixed barrier for these technologies. Although not relevant today, COD measurements might have significant importance in future EPA water regulations, and should be taken into account when recommending a treatment solution. by Abizer F.
