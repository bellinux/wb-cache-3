5|$|I-5s {{called up}} during the {{emergency}} in 1941 were converted for use as fighter-bombers by adding two more <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> some aircraft were fitted with the heavy bombs that had been rejected earlier.

25|$|The Leclerc is also {{equipped}} with a 12.7mm coaxial <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> a remote-controlled 7.62mm <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> whereas most other NATO tanks use 7.62mm weapons for both their coaxial <b>and</b> top <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62mm coaxial <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> two top-mounted <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> one 7.62mm <b>and</b> one 12.7mm.|$|R

5|$|The He 111H-1 {{was fitted}} with a {{standard}} set of three 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> eight SC 250 250kg (550lb) or 32 SC 50 50kg (110lb) bombs. The same armament {{was used in the}} H-2 which started production in August 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{advance on}} Finschhafen {{continued}} on 26 September. Since the Salankaua Plantation was still {{reported to be}} heavily defended, Windeyer attempted to force the defenders to withdraw. He started with attacks on two hills to the south west of the plantation. B and D Companies of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion attacked {{what came to be}} called Snell's Hill. It was captured in hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. The Australians captured three 13mm heavy <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> seven light <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> buried the bodies of 52 dead Japanese defenders. The other feature, which came to be called Starvation Hill, was taken by C Company. However, their capture did not prompt the Japanese to leave the Salankaua Plantation.|$|E

5|$|To offset shortages, {{captured}} {{equipment from}} the French and other occupied armies were {{incorporated in the}} defences, casemates designed for non-German artillery, anti tank and <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> the use of turrets from obsolete tanks in tobrukstand pill boxes (tobruk pits).|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman attack {{began with}} heavy fire from light guns, <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> rifles. Although the {{commander}} of the yeomanry detachment had orders to retire if attacked in force, he could not leave the dismounted engineers. The Ottoman attack was resisted for two hours, but by 07:45 eleven yeomanry officers and 135 other ranks were casualties. The survivors, four officers and forty-two other ranks, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|A {{mixture of}} 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns {{were used for}} close defence work, and could be fitted to {{pedestals}} at various points on the ship, primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms (one {{either side of the}} forward funnel, the third raised above the aft superstructure). At launch, Sydney carried fourteen Lewis <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> two Vickers machine guns, but by the start of World War II, the Lewis guns had been reduced to nine, and the Vickers guns removed completely.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made.

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties in}} the battles. Estimates {{of the number of}} Austro-Hungarian casualties vary. Jordan states that the Austro-Hungarians suffered a total of 37,000 {{casualties in the}} battle, of whom 7,000 were fatalities. Misha Glenny states that almost 30,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were wounded and 6,000–10,000 were killed. Horne writes that the Austro-Hungarians had 8,000 soldiers killed and 30,000 wounded in the battle, compounded by the loss of 46 cannons, 30 <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> 140 ammunition wagons. Historian David Stevenson states that 4,500 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Kress von Kressenstein's Fourth Army {{was made}} up of the 3rd (Anatolian) Infantry Division's three regiments, the 31st, 32nd and 39th Infantry Regiments, totalling 16,000 men, of whom 11,000 to 11,873 were combatants, Arab {{ancillary}} forces; and one regiment of the Camel Corps. Estimates of their arms range from 3,293 to 12,000 rifles, 38 to 56 <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> two to five anti-aircraft gun sections; they also fielded four heavy artillery and mountain gun batteries (30 artillery pieces) and the Pasha I formation.

5|$|On October 3, 2009, {{according}} to a report published by U.S. Army historian Richard S. Lowry, Taliban fighters launched a coordinated attack on the outpost from three sides at about 06:00, capturing its ammunition depot. Some 300 fighters participated in the attack armed with a recoilless rifle, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> <b>and</b> small arms, badly outnumbering the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) presence of about 85 U.S. Army, Afghan National Army and Latvian Army soldiers, and the 35 Afghan soldiers who abandoned their positions. It would later be known as the Battle of Kamdesh.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Marines {{were able}} to deploy two M1919 Browning machine guns to provide suppressing fire on Gavutu's caves, {{allowing}} more Marines to push inland from the landing area. Seeking cover, the Marines became scattered and were quickly pinned down. Captain George Stallings—the battalion operations officer—directed Marines to begin suppressive fire with <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> mortars on the Japanese machine gun emplacements on Tanambogo. Shortly thereafter, American dive bombers dropped several bombs on Tanambogo, diminishing some {{of the volume of}} fire from that location.|$|E

5|$|The Australians were {{crossing}} a creek {{that was in}} front of a steep hill. The Japanese commander waited until the Australians were almost at his position before opening fire with <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> mortars. The troops who had crossed the creek found hand grenades were being rolled down the hill at them; those behind it were pinned down by heavy and accurate fire. Arnold decided to pull back. That night, he formed a defensive position, and beat off a small Japanese attack.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov I-5 was a single-seat biplane {{which became}} the primary Soviet fighter between its {{introduction}} in 1931 through 1936, after which it became the standard advanced trainer. Following Operation Barbarossa, which destroyed much of the Soviet Air Forces (VVS), surviving I-5s were equipped with four <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> bomb racks and pressed into service as light ground-attack aircraft and night bombers in 1941. They were retired in early 1942 as Soviet aircraft production began to recover and modern ground-attack aircraft like the Ilyushin Il-2 became available. A total of 803 built (including 3 prototypes).|$|E
5|$|The Syrians were {{equipped}} with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and {{those used by}} the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. The Syrians also possessed a number of <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> about 15 artillery batteries. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other.|$|E
