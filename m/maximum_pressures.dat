5000|$|When used in {{explosive}} devices, {{the main}} cause of damage from a detonation is the supersonic blast front (a powerful shock wave) in the surrounding area.

Therefore, detonation is most often used for explosives and the acceleration of projectiles. However, detonation waves may also be used for less destructive purposes, including deposition of coatings to a surface or cleaning of equipment (e.g. slag removal) and even explosively welding together metals that would otherwise fail to fuse. Pulse detonation engines use the detonation wave for aerospace propulsion.

5000|$|Pipe flanges {{that are}} made to {{standards}} called out by ASME B16.5 or ASME B16.47 are typically made from forged materials and have machined surfaces. B16.5 refers to nominal pipe sizes (NPS) from ½" [...] to 24". B16.47 covers NPSs from 26" [...] to 60". Each specification further delineates flanges into pressure classes: 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500 for B16.5, and B16.47 delineates its flanges into pressure classes 75, 150, 300, 400, 600, 900. However these classes do not correspond to <b>maximum</b> <b>pressures</b> in psi. Instead, the maximum pressure depends on the material of the flange and the temperature.
