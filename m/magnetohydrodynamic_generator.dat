When the particle concentration becomes high and random particle-particle interaction takes place, the performance or efficiency of these devices deteriorates drastically. Mutual particle interaction leads to higher particle-phase viscous stresses and can be accounted for by endowing the particle phase by the so called particle-phase viscosity.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{conversion of the}} energy released during the planetary entry phase of an interplanetary vehicle trajectory. The effect of MHD conversion is multi-fold. It reduces and redirects heat transferred to the vehicle, and regenerates the dissipated energy in reusable and transportable form. A vehicle on an interplanetary mission carries about 10, 000 kWh of kinetic energy per ton of its mass. This energy is dissipated into heat during the planetary atmospheric entry phase. For instance, the kinetic energy of Mars Pathfinder was about 4220 kWh. Based on the loss in velocity, Mars Pathfinder lost about 92. 5 % of that energy during the plasma-sustaining entry phase that is approximately 3900 kWh. An ideal MHD generator, distributed over the probe surface of Mars Pathfinder could convert more than 2000 kWh of this energy loss into electrical energy, which correspond to more than 50 % of the kinetic energy loss. That means that the heat transferred to the probe surface can be reduced by at least 50 % if the converted energy is adequately stored, or re-radiated, or directly used. Therefore, MHD conversion could act not only as the power generating, but also as the cooling process. In this paper we describe results of preliminary experiments with light and microwave emitters powered by model <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>generators</b> and discuss method for direct use of converted energy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{large-scale}} linear problems a one-dimensional {{electrical network}} often {{serves as a}} model, at discrete points, for a function of k independent variables. Such a discrete animated model has been generalized by the author to represent a class of large-scale nonlinear problems by introducing a sequence of linear-, planar-, cubic-, etc., up to k-dimensional networks, all interconnected into a single polyhedral structure. However, a hierarchy of multidimensional networks {{can no longer be}} energized by mere currents and voltages. A sequence of multidimensional electromagnetic waves must be propagated across the polyhedron (and its dual polyhedron), in order that the waves may satisfy Stokes' theorem, as they step across the boundaries between two different-dimensional networks. Such an animated polyhedral model can represent not only a function of k independent variables, but also all its divided differences of higher order (estimated directional derivatives along the lines, planes, cubes, etc.) all simultaneously. Furthermore, if the polyhedron and its dual are immersed into a k-dimensional region filled with stationary or moving magnetohydrodynamic plasma, the amorphous field crystallizes into a sequence of 2 k sets of transmission networks, coupled by and energized with a large number of k-dimensional <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>generators</b> (“generalized” rotating electrical machines). Even in the absence of motion (velocity terms), the crystallized field-structure may assume a self-adaptive “oscillatory” state, in which it can represent not one, but any number of arbitrarily picked functions of k independent variables, as well as their higher order divided differences—all simultaneously and automatically—without needing any adjustment or interference by the analyst. The resultant oscillatory polyhedron (or self-organizing “automaton”) is applied in the present paper to model (curve-fit) simultaneously any number of functions of a set of nonuniformly-spaced variables. In particular, simple numerical examples are shown of estimating—by regression theory and a least-square criterion—several arbitrary functions of two independent variables at four nonuniformly-spaced points on a plane. The same oscillatory model (automaton) is used, without any change, for the highly satisfactory estimation of not one but six different arbitrarily picked functions, plus their divided differences. Numerical examples with two nonoscillatory polyhedra show that the latter can satisfactorily fit only one, or at most, only a small class of functions plus their divided differences...|$|R
