500|$|... "Mine" [...] {{was one of}} the {{fourteen}} tracks in Speak Now that was written solely by Swift. She also co-produced the song with Nathan Chapman, who co-produced all of Swift's studio albums. It was originally planned to be released on August 16, 2010, however, after the leak of an unauthorized low-quality mp3 file of the song, Big Machine Records decided to ship the song to country radio and iTunes twelve days earlier than planned on August 4, 2010. Swift commented that [...] "a leak is so out of my comfort zone, but it ended up good in the end. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> emotional that I started crying." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I am most {{surprised}} by {{those moments when}} I have {{felt as if the}} sentences, dreams, and pages that have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination– that another power has found them and generously presented them to me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had to tell}} them. I couldn't keep it back. They <b>made</b> <b>me</b> suffer <b>so</b> dreadfully.|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I wish I {{were more}} worth your while. You've <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> {{dissatisfied}} with myself. I'm such a rotter.|$|R
60|$|That {{made him}} angry, {{and he said}} that insular envy <b>made</b> <b>me</b> unresponsive. <b>So,</b> you see, I could not make him understand.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2011, after Corinthians were {{eliminated}} from the 2011 Copa Libertadores by the Colombian team Deportes Tolima, Ronaldo announced his retirement from football, concluding an 18-year career. In an emotional press conference on 14 February, he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement. Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: [...] "It's very hard to leave something that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost to my body. The head wants to go on but the body can't take any more. I think of an action but I can't {{do it the way}} I want to. It's time to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles [...] "Wag" [...] Bennett, one of {{the judges}} at the 1966 competition, was {{impressed}} with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited {{him to stay in}} his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate, London. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: [...] "Being with them <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.” ...|$|E
60|$|And then I {{suddenly}} got it. I {{suppose it}} was fatigue that had <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> slow to apprehend the nub.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{commonplace in}} me,' said Lucilla, gravely, 'but I {{could not help}} it; he <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> good--or so bad--that I believe I shall--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should have}} thought God would have {{understood}} me,' replied the other. 'You do not, I see; {{but then it was}} God that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think <b>so,</b> was it not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so did Penny and I," [...] said Mrs. Penny: [...] "I wore my best Bath clogs, I remember, and Penny was cross {{because it}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> look <b>so</b> tall." ...|$|R
60|$|Everything {{that it had}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> {{happy to}} see in her face died away. She was once more wan and anxious.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, father, you've <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy {{by saying}} that. Now I shall {{be able to}} tell George that there's nothing to worry about.' ...|$|E
60|$|AMY. Not Mr. Dolphin. Oh dear, it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> sad; more sad than angry. I {{can never}} be {{grateful}} enough to Signorina Grattarol.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can change}} my mind, can't I? Maybe you're only wild and {{reckless}} when you drink. Mrs. Hoden said such {{nice things about}} you. They <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> wait <b>so</b> long," [...] he said. [...] "I don't know how I have been living; every hour seemed like years. You should have decided sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I know," [...] {{returned}} Fan, still troubled in {{her mind}} and anxious. [...] "It was that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> happy. I thought--that {{you wanted me to}} love you." ...|$|R
60|$|And yell we did; once, twice, {{and then}} a dozen times, {{in a tone that}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> hoarse I could hardly speak afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Philip, don't leave me. You don't {{know what}} you mean to me. I have such a wretched life, and you've <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Paul, {{speaking}} more to Farden than to his master, 'and then Mrs. King {{gave me some}} supper, {{and that}} was what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> late.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought God would have {{understood}} me," [...] replied the other. [...] "You do not, I see; {{but then it was}} God that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think <b>so,</b> was it not?" ...|$|R
60|$|Emp. Virtue, disdain, despair, I oft have tried, And, foiled, {{have with}} new arms my foe defied. This <b>made</b> <b>me</b> with <b>so</b> little joy to hear The victory, when I the victor fear.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've told Bobbie and my aunt that we're {{going to}} be married. They <b>made</b> <b>me</b> suffer <b>so</b> dreadfully. I had to tell them. I couldn't keep it back, they said such horrible things about you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{it would}} have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy to think that my daughter's child should come to live in his grandfather's old house," [...] murmured Mr. Amedroz.|$|E
6000|$|This {{somewhat}} mollified her. [...] "Oh, Mr. Stanhope," [...] said she, [...] "why {{should you}} have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> miserable? What will you have gained by telling me all this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This preface <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> impatient, being {{conscious}} {{of my own}} merits and innocence, that I was going to interrupt him; when he entreated me to be silent, and thus proceeded:— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he announced, as {{he twisted}} the tube {{about in his}} long fingers, holding {{it up to the}} light, [...] "is the finest brand of cigars ever made in Cuba. A gentleman who had every reason to be {{grateful}} to me--I won't say who he was--gave me that once. Well, the Lord <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so's</b> I can't appreciate any better tobacco than those five-cent 'Bobtails' Monahan's got downstairs, and I saved it. I saved it for the man who would put something over me some day, and--you get it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't know. I {{could go}} over there and dance again as I used to, but being sick has <b>made</b> <b>me</b> ugly, <b>so</b> they won't have me, and no one else will take me because I have been there once.' ...|$|R
5000|$|She also stated:"I {{remember}} {{wishing that}} I {{could be like}} Emma Peel from The Avengers and kick all the skinheads' heads in, because they used to mercilessly torment these people for being foreigners. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> helpless, hopeless and ill." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS DUBEDAT. Thank {{you again}} and again. You have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy: I {{know you will}} admire him and like him. This is my address. [She gives him her card].|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy!" [...] she said tremulously. [...] "Oh, {{you can never}} know how happy! Nothing hurts now--nothing ever can hurt, because I know he did care." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dacre!' exclaimed Lady Caroline, 'Mr. Dacre! Oh! {{you have}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> happy, George! Mr. Dacre is the very, very person; that is, {{the very best}} person you could {{possibly}} have applied to.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was a good}} answer, I thought, and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> curious. <b>So,</b> I {{moved my}} {{position}} to that corner of my bench which was nearest to them, and leaning my back against the convent wall, heard perfectly, without appearing to attend.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he got up}} {{slow and}} walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying {{anything}} but that. But that was enough. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> mean I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite. Occasionally I {{meet the}} people afterwards. For instance, Thomas Sims, the cabman, {{was one of}} them, and," [...] he added colouring, [...] "forgive <b>me</b> for saying <b>so,</b> but you are another. I knew it at once, the moment I saw you, {{and that is what}} <b>made</b> <b>me</b> feel <b>so</b> friendly." ...|$|R
