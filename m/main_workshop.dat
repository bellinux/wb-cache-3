25|$|The airport had a {{capacity}} for 2,500 men {{at the end of}} the war, although the bombing and lack of subsequent repair had left the airport in a dilapidated state. The aircraft factory had been dismantled for most of its equipment. It was therefore converted to a pure maintenance facility which was to serve as the <b>main</b> <b>workshop</b> for the newly established Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF). It was hence only to be kept airworthy to such a degree that aircraft could land for maintenance. The workshops's first major task was the renovation of seventeen Fieseler Storchs. The air force established its mechanical school at Kjeller in October 1945 as did the Air Force Communications and Radar School. As the space was limited the technical school was moved to Kjevik Air Station and the latter to Lutvann in February 1946.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2005, {{the only}} {{dedicated}} Kleinprofil depot is at Grunewald (Hw Gru/Bw Gru), which opened on 21 January 1913. [...] The first Großprofil depot opened at Seestraße (Hw See/Bw See) in 1923, {{to service the}} Nord-Süd-Bahn. [...] It has 17 tracks—2 for the <b>main</b> <b>workshop,</b> and 15 for the service workshop—but its inner-city location prevents any further expansion. [...] Due to BVG budget cuts, the Seestraße depot also services Kleinprofil trains. [...] Two further Großprofil service workshops are located at Friedrichsfelde (Bw Fri), and Britz-Süd (Bw Britz).|$|E

5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the Neudietendorf-Ritschenhausen railway in 1884, the station was on a long-distance route {{connecting}} Berlin with Stuttgart via Erfurt and Würzburg. In 1895, the Prussian state railways acquired the Werra Railway and its railway facilities became the [...] "Prussian" [...] station (Preußischen Bahnhof). By 1900, a one-storey building wing, a new station hall with a staircase and a loading ramp were built between the Prussian and Bavarian buildings. The adjoining workshop has developed by 1900 into a connected building complex, 200 metres long, with 26 locomotive stalls and a number of workshops and other facilities. As the capacities of the <b>main</b> <b>workshop</b> soon reached their limits, in 1914 the Prussian state railway built a new <b>main</b> <b>workshop,</b> one km north of the station, later called [...] "RAW Meiningen" [...] and now operating as Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works. The old <b>main</b> <b>workshop</b> was dismantled and converted back into a train depot. In the following years all platforms were extended and provided with canopies except for platform 2.|$|E
