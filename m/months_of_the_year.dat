In 190405, Re Umberto and her sisters were in service with the Active Squadron, which was kept in service for nine <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> with three months in reduced commission. The {{following}} year, the ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron, along with the three s and the ironclad , three cruisers, and sixteen torpedo boats.

5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years.

Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E
