5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} postoperative (PO) hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and to evaluate its predictability for the outcome of these patients. Patients & Methods: The study included all patients assigned for CABG surgery and had no previous history of diabetes mellitus with preoperative fasting blood glucose of 180  mg/dl. Patients were categorized according RBG into: Normoglycemics had RBG < 180  mg/dl and Hyperglycemics had RBG < 180  mg/dl. Intraoperative data included frequency of CABG with beating heart and number of internal mammary artery graft used, aortic artery clamping, CPB and total operative times. Postoperative data included the frequency of hyperglycemic patients, occurrence of PO <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality.</b> All hyperglycemic patients received insulin infusion adjusted to achieve RBG level of 126 – 179  mg/dl. Results: All patients had significantly higher postoperative RBG levels compared to preoperative levels. Forty-three patients were hyperglycemic, while 57 patients were considered normoglycemic. Throughout ICU and hospital stay, 31 patients developed <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> 4 patients died with significantly higher frequency of additional <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortalities</b> in hyperglycemic versus normoglycemic patients. There was positive significant correlation between the frequency of PO <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>and</b> extent of PO hyperglycemia, aortic clamping, CPB and total operative times. ROC curve and regression analyses showed that the extent of PO hyperglycemia, aortic clamping, CPB and total operative times are the significant predictors for <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortalities.</b> Conclusion: PO hyperglycemia showed deleterious effects on outcome of CABG patients manifested as increased frequency of <b>morbidities</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortalities</b> during ICU <b>and</b> hospital stay {{and the extent of}} hyperglycemia could be considered as independent predictor of worsened outcome. The applied management policy allowed reduction of blood glucose levels without inducing hypoglycemia with subsequent improved outcome...|$|R

5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} cause of <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in the North Atlantic right whale is {{entanglement}} in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings {{in an attempt to}} estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal <b>morbidity</b> <b>and</b> <b>mortality</b> in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
