5|$|After Hitler {{took control}} in Germany in 1933, Borah thought {{well of the}} new chancellor's {{repudiation}} of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. But he was utterly disgusted and alienated by the Nazi treatment of the Jews. This did not initially lead him {{to speak out against}} Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was impractical with <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> unemployed. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany's former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of federal}} {{legislation}} enhancing and extending {{civil rights legislation}} to <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> with disabilities gained bipartisan support in late 1988 and early 1989.

25|$|The zooming {{wealth of}} the top one percent is a problem, but it's not nearly as big a problem as the tens of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> who have {{dropped out of high}} school or college.

25|$|Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39) was a New Deal {{program to}} fund theatre and other live artistic {{performances}} and entertainment {{programs in the}} United States during the Great Depression. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. Under national director Hallie Flanagan it was shaped into a true national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and {{made it possible for}} <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> to see live theatre for the first time.|$|E
25|$|However, war-weariness was a {{major factor}} by 1917, even {{reaching}} the army, as soldiers were reluctant to attack—many threatened to mutiny—saying {{it was best to}} wait for the arrival of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.|$|E

25|$|Healthcare {{rationing}} may {{refer to}} the restriction of medical care service delivery based on any number of objective or subjective criteria. Republican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he {{referred to as a}} type of healthcare rationing. President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical pre-existing conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argued that <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of medical pre-existing conditions.|$|E
25|$|Brandeis was {{becoming}} increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and {{the trend toward}} bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added {{a new dimension to}} the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, {{it was not until the}} 20th century that there was any major effort to apply it.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the trailing}} interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin {{raised the issue of}} <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry. In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.|$|E

25|$|AOL (formerly {{a company}} known as AOL Inc., {{originally}} known as America Online, and stylized as Aol.) is a web portal and online service provider based in New York. It is a brand marketed by Oath, {{a subsidiary of}} Verizon Communications. AOL {{was one of the}} early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the U.S. It originally provided a dial-up service to <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans,</b> as well as providing a web portal, e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. At the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up to broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.|$|E
25|$|As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson {{turned his}} focus to {{hospital}} insurance {{for the aged}} under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake—hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house {{by a margin of}} 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{immigrants}} are also changing the American medical landscape through {{increasing number of}} Asian medical practitioners in the United States. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the US government invited a number of foreign physicians particularly from India and the Philippines to address the acute shortage of physicians in rural and medically underserved urban areas. The trend in importing foreign medical practitioners, however, became a long-term, chronic solution as US medical schools failed to produce enough physicians to match the increasing American population. Amid decreasing interest in medicine among American college students due to high educational costs and high rates of job dissatisfaction, loss of morale, stress, and lawsuits, Asian American immigrants maintained a supply of healthcare practitioners for <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans.</b> It is well documented that Asian American international medical graduates including highly skilled guest workers using the J1 Visa program for medical workers, tend to serve in health professions shortage areas (HPSA) and specialties that are not filled by US medical graduates especially primary care and rural medicine. Thus, Asian American immigrants {{play a key role}} in averting a medical crisis in the US.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Johnson became vice {{chairman}} of Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, a quasi-public organization that guarantees mortgages for <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> homeowners.

50|$|An {{important}} {{provision of}} the G.I. Bill was low interest, zero down payment home loans for servicemen, with more favorable terms for new construction compared to existing housing.
