5|$|A second Feast Day {{was added}} in 2007 by a benefaction from George Moody, {{formerly}} of Oriel, {{to be celebrated}} on or near St George's Day (23 April). The only remaining gaudy had been Candlemas; the new annual dinner was {{to be known as}} the St. George's Day Gaudy. The dinner is black tie and gowns, and by request of the benefactor, the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> will normally be goose. The inaugural event took place on Wednesday 25 April 2007.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the grass}} on the putting greens was the wide-bladed Bermuda. The greens lost speed, {{especially}} during the late 1970s, after {{the introduction of a}} healthier strain of narrow-bladed Bermuda, which thrived and grew thicker. In 1978, the greens on the par 3 course were reconstructed with bentgrass, a narrow-bladed species that could be mowed shorter, eliminating grain. After this test run, the greens on the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> were replaced with bentgrass in time for the 1981 Masters. The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.|$|E

5|$|The menu uses {{locally grown}} produce from Powys and Shropshire, {{and is a}} {{combination}} of classic and modern French cuisine with seasonal changes. Dishes include a pork belly main from the nearby Neuadd Fach baconry, which is served with an apple mousseline, pear and au jus. A monkfish <b>main</b> <b>course</b> comes served with a langoustine consommé and a Brussels sprout purée. Other French courses include a French onion soup and a cheese soufflé. Desserts served include a nougat tube filled with white chocolate and passion fruit mousse, and a trio of lemon pots.|$|E
5|$|Tracey Macleod ate at Pétrus for The Independent {{shortly after}} {{it opened in}} 1999. She thought that certain touches would impress the Michelin inspectors, and that the dishes were {{suitably}} elaborate. Jay Rayner visited the restaurant whilst {{it was at the}} Bekerley Hotel in 2003 for The Observer. He thought that the menu was over complicated, and not all the elements of the dishes worked together. Gillian Glover of The Scotsman thought in 2005 that some of the food served was forgettable, but stand out elements included frog leg lolipops which came with her <b>main</b> <b>course</b> of baked seabass with garlic puree.|$|E

5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (<b>main</b> <b>course),</b> and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Modern western vegetarianism {{was founded}} in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first Vegetarian Society. It has {{increased}} markedly {{since the end of}} World War II, when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, one of the highest percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no red meat. By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the Vegan Society had at least one vegan <b>main</b> <b>course</b> on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 3 is {{a racing}} game that retains {{the same basic}} {{elements}} of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Set in 2116, Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the <b>main</b> <b>course.</b> The less {{time spent in the}} pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate.|$|E

5|$|The first {{studies and}} propositions {{to clean up}} the river date back to 1859, and during the {{following}} years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of different ideas were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved diverting the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of sanitization impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the underground drainage tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North–South connection.|$|E
5|$|Just before Stamford, the Great North Road, now {{labelled}} the A1, {{crosses the}} river, and a pumping {{station on the}} north bank at Stamford Meadows has pumped large quantities of water to the Rutland Water reservoir since its construction in 1975. Stamford was the lowest {{point at which the}} river could be forded so the Roman Ermine Street crossed the Welland there. The A16 road crosses the river by a three-arched stone bridge designed by Edward Browning in 1845. Below it, Albert Bridge is made of iron with stone piers, and was erected by Stamford Town Council in July 1881, to replace an earlier bridge which was washed away in a flood. Beyond Stamford, the river passes the site and ruins of the Benedictine St Leonard's Priory. Hudd's Mill marks {{the point at which the}} Stamford Canal left the river. The present mill building dates from 1751 and 1771. The River Gwash, which the canal crossed on the level, joins from the north, and the remains of the canal follow the river on its north bank. Below Uffington, the county border follows the old course of the river, first to the south to Tallington and then to the north, while the <b>main</b> <b>course</b> now flows along the Maxey Cut to Peakirk. The old course consists of two streams, fed by sluices from the Maxey Cut, which meander to The Deepings. The eastern stream supplied power to Lolham and Maxey mills, while the western stream did the same for Tallington Mill, which dates from around 1700, West Deeping mill, and Molecey's mill, which still retains its seventeenth-century undershot waterwheel, modified in the 19th century to Poncelet's improved design, and the only surviving waterwheel of its type in Lincolnshire. At the western edge of Market Deeping the two streams join, and they are also joined by the Greatford Cut, which has carried the diverted waters of the West Glen river since the early 1950s.|$|E
