40|$|Interlinear text {{has long}} been a {{valuable}} device in language documentation and linguistic description. However, the task of creating, editing and publishing interlinear text is an onerous one. Interlinear text is governed by simple rules, yet laborious <b>manual</b> <b>formatting</b> in a word processor is the norm. A handful of specialized software tools facilitate the creation of interlinear text, permitting customizable views and alignment to audio and video. However, word processors and specialized software alike fail to deliver on a key promise of digitization, namely reusability. In order to facilitate reusability, we have developed a general-purpose conceptual model of interlinear text consisting of four levels: text, phrase, word and morph. The details of the model are informed by our analysis of a representative sample of current practice. We have implemented the model using standard XML technologies. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Automated {{pavement}} {{performance data}} collection {{is a method}} that uses advanced technology to collect detailed road surface distress information at traffic speed. Agencies are driven to use automated survey techniques to enhance or replace their current manual distress survey because {{of the advantages of}} objective measurements, safety benefits, and reduced measurement time. As agencies move toward the transition to fully automated data collection methods, there are common concerns regarding how the output of the new method will match the current manual survey ratings and how they will be adopted into the existing Pavement Management System (PMS). This study evaluates the newly implemented automated distress survey technique and its implementation into the Nebraska Pavement Management System (NPMS). To meet the objectives, a user-friendly program was developed to convert the automated distress ratings into the current <b>manual</b> distress ratings <b>format.</b> Then, a data set that includes more than 7, 000 miles of distress data collected by the automated method was converted to the <b>manual</b> data <b>format</b> and compared to the most recent manual rating data of those sections to assess the agreement between the two data formats after the conversion process. The results show that the automated pavement survey slightly overrates bituminous pavement distresses with only a few distress types that could not be properly detected. Finally, a regression analysis of a core pavement performance indicator, NSI, was conducted to examine how the new automated performance measurement system will ultimately affect NPMS decisions if implemented into Nebraska’s pavement management system...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we show a {{significantly}} reduced assay {{time and a}} greatly increased bead recovery for a commercial Luminex-based multiplex diagnostic immunoassay by performing all liquid handling steps of the assay protocol in a non-contact acoustic trapping platform. The Luminex assay is designed for detecting antibodies in poultry serum for infectious bursal disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus and avian reovirus. Here, we show proof-of-concept of a microfluidic system capable of being fully automated and handling samples in a parallel format with a miniature physical footprint where the affinity beads are retained in a non-contact levitated mode in a glass capillary throughout the assay protocol. The different steps are: incubation with the serum sample, secondary antibodies and fluorescent reporters and finally washing to remove any non-specifically bound species. A Luminex 200 instrument {{was used for the}} readout. The flow rates applied to the capillary during the initial trapping event and the wash steps were optimised for maximum bead recovery, resulting in a bead recovery of 75 % for the complete assay. This can be compared to a bead recovery of approximately 30 % when an automatic wash station was used when the assay was performed in the conventional <b>manual</b> <b>format.</b> The time for the incubation steps for a single assay was reduced by more than 50 %, without affecting assay performance, since intermediate wash steps became redundant in the continuously perfused bead trapping capillary. We analyzed seven samples, in triplicates, and we can show that the readout of the assay performed in the acoustic trap compared 100 % to the control ELISAs (positive or negative readout) and resulted in comparable S/P values as the conventional manual protocol. As the acoustic trapping does not require the particles to have magnetic properties, a greater degree of freedom in selecting microparticles can be provided. In extension, this can provide an opportunity to develop cheaper and more effective microparticles...|$|R

40|$|The central goal of {{food safety}} policy in the European Union (EU) is to protect {{consumer}} health by guaranteeing a high level {{of food safety}} throughout the food chain. This goal can in part be achieved by testing foodstuffs for the presence of various chemical and biological hazards. The aim {{of this study was to}} facilitate food safety testing by providing rapid and user-friendly methods for the detection of particular food-related hazards. Heterogeneous competitive time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays were developed for the detection of selected veterinary residues, that is coccidiostat residues, in eggs and chicken liver. After a simplified sample preparation procedure, the immunoassays were performed either in <b>manual</b> <b>format</b> with dissociation-enhanced measurement or in automated format with pre-dried assay reagents and surface measurement. Although the assays were primarily designed for screening purposes providing only qualitative results, they could also be used in a quantitative mode. All the developed assays had good performance characteristics enabling reliable screening of samples at concentration levels required by the authorities. A novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay system was developed for the detection of Salmonella spp. in food. The sample preparation included a short non-selective pre-enrichment step, after which the target cells were collected with immunomagnetic beads and applied to PCR reaction vessels containing all the reagents required for the assay in dry form. The homogeneous PCR assay was performed with a novel instrument platform, GenomEra ™, and the qualitative assay results were automatically interpreted based on end-point time-resolved fluorescence measurements and cut-off values. The assay was validated using various food matrices spiked with sub-lethally injured Salmonella cells at levels of 1 - 10 colony forming units (CFU) / 25 g of food. The main advantage of the system was the exceptionally short time to result; the entire process starting from the pre-enrichment and ending with the PCR result could be completed in eight hours. In conclusion, molecular methods using state-of-the-art assay techniques were developed for food safety testing. The combination of time-resolved fluorescence detection and ready-to-use reagents enabled sensitive assays easily amenable to automation. Consequently, together with the simplified sample preparation, these methods could prove to be applicable in routine testing...|$|R
