5000|$|In October 2014 Drobot, {{along with}} his {{business}} partners, was sued for using counterfeit screws and hardware in spinal surgeries performed at Pacific Hospital and other area hospitals. At a Feb. 20, 2015 court hearing, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elihu <b>M.</b> <b>Berle</b> rejected the claims against the group accused of using counterfeit surgical screws as in 29 out of 32 cases the plaintiffs were never treated at Pacific Hospital. [...] Drobot filed a $50 million defamation suit in October 2014 against attorneys Brian Kabatek and Robert Hutchinson and the law firms of Kabateck Brown Kellner, Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy and Knox Ricksen. In April 2015, Drobot and his company Healthsmart Pacific, Inc. {{filed a lawsuit against}} 30 individuals and their attorneys for falsely and maliciously claiming that Michael and Healthsmart’s former hospital, Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, harmed them via a non-existent [...] "counterfeit screw" [...] conspiracy. Drobot has agreed to cooperate fully with prosecutors in a case that U.S. attorney’s office spokesman Thom Mrozek has said [...] "remains active and ongoing".|$|E

5000|$|Others who {{reject the}} {{judgment}} on the Bridgeman case have pointed to Schiffer Publishing v. Chronicle Books as providing a contrary decision. However, in Schiffer, {{the facts of the}} case differed. In particular, the plaintiff had not been making any attempt at full fidelity with the works being photographed, and thus the photographs comprised an element of originality. As stated in Schiffer, [...] "the tone and value of colors in the Schiffer photographs differed from those of the actual fabric swatch", meaning that not only was fidelity not achieved, but in fact the photographs were visibly inaccurate representations of the works photographed. The presiding judge in the case, Judge <b>Berle</b> <b>M.</b> Schiller, cited Bridgeman and went to great lengths to demonstrate that the material facts of Schiffer differ from those of Bridgeman. Bielstein concludes from this that far from Schiffer contradicting Bridgeman, it actually reinforces it and builds upon it, confirming that an [...] "interpretive dimension or spark of originality" [...] over and above [...] "slavish copying", conferred originality and copyrightability.|$|R
