40|$|A case of {{congenital}} anieurysmal defect of the ventricular septumi {{is reported}} {{which appears to}} be unique in that this lesion was the only significant finding at autopsy. The patient had evidence of auriculoventricular block for a period of 26 years, at first partial and then complete. She succumbed at the age of 47 to a series of Adams-Stokes attacks which were demonstrated to be set off by parox-ysmal ventricular flutter followed byr ventricular tachy (caridia and ventricular standstill. Pertinent literature is briefly reviewed. T HE FOLLOWING case is conisidered worthy of recording since it appears to be the only one which we can find on record where an aneurysmal defect of the ventricular septum was the sole significant anatomic lesion found at autopsy. It demon-strates that ventricular flutter, unsuspected without cardiographic evidence, may precipi-tate the Adams-Stokes type of syncope. PREVIOUS LITERATURE Aneurysm of the Ventricular Septum. Because of its presumed lack of clinical significance, little has been written on the subject of anetu-rysm of the ventricular septum. Abbott, in Osler's Modern Medicine, 1 described the path-ologic condition briefly avid reviewed the origi-nal studies of Mall. 2 In, 1938 Lev and Saphir' published two cases and reviewed 70 cases which had been reported in the literature. Since this review wve find only one further case reported, that of Castoldi 4 in 1942. Adams-Stokes Syndrome. The <b>Morgagni-Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> as originally de-scribed referred to the association of syncope, epileptiform (convulsions and marked slowing of the heart action. Parkinson and co-workers` in 1941 reviewe(d all reported cases of the Adams-Stokes syndrome with electrocardio...|$|E
