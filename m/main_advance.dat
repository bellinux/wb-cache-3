The Americans engaged the Japanese force and reported inflicting heavy losses. The arrival of that day of the first units of Brigadier Ivan Dougherty's 21st Infantry Brigade at Nadzab at last allowed the paratroopers to be relieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet {{seen in the}} Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the <b>main</b> <b>advance.</b> Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.|$|E
5|$|In these engagements it {{is claimed}} that a whole Ottoman {{battalion}} was captured or killed. Over 100 Ottoman soldiers were killed. Among the 172 prisoners were many wounded, while the British losses were under 60. It {{had been a}} crucial battle; if El Burj had been captured the British would have lost {{the use of the}} road leading up from Berfilya, and the Beit Nuba–Beit Sira valley would have become untenable. The left flank of the infantry's <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> on Jerusalem would have been exposed, which would have also weakened the pressure being exerted towards the Nablus road.|$|E

5|$|With {{the beach}} assault phase {{completed}} the RCTs reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions {{and over the}} course of the next two days achieved the original D-Day objectives. On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN-63 and Colleville, both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on Port-en-Bessin. The <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment, with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached, south and south-eastwards. The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers. Attempts by 3/26 and B/18 with support from the tanks of B/745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8. The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8. The 26th Infantry Regiment's three battalions, having been attached to the 16th, 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day, spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards, forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin. By the morning of June 9 the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps, thus linking Omaha with Gold.|$|E
25|$|Throughout May 1948, Egypt's main force {{advanced}} {{north to}} the Ad Halom bridge, where it halted after the Israeli Operation Pleshet on June 2–3. Another wing of the Egyptian military positioned itself on the Majdal – Bayt Jibrin road and cut off the Israeli-held northern Negev {{from the rest of}} the country. Along its <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> path, Egypt succeeded in taking Nitzanim, and Yad Mordechai and Kfar Darom were evacuated by the Israelis. During this period, numerous Jewish villages in the Negev were subject to constant Egyptian air and artillery harassment, Be'erot Yitzhak being one of them, suffering the hits of approximately 5,000 shells.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} {{took place}} mainly around Manggar airstrip as the defending Japanese employed delaying tactics of ambushes and booby traps, however, within three weeks {{the fighting was}} largely over. The battalion's involvement consisted mainly of carrying out fighting patrols and establishing observation posts along the axis of the <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> up the Milford Highway. Nevertheless, it {{was involved in a}} number of significant engagements throughout July as patrols came into contact with pockets of resistance and small Japanese force's attacked the battalion's observation posts before orders to cease aggressive actions came down from higher command in early August. Following that the battalion was involved in reconnaissance patrols as the war came to an end.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, on the {{southern}} coast, the <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> towards Wide Bay had begun in late December. This involved establishing a forward base around Milim, which was achieved in mid-February 1945 by the 14th/32nd Infantry Battalion which was moved by barge via Sampun. On 15 February, Kamandran was captured following a brief fight during which a patrol from the New Guinea Infantry Battalion carried out a successful ambush. At this point, Japanese resistance on {{the southern}} coast began to grow and in {{the final phase of}} the advance, the Australians began advancing on foot around Henry Reid Bay, to secure the Waitavalo–Tol area, which was held by a Japanese force around battalion strength.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{finally came}} out of his fortifications on December 15 to start a {{two-phase}} attack on the Confederates. The first, but secondary, attack was by Steedman on the Confederate right flank. The main attack would be on the enemy's left, by Smith, Wood, and Brig. Gen. Edward Hatch (commanding a dismounted cavalry brigade). Steedman's attack kept Cheatham on the Confederate right occupied {{for the rest of the}} day. The main attack wheeled left to a line parallel to the Hillsboro Pike. By noon, the <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> had reached the pike, and Wood prepared to assault the Confederate outposts on Montgomery Hill, near the center of the line. Hood became concerned about the threat on his left flank and ordered Lee to send reinforcements to Stewart. Wood's corps took Montgomery Hill in a charge by Brig. Gen. Samuel Beatty's division.|$|E
25|$|In August 1943, the 2/4th was {{deployed}} to New Guinea, arriving at Milne Bay {{where they were}} placed {{under the command of}} the 9th Division, attached to the 26th Brigade. On 4 September, the 2/4th participated in Australia's first amphibious landing since Gallipoli when they landed at Lae during the Salamaua-Lae campaign. The 2/4th came ashore in the second wave of the landing, suffering heavy losses with thirty-four men being killed or missing when their Landing Ship Tank was attacked by Japanese dive and torpedo bombers. After the landing, the 2/4th began reconnaissance and flank protection operations for the 26th Brigade until 30 October, when Lae finally fell and they were sent by barge to reinforce the 20th Brigade at Finschhafen in the clearing of the Huon Peninsula. During this time the 2/4th conducted numerous long range patrols, often being sent ahead of the <b>main</b> <b>advance,</b> before finally being removed from the line at the end of February 1944 and being sent back to Australia for leave.|$|E

25|$|A {{long period}} of {{training}} followed on the Atherton Tablelands, as inter-Allied politics resulted in limited opportunities for the employment of Australian troops throughout 1944 and into 1945. As a result, {{it was not until}} mid-1945 that the 2/32nd went into battle again. The Borneo campaign ultimately proved to be their final involvement in the war. During the initial operations to capture Labuan, the battalion remained in reserve, and only came ashore on 12 June. The battalion was transported from Labuan to Padas Bay four days, on 16 June, via landing craft, and following this took part in capturing Weston the next day. The 2/32nd subsequently patrolled towards Beaufort and then throughout early July advanced towards Papar. The <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> was made along the railway line with a flanking move being provided by one company that conducted an amphibious landing to the south; after these moves, the town was subsequently taken on 12 July 1945.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February after {{discussions with}} Rawlinson, Plumer and Haig, Macmullen {{submitted}} a memorandum {{which became the}} GHQ 1917 plan. On 7 May, Haig set the timetable for the preliminary attack on Messines Ridge (7 June) and the Flanders offensive some weeks later. A week after the Battle of Messines Ridge, Haig informed his army commanders that his objectives were to wear down the German army, secure the Belgian coast and advance to the Dutch frontier. The armies were to capture Passchendaele Ridge and advance on Roulers and Thourout, to cut the railway supplying the German garrisons holding the Western Front north of Ypres and the Belgian coast. An attack by the Fourth Army would then begin on the coast, combined with Operation Hush (including an amphibious landing) {{in support of the}} <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> to the Netherlands frontier. On 13 May, Haig appointed General Hubert Gough to command the Ypres operation and the coastal force; Macmullen gave Gough the GHQ 1917 plan the next day.|$|E
25|$|Political {{considerations}} then intruded. Illinois {{politician and}} Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand obtained permission from Lincoln to recruit an army in southern Illinois and command it on a river-born expedition aimed at Vicksburg. He {{was able to}} get Sherman's corps assigned to him, but it departed Memphis before McClernand could arrive. When Sherman returned from the Yazoo, McClernand asserted control. He inexplicably detoured from his primary objective by capturing Arkansas Post on the Arkansas River, but before he could resume his <b>main</b> <b>advance,</b> Grant had reasserted control, and McClernand became a corps commander in Grant's army. For the rest of the winter, Grant attempted five separate projects to reach the city by moving through or reengineering, rivers, canals, and bayous to the north of Vicksburg. All five were unsuccessful; Grant explained afterward that he had expected these setbacks and was simply attempting to keep his army busy and motivated, but many historians believe he really hoped that some would succeed and that they were too ambitious.|$|E

500|$|The {{tactical}} {{air strikes}} {{that were to}} precede the incursion and suppress known anti-aircraft positions were suspended two days prior to the operation due to poor flying weather. After a massive preliminary artillery bombardment and 11 B-52 Stratofortress missions, the incursion began on 8 February, when a 4,000-man ARVN armor/infantry task force consisting of the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 1st and 8th Airborne Battalions, advanced west unopposed along Route 9. To cover the northern flank, ARVN Airborne and Ranger elements were deployed {{to the north of}} the <b>main</b> <b>advance.</b> The South Vietnamese 39th Ranger Battalion was helilifted into a Landing Zone (LZ) known as Ranger North (...) while the 21st Ranger Battalion moved into Ranger South (...) [...] These outposts were to serve as tripwires for any communist advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. Meanwhile, the 2nd Airborne Battalion occupied Fire Support Base (FSB) 30 (...) while the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion went into FSB 31 (...) [...] Troops of the 1st Infantry Division simultaneously combat assaulted into LZs Blue, Don, White, and Brown and FSBs Hotel, Delta, and Delta 1, covering the southern flank of the <b>main</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E
500|$|After the Japanese counteroffensive was {{defeated}} in late October 1943, Australian attention turned to Sattleberg, {{the site of an}} abandoned Lutheran mission. The newly arrived 26th Brigade was chosen to lead the assault as it was fresher than the division's other brigades. The <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> began on 17 November, although the battalion took part in a preliminary attack on Green Ridge the previous day in order to secure the start line for the advance. Pushing north-west from Jivevaneng in company with Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion, the 2/48th began the drive towards Sattleberg. In difficult terrain and against stubborn Japanese defence, the advance made slow progress, nevertheless by 22 November Steeple Tree Hill was captured and the battalion reached the southern slopes of the Sattelberg feature, about [...] from its summit.|$|E
500|$|The Germans, {{executing}} a plan {{approved by}} Hitler, tried {{to capture the}} IJssel and Maas bridges intact, using commando teams of Brandenburgers that began to infiltrate over the Dutch border ahead of the <b>main</b> <b>advance,</b> with some troops arriving {{on the evening of}} 9 May. During the night of 10 May they approached the bridges: several teams had a few men dressed as Dutch military police pretending to bring in a group of German prisoners, to fool the Dutch detonation teams. Some of these [...] "military policemen" [...] were real Dutchmen, members of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging, the Dutch Nazi party. [...] Most of these attempts failed and the bridges were blown, on two occasions with Brandenburgers and all. The main exception was the Gennep railway bridge. [...] Immediately an armoured train crossed it followed by a troop train, both driving right through the Peel-Raam Position at Mill and unloading an infantry battalion behind the defence line.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{powerplant}} {{selected for}} the single-engined F-16 was the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 afterburning turbofan, {{a modified version of}} the F-15's F100-PW-100, rated at 23,830lbf (106.0kN) thrust. During testing, the engine was found to be prone to compressor stalls and [...] "rollbacks", wherein the engine's thrust would spontaneously reduce to idle. Until resolved, the Air Force ordered F-16s to be operated within [...] "dead-stick landing" [...] distance of its bases. It was the standard F-16 engine through the Block 25, except for new-build Block 15s with the Operational Capability Upgrade (OCU). The OCU introduced the 23,770lbf (105.7kN) F100-PW-220, later installed on Block 32 and 42 aircraft: the <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> being a Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC) unit, which improved reliability and reduced stall occurrence. Beginning production in 1988, the [...] "-220" [...] also supplanted the F-15's [...] "-100", for commonality. Many of the [...] "-220" [...] engines on Block 25 and later aircraft were upgraded from 1997 onwards to the [...] "-220E" [...] standard, which enhanced reliability and maintainability; unscheduled engine removals were reduced by 35%.|$|E
500|$|The South African {{offensive}} from Walvis Bay {{began in}} February 1915, when Northern Force took Swakopmund—the nearest German coastal settlement, about [...] north—without facing major resistance. The Germans almost immediately retreated, leaving behind explosive booby traps and other improvised weapons. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment first engaged the Germans while Northern Force moved east across the desert, {{taking part in}} a number of minor skirmishes and suffering its first two fatalities in a German ambush. To overcome the natural difficulties of the desert terrain, Botha used fast-moving mounted or mechanised troops rather than regular infantry, so the Southern Rhodesian contingent played little part in the <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> on Windhoek. The Rhodesians guarded the construction of a railway inland for much of the campaign, but participated in Northern Force's victory over the Germans at Trekkopjes, losing Lieutenant Hollingsworth (killed in action) and five enlisted men (wounded). Windhoek surrendered to Botha in July 1915, effectively ending the South-West African front of the war. The local German population did not embark on a guerrilla campaign after Windhoek's fall.|$|E
500|$|For the attack, Koptsov {{was placed}} in command of a group {{consisting}} of the 15th Tank Corps and the 154th Rifle Division, reinforced by support units. The group's immediate objective was to advance towards Meshalkino, Myzin, Marino, and Belyi Verkh, cross the Vytebet River, and establish a bridgehead on its west bank. It was then to surround and destroy German troops {{in the area of}} Trostyapka, Perestryazh, and Belyi Verkh, operating in conjunction with the 16th and the 61st Armies. On {{the first day of the}} attack, the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions were sent into the attack first, but could not break through. The 12th Tank Corps was committed to the fight, but came under heavy German air attack and was stopped. At 12:00, a report was received that the 3rd Tank Corps had seized Smetskiye Vyselkami and advanced westwards. Considering that the <b>main</b> <b>advance</b> was halted by German resistance, Western Front commander Georgy Zhukov ordered the transfer of the 15th Tank Corps. The corps was to advance towards Slobodka and Belyi Verkh, but the report of Smetskiye Vyselkami's capture proved to be false, and the 15th's vanguard suffered heavy losses on approaching the village. The 105th Heavy Tank Brigade and 17th Motor Rifle Brigade captured Smetskiye Vyselkami from the 56th Infantry Division's 192nd Infantry Regiment in fierce fighting by 17:00, but the corps was unable to make a breakthrough, becoming delayed by difficulties in traversing swampy terrain, getting lost while moving through forest trails, and running into minefields.|$|E
