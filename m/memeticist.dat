5000|$|The {{memetics}} movement split {{almost immediately}} into two. The first group {{were those who}} wanted to stick to Dawkins' definition of a meme as [...] "a unit of cultural transmission". Gibran Burchett, another <b>memeticist</b> responsible for helping to research and co-coin the term memetic engineering, along with Leveious Rolando and Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as [...] "a unit of cultural information that can be copied, located in the brain". This thinking is more in line with Dawkins' second definition of the meme in his book The Extended Phenotype. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable cultural artifacts and behaviors. However, in contrast to those two positions, Blackmore does not reject either concept of external or internal memes.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time as the {{publication}} of the books by Lynch and Brodie the e-journal Journal of Memetics - Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission appeared on the web. It was first hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at Manchester Metropolitan University but later taken over by Francis Heylighen of the CLEA research institute at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent <b>memeticist</b> community. (There had been a short-lived paper-based memetics publication starting in 1990, the Journal of Ideas edited by Elan Moritz.) In 1999, Susan Blackmore, a psychologist at the University of the West of England, published The Meme Machine, which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett, Lynch, and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural evolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel, and controversial, memetics-based theories for the evolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.|$|E

40|$|Prominent <b>memeticists</b> like Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore {{have made}} claims far more radical than those {{included}} in Dawkins’ original proposal, which provoked increasingly heated debates and arguments over the theoretical significance {{as well as}} limits or flaws of the entire memetic enterprise. In this paper, I examine closely some of the critical points taken by Kate Distin in her penetrating engagement with those radical claims, which include such ideas as the thought that we are meme machines as much as gene machines, the thesis {{that there is no}} conscious self inside those machines, and the claim that a complex interplay of replicators and environment is all there is to life (Blackmore 1999 : 241).

40|$|Abstract Recent {{debates about}} {{memetics}} have revealed some widespread misunderstandings about Darwinian approaches to cultural evolution. Drawing from these debates, this paper disputes five common claims: (1) mental representations are rarely discrete, and therefore models that assume discrete, gene-like particles (i. e., replicators) are useless; (2) replicators {{are necessary for}} cumulative, adaptive evolution; (3) content-dependent psychological biases are the only important processes that affect the spread of cultural representations; (4) the “cultural fitness” of a mental representation can be inferred from its successful transmission; and (5) selective forces only matter if the sources of variation are random. We close by sketching the outlines of a unified evolutionary science of culture. Keywords Dual inheritance theory. Memes. Cultural evolution. Epidemiology of representations. Cultural transmission. Replicators Recent debates about the utility of “memes ” have revealed some fundamental misunderstandings {{about the nature of}} cultural evolution. <b>Memeticists</b> and their many critics seem to share the view that evolutionary principles can only be applied to cultural evolution if culture {{can be thought of as}} arising from the transmission o...|$|R
5000|$|Mary Midgley criticises {{memetics}} for {{at least}} two reasons: [...] "One, culture is not best understood by examining its smallest parts, as culture is pattern-like, comparable to an ocean current. Many more factors, historical and others, should be taken into account than only whatever particle culture is built from. Two, if memes are not thoughts (and thus not cognitive phenomena), as Daniel C. Dennett insists in [...] "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", then their ontological status is open to question, and <b>memeticists</b> (who are also reductionists) may be challenged whether memes even exist. Questions can extend to whether the idea of [...] "meme" [...] is itself a meme, or is a true concept. Fundamentally, memetics is an attempt to produce knowledge through organic metaphors, which as such is a questionable research approach, as the application of metaphors has the effect of hiding that which does not fit within the realm of the metaphor. Rather than study actual reality, without preconceptions, memetics, as so many of the socio-biological explanations of society, believe that saying that the apple is like an orange is a valid analysis of the apple." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} has two results. First, I {{argue that}} each of the two basic components of technological determinism (TD) —what I call the inexorability thesis and the autonomy thesis—are plausible claims on a naturalistic stance. Second, I argue that a normative model for the design of cognitive systems can guide the practice of cognitive engineering, e. g. the task of building cognitive aids and enhancements. TD conjoins two logically independent but empirically related claims. The inexorability thesis is the claim that technology change is an evolutionary process. I defend this claim against considerations raised by Lewens, most notably the lack of a robust account of artifact reproduction that would underwrite genuine transmission. I consider (but reject) the solution of <b>memeticists</b> to this problem. I find that theorists of cultural evolution, e. g. Boyd and Richerson (among others), do present a plausible response. Technologies can be said to evolve via the cumulative selective process of cultural retention. The autonomy thesis is the claim that features of human cognitive agency arise from material culture. I argue for this thesis through a consideration of the merits of Preston’s theory of material culture. Her sociogeneric approach attributes human cognitive agency to a material cultural genesis, and this approach is backed by strong anthropological evidence. Preston would not accept the thesis but she does not manage to exclude it, despite an admirable attempt to develop an account of innovation. I also consider the design of technologies in the practice of cognitive engineering and propose adopting a normative theory of factitious intellectual virtue as a model to guide design in this arena...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{attraction}} in cultural evolution (Reply to J. Henrich and R. Boyd, “On modeling cognition and culture”, Journal of Cognition and Culture, 2 (2), 2002). 1 Abstract: Henrich and Boyd (2002) {{were the first}} to propose a formal model of the role {{of attraction}} in cultural evolution. They came to the surprising conclusion that, when both attaction and selection are at work, final outcomes are determined by selection alone. This result is based on a determistic view of cultural attraction, different from the probabilistic view introduced in Sperber (1996). We defend this probabilistic view, show how to model it, and argue that, when both attraction and selection are at work, both affect final outcomes. Two naturalistic research programmes relevant to the explanation of cultural phenomena that started in the 70 s — the evolutionary approach of Boyd and Richerson (1985, Richerson and Boyd 2005), and their collaborators, and the cognitive approach of Atran (1990, 2002), Boyer (1994, 2001), Hirschfeld (1996), Sperber (1996), and their collaborators — have to a certain extent converged over the years, the first, more evolutionary programme going into greater detail into the cognitive bases of cultural evolution, and the second, more cognitive programme paying an ever increasing attention to the evolution of mind and culture. Part of the reason why this relative convergence went almost unnoticed is the fact that these programmes were generally pursued in mutual ignorance with no discussion of the work in the other tradition, or, worse with misrepresentation, as when Sperber extended his criticisms addressed to Dawkins and <b>memeticists</b> to the work of Boyd and Richerson without attending to the relevant differences between these two approaches. In their article “On modeling cognition and culture, ” Henrich and Boyd (2002) open a serious discussion of the cognitive approach. They overestimate, however, the points of divergence: we happen to agree with much of what they present as objections. Let us, to illustrate this point, add comment in square brackets and in italics to their concluding paragraph: 2 The crux of Sperber, Atran and Boyer’s position is that the transmission of culture requires domain specific cognitive mechanisms [yes, with qualifications], and that therefore population dynamic models of cultur...|$|R
