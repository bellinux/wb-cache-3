We present the first eddy covariance (EC) study on a live <b>maerl</b> <b>bed,</b> assessing the community benthic gross primary productivity (GPP), respiration (R), and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) derived from diel EC time series collected during 5 seasonal measurement campaigns in temperate Loch Sween, Scotland. Measurements were also {{carried out at}} an adjacent (~ 20 m distant) permeable sandy habitat. The O 2 exchange rate was highly dynamic, driven by light availability and the ambient tidally-driven flow velocity. Linear relationships between the EC O 2 fluxes and available light indicate that the benthic phototrophic communities were lightlimited. Compensation irradiance (Ec) varied seasonally and was typically ~ 1. 8 -fold lower at the <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> compared to the sand. Substantial GPP was evident at both sites; however, the <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> and the sand habitat were net heterotrophic during each sampling campaign.

40|$|This {{study used}} a large spatial scale {{approach}} {{in order to}} better quantify the relationships between <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> structure and a selection of potentially forcing physical factors. Data on <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> structure and morpho-sedimentary characteristics were obtained from recent oceanographic surveys using underwater video recording and grab sampling. Considering the difficulties in carrying out real-time monitoring of highly variable hydrodynamic and physicochemical factors, these were generated by three-dimensional numerical models with high spatial and temporal resolution. The BIOENV procedure indicated that variation in the percentage cover of thalli can best be explained (correlation = 0. 76) by a combination of annual mean salinity, annual mean nitrate concentration and annual mean current velocity, while the variation in the proportion of living thalli can best be explained (correlation = 0. 47) by a combination of depth and mud content. Linear relationships showed that the percentage cover of maerl thalli was positively correlated with nitrate concentration (R 2 = 0. 78, P < 0. 01) and negatively correlated with salinity (R 2 = 0. 81, P < 0. 01), suggesting a strong effect of estuarine discharge on <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> structure, and also negatively correlated with current velocity (R 2 = 0. 81, P < 0. 01). When maerl beds were deeper than 10 m, the proportion of living thalli was always below 30 % but when they were shallower than 10 m, it varied between 4 and 100 %, and was negatively correlated with mud content (R 2 = 0. 53, P < 0. 01).

40|$|Predicted ocean {{acidification}} and warming {{are likely to}} have major implications for marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers. However, little information is available on the response of marine benthic communities as a whole to predicted changes. Here, we experimentally examined the combined effects of temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p CO 2) increases on the response of <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> assemblages, composed of living and dead thalli of the free-living coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides, epiphytic fleshy algae, and grazer species. Two 3 -month experiments were performed in the winter and summer seasons in mesocosms with four different combinations of p CO 2 (ambient and high p CO 2) and temperature (ambient and + 3  °C). The response of maerl assemblages was assessed using metabolic measurements at the species and assemblage scales. This study suggests that seasonal variability represents an important driver influencing the magnitude and the direction of species and community response to climate change. Gross primary production and respiration of assemblages was enhanced by high p CO 2 conditions in the summer. This positive effect was attributed to the increase in epiphyte biomass, which benefited from higher CO 2 concentrations for growth and primary production. Conversely, high p CO 2 drastically decreased the calcification rates in assemblages. This response {{can be attributed to the}} decline in calcification rates of living L. corallioides due to acidification and increased dissolution of dead L. corallioides. Future changes in p CO 2 and temperature are likely to promote the development of non-calcifying algae to the detriment of the engineer species L. corallioides. The development of fleshy algae may be modulated by the ability of grazers to regulate epiphyte growth. However, our results suggest that predicted changes will negatively affect the metabolism of grazers and potentially their ability to control epiphyte abundance. We show here that the effects of p CO 2 and temperature on <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> communities were weakened when these factors were combined. This underlines the importance of examining multi-factorial approaches and community-level processes, which integrate species interactions, to better understand the impact of global change on marine ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Maerl {{beds are}} mixed sediments {{built by a}} surface layer of slow-growing, unattached coralline algae that are of {{international}} conservation significance because they create areas of high biodiversity. They are patchily distributed throughout Europe (to ∼ 30 m depth around the British Isles and to ∼ 120 m depth in the Mediterranean) and many are affected by towed demersal fishing. We report the effects of Newhaven scallop dredges on a previously unfished <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> compared with the effects on similar grounds that have been fished commercially in the Clyde Sea area, Scotland. Sediment cores were taken to assess the population density of live maerl thalli prior to scallop dredging on marked test and control plots. These plots were then monitored biannually over a four-year period. Live maerl thalli were sparsely distributed at the impacted site, and experimental dredging had no discernible effect on their numbers. The previously unfished ground had dense populations of live maerl and scallops (both Aequipecten opercularis and Pecten maximus).

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a {{comprehensive}} assessment of Mesophyllum species diversity and their distribution in Atlantic Europe and the Mediterranean Sea is presented based on molecular (COI- 5 P, psbA) and morphological data. The distribution ranges were redefined {{for the four}} species collected in this study: M. alternans, M. expansum, M. macroblastum and M. sphaericum. Mesophyllum sphaericum, which was previously known only from a single <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> in Galicia (NW Spain), is reported from the Mediterranean Sea. The known range of M. expansum (Mediterranean and Macaronesia) was extended to the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula. The occurrence of M. alternans was confirmed along the Atlantic French coast south to Algarve (southern Portugal). Mesophyllum lichenoides was only recorded from the Atlantic, whereas M. macroblastum appears to be restricted to the Mediterranean Sea. A positive correlation was observed between maximum Sea Surface Temperature (SSTmax) and the depth at which M. expansum was collected, suggesting that this species may compensate for higher SST by growing in deeper habitats where the temperature is lower. The latter indicates that geographic shifts {{in the distribution of}} coastal species as a result of global warming can possibly be mitigated by changes in the depth profile at which these species occur. Mesophyllum expansum, an important builder of Mediterranean coralligenous habitats, may be a good target species to assess its response to climate change...|$|E
40|$|DNA barcoding in {{combination}} with morpho-anatomical analysis was applied to study the diversity of crustose coralline algae associated to two <b>maerl</b> <b>beds</b> from two protected Atlantic European areas from Brittany and Galicia —France and Spain, respectively—. Given the records of gametophytes of the maerl species Phymatolithon calcareum under crustose growth-forms, and that associated crustose coralline algae appear {{to be involved in}} the recruitment of new maerl plants, we compared the species composition between the associated crustose coralline algae to Breton and Galician <b>maerl</b> <b>beds</b> with the <b>maerl</b> species identified in these beds in previous DNA barcoding surveys. Our molecular results revealed higher species diversity in associated crustose coralline algae than in maerl-forming species. Nine taxa of crustose coralline algae were found in both study areas: four in Brittany and five in Galicia. Three species from Brittany were identified as Phymatolithon calcareum, Phymatolithon lamii, and Lithophyllum hibernicum. The remaining six ones were assigned to the genera Phymatolithon and Mesophyllum, along with Lithothamnion and Lithophyllum. Morpho-anatomical examination of diagnostic characters corroborated our molecular identification. Our results showed that the most representative genus of crustose coralline algae in Brittany was Phymatolithon, while in Galicia was Mesophyllum. In Brittany, Phymatolithon calcareum was found under both growth-forms, maerl and crustose coralline algae, the latter assigned to the gametophyte stage by the presence of uniporate conceptacles. The recruitment of new maerl plants involving associated crustose coralline algae with <b>maerl</b> <b>beds</b> may occur, but only we can affirm it for Phymatolithon calcareum in Brittany. By contrast, the different species composition between both growth-forms in the Galician <b>maerl</b> <b>beds</b> would indicate that the fragmentation of own free-living maerl species appears to be the most common propagation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} bottoms off {{the northeastern}} {{coast of the}} Maltese Islands are important inshore fishing grounds. Between depths of 45 m and 80 m, these bottoms are characterized by accumulations of unattached calcareous rhodophytes, forming maerl beds. The complex structure of these free-living thalli (rhodoliths) introduces heterogeneity to the otherwise homogenous sedimentary bottoms, thus increasing biotic diversity. Maerl deposits may take hundreds of years to accumulate and their development is strongly correlated with the current and sedimentary regimes and with bottom disturbance, making such beds susceptible to anthropogenic disruption. Two fishing techniques in particular used locally may {{have an impact on}} maerl bottoms: parit fishing (bottom-set gill-nets) and bottom trawling using an otter trawl. We investigated the effect of the former by experimental fishing on maerl, and that of the latter by studying rhodolith structure, sediment granulometry, and benthic biodiversity of a 20 km 2 <b>maerl</b> <b>bed,</b> part of which is regularly trawled. Parit fishing may remove the larger rhodoliths but its impact depends greatly on the strength of the bottom current. The trawled site had more abundant rhodoliths and coarser sediments than the non- trawled site, but a lower sediment organic content. Rhodolith morphology was also different at the two sites. Both sites had a high species richness but low abundance and biomass. Differences in species composition were also noted.

The influence of depth and sediment type on the spatial distribution of shallow soft-bottom amphipods was tested by means of univariate and multivariate methods. Samples were collected down to 40 m depth within areas ranging from very fine sand to gravel. The ratio between density and diversity was found to increase with depth and from coarser to finer sediments. Both physical variables tested were found {{to play a major}} role in structuring amphipod assemblages. However, some dominance of depth was evident as samples were mainly separated according to this variable. Moreover, while only 15 taxa were common to all depth levels, 35 were collected from all sediment types. Both depth and sediment type may override the potential effects of geographical location, as samples from different areas along the southern Portuguese coast were biologically related. A peculiar habitat was sampled in this study: a <b>maerl</b> <b>bed,</b> which was confirmed to be a hotspot of density. Nevertheless, this habitat did not harbor a distinct amphipod assemblage but some taxa such as Caprella spp., Lembos websteri, lysianassids and Gammarella fucicola were preferentially collected there.

Mapped maerl-beds are predominant on submerged terraces located at variable water depth (wd) between 42 and 52 m. This preferred distribution on submerged terraces is probably associated with relatively vigorous bottom currents generated by local circulation that hinders the deposition of terrigenous sediments. Calcareous red algae result to be the most important producers of carbonates from 40 down to 60 m wd. We calculated the coralline carbonate accumulation from the percentage cover of coralline algae (thin section mapping) x 1 cm-thick layer of sediment x measured coralline density. The total coralline cover (living plus dead) in the Cilento area is 13. 96 km(2), with a total 316 800 tons of algal carbonate in the surface 1 cm layer, that correspond to 20 430 g m(- 2). Living maerl is recorded at a depth of 47 m, with a live coralline cover of about 40 % over a minimum area of about 1. 2 km(2).

The Cilento coastal area (eastern Tyrrhenian Sea) has been mapped and characterized by acoustic survey techniques combined with sediment sample analysis. Maërl-beds are reported {{for the first time}} off the Cilento coasts, where calcareous red algae are the most important carbonate producer between 40 and 60 meter of water depth (w. d.). Within the study area maërl-beds dominate on submerged terraces located at variable w. d. between 42 and 52 m. The preferred {{distribution of}} maërl-beds on submerged terraces is associated to the role that terraces exert in the local circulation dynamic, deviating bottom currents and thus preventing the detrimental sediment accumulation on maërl. We calculated the coralline carbonate accumulation from the percentage cover of coralline algae (by thin section mapping) x 1 -cm thick layer of sediment x measured coralline density. The total coralline cover (live plus dead) in the Cilento area is 13. 96 km 2, with a total 316800 t of algal carbonate in the surface 1 cm-thick layer, that is to say 20430 g m- 2. Living maërl is recorded at a depth of 47 m, with a live coralline cover of about 40 % over a minimum area of about 1. 19 km 2. This live maërl has a thickness of about 1 cm and is mostly composed of unattached branches of Lithothamnion corallioides Crouan & Crouan, 1867. The molluskan association of the <b>maërl</b> <b>bed</b> is dominated by characteristic species of the Coastal Detritic Biocoenosis. Living coralline production rate has been calculated as weight of live corallines in 1 -cm thick layer x 100 y- 1 x total area- 1 and corresponds to 90. 8 g m- 2 y- 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMaerl {{beds are}} highly biodiverse {{biogenic}} substrata {{that have been}} receiving increasing attention in the last decade. Although maerl beds represent important nursery areas for commercial fishes and molluscs, little is known on the trophic web of their communities. Community structure parameters of <b>maerl</b> <b>bed</b> of the Bay of Brest (species richness, abundance, biomass and dominating species) were studied in parallel with the carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of their main benthic species (macrofaunal, and megafaunal organisms) {{in order to assess}} the trophic levels and differences in the potential food sources of maerl inhabitants. The major potential sources of energy were identified to originate either from epiphytic macroalgae and microphytobenthos both growing on maerl thalli, together with sedimenting (sedimentary) particulate organic matter (POM) originating from the water column. The majority of the macro- and megafaunal organisms investigated were filter feeders, selective-deposit feeders and predators/scavengers. Filter feeders fall into three different groups representing different trophic pathways (i) sponges feeding directly on POM (water column filter feeders I), (ii) ascidians and holothurians feeding on POM and probably captured pelagic preys (water column filter feeders II), and (iii) filter feeding molluscs and crustaceans were hypothesised to feed on microphytobenthos or on decaying sedimented POM (Interface filter feeders). Selective deposit feeders were also divided into two subgroups. Carnivores were also distinguished between those with scavenging habits and true predators. Coupling of the trophic levels observed with the community biomass structure revealed that most of the benthic biomass derives its food from detritic sedimented POM and/or microphytobenthos, with interface filter feeders (23 % of the biomass), selective deposit feeders (12 %). Carnivores made up to 14 % of the total biomass. Generally stable isotopes ratio mean values overlap and cover a large range within feeding types, indicating a strong overlap in food sources and a high degree of complexity of the food web presumably due to the diversity of the potential food sources...|$|E

40|$|<b>Maerl</b> <b>beds,</b> which harbour productive, diverse benthic communities, are {{threatened}} by human activities. Although some types of fishing activities can impact <b>maerl</b> <b>beds,</b> their effects are poorly studied {{due to the lack}} of appropriate un-fished control sites. In this study, we took advantage of the 25 yr old no-take Columbretes Islands Marine Protected Area (MPA) (NW Mediterranean) as the best available reference for pristine conditions and assessed (1) the conservation status of <b>maerl</b> <b>beds</b> in this MPA and (2) the impacts of fishing in nearby beds that are open to this activity. We compared macroalgal species richness (including both calcifying and non-calcifying species), maerl cover and the live proportion of maerl in 3 contiguous zones with different protection histories: inside the 25 yr old MPA (IN 25), inside the adjacent 6 yr old MPA (IN 6) and in the unprotected grounds surrounding the MPA here fishing continues (OUT). We also analysed differences between shallow (30 to 49 m) and deep (50 to 69 m) beds inside the IN 25 area. As expected, all variables were higher in shallow than in deep beds within the IN 25, likely because of greater irradiance and water motion in the shallow realm. Maerl cover and algal species richness were greater in deep beds within the IN 25 than in the adjacent beds of the OUT region that was composed of similar bathymetric and sediment features, and thus protection from fishing activities in the MPA can best explain these differences. Nonetheless, the proportion of live maerl was similar in both areas. Factors such as differences in light exposure or fragmentation by fishing gear (thus generating new recruits) under a sufficiently intense hydrodynamic regime (thus avoiding burial) may mask fishing impacts on the fraction of live maerl. Similar maerl cover in long- and short-term protected contiguous beds suggests that recovery of such algal beds might occur within 6 yr after fishing cessation. Postprin...|$|R
