25|$|Arthur Tansley {{had a dream}} {{where he}} shot his wife. He {{wanted to know what}} it <b>meant,</b> <b>so</b> he studied Sigmund Freud. However, one part of Freud's theory was that the human brain is an {{electrical}} machine. Tansley became convinced that, as the brain was interconnected, so was the whole of the natural world, in networks he called ecosystems, which he believed were inherently stable and self-correcting, and which regulated nature {{as if it were a}} machine.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a severe}} ankle injury that he {{suffered}} during the Celtics pre-season training camp, the franchise {{was no longer}} interested in offering him a contract because Gerald Henderson had taken his place, and his injury would keep him out for the foreseeable future. It was then that Galis decided to pursue a professional career in Greece's Basket League. Later, while playing in Greece, he would be offered NBA contracts by the Celtics and the New Jersey Nets. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, FIBA did not have professional status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the national team level. Since playing for the Greek national team <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to him, he stayed in Greece. Celtics legend Red Auerbach later said that the single biggest mistake he ever made in his career was not keeping Galis.|$|E

25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

Fraser also wrote: [...] "It was in Pakistan that Marcus Trescothick's mental illness began to stir and the opener has not played an overseas test since".|$|E

Kariya has {{maintained}} a close friendship with Teemu Selänne, and even attended Selänne's final regular season game at the Honda Center in 2014. Despite Kariya having only once attended the arena following his retirement, Selänne made sure to invite his old teammate as [...] "he has <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to me, all my best years and the chemistry I’ve had with him." [...] Selänne {{even went so far}} to threaten to tie him up and toss him in his trunk of his car, then drive him to the stadium himself if Kariya refused.

500|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 25 March 1725 which was in that year both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday. Annunciation was the only occasion for festive music during Lent when Leipzig observed tempus clausum (silent time). [...] {{turned out to be}} the last chorale cantata Bach composed in his second cantata cycle. If Stübel was the librettist, his death in January 1725 explains that Bach lacked a competent collaborator. The composer returned to other texts for the remaining liturgical time of Easter, Pentecost and Trinity. The completion of the cycle of chorale cantatas <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to him, that he included the early chorale cantata for Easter Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, and added a few chorale cantatas for occasions that were missing.|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki passed Dale Jarrett with 27laps {{left at the}} Food City 500 race on April 5 at Bristol to take {{a narrow}} victory. It was his fourthWinston Cup victory. After that race, he never left the topfive in season points. Andrews {{attributed}} Kulwicki's consistently strong finishes to the steady performance of newly adopted radial tires throughout their lifespan. He said, [...] "It was hard to control them, and the driver's ability to work with that car during practice {{in order to get}} the car set up <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much more than it ever did." [...] Kulwicki's second victory in the season was at the first race at Pocono. Discounted as a contender for the season championship during the year, Kulwicki was expected to fade from contention. He qualified on the pole position for the Peak AntiFreeze 500 race on September 20 at Dover, but crashed early in the race and finished 34th.|$|E
500|$|When Harry Met Sally... {{was first}} {{released}} on VHS in late 1989, {{a few months}} after its theatrical release.

It was released on DVD for the first time on January 9, 2001, and included an audio commentary by Reiner, a 35-minute [...] "Making Of" [...] documentary featuring interviews with Reiner, Ephron, Crystal, and Ryan, seven deleted scenes, and a music video for [...] "It Had To Be You" [...] by Harry Connick Jr. A Collector's Edition DVD was released on January 15, 2008, including a new audio commentary with Reiner, Ephron, and Crystal, eight deleted scenes, all new featurettes (It All Started Like This, Stories Of Love, When Rob Met Billy, Billy On Harry, I Love New York, What Harry Meeting Sally <b>Meant,</b> <b>So</b> Can Men And Women Really Be Friends?), and the original theatrical trailer.

500|$|The character's main love {{interest}} throughout his duration on {{the soap opera}} was Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), whom he married in 2011. Nichols had previously stated {{in an interview that}} he thought Tucker would [...] "definitely 'team up' when he finds the right woman". Davidson stated in an interview that the pair will [...] "have their ups and downs, but they're definitely in each other's lives." [...] In September 2011, it is revealed that Tucker is the biological father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the result of a long-ago affair with Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan). When asked of Tucker's reaction to the news, Morgan stated: [...] "It's revealed that Devon was the result of a one-night stand between Harmony and Tucker. That night meant the world to her—Tucker was the love of her life—but it <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> little to him that he doesn't even recognize Harmony when they meet again. Not a clue! It's like a dagger through her heart." [...] James said he was [...] "overjoyed" [...] at the revelation, stating: [...] "There's so much they can do with this story. The relationship between Tucker and Devon—my character allowing that relationship to grow. How it affects Neil. And there's a plethora of possibilities that can come from his relationship with Mrs. Chancellor. I'm sure that relationship will develop just as it will with Devon and Tucker. And then, there's Devon's mother, Harmony, who is back." [...] Tucker and Ashley's marriage ended the following year, after he cheated on her with Harmony. Following their divorce, Nichols stated in an interview with Xfinity that Tucker would [...] "have to find a new woman" [...] as he [...] "can't be without female companionship".|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Manson {{announced}} she was stepping away from music, claiming she got {{sick of the}} music industry's new practices and had found more excitement in acting. Manson said she thought about abandoning the music business as soon as 2008, when her mother developed dementia, and later died, saying that [...] "I didn't want to make music, didn't feel creative. I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] at their son's memorial. According to Manson, [...] "we were all in so much pain, but it <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to them that I could sing that song and {{so much to me}} that I was able to do something. It made me realise how much music sustains people. I don't know why I'd turned my back on it." ...|$|E

He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: [...] "Participating in the competition <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences." [...] He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel (where he placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous. [...] "The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich." [...] Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London.

2500|$|The late (Sunni) theologian Mawdudi (founder of Jamaat-E-Islami) {{wrote that}} the {{establishment}} of the caliphate as (essentially) a monarchy began with the caliphate of Muawiyah I. It wasn't the kind where Muawiyah was appointed by the Muslims. Mawdudi elaborated that Muawiyah wanted to be caliph and fought in order to attain the caliphate, not really depending upon the acceptance of the Muslim community. The people did not appoint Muawiyah as a caliph, he became one by force, and consequently the people {{had no choice but to}} give him their pledge of allegiance (bay'ah). Had the people not given Muawiyah their allegiance at that time, it wouldn't have <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much as losing their rank or position, as much as it would have meant bloodshed and conflict. This certainly couldn't have been given preference over peace and order. Following Hasan ibn Ali's abdication of the caliphate, all the Muslims (including the Sahabah and Tabi'een) gave their pledge of allegiance to Muawiyah I, bringing an end to civil war. That year was called the Aam Al Jamaat (Year of Unification). As Mawdudi pointed out, Muawiyah's own speech during the initial days of his caliphate expressed his own awareness of this: ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the record was generally positive. UK-based Melody Maker viewed The Colour and the Shape {{to be a significant}} American rock release, writing, [...] "The Colour and the Shape is a great rock album at a time when great rock albums are viewed with increasing suspicion." [...] The publication saw the album as leagues ahead of other post-grunge acts: [...] "The first album might have been a collection of loveable songs, but lacked the sheer visceral attack that thrills this time round," [...] wrote Victoria Segal. [...] "An attack that would have [...] almost any other US rock band biting their nails in anguish and embarrassment." [...] Christina Kelly of Rolling Stone was largely positive, although she singled out Norton's production as distracting: [...] "Colour has a big, radio-ready, modern-rock sound. Some might even call the album overproduced: On the ballads, the vocals are overprocessed and fake sounding." [...] Entertainment Weekly praised the band's growth, but criticized the sound journalist David Browne described as [...] "like much current alt-rock: been there, grunged that." [...] In contrast, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described that production as revolutionary: [...] "everything here wound up defining the sound of post-grunge modern rock, and it remains as perhaps the best example of its kind." [...] In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said the music is routine but elevated by Grohl's [...] "marital breakup content/concept," [...] allowing him to [...] "fully inhabit the music that <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> much to him and millions of other Kurt Cobain fans." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork was less favourable, rating the album 3.4/10 and calling the music [...] "sorely dated." ...|$|E
