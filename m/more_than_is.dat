5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{was shown to}} be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The genetic {{distance}} between the two was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon. The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> usual among salticids, visual cues alone are enough to start displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E

25|$|Errors in the dbSNP can hamper {{candidate}} gene association studies and haplotype-based investigations. Errors may also increase false conclusions in association studies: {{increasing the number}} of SNPs that are tested by testing false SNPs requires more hypothesis tests. However, these false SNPs cannot actually be associated with traits, so the alpha level is decreased <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> necessary for a rigorous test if only the true SNPs were tested and the false negative rate will increase. Musemeci et al. (2010) suggested that authors of negative association studies inspect their previous studies for false SNPs (SNDs), which could be removed from analysis.|$|E

25|$|By advocating {{proportionality}} in the court's approach towards protecting substantive legitimate expectations, Lord Justice Laws effectively paralleled {{the approach}} {{used by the}} UK courts when considering whether an interference with a right subject to qualifications protected by the European Convention on Human Rights is lawful. Drawing guidance from the Convention, the proportionality test requires (1) that {{the objective of the}} action must be sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right; (2) that the action designed to meet the objective must be rationally connected to that objective, and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; and (3) the means used to impair the right must be no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> necessary to accomplish the legitimate objective, and the more severe the deleterious effects of an action, the more important the objective must be if the action is to be justified. As the European Convention was given effect in the domestic law of the UK by the Human Rights Act 1998, the proportionality approach resonated with the courts which were familiar in applying the test in cases involving qualified Convention rights across a wide spectrum of factual and policy contexts. For instance, the proportionality approach was applied by Justice Stephen Silber in R. (X) v. Head Teacher and Governors of Y School (2007).|$|E

500|$|Modern {{animal rights}} activists, {{such as those}} from the Flemish Bird Protection Society, accuse {{trainers}} of [...] "brainwashing" [...] birds into singing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> natural or healthy by playing looped recordings of finch calls, and that caging birds in the intentionally small and dark contest boxes is cruel. The finch is a popular aviary bird in many countries and it is forbidden in the European Union to catch birds in the wild, despite vinkeniers purporting that wild birds sing better than captive ones. Though chaffinch populations are currently {{not considered to be}} threatened, a 2002 court case at the Belgian Constitutional Court upheld a 1979 EU law banning the capture of wild finches.|$|E
500|$|The Hobbs Act's {{definition}} of [...] "extortion" [...] was [...] "copied from the New York Code substantially."

[...] Blackstone described extortion as [...] "an abuse of public justice, which consists of an officer's unlawfully taking, by colour of his office, from any man, any money or thing of value that is not due to him, or <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> due, or before it is due." ...|$|E

500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I might add that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E
500|$|The story {{focuses on}} a family of {{anthropomorphic}} rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit cautions her young against entering the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, telling them: [...] "your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor". Her three daughters obediently refrain from entering the garden, going down the lane to pick blackberries, but her rebellious son Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up eating <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a watering can in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's scarecrow. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, while his well-behaved sisters receive a sumptuous dinner of milk and berries as opposed to Peter's supper of chamomile tea.|$|E
500|$|For {{many decades}} the Scots legal system was unique {{for being the}} only legal system without a parliament. This ended {{with the advent of}} the Scottish Parliament, which legislates for Scotland. Many {{features}} within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: [...] "guilty", [...] "not guilty" [...] and [...] "not proven". Both [...] "not guilty" [...] and [...] "not proven" [...] result in an acquittal, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy. There is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice – see the provisions of the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. Manslaughter, in England and Wales, is broadly similar to culpable homicide in Scotland, and arson is called wilful fire raising. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>is</b> typical in many countries.|$|E
