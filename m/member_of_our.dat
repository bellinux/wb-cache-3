She began leading an early-morning Bible class {{at a local}} cafeteria and became active in Life Christian Center, a charismatic church in Fenton. Within a few years, Meyer was the church's associate pastor. The church {{became one of the}} leading charismatic churches in the area, largely because of her popularity as a Bible teacher. She also began airing a daily 15-minute radio broadcast on a St. Louis radio station.|$|E

Those who spoke at the event included politician Sarah Brown and novelist and poet Roz Kaveney.

The same day, a candlelight vigil was held in New York City's Columbus Circle.

500|$|Charlotte Shaw was a 14-year-old from Frithelstock, near Great Torrington, Devon. She was {{a student}} at Edgehill College, Bideford (Kingsley School since 2009), where she was {{involved}} in various sporting activities run by the school, including captaining its netball and gymnastics teams. Shortly after Shaw's death was announced, the school released a statement in which it said [...] "We are all shocked by the tragedy. [...] was a delightful <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> school community". Shaw was {{part of a group of}} 10 students from Edgehill who, along with 84 other groups, were training on 4 March 2007 for Ten Tors, which is held every May. Her death is believed to be the first to occur during, or training for, Ten Tors.|$|E
500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, and I loved having another <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, he was a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E

2500|$|The racism {{allegation}} caused considerable backlash {{from within}} India. Many, including BCCI chairman Sharad Pawar have equated {{it to an}} attack on the country's people itself, based on the apparent misunderstanding that lead to such an escalation. Pawar told Cricinfo [...] "allegations of racism against a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> cricket team is not acceptable... We fight against racism. Our country supported anti-racism movements in South Africa." [...] Kumble considered the allegation one that should not have been made lightly as the team is meant to be an ambassador for the country and an allegation of racism becomes an issue of honour.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a {{gardener}} for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer {{be recognized as a}} member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: [...] "It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> family...

2500|$|In 1952, a {{prescription}} drug ring was discovered in New York where thousands of patients were manipulated to purchase unapproved, high-priced pharmaceuticals. These medications were placed in pharmacies by unethical pharmacists and doctors who partnered to exploit unassuming customers for financial gain. Patients would pay up to 80% more for these unapproved, and presumably poor quality medications. These drug firms were bankrolled by thousands of doctors and pharmacists who purchased shares in the companies. A stern and effective warning was sent out by Barasch, on behalf of Allied Trades Council, to its over 11,000 members, {{many of whom were}} employed in hundreds of drug stores in New York's five boroughs, that [...] "any <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> union found aiding and abetting and joining this criminal hoax on unsuspecting customers will be brought up on charges immediately [...] [...] [...] Wherever and whenever you find evidence that would indicate that this racket is being carried on in your store or plant, call the union immediately [...] [...] [...] Give us all the details and we will turn them over to the proper authorities." ...|$|E

2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
