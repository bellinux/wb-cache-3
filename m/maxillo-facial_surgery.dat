A plastic surgery and <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery</b> centre, with three thirty bedded wards, one for women, one for officers and one for other ranks, was established under the leadership of Professor F C Wilkinson. A dental laboratory was set up on a ward veranda. All the civilian TB patients were moved out. The first party of 10 patients came from Dunkirk on 3 June 1940 for <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> Patients included German prisoners of war. In 1943 a separate Dental unit and laboratory, a photography unit and two operating theatres were added. In early 1945 the hospital reverted to civilian use but with a military wing of 128 beds for servicemen with pulmonary TB. After the war it became difficult to find sufficient nurses and 120 beds were closed. The plastic surgery and <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery</b> centre continued and did some work at the Christie Hospital and at the Duchess of York Hospital.

40|$|International audienceBiomechanical {{modeling}} {{of the facial}} soft tissue behavior is needed in aesthetic or <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgeries</b> where the simulation of the bone displacements cannot accurately predict the visible outcome on the patient's face. Because these tissues have different nature and elastic properties across the face, depending on their thickness, and their content in fat or muscle, individualizing their mechanical parameters could increase the simulation accuracy. Using a specifically designed aspiration device, the facial soft tissues deformation is measured at four different locations (cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip) on 16 young subjects. The stiffness is estimated from the deformations generated {{by a set of}} negative pressures using an inverse analysis based on a Neo Hookean model. The initial Young's modulus of the cheek, cheekbone, forehead, and lower lip are respectively estimated to be 31. 0  kPa ±  4. 6, 34. 9  kPa ±  6. 6, 17. 3  kPa ±  4. 1, and 33. 7  kPa ±  7. 3.

40|$|<b>Maxillo-facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery</b> - past, {{present and}} future. <b>Maxillo-facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery</b> most {{probably}} {{started as a}} speciality of Dentistry in 1915, during the First World War. Dr Kazanjian, {{who was at the}} time a dentist in the United States Army, was probably the first to establish a clinic for treating combat injuries of the jaws and face. Sir Harold Gillies, an English plastic surgeon, was so impressed by Dr Kazanjian's work that he attempted to persuade him to remain in England {{at the end of the}} war to work in his unit, but he was unsuccessful and Dr Kazanjian returned to the United States in 1919. During the Second World War, <b>Maxillo-Facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery</b> once again provided an excellent service in the treatment of injuries of the face. Present apart from war Injuries, there are many injuries, e. g. caused by motor vehicle accidents, that are treated by <b>Maxillo-facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery.</b> From the mass of experience acquired in the treatment of fractures of the face, a new ray of hope has emerged for patients afflicted with congenital malformation of the facial bones. A new field has opened up, which developed from the classic lines of fracture of the upper two-thirds of the face as described by Rene Le Fort. This has enabled unsightly syndromes of the face to be corrected surgically by means of osteotomies corresponding to these fracture lines, as described. Techniques developed by Professor Hugo Obwegeser have made the repositioning of the lower jaw an exclusively intra-oral operation which gives outstanding functional and aesthetic results. Obwegeser, Converse and Tessier have also developed safe surgical techniques for treating cases of hypertelorism by osteotomy and thereby moving the eyes closer together. Surgery designed to improve the ridges of the jaws for better retention of dentures, has also shown promising results. With improved techniques, the implantation of dentures has been revived, with excellent results. Impacted teeth, occurring in 17 % of persons over the age of 20 years, are today removed prophylactically to avoid later complications. Future As the Department of <b>Maxillo-Facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery</b> of the University of Pretoria can compare with the best in the world, the time has perhaps come where, through publications and the delivery of papers, we should begin to share our experience and knowledge with others. There is also great room for improvement in relations between maxillo-facial and oral surgeons and their medical colleagues, in particular the plastic surgeons. Improved co-operation between all branches of dentistry and medicine can only enrich both professions, to the benefit of patient and practitioner alike.

40|$|New Virtual Reality {{technologies}} {{provide the}} possibility of widening access to information in data. Haptics, the technology of touch, could be an interesting future aid and have large impact on medical applications. The use of haptic devices allows computer users to use their sense of touch, in order to feel virtual objects {{with a high degree}} of realism. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the potential deployment and the benefits of using haptic force feedback instruments in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> Based on a produced test application, the thesis includes suggested recommendations for future haptic implementations. At the Department of <b>Maxillo-Facial</b> <b>Surgery,</b> at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, Virtual Reality technologies are used as an aid to a limited extent during the production of physical medical models. The physical medical models are produced with Rapid Prototyping techniques. This process is examined and described in the thesis. Moreover, the future of the physical medical models is outlined, and a future alternative visualizing patient data in 3 D and use haptics as an interaction tool, is described. Furthermore, we have examined the present use of haptic technology in medicine, and the benefits of using the technology as an aid for diagnostic and treatment planning. Based on a presented literature study and an international outlook, we found that haptics could improve the management of medical models. The technology could be an aid, both for physical models as well as for virtual models. We found three different ways of implementing haptics in <b>maxillo-facial</b> <b>surgery.</b> A haptic system could be developed in order to only manage virtual medical models and be an alternative solution to the complete Rapid Prototyping process. A haptic system could serve as a software, handling the image processing and interfacing from a medical scanner to an Rapid Prototyping system. A haptic system could be developed as an alternative interaction tool, which could be implemented as an additional function in currently used image processing software, in order to improve the management of virtual medical models before the Rapid Prototyping process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the committee of preliminary inquiry (in the context of professional conduct committees) of the Health Professions Council of South Africa, with specific reference to <b>maxillo-facial</b> and oral <b>surgery.</b> An evaluation was done of cases that were referred by the committee for preliminary inquiry to this specific professional conduct committee of the Medical and Dental Professions Board. Where necessary, these cases were supplemented by relevant cases from other professional conduct committees. In order to achieve this goal, a comprehensive literature study was conducted on the broad concept of medical and dental misconduct and negligence. Specific attention was paid to the issues of expert testimony and witnesses and consent. Furthermore, a study was conducted to determine the legal framework in which these committees are supposed to function. In the cases where inquiries into the complaints against the registered practitioners followed, a detailed evaluation of the so-called legal process was done, as well as the findings in each case (in the context of the professional conduct committees). The results of this study have shown that the investigative system of the committee for preliminary inquiry preceding professional conduct inquiries into complaints against registered practitioners has certain shortcomings, especially in the more complex cases. The following proposals have been made (in order of most importance) : 1. Both the committee for preliminary inquiry and professional conduct committee must abide by the rules of natural justice, as pertained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. 2. Establishment of a Forum of Expert Witnesses that will evaluate all cases of alleged professional misconduct and negligence pertaining to the field of <b>maxillo-facial</b> and oral <b>surgery,</b> after it was evaluated and referred by the Ombudsman. 3. Appointment of a maxillo-facial and oral surgeon as Ombudsman to evaluate all cases brought before the committee for preliminary inquiry pertaining to the field of <b>maxillo-facial</b> and oral <b>surgery.</b> 4. Acceptance of the proposed test of medical negligence, i. e. the ‘reasonable person’s test’, subjected to that of the ‘reasonable specialist’ as standard for evaluation of cases of alleged negligence in <b>maxillo-facial</b> and oral <b>surgery.</b> 5. The proposed patient’s consent form serves as an example of a legitimate patient consent form. It follows that the legal requirements, especially in cases of extensions and deviations of medical interventions, must be adhered to. 6. It is advisable to belong to an organisation providing indemnity cover (such as Medical/Dental Protection Society) in order to receive proper assistance in the handling of these cases of alleged unprofessional/disgraceful conduct. The recommendations consequential to this study would provide a more streamlined, cost- and time effective investigative system to investigate claims of unprofessional conduct for possible further disciplinary action.

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Ossifying fibroma (OF) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} of the three fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws. It occurs mostly in patients between the age of 20 and 40 years. Females are more commonly affected than males. Clinically, OF usually presents as a painless expansive intra-bony mass. Swelling and pain may be present in some cases while some lesions are discovered incidentally. Radiographically, OF is usually well-defined and unilocular or multilocular. Early lesions present as well-defined radiolucency that are small in size. Over time, the lesions tend to enlarge in size and become mixed radiolucent-radiopaque and finally become completely radiopaque. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the clinical and radiological features of ossifying fibroma presenting at the Departments of <b>Maxillo-Facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery</b> and Diagnostics and Radiology, University of the Western Cape Oral Health Centre as well as to assess its management and recurrence patterns. A retrospective case series analysis was performed of all histopathologically diagnosed ossifying fibroma cases available at the Departments of <b>Maxillo-Facial</b> and Oral <b>Surgery</b> and Diagnostics and Radiology at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of the Western Cape from 1976 - 2014. Patient's age, gender and ethnicity were recorded. The clinical presentation of the lesion as well as the history was analyzed. Radiographic features including density, size, shape, location, locularity and its effect on adjacent structures was noted. Management of each case and follow-up was also documented. A total 61 cases were included in the study. The majority of patients were females (63. 9 %) and below 40 years of age (73. 9 %). Few cases were symptomatic (29. 5 %) with an average period 22 months from first symptoms to presentation.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} (CaP) ceramics {{are widely}} used for bone substitution in orthopedic, <b>maxillo-facial</b> and dental <b>surgery.</b> Many environmental factors {{are involved in the}} gradual degradation of calcium phosphate ceramic after implantation, including physicochemical processes (dissolution-precipitation) and the effects of various cell types. Several of these cell types degrade ceramics by phagocytotic mechanisms (fibroblasts, osteoblasts, monocytes/macrophages) or by an acidic mechanism with a proton pump to reduce the pH of the microenvironment and resorb these synthetic substrates (osteoclasts). Various mesenchymal cells located at the implantation sites can induce the solubilization of CaP ceramics. Crystal-cell contacts were required to induce such crystal dissolution. Mesenchymal cells such as fibroblastic cells are also actively involved in the ceramic degradation process. In this context, CaP crystals underwent dissolution into the phagosome. If osteoclasts resorb CaP ceramics similarly to the natural bone, they possess a phagocytic capability. This phagocytosis mechanism consisted of three steps: crystal phagocytosis, disappearance of the endo-phagosome envelope membrane and fragmentation of phagocytosed crystals within the cytoplasm. Similar phenomenons have been observed during the phagocytic mechanism induced by monocytes/macrophages. The cellular mechanisms of CaP ceramic degradation are modulated by various parameters, such as the properties of the ceramic itself, the implantation sites and the presence of various proteins (cytokines, hormones, vitamins, ions, etc.). The cells involved in these mechanisms could intervene directly or indirectly through their cytokine/growth factor secretions and their sensitivity to the same molecules.
