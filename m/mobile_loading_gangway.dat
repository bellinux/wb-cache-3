40|$|Background: In {{this article}} we propose a Space-Time Finite Element Method (STFEM) for the {{resolution}} of mechanical problems involving three dimensions in space and one in time. A special attention will be paid with the non separation of the space and time variables because this kind of interpolation is well-suited to mesh adaptation. Methods: For that purpose, we have developed a technique of 4 D mesh generation adapted to space-time remeshing. A difficulty arose in the representation of 4 D finite elements and meshes. This original technique does not require coarse-to-fine and fine-to-coarse mesh-to-mesh transfer operators and does not {{increase the size of}} the linear systems to be solved, compared to traditional finite element methods. Space-time meshes are composed of simplex finite elements. Computations are carried out {{in the context of the}} continuous Galerkin method. Results: We have tested the method on a linearised elastodynamics problem. Our technique of mesh adaptation was validated on elementary examples and applied to a problem of <b>mobile</b> <b>loading.</b> The convergence and stability of the method is studied and compared with existing methods. Conclusion: This work is a first implementation of 4 D space-time remeshing. A stability criteria for the method is established, as well as a convergence rate of about 2. Using simplex elements it is possible to develop a technique of mesh adaptation able to follow a <b>mobile</b> <b>loading</b> zone...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. In this thesis, {{contactless}} {{power transmission}} with sliding transformers to <b>mobile</b> <b>loads</b> is investigated. The sliding transformer comprises an extended primary winding - placed {{along the path}} of travel - which is fed through a core containing a secondary winding and which {{is attached to a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>load.</b> In the first chapter problems with existing power supply systems are discussed whereafter several possible applications of such a system are identified. In this chapter different methods of obtaining contactless power transmission are also discussed and a brief discussion of a practical, cost effective system is given. In chapter two the application of different resonant topologies to compensate the large structural inductance of the sliding transformer is investigated. A Series Resonant, Series Loaded topology is identified as the most practical and efficient topology for this application and a more detailed analysis of this topology - as applied to this case - is given. Formulas to calculate the sliding transformer parameters are given in the third chapter and two quantities relating the optimization of sliding transformers to the parameters thereof, are defined. Methods to optimize sliding transformers in terms of these two quantities, and also with respect to EMI, are also discussed in this chapter. The design of a five meter long experimental system which delivers 15 kVA to a <b>mobile</b> <b>load</b> is given in chapter four and experimental results of this system are presented. In chapter five a detailed investigation into different output power control methods is conducted. The effect of these control methods on EMI is investigated by means of numerical simulation of a Series Resonant, Series Loaded system under these different control methods. The most complex control method which generates the most EMI, namely frequency and pulse burst control, is implemented into the experimental system to investigate the limitations thereof. Experimental results of this controlled system are presented. It is found that this control method increases the control range obtainable with classical frequency control but introduces many limitations due to discontinuous primary current. It is concluded in the last chapter {{that it is possible to}} optimize sliding transformers within achievable cost constraints to such an extent that such systems have acceptable efficiencies and that reasonable system lengths are obtainable...|$|R

40|$|Next {{generation}} wireless architectures {{are expected}} to enable slices of shared wireless infrastructure which are customized to specific mobile operators/services. Given infrastructure costs and stochastic nature of <b>mobile</b> services' spatial <b>loads,</b> it is highly desirable to achieve efficient statistical multiplexing amongst network slices. We study a simple dynamic resource sharing policy which allocates a 'share' of a pool of (distributed) resources to each slice- Share Constrained Proportionally Fair (SCPF). We give a characterization of the achievable performance gains over static slicing, showing higher gains when a slice's spatial load is more 'imbalanced' than, and/or 'orthogonal' to, the aggregate network load. Under SCPF, traditional network dimensioning translates to a coupled share dimensioning problem, addressing {{the existence of a}} feasible share allocation given slices' expected loads and performance requirements. We provide a solution to robust share dimensioning for SCPF-based network slicing. Slices may wish to unilaterally manage their users' performance via admission control which maximizes their carried loads subject to performance requirements. We show this can be modeled as a "traffic shaping" game with an achievable Nash equilibrium. Under high loads, the equilibrium is explicitly characterized, as are the gains in the carried load under SCPF vs. static slicing. Detailed simulations of a wireless infrastructure supporting multiple slices with heterogeneous <b>mobile</b> <b>loads</b> show the fidelity of our models and range of validity of our high load equilibrium analysis...|$|R

Results {{from a third}} <b>mobile</b> <b>load</b> {{simulator}} (MLS 3) experiment {{indicates that}} in-situ determination of the under laying pavement material elastic modulus properties using the back calculation method from falling weight deflection measurements provide reliable material model inputs for finite element analysis. In this study, finite element (FE) prediction models available in abaqus were implemented to simulate the rutting performance of asphalt mixture overlays under accelerated loading. A unified, three dimensional pavement section was proposed as a constitutive material model for the rutting prediction of various pavement section combinations in FE analysis. The asphalt overlay mix was treated as an elastic material and its corresponding material properties were determined from laboratory tests while falling weight deflection tests were conducted to determine the underlaying layer moduli. In general, the FE creep and elasto-visco-plastic models predicted that rutting developments match well with the MLS 3 measured results. However, to perform an effective evaluation of the FE simulation analysis and obtain reliable prediction results from an MLS 3 experiment, some special techniques to obtain and characterize material input parameters are deemed necessary...|$|R
