5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|As {{could be}} expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted {{the government of the}} South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and <b>mutual</b> <b>understanding</b> between the white population of South Africa.|$|E

Stalin created a leadership system that reflected historic czarist styles of paternalism and repression, yet was also quite modern. At the top personal loyalty to Stalin counted for everything. However, Stalin also created powerful committees, elevated younger specialists, and began major institutional innovations. In the teeth of persecution, Stalin's deputies cultivated informal norms and <b>mutual</b> <b>understandings</b> which provided the foundations for collective rule after his death.|$|R
