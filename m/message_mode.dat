40|$|For a {{large number}} of applications, there is a strong need for the {{provision}} of a connectionless service by the B-ISDN. However, the cell-based ATM, which is used for switching and multiplexing in this public telecommunication network, is a connection-oriented technique. The B-ISDN should therefore be extended with functionality to allow for connectionless communications. This dissertation addresses the design and analysis of such an extension. An architectural framework is presented, which places the protocols to be used in perspective. Two possible network architectures result from the functional decomposition of the connectionless service into cooperating protocol entities and the underlying ATM service. In the first one, end-systems of the B-ISDN are interconnected by means of end-to-end ATM connections. In the second one, endsystems are connected to special entities in the B-ISDN, called Connectionless Servers (CLSs). The CLSs are interconnected by ATM connections, thus constituting a connectionless overlay network on top of ATM. A number of different implementation architectures for a CLS are proposed, and analysed with respect to effectiveness, availability, scalability, and in particular, performance. The major distinction between these implementation architectures is the distribution of functionality over modules. Furthermore, two different modes of operation are identified for a CLS. In the <b>message</b> <b>mode</b> of operation, a packet is reassembled from the incoming cells before it is processed and forwarded. In streaming mode of operation, the first cell of a packet is immediately processed and forwarded upon arrival, while state information is maintained for the processing and forwarding of subsequent cells of the packet. A number of performance models are developed in this dissertation. An approximate model of a CLS is analysed to allow for comparison of the delay which is experienced by cells for different implementation architectures and modes of operation. If the bandwidth assigned to ATM connections between CLSs is relatively high, <b>message</b> <b>mode</b> of operation yields the lowest delay, otherwise streaming mode performs best. In order to support the dimensioning of a reassembly buffer in a CLS operating in <b>message</b> <b>mode,</b> another, more detailed model is developed and analysed. It allows the computation of the packet loss probability of a buffer, as a function of its size. An essential function for the provision of a connectionless service using ATM is connection management. This function instructs the signalling system of the B-ISDN to establish and release ATM connections as needed for the transfer of packets. A new mechanism is proposed that exploits the expected correlation between subsequent packet arrivals to reduce the average bandwidth that needs to be reserved by the ATM network. A performance model is developed and analysed to determine the optimal control parameters of the new mechanism, and to evaluate its behaviour. It is shown that bandwidth reductions of up to 95 % can be obtained, compared to conventional mechanisms, without affecting the average delay experienced by packets...|$|E
40|$|Bostr [...] om and Felbinger [1] have {{presented}} a ping-pong communication protocol {{which allows the}} information transferred in a deterministic secure manner. The security of this ping-pong protocol {{is based on an}} entangled pair of qubits. And the proof of the case of eavesdropping attack is correct. The aim of this Comment, however, is {{to point out that the}} information Bob gains from Alice is not reliable, i. e., the message can not be transmitted successfully from Alice to Bob if this ‘ping-pong ’ protocol is not modified. In the ‘ping-pong ’ protocol, it utilizes the property that one bit of information can be encoded in the states |ψ ±>, which is completely unavailable to anyone who has only access to one of the qubits. To gain information from Alice, Bob prepares two qubits in the Bell state |ψ +> = (1 / √ 2) (| 0 > | 1 > +| 1 > | 0 >).

Using the public channel, she sends the result to Bob, who then also switches to control mode and performs a measurement in the same basis Bz. Bob compares his own result with Alice’s result.

30|$|To summarize, we {{considered}} deterministic attacks on {{two kinds of}} two-way QKD protocols (pp with entangled photons and LM 05 with single photons) in which an undetectable Eve can decode all the messages in the <b>message</b> <b>mode</b> (MM) and showed that the mutual information between Alice and Bob is not a function of disturbance but is equal to unity no matter whether Eve is in the line or not. Eve induces a disturbance (D) only in the control mode (CM) and therefore the standard approach and protocols for estimating and calculating the security are not available since they all assume the presence of D in MM. As a result, a critical D cannot be determined, the standard error correction procedure cannot be applied for elimination of Eve’s information, {{the efficiency of the}} privacy amplification is curtailed, and the unconditional security cannot be considered proved. In a way, Alice’s sending of the key is equivalent to sending an unencrypted plain text “secured” by an unreliable indicator of Eve’s presence and such protocols cannot be considered for implementation at least not before one proves or disproves that a novel kind of security procedures for such deterministic attacks can be designed.|$|E
40|$|Recently, Nguyen {{presented}} an entanglement-based protocol {{for two people}} to simultaneously exchange their message [1]. The basic idea of this protocol is beautiful. However, the detection probability of per control mode(CM) run under disturbance attack [2] is incorrect. So the total detection probability after N runs is not reliable. In this comment, we will show that detection probability in every CM run under the disturbance attack is not 3 / 4 but 1 / 2. In Nguyen’s protocol [1], Bob first prepares an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) that is randomly {{in one of the}} four Bell states. Bob sends one qubit of the EPR pair to Alice and keeps another. When Alice receives Bob’s travel qubit, she performs an encoding operation on the travel and sends it back to Bob. Bob performs an Bell basis measurement and announces his measurement outcome. When received Bob’s announcement, Alice can select to decode Bob’s information (<b>message</b> <b>mode).</b> Otherwise, she publish her encoded information to check security of their dialogue. Let us suppose that Eve uses a disturbance attack, i. e., she measures the travel qubit in the basis Bz = {| 0 >, | 1 >} in every run.

40|$|The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) is a {{world-class}} spacecraft tracking facility with stations located in Spain, Australia and USA, servicing Deep Space Missions of many space agencies. The {{current system of}} scheduling spacecraft during cruise for multiple 8 hour tracking sessions per week currently leads to an overcommitted DSN. Studies indicate that future projected mission demands upon the Network will only make the loading problem worse. Therefore, a more efficient scheduling of DSN resources is {{necessary in order to}} support the additional network loading envisioned in the next few years: The number of missions is projected to increase from 25 in 1998 to 34 by 2001. In fact given the challenge of the NASA administrator, Dan Goldin, of launching 12 spacecraft per year, the DSN would be tracking approximately 90 spacecraft by 2010. Currently a large amount of antenna time and network resources are subscribed by a project in order to have their mission supported during the cruise phase. The recently completed Mars Pathfinder mission was tracked 3 times a week (8 hours/day) during the majority of its cruise to Mars. This paper proposes an innovative approach called <b>Message</b> <b>Mode</b> Operations (MMO) for mitigating the Network loading problem while continuing to meet the tracking, reporting, time management, and scheduling requirements of these missions during Cruise while occupying very short tracking times. MMO satisfies these requirements by providing the following services: Spacecraft Health and Welfare Monitoring Service Command Delivery Service Adaptive Spacecraft Scheduling Service Orbit Determination Service Time Calibration Service Utilizing more efficient engineering telemetry summarization and filtering techniques on-board the spacecraft and collapsing the navigation requirements for Doppler and Range into shorter tracks, we believe spacecraft can be adequately serviced using short 10 to 30 minute tracking sessions. This claim assumes that certain changes would have to he made in the way the Network traditionally services missions in Cruise. Furthermore, limiting spacecraft to short sessions will free up larger blocks of time in the tracking schedule to help accommodate future tracking demands soon to be placed upon the Network.

In this thesis, the occurrence of direct speech (e. g., Mary said: "Let's go") in language produced by individuals with aphasia {{and its effects on}} listener perception are explored. The thesis also investigates the effects of direct and indirect speech (e. g., Mary said that she wanted to go) on discourse comprehension in individuals with aphasia. The principal finding is that direct speech has a positive effect on both language production and language comprehension in Dutch individuals with aphasia. In the General Introduction, Chapter 1, possible causes of aphasia are discussed, followed by a description of how aphasia affects language production and comprehension. Next, possible ways that individuals with aphasia may compensate for these difficulties are considered. This is followed by a description of the main findings from the literature on direct and indirect speech processing and, more specifically, the use of direct speech in aphasia. Although much attention had been paid to reported speech in “healthy” interaction, the review of the literature makes it clear that {{little is known about the}} role of reported speech in aphasic discourse. In addition, there are a number of methodological limitations in the previous research, such as a reliance on English language studies, small participant groups, the absence of a control group, and a major focus on written language. Hence, even though needed because of these methodological limitations. The chapter ends with the formulation of the research questions that are addressed in this thesis. In the study presented in Chapter 2, the occurrence of direct speechprevious research on the production of direct speech constructions in narratives of Dutch individuals with and without aphasia is examined. The question posed in this chapter is whether and how often the construction is used, and in which forms it becomes manifest. To answer this question, the relative frequencies of direct speech constructions are calculated and compared within and between groups and tasks. Based on the patterns found in the data, different forms of direct speech are categorised: speech quotations, thought quotations, bare quotations and question-answer sequences. The results show that both groups make use of various forms of direct speech, but the individuals with aphasia produce more direct speech constructions than the non-brain-damaged (NBD) speakers. In addition, their direct speech instances have a different distribution across categories. The larger proportion of direct speech by individuals with aphasia is suggested to be a strategy to avoid difficulties with word-finding and grammar. In Chapter 3 the effects of the occurrence of direct speech on the perceived liveliness and speech comprehensibility of spontaneous speech produced by speakers with and without aphasia are assessed. Previous studies have shown that direct speech is frequently accompanied by, for example, shifts in prosody, voice quality, and pitch. As modification of intonation has been suggested to affect the degree of perceived liveliness of speech, the occurrence of direct speech is expected to have a positive effect on perceived liveliness. Furthermore, since increased liveliness has been argued to help a listener to stay focused and understand the content of a message, the occurrence of direct speech is expected to positively affect speech comprehensibility. The study demonstrates, as expected, that communication is perceived as more lively in both populations when it contains direct speech than when it does not. However, it is not more comprehensible. We suggest that the relatively high frequency of use of direct speech by speakers with aphasia reflects a strategy to increase not only liveliness of their discourse, but also listener focus and involvement. Chapter 4 addresses the question of whether the use of direct speech,compared to indirect speech, affects comprehension of narrative discourse in Dutch listeners with and without aphasia. The Direct Speech Comprehension (DISCO) test is developed to examine the effects of manipulation of direct versus indirect speech on discourse comprehension. As predicted, narratives with direct speech are better understood than narratives with indirect speech by listeners with and without aphasia. Two possible explanations are proposed: 1) the positive effect of direct speech is caused by the additional “layers” of communication (e. g., changes in pitch, volume and speech rate, facial expression, pauses) accompanying direct but not indirect speech; 2) in Dutch, direct speech is easier to comprehend than indirect speech, since the grammatical structure of direct speech is less complex than that of indirect speech. That is, direct speech constructions do not have grammatical embedding and are in canonical word order. Indirect speech constructions are embedded sentences with an (obligatory) complementiser (‘that’) and the word order of the embedded sentence is non-canonical. for the Dutch results is correct by replicating the study in English. In English, like in Dutch, indirect speech constructions are embedded. However, English indirect speech constructions have the same (canonical) word order as direct speech constructions, and the complementiser is optional and usually omitted. Hence, an English version of the DISCO test is developed and presented to participants with and without aphasia. The effects of language (Dutch versus English), group (speakers with aphasia versus speakers without aphasia) and condition (direct versus indirect speech) are examined. All three variables affect DISCO scores: the Dutch participants perform better than the English-speaking participants, the non-aphasic control group outperforms the aphasic group, and the direct speech condition is easier than the indirect speech condition. However, for English speaking participants with aphasia, direct speech is not easier to understand than indirect speech. Given these differential effects for the Dutch and English aphasic individuals, it is argued that both the extra “layers” of communication (changes in intonation, facial expression, pauses, etc.) and the grammatical characteristics of direct and indirect speech constructions play a role in discourse comprehension success, but that the surface syntactic ambiguity of English reported speech constructions influences performance. In Chapter 6, the issues raised in Chapter 1 and explored in Chapters 2 to 5 are discussed, and the results interpreted in relation to previous literature. Individuals with aphasia produce more direct speech constructions than speakers without aphasia, and this relative increase is suggested to reflect a strategy to mask word finding difficulty and to avoid grammatically complex constructions. It is argued that this is the first research to show that communication is perceived as more lively when it contains direct speech than when it does not. Furthermore, the positive effects of direct speech constructions on discourse comprehension in individuals with aphasia are considered. Finally, some clinical implications of the research are discussed: As direct speech is a linguistic format used by speakers without aphasia, it can provide a natural strategy to compensate for word-finding problems and grammatical difficulties. Direct speech can be a way that individuals with aphasia can complement or even replace verbal communication by relying on paralinguistic and non-linguistic devices, such as intonation, gestures, and body movements (aspects that are usually intact in individuals with aphasia). In this way, direct speech can contribute to the perceived liveliness of speech, helping individuals with aphasia to be stronger communication partners. Direct speech provides them with a natural, economical and flexible linguistic format that can be used in versatile communicative contexts. Therefore, speech language pathologists should consider practicing the use of direct speech in everyday communication with aphasic speakers. Similarly, there may be benefits from communication partners of individuals with aphasia using direct rather than indirect speech constructions to report speech, since the reduced grammatical complexity and extra non-verbal and paralinguistic cues may help individuals with aphasia better understand a <b>message.</b> <b>Mode</b> of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xviii, 199 pages...|$|E
