Due to the strong affinity towards self-condensation in alkaline media (see above) solutions of cyanamide are stabilized by the addition of 0.5 wt% of monosodium phosphate as buffer. Solid cyanamide is produced by careful evaporation of the solvent and subsequent addition of a hydrolysis labil ester of <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The ester absorbs traces of moisture (suppression of urea formation), neutralizes alkalinity (ammonia) and continually releases small amounts of <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} photooxidation of dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) in aqueous acetonitrile has been established by kinetic modeling the UV absorbance vs. time curves under continuous irradiation. The model, built according to the known solution reactivity of oxysulfur radicals [1], consists of 22 steps involving 6 radical and 10 nonradical species. The first steps of the mechanism are the homolytic cleavage of the DMDS S - S bond with formation of methanethiyl radicals (CH 3 S) followed by addition of these radicals to molecular oxygen. There are photoequilibria between thiyl (CH 3 S), sulfinyl (CH 3 S), and sulfonyl (CH 3 SO 2) radicals and the corresponding molecular species (methyl methanethiosulfinate CH 3 S(O) SCH 3 or MMTSI, methyl methanethiosulfonate CH 3 S(O) 2 SCH 3 or MMTS and methanesulfinic acid CH 3 S(O) OH or MSIA) which appear as long lived intermediates. Reactions of sulfonyl radicals with oxygen lead to methanesulfonic acid (CH 3 S(O) 2 OH) or MSA. Cleavage of sulfonyl radicals gives SO 2 and CH 3, the parent compounds of sulfuric (H 2 SO 4) and <b>methanoic</b> (HCOOH) <b>acids.</b> The predictive power of the model was tested at higher initial concentration of DMDS in anhydrous and aqueous acetonitrile. In these conditions, the proposed mechanism gives a semiquantitative description of {{the course of the}} reaction and reproduces the kinetic behavior of the long lived intermediates. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|For some model {{molecules}} (<b>methanoic</b> and ethanoic <b>acids,</b> methane, and phenol), systematic {{investigations of}} quantum yields {{were carried out}} in the present paper, as a function of concentration and of absorbed radiant power. Quantum yields ÃŽÂ¦Ã¢ÂˆÂž, calculated from rates, followed an apparently Langmuirian function of initial concentration C 0, by which ÃŽÂ¦Ã¢ÂˆÂž values at Ã¢Â€ÂœinfiniteÃ¢Â€Â concentration could be obtained. By having thus established that quantum yields of photomineralisation ÃŽÂ¦Ã¢ÂˆÂž are independent of radiation wavelength, within the absorption range of semiconductor, but depend on radiant power, such a dependency was experimentally investigated. For all the investigated molecules, the maximum allowable values reached in the low radiant power range clearly appeared as a plateau. On the contrary, at high radiant power values, another plateau, at a value of about 1 / 4 - 1 / 5 with respect to the maximum value, was evident. This was interpreted {{on the basis of a}} competition kinetics of hydroxyl radicals with themselves, leading to hydrogen peroxide formation, other than with substrate or intermediate molecules leading to full mineralisation. Modelling of quantum yields as a function of concentration and radiant power thus allows a fully consistent and trustworthy design of photoreactors...|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} acetic acid was {{selected}} as a prime suspect model pollutant from {{the wide variety of}} pollutants found typically in the air of repositories, based both on its chemical reactivity and its abundance. The majority of the gaseous pollutants to which paper collections are exposed are considered essentially inert. Only a handful of gaseous substances are described in conservation literature to induce chemical reactions in paper [14]. These pollutants can be subdivided into outdoor generated and indoor generated gases. The effect of the outdoor generated pollutants sulfur-dioxide, nitrogen-oxides and ozone on paper has been studied extensively with accelerated aging laboratory experiments [1 – 3, 5, 6, 24 – 27]. Nevertheless, thanks to both policies of outdoor pollution reduction and policies of improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings by reducing the fresh air intake, the typical concentration of such gases in repositories has declined below 5  ppb for sulphur dioxide and ozone and 15  ppb for nitrogen dioxide [28]. Probably as a consequence the focus of conservation research shifted in the last 15  years to investigate the indoor generated pollutants methanal (formaldehyde), ethanoic (acetic) and <b>methanoic</b> (formic) <b>acid</b> [4, 7 – 11, 16, 29 – 36]. Indoor emission of formaldehyde from urea–formaldehyde bonded products like fiberboard has been studied thoroughly in connection to human health. The relevance to paper decay is probably small because chemical reactivity is limited in absence of oxidants [9, 37, 38] and concentrations found in archival storage rooms are below 10  ppb [16]. In contrast to the pollutants discussed above, the two carboxylic acids formic and acetic acid are typically found in storage rooms containing paper at concentration levels up to respectively 70  ppb and 150  ppb [14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22]. In some special situations containing non-paper emitting sources in closed cabinets, higher concentration levels have been reported [39, 40]. Both acids are generated by oxidative and hydrolytic reactions in organic materials like wood and paper [41 – 43]. If absorbed by less acidic paper materials they might promote chemical decay by catalyzing hydrolysis of cellulose. The transfer of chemically reactive volatile components from certain collection objects to others is commonly referred to as cross-contamination. The laboratory-derived experimental evidences of the detrimental effect of acetic acid in typical archival conditions is nevertheless contradictory. Menart and co-authors [10] extrapolating data collected at an intermediate concentration (1000  ppb) and temperature (60, 70 and 80  °C) in a set-up with continuous gas flushing, which guarantees the attainment of equilibrium between the concentration of the gas in air and in the paper, conclude that “the effect (of acetic acid) in typical archival environments is limited and in some cases insignificant”. On the other side in a modified Oddy test for plastic materials performed at 80  °C and for 14  days, acetic acid has been shown to depolymerize pure cellulose paper [44]. In a similar set-up based on the investigation of the impact of historic storage materials on the carbonyl group content and the weight average molar mass of two types of paper, Becker and co-authors [11] conclude that “the mutual evaluation of formic acid and acetic acid is able to explain increased deterioration despite VOC emissions that are seemingly low at first sight”. Prompted by these contradictory evidences we have searched for indications of acetic acid damage on studies examining directly archival collections.|$|R

For the reactions of methanal and <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid</b> with H atoms and OH, HO 2, and CH 3 radicals, the calculated relative electronic energies were obtained with the CCSD(T) /cc-pVXZ (where X = D, T, and Q) method and were extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The electronic energies obtained with the CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ method were benchmarked against the CCSD(T) /CBS energies and were found to be within 1 kcal mol(- 1) of one another. Thus, the energies calculated using the less expensive CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ method were used in all of the reaction mechanisms and in calculating our high-pressure limit rate constants for the title reactions.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the {{effects of climate change}} and reduce dependence on fossil fuels, carbon-neutral methods of electricity generation are required. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have the potential to operate at high efficiencies, while liquid hydrocarbon fuels require little or no new infrastructure and can be manufactured sustainably. Using hydrocarbons in SOFCs introduces the problem of carbon deposition, which can be reduced or eliminated by judicious choice of the SOFC materials, the operating conditions or the fuel itself. The aim of this project was to investigate the relationships between fuel composition and SOFC performance, and thus to formulate fuels which would perform well independent of catalyst or operating conditions. Three principal hypotheses were studied. Any SOFC fuel has to be oxidised, and for hydrocarbons both carbon-oxygen and hydrogen-oxygen bonds have to be formed. Oxygenated fuels contain these bonds already (for example, alcohols and carboxylic acids), and so may react more easily. Higher hydrocarbons are known to deposit carbon readily, which may be due to a tendency to decompose through the breaking of a C-C bond. Removing C-C bonds from a molecule (for example, ethers and amides) may reduce this tendency. Fuels are typically diluted with water, which improves reforming but reduces the energy density. If an oxidising agent could also act as a fuel, then overall efficiency would improve. Various fuels, with carbon content ranging from one to four atoms per molecule, were used in microtubular SOFCs. To investigate the effect of oxygenation level, alcohols and and carboxylic acids were compared. The equivalent ethers, esters and amides were also tested to eliminate carbon-carbon bonding. Some fuels were then mixed with <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid</b> to improve energy density. Exhaust gases were analysed with mass spectrometry, electrical performance with a datalogging potentiostat and carbon deposition rates with temperature-programmed oxidation. It was found that oxygenating a fuel improves reforming and reduces the rate of carbon deposition through a favourable route to CO/CO 2. Eliminating carbon-carbon bonds from a molecule also reduces carbon deposition. The principal advantage of blending with <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was the ability to formulate a single phase fuel with molecules previously immiscible with water.

First we have compared several interatomic potential models to describe the structures and properties of four iron oxide polymorphs, namely α-Fe 2 O 3 (hematite), β-Fe 2 O 3, γ-Fe 2 O 3 (maghemite) and ε-Fe 2 O 3 to choose a suitable potential for these systems, where we have considered cell volume, angles, Fe-O bond distances and relative stabilities of the four polymorphs. Next, we have investigated the energetic of vacancy ordering in γ-Fe 2 O 3 (maghemite), using a statistical approach to evaluate uptake and ordering as a function of temperature. Our results show clearly that full vacancy ordering, in a pattern with space group P 41212, is the thermodynamically preferred situation in the bulk material. This stability arises from a minimal Coulombic repulsion between Fe 3 + cation sites for this configuration.

There is extensive attention from both domestic and overseas on the distribution, transference and potential hazard of antibiotic in the environment[1], and the study on the residual antibiotic transference in water body is very important [2].

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{adsorption}} of three organic molecules onto different surfaces of goethite α−FeO(OH) using atomistic simulation techniques. New interatomic potentials for the interaction between goethite and the organic molecules were developed. In {{the majority of cases}} the organic molecules were found capable of forming a coordinate bond via their carbonyl oxygen atom with a surface iron ion. In addition, weaker hydrogen-bonds were formed between the organic molecules and the surfaces. The largest adsorption energies were obtained for the modes of adsorption where the organic molecules bridged or spanned the periodic grooves or dips present on the goethite surfaces, thus forming several interactions between the molecule and the surface. Among all adsorbates studied, the hydroxamic acid molecule in the eclipsed conformation releases the largest adsorption energy when it interacts with goethite surfaces, followed by the staggered conformations of hydroxyethanal and <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid</b> molecules. The adsorption energies are in the range of − 60. 0 to − 186. 4 kJ∙mol− 1. Due to the surface structure, as well as the flexibility and size of hydroxamic acid and hydroxyethanal, in most cases these adsorbate molecules lose their planarity with respect to the structure of the isolated molecules. We found that the replacement of pre-adsorbed water by the organic adsorbates is an exothermic process on all the goethite surfaces studied. The removal by sorption onto iron particles of humic and fulvic acids, the major substituents of natural organic matter (NOM) that pollutes aquifers and soils, is corroborated by our calculations of the adsorption of surfactants with the same functional groups to the surfaces of oxidised iron particles...|$|E

The second order MÃ¸ller-Plesset method using the 6 - 311 G(d,p) basis set {{has been used in}} the geometry optimization and in the frequency calculation of all of the species involved in the above reactions, as well as the hindrance potential description for reactants and transition states. Intrinsic reaction co-ordinate calculations were carried out to validate all of the connections between transition states and local minima. The CCSD(T) /cc-pVXZ method (X = D, T, Q) and corresponding extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit was used in order to calculate the relative electronic energies of the reaction mechanisms of dimethyl ether, methanal, dimethyl ketone, <b>methanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and methyl ethanoate and are reported in kcal/mol. The relative energies calculated with the computationally less expensive methods of G 3 in esters + OH radicals and CCSD(T) /cc-pVTZ in the remaining reaction mechanisms were benchmarked against the energies calculated with the CCSD(T) /CBS method and are within 1 kcal/mol. Rate constants have been calculated for all of the reaction channels by conventional transition state theory with asymmetric Eckart tunneling corrections and 1 -D hindered rotor approximations in the temperature range 500 - 2000 K. A branching ratio analysis has also been investigated for some of the reaction mechanisms studied in this work. The rate constant results have been compared to available experimental and theoretical data and they are generally in good agreement. A comparison of abstraction of a H-atom by OH and HO 2 radicals at the different positions relative to the functional group of the studied oxygenated species has been performed. For both OH and HO 2 radicals, abstraction of a H-atom at the alpha 2 ̆ 7 or alpha positions of alcohols and ethers is faster than for alkanes and generally slower for aldehydes, ketones, acids and esters throughout the temperature range studied...|$|E
