5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} to Europe remains debated: American vines had been taken to Europe <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before,</b> for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E

5|$|MacDougall stated his {{experiment}} {{would have}} to be repeated <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment is widely regarded as flawed and unscientific due to the small sample size, the methods used, as well as the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis. The case has been cited as an example of selective reporting. Despite its rejection within the scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized the concept that the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.|$|E

5|$|As {{the owner}} of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a {{position}} he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. John McKenna took over as chairman after Houlding's departure. McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League. The chairmanship changed hands <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> John Smith, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990. His successor was Noel White who became Chairman in 1990 In August 1991 David Moores, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years became Chairman. His uncle John Moores was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, a hammer, and the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought a {{sledgehammer}} into the ring, Foley attempted to take it away from him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E

25|$|If Shakespeare {{had indeed}} {{intended}} for Antony to crossdress, {{it would have}} drawn even more similarities between Antony and Hercules, a comparison that many scholars have noted <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before.</b> Hercules (who {{is said to be}} an ancestor of Antony) was forced to wear Queen Omphale's clothing while he was her indentured servant. The Omphale myth is an exploration of gender roles in Greek society. Shakespeare might have paid homage to this myth as a way of exploring gender roles in his own.|$|E

25|$|The WC was {{the first}} farm tractor to have rubber tires as {{standard}} equipment, and the first tractor tested on rubber in the Nebraska tractor tests. The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a steel wheel with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping {{the cost of the}} tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC drop gearing at the rear (bull-gear-with-pinion final drives), which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter drive wheels. Drop gearing had appeared <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|E
25|$|Sometime between 223 and 224, when rebellions {{broke out}} in the Nanzhong region of {{southern}} Shu, Zhuge Liang wanted to personally lead the Shu army on a campaign to quell the revolts and pacify the region. Wang Lian strongly objected and said that Zhuge Liang, given his important status, should not undertake the risk of going into the dangerous Nanzhong region. As Zhuge Liang was worried that none of the Shu generals was sufficiently competent for this task, he insisted on personally leading the campaign. However, Wang Lian's sincerity did make Zhuge Liang reconsider <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> he finalised his decision to go on the campaign in early 225.|$|E
25|$|Law {{and order}} {{had broken down}} <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>before</b> Partition, with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps {{insufficient}} {{to the task of}} keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to cut and run. The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which {{it would be difficult to}} get out.|$|E
