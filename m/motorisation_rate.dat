50|$|Nonetheless the {{positive}} effects on access to remote places and mobility comfort provided by the automobile, {{the negative effects of}} the car on everyday life have been a subject of debate. Although the introduction of the mass-produced car represented a revolution in mobility and convenience, creating job demand and tax revenue, the high <b>motorisation</b> <b>rates</b> also brought severe consequences to the society and to the environment. The modern negative consequences of heavy automotive use include the use of non-renewable fuels, a dramatic increase in the rate of accidental death, the disconnection of local community, the rise in obesity and cardiovascular diseases, the emission of air and noise pollution, the emission of greenhouse gases, generation of urban sprawl and traffic, segregation of pedestrians and other active mobility means of transport, decrease in the railway network, urban decay and the high cost per unit-distance on which the car paradigm is based.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} with major car manufacturers, such as USA or Germany, {{a certain degree}} of car dependency might be positive for the economy at a macroeconomic level, since it demands automobile production, therefore resulting also in job demand and tax revenue. These economic conditions were particularly valid during the 1920s when the number of automobiles, worldwide, had a substantial annual average increase, but also during the post-World War II economic expansion. Notwithstanding the growing effects provided by the automobile on the economy of some countries, several other auto-dependent countries, deprived from automobile industry and oil resources, have to allocate substantial economic assets, to satisfy its mobility policies, affecting then their commercial balance. This situation is broadly valid in the majority of the European countries, since, disregarding some few exceptions such as Norway, Europe is largely dependent on imports for its fossil fuels. Furthermore, just few European countries, such as Germany or France, have car manufacturers productive enough to satisfy their country's internal demand for cars. All these factors related to high <b>motorisation</b> <b>rates,</b> affect therefore the economic growth in the majority of the European countries.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, the number of elderly people in western European and other industrialised {{countries}} has been increasing. These demographic processes will continue. The growing share of elderly people in the population will lead to new challenges for ageing societies, particularly when the baby-boom generation retire. As a result, elderly people have become a focal point of interest in politics and science, and consequently in transport research. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a comprehensive overview of empirical findings on the mobility behaviour of seniors - today, in the past and in the future - followed by a simulation of the future transport demand of seniors, taking into account their changing <b>motorisation</b> <b>rates</b> and travel behaviour. The article is divided in two main parts. The first part provides a systematic overview of existing empirical findings and outlines expected effects in the near future derived from these findings. In the second part, we estimate the future travel demand using the TAPAS simulation model (travel activity pattern simulation). This microscopic model allows us to see how the overall travel demand will change, particularly due to demographic change - in response to altered population structures on the one hand and altered levels of motorisation or modified behaviour in the group of elderly people on the other. The results allow us to separate the demographic effects from the effects caused by increasing motorisation and changing behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The actual {{trend of}} spatial {{diffused}} and functional segregated settlement structures causes long term growth in traffic volumes. One step to more sustainability is land use development along existing passenger rail infrastructure. It {{is a clear}} strategy of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia e. g., with specific grants to cities, to develop housing close to rail stations. The focus of the presentation could lead to different surveys, each one including the results, their transferablity and the implication for further policy development. According to additional research and development projects at the Land {{as well as at}} the European level, further results could be included. 1. Which potentials and which impacts? Both the potentials and the impacts of a rail-oriented development have been analysed by ILS for the NRW Ministry of Urban Development. For the potentials, there has been a survey among over hundred cities in three regions. The results show a considerable amount of available land for new housing around rail stations, but also a substantial variation between regions and among cities. For the impacts, an other survey was accomplished among 2100 persons from six comparable suburban areas with high <b>motorisation</b> <b>rates.</b> It shows, that there is a significant difference in their modal choice, depending on the rail accessibility, although the difference is lower than it might be expected. 2. Policies measures (What?) and processes (how?) The analysis of some best practices both on the urban and regional levels leads to an identification of key factors for success of policy implementation. This was the goal for an ILS survey for the french Ministry for transport and planning, regarding experiences in North Rhine-Westphalia. Not only the "what?" question, about applicated measures and tools, but the "how?" question too, about processes and governance, were investigated. The case analysis is based on the Land level (NRW integrated policies for housing, planning, transport), on the regional level (housing development close to rail stations in the Region Bonn), and on the agglomeration level (integrated local policy in M). For this last case for example, several factors are keys of success for a rail oriented development: the continual elaboration of a global strategical concept (giving priority to a polycentric, balanced urban system, promoting resource-efficient settlements patterns, focusing on public transport infrastructure), a clear cooperation among the city departements, (for example based on working groups about the housing program), and a prospective real estate policy (half of the building land belongs to the city, and is mainly close to rail stations). 3. Further experiences and projects Successful experiences exist in NRW from the revitalisation of a railway line and land use development for housing near the stations ("Haller Willem"). Here also activities of NGO`s are of high relevance. Providing housing near railway stations is only a necessary condition for the usage of public transport; accompanied services could increase the effect. So supplying houses with PT tickets inclusive ("mobile home") or the supply of mobility services offered by housing companies could be helpful. The presentation could present ideas and first experiences...|$|R
