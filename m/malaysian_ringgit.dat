Bank Negara Malaysia, the nation's central bank, decided to impose capital controls to prevent the outflow of the Ringgit in the open market. The Ringgit became non-internationalised and a traveller had to declare to the central bank if taking out more than RM10,000 out of the country and the Ringgit itself was pegged at RM3.80 to the US dollar.|$|E

50|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Lat {{began to}} {{supplement}} his family's income through his artistic skills, by drawing comics and selling them to his friends. Four years later, in 1964, the young cartoonist achieved his first published work: a local movie magazine—Majallah Filem—printed his comic strips, paying him with movie tickets. Lat's first comic book publication, Tiga Sekawan (Three Friends Catch a Thief), was published by Sinaran Brothers that year. The company had accepted Lat's submission, mistaking him for an adult and paying him 25 <b>Malaysian</b> <b>ringgits</b> (RM) for a story about three friends who band together to catch thieves. In 1968, {{at the age of}} 17, Lat started penning Keluarga Si Mamat (Mamats Family), a comic strip for Berita Minggu (the Sunday edition of Berita Harian).

His education finished two years later at the end of Form 5; his Third Grade in the Senior Cambridge examinations was not enough for him to advance to Form 6.

40|$|Domestic {{tourism in}} Malaysia has {{experienced}} dramatic boom after government turns to domestic front and introduces various measures. Domestic travels were particularly promoted after Malaysia felt {{the effects of}} the financial crisis {{towards the end of the}} 20 th century. Since then, Malaysians have been encouraged to spend their money at home and to visit local destinations. Several monetary regulations were also introduced such as the strict limitation on the amount of <b>Malaysian</b> <b>Ringgits</b> that can be taken abroad, as well as on the selling of the local currency. At the same time, continuous promotion and festivities have been carried out t 1 u'oughout the country all year round to spur domestic spending.

Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation.

40|$|Malaysian {{bond market}} is {{developing}} rapidly {{but not much}} is {{understood in terms of}} macroeconomic factors that could influence the yield spread of the <b>Ringgit</b> <b>Malaysian</b> denominated bonds.

The findings support the expected hypotheses that CPI and IR are the major drivers that influence the changes in MGS yield spreads. However IPI and KLCI have weak and no influence on MGS yield spreads respectively Whilst IR, CPI and IPI have significant influence on the yield spreads of CB 1, CB 2 and CB 3, KLCI has significant influence only on the CB 1 yield spread but not on CB 2 and CB 3 yield spread...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Tax {{incidence}} {{is a basic}} {{topic in}} public economics as the tourism&# 13; industry is an increasingly major contributor to government revenue. Generally, government taxation&# 13; objectives are {{for the purpose of}} financing programs that improve peoples lives and economic&# 13; prosperity, accelerate economic growth and allow for access to sustainable development. In the first&# 13; view, tax policy decisions by government are based on their effects on the distribution of economic&# 13; welfare. Therefore, to provide incentives for governments to select a suitable tax policy, exportability&# 13; of tax is important. Hotel room tax {{is one of the main}} parts of tourism tax. Despite the importance of&# 13; tax for government, it seems that the exportability of hotel room tax is still not well known. Therefore,&# 13; understanding the counteraction of foreign visitors with respect to its main factors is important for the&# 13; Malaysian government and tourism management. To achieve these aims, this study examines tax&# 13; incidence effects on the tourism market. Approach: We use hotel room as representative of tourism&# 13; market. Quarterly data from 1995 - 2009 are used and a dynamic model of simultaneous equation is&# 13; employed. Results: Our results indicate that in the short run supply is elastic and demand is&# 13; inelastic. But in the long run both demand and supply are elastic to price. Conclusion: Based the results&# 13; if the government imposes one <b>ringgit</b> (<b>Malaysian</b> currency) tax on hotel room price, the tourist&# 13; contribution is more than 89 and 74 % in the short run and long run respectively. Hence, we conclude&# 13; that the Malaysian tourism market is exportable. Our results also indicate that tax on hotel has no&# 13; negative social effects in the short run. </div...|$|R

[...] While investment in traditional financial instruments like bonds or stocks often is considered to contribute positively to economic growth by providing capital, currency speculation does not; according to this view, it is simply gambling that often interferes with economic policy. For example, in 1992, currency speculation forced the Swedish National Bank (the central bank of Sweden) {{to raise interest rates}} for a few days to 500% per annum, and later to devalue the krona. Mahathir Mohamad, one of the former Prime Ministers of Malaysia, is one well-known proponent of this view.
