The Camel Troop fell back on Lahij, where it was reinforced by the advance guard of the <b>Movable</b> <b>Column,</b> numbering two hundred and fifty rifles, with two ten-pounder guns. This advance guard had moved up under most trying conditions. The heat was intense, there was great shortage of water, and progress was difficult over the sand.

As {{only a few of the}} Volunteer Horse had been ordered to accompany the attacking force, Chris and his companions took up their position on an eminence that afforded a general view of the battle, and here a large number of the townspeople also gathered.

Little difficulty was experienced during the advance, and several villages were destroyed; but on 16 November, during the return march, the rearguard was hotly engaged all day, {{and had to be}} relieved by fresh troops next morning. British casualties numbered 72. Almost daily the Afridis, too wise to risk general engagements, waged continual guerrilla warfare, and troops engaged in foraging or survey duties were constantly attacked. On 21 November, a brigade under Brigadier-General Westmacott was detached to visit the Rajgul valley. The road was exceedingly difficult and steady opposition was encountered. The objectives were accomplished, but with 23 casualties during the retirement alone. The last task undertaken was the punishment of the Chamkannis, Mamuzais, and Massozais. This was carried out by Brigadier-General Gaselee, who joined hands with the Kurram <b>movable</b> <b>column</b> ordered up for the purpose. The Mamuzais and Massozais submitted immediately, but the Chamkannis offered resistance on 1 and 2 December, with about 30 British casualties.|$|R

However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the Company forces were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the Company forces to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the Punjab were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the Punjab <b>Movable</b> <b>Column</b> of British, Sikh and Pakhtun soldiers under John Nicholson to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August.

2500|$|The pilot sat {{immediately}} {{forward of}} the wing and controlled the aircraft by a combination a <b>movable</b> <b>column</b> and a wheel mounted on that column. Pitch was controlled by fore and aft movement of the column, which, by means of wires, moved the elevator mounted at the forward end of the front boom. Yaw control was effected by twisting the column about its vertical axis (by means {{of pressure on the}} steering wheel), which turned the vertical rudder (mounted above the elevator) left or right. Lateral control was achieved by rotating the wheel: When the pilot turned the steering-wheel to port, the linkage (shown below and here) retracted the port wingtip, at the same time extending the starboard extension by the same amount. Thus {{there was no need for}} a rudder bar (or pedals); the pilot’s feet were not used for controlling the aircraft. Also mounted on the control column was a throttle lever; a button on the wheel enabled [...] "the Bosch high-tension magneto to be switched off for the purpose of switching off the engine".

60|$|It {{became evident}} {{now that there}} was not much chance of {{overtaking}} {{the main body of the}} burghers, and an attempt was therefore made to interpose a fresh force who might head them off. A line of posts existed between Thabanchu and Ladybrand, and Colonel Thorneycroft was stationed there with a <b>movable</b> <b>column.</b> It was Knox's plan therefore to prevent the Boers from breaking to the west and to head them towards the Basuto border. A small column under Parsons had been sent by Hunter from Bloemfontein, and pushed in upon the flank of De Wet, who had on the 12th got back to Dewetsdorp. Again the pursuit became warm, but De Wet's time was not yet come. He headed for Springhaan Nek, about fifteen miles east of Thabanchu. This pass is about four miles broad, with a British fort upon either side of it. There was only one way to safety, for Knox's mounted infantrymen and lancers were already dotting the southern skyline. Without hesitation the whole Boer force, now some 2500 strong, galloped at full speed in open order through the Nek, braving the long range fire of riflemen and guns. The tactics were those of French in his ride to Kimberley, and the success was as complete. De Wet's force passed through the last barrier which had been held against him, and vanished into the mountainous country round Ficksburg, where it could safely rest and refit.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to reveal and analyze {{resonance}} modes of a large-scale milling-drilling-boring machine. The <b>machine</b> has a <b>movable</b> <b>column</b> with vertical slot occupied by a symmetrical carriage with horizontal ram. Static rigidity of the machine is relatively low due to its large dimensions. So {{it is necessary to}} assess possible vibration activity. Virtual and operational trials of the machine have been carried out simultaneously. Modeling has been executed {{with the help of a}} finite element method (FEM). The FEM-model takes into account not only rigidity of machine structures but also flexibility of bearings, feed drive systems and guides. Modal FEM-analysis has revealed eight resonance modes that embrace the whole machine tool. They form a frequency interval from 12 to 75 Hz which is undesirable for machining. Three closely located resonances (31 - 37 Hz) are considered as the most dangerous ones. They represent various combinations of three simple motions: vertical oscillations of a carriage, horizontal vibrations of a ram and column torsion. Reliability of FEM- estimations has been proved by in-situ vibration measurements. An effect for stabilization of resonance modes has been detected while making variations in design parameters of the machine tool. For example, a virtual replacement of cast iron for steel in machine structures practically does not have any effect on resonance frequencies. Rigidity increase in some parts (e. g. a ram) has also a small effect on a resonance pattern. On the other hand, resonance stability makes it possible to avoid them while selecting a spindle rotation frequency. It is recommended to set double feed drives for all axes. A pair of vertical screws prevents a “pecking” resonance of the carriage at frequency of 54 Hz. It is necessary to foresee an operation of a main drive of such heavy machine tool in the above resonance interval with the spindle frequency of more than 75 Hz. For this purpose it is necessary to proceed to high-speed machining (HSM). </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{kill zone}} {{is an element}} of point ambush in which a {{military}} unit targets a single area with defensive fire such as mines, demolitions and guns. The kill zone may be bordered by obstacles, traps or indirect fire (artillery or mortars) to keep the enemy from escaping. In an area ambush, related multiple kill zones will be covered by multiple defensive units. The weapons of the kill zone are not fired until the majority of the enemy unit is within the kill zone, ideally all of the targeted unit. Defensive fire is initiated by the defensive unit leader who orders the most devastating weapons to be engaged, followed immediately by other weapons. The initial attack may be remote-controlled charges such as Claymore mines or other explosives. The ambushed unit may be prevented from advancing or retreating by explosions at the front and rear of their <b>column.</b> <b>Machine</b> gun and small arms fire may be augmented by indirect fire. Ideally, the action is completed so quickly that the enemy force has no time to report the engagement. A successful ambush may result in a patrol in the kill zone being destroyed in seconds. The ambush of a kill zone carries high risk in that forces not in the zone may maneuver around the flanks of the attackers, limiting their escape. Nearby forces may also come to the assistance of those caught in the attack. For this reason, a well-executed attack may be over in under a minute and rarely extends beyond a few minutes.|$|R

The company has a need of a real time inspection and control methodology so that new hires as well as experienced operators can produce machined parts with high quality and low scrap rates. This thesis project was conducted by Zhu, Zhang and Udayshankar as a team, developing and applying multiple components of SPC at Waters. Zhang's thesis focuses on Gage Repeatability & Reproducibility and Udayshankar's thesis focuses on standard operating procedures (SOPs). An SPC methodology flow chart is designed specifically for the company based on theoretical review of SPC methods and baseline data collection. Initially, the <b>column</b> <b>machining</b> process {{was out of control}} due to existing assignable causes such as tool breakage and tool wear. After an SOP is designed and operators trained to follow the SOP, the process was brought back into statistical control. A sampling plan is determined and individual control charts are used to achieve real time inspection in the long term. As a result, scrap rate was reduced from 8 % to 4 % and potential savings in the column area is higher than $ 200, 000. The SPC methodology will be scaled up to the entire machining center in the near future, which will have a potential annual savings of $ 600, 000. At the end of this thesis project, recommendations are made to Waters Corporation to help it maintain its status as a world class manufacturer. Major recommendations are to implement a database system for quality control, root cause analysis, training program and continuous process improvements. by Haipei Zhu. Thesis: M.
