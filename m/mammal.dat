5|$|The Marine <b>Mammal</b> Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) {{was passed}} on October 21, 1972 under {{president}} Richard Nixon {{to prevent the}} further depletion and possible extinction of marine <b>mammal</b> stocks. It prohibits the taking ("the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such") of any marine <b>mammal</b> without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Marine <b>Mammal</b> Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding walruses) and cetaceans.|$|E

50|$|While early <b>mammals</b> {{were small}} nocturnal animals that mostly ate soft plant {{material}} and small {{animals such as}} insects, {{the demise of the}} non-avian dinosaurs {{and the beginning of the}} Paleocene saw <b>mammals</b> growing bigger and occupying a wider variety of ecological niches.

5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive <b>mammal,</b> Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield <b>mammal,</b> was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental <b>mammal.</b> Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the <b>mammal</b> species {{recorded}} in Canada. There are approximately 200 <b>mammal</b> species native to Canada. Its large territorial size and variety of ecosystems, ranging from mountains to plains to urban housing, mean that Canada can harbour a great variety of species, including nearly half of the known cetaceans. The most well represented order is that of the rodents, and the smallest that of the Didelphimorphia (common opossums).|$|E
5|$|Another fossil {{from the}} Yixian Formation {{provides}} direct evidence of Psittacosaurus as a prey animal. One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont <b>mammal,</b> is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous <b>mammal</b> swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E

Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so <b>mammals</b> eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous <b>mammals</b> eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} <b>mammals.</b>|$|R
