40|$|Oviposition site {{selection}} {{can be viewed}} as an act of parental care; it is a life history trait with significant consequences for offspring development and success. Herbivorous insects may adopt different strategies for spreading their eggs (e. g. single oviposition events versus egg clustering). Host plant use results from the interplay of available cues and the responsiveness of the ovipositing female. We studied how egg-laying behaviour of individual females resulted in the egg distribution patterns observed at the population level in the ant-parasitic butterfly Maculinea alcon. Eggs are laid on <b>marsh</b> <b>gentians,</b> Gentiana pneumonanthe, but survival also depends on the presence of Myrmica host ants as young caterpillars leave the host plant and survive only after being adopted by ants. Several studies have focused on egg distribution patterns, but less so on the behavioural mechanisms behind the oviposition patterns. Our observational data show evidence for some level of egg clustering, as predicted by the obligate myrmecophilous lifestyle. There was no evidence of egg-laying avoidance when gentians already carried several eggs. Phenological time windows for oviposition on individual flower buds and gentians were much wider than reported before. Detailed tracking of egg-laying females in the field showed high rates of oviposition and suggest relatively high average levels of fecundity compared to fully herbivorous lycaenid butterflies. Results are discussed in relation to adaptive oviposition strategies of this highly specialist ant parasite of conservation concern. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Other regular wildlife visitors include red deer, roe deer and muntjac, barn owls are regularly seen hunting over the site and other bird species of interest include crossbills, jack snipe and turtle dove.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecological}} {{value of the}} New Forest is enhanced by the relatively large areas of lowland habitats, lost elsewhere, which have survived. There are several kinds of important lowland habitat including valley bogs, alder carr, wet heaths, dry heaths and deciduous woodland. The area contains a profusion of rare wildlife, including the New Forest cicada Cicadetta montana, the only cicada native to Great Britain, although the last unconfirmed sighting was in 2000. The wet heaths are important for rare plants, such as <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian</b> (Gentiana pneumonanthe) and marsh clubmoss (Lycopodiella inundata) and other important species include the wild gladiolus (Gladiolus illyricus).|$|E
50|$|The Utrechtse Heuvelrug is {{the second}} largest forest area in the Netherlands. In the forest some relics from the {{original}} post-glacial forests can be found, including oak and beech. In the park several marten species can be found, such as the European badger (Meles meles) and the European pine marten (Martes martes). There are more than 100 bird species living in the park, among which the black woodpecker, the raven and the bluethroat. In the marshy region near Amerongen castle the little bittern is a rare species, as well as rare plants like sundew and <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian.</b> In addition, several amphibian, reptile, bat, butterflies and dragonflies species {{are living in the}} region.|$|E
50|$|Since 1990 land {{improvement}} measures have been partially reversed. Wet biotopes with wet meadows and bogs have been recreated out of pasture and arable land. As a result, several threatened species {{of plant and animal}} have established themselves here. osprey, falcon, otter, great crested newt and grass snake have been seen once more. The Lewitz is a popular stopover for wild geese, crane and other migratory birds. Amongst the rare plants in the Lewitz are orchids, Pasqueflower, common tormentil and <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian.</b> The Lewitz is today both a protected area and nature reserve.

50|$|The Misselhorn Heath, with {{a section}} {{that is known}} as the Tiefental, has an area of about 209 ha. It begins 2 km east of Hermannsburg and {{consists}} predominantly of heath. These are almost exclusively covered by the common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Only occasionally, in the wetter locations, is the cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix) also found. bladderworts (Utricularia), an endangered genus of carnivorous plants that occur in fresh water and wet soil, are found in several, smaller, boggy or wet locations, as is the spoonleaf sundew (Drosera intermedia), another protected carnivorous plant. Other plants found here include the protected common lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica), which is on the red list of endangered vascular plants in Germany, and the rare <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian</b> (Gentiana pneumonanthe). Cottongrass is also found very occasionally in these reserves.The Schillohsberg Heath has an area of about 73 ha. It lies east of Lutterloh. It is a genuine heathland habitat, like the Weesener Weg Heathland which have an area of about 11 ha and lie immediately north of Lutterloh.|$|E
50|$|Trees and grasses are not {{the only}} {{vegetation}} in the dunes though. The sandy dune heaths in Thy National Park are a rare habitat in a European context, and they are to be protected by law, so they have been a major contributory factor in establishing the national park. It is a continuous job trying to preserve them from invading flora. The larger animals are grazing excess vegetation, trees are sometimes uprooted and controlled burning is carried out occasionally, to give the sandy heath a chance. The heath vegetation might look simple to the untrained eye, but is in fact very varied, dominated by common heather, sand sedge, marram grass, the edible black crowberry, bell heather and various lichens. The sandy heaths of Thy attract many birds with some very rare breeders (in Denmark), such as crane and wood sandpiper and they form a habitat for a variety of smaller animals like the natterjack toad and many insects. The wet hollows in between support quite different plants such as bog bilberry, bayberry, <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian,</b> cranberry and a variety of sundew.|$|E
40|$|Allerthorpe Common is one {{of three}} {{remaining}} heathlands on sandy glacial soil in the Vale of York. During the 1960 Õs, Allerthorpe Common was extensively afforested with pine so that heathland communities are now largely confined to a 6 hectare nature reserve, and an unplanted area in the northeast corner of the common. Heather Calluna vulgaris, cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix, purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea, and cotton grass Eriophorum angustifolium form a mosaic of wet and dry heath communities, into which birch woodland has encroached in places as a result of seral succession. There is a small population of <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian</b> Gentiana pneumonanthe, a species which is uncommon nationally and now restricted to 38 localities mainly in the south of England. A particular feature of the nature reserve is a large stand of marsh cinquefoil Potentilla palustris. The heathland bird community includes breeding nightjar, tree pipit and whinchat.

40|$|The {{timing of}} {{oviposition}} and {{selection of the}} phenological stage of the host plant can have significant consequences for development and success of offspring, and is particularly important for endangered specialist species with rare habitats, such as Phengaris alcon butterflies. Females of this species oviposit on marsh gentians, Gentiana pneumonanthe. For the first time, we evaluate the survival of eggs deposited by early and late flyers {{in relation to the}} phenological stage of <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian</b> flower buds, as well as caterpillar survival and development. An analysis was conducted on 127 gentian shoots, on which 837 eggs were monitored. We observed more frequent oviposition on the apical and youngest buds, with increased egg load by females during the first one-third of the flight period. Offspring survival of about 55 % was observed, with up to 15 caterpillars per bud. Offspring survival was significantly higher from eggs that were oviposited on larger flower buds and on flower buds in an early developmental stage. Also, early flyers’ offspring gave rise to better survival rates and the caterpillar development in flower buds differed significantly according to bud size, with more days required in smaller buds. Finally, the significant differences found across the entire study period illustrate that the understanding of oviposition through time is important to the conservation of this rare European species...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{expected}} consequences {{of climate change}} are shifts in species’ ranges. Most of current methods to predict such shifts in species distributions consider changes in suitability of climatic conditions for existence. With these models, {{it is possible to}} indicate the potential distribution of species that would arise under spatial conditions that cause unlimited landscape accessibility and habitat suitability. At the regional scale, however, detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance are pivotal for conservation planning. This study aims to predict species occurrences at the regional scale, incorporating demographic processes and dispersal to assess habitat accessibility and suitability in detail. We investigated a system with trophic dependence: the Alcon blue butter¿y (Phengaris alcon) is fully dependent on the occurrence of its host plant species <b>marsh</b> <b>gentian</b> (Gentiana pneumonanthe). We applied a model chain, consisting of a soil and biomass model, a plant species occurrence and dispersal model and a butter¿y metapopulation model. We investigated the effect of future climate change, both under affected and unaffected habitat conditions as determined by host plant occurrence. Our modelled results show that the butter¿ies perform best when habitat conditions remain unaffected by climate change. However, when climate change does affect the occurrence of its host plant species, butter¿y distribution and performance will be deteriorated. This implies that detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance should incorporate dispersal, demographic processes and biotic interactions explicitly. Our approach allows for the identi¿cation of locations that are potentially suitable for the measures increasing network robustness for P. alcon...|$|E
