40|$|Melozone biarcuata (Prevost 2 ̆ 7 s Ground-sparrow) has {{traditionally}} been divided into two allopatric groups based on differences in vocalizations and plumage characteristics: <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi in Costa Rica and <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> biarcuata/M. b. hartwegi in northern Central America. However, {{the relationship between these}} subspecies has not been studied using a modern taxonomic approach. In this study, our objective was to provide the first detailed taxonomic comparison between these three subspecies using an integrative multi-trait analysis. We analyzed morphometric features, qualitative plumage patterns, and quantitative plumage measurements using spectral reflectance from all three subspecies, and we analyzed vocalizations for subspecies <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> biarcuata and <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi. Our results show that <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi can be readily distinguished from the two other subspecies on the basis of morphometrics (<b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi are smaller), plumage patterns (<b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi have different facial markings and plumage patches), color differences (<b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi have plumage patches that differ in color and brightness), and vocalizations (<b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi have songs and calls that are acoustically distinct from those of <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> biarcuata). By contrast, the two northern subspecies <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> biarcuata and <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> hartwegi were very similar for most traits, supporting previous suggestions that the two northern subspecies should be considered a single subspecies. Our data reveal that the differentiation in phenotypic characteristics between <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi versus <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> biarcuata and <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> hartwegi is similar to that reported for other complexes of subspecies where species status has been recognized. We argue that <b>M.</b> <b>b.</b> cabanisi should be treated as a species separate from M. biarcuata and propose that it be called Melozone cabanisi, White-faced Ground-sparrow. Our findings will contribute to the conservation efforts of the White-faced Ground-sparrow, which is endemic to Costa Rica 2 ̆ 7 s Central Valley and Turrialba Valley, by bringing focus to conservation policies that preserve ground-sparrow habitat (thickets, shade coffee plantations, and young secondary forest).

As análises físico-químicas constaram da determinação do pH e da concentração do cloridrato de poli-hexametileno biguanida (P. H. <b>M.</b> <b>B.),</b> cobre, cálcio, zinco e formalina. As análises microbiológicas {{realizadas}} foram contagem de microrganismos aeróbios ou facultativos mesófilos e anaeróbios mesófilos.
