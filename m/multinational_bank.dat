Part one of the article gave some background on the taxation of <b>multinational</b> <b>banks,</b> followed by a discussion of their uniqueness, and the theoretical benefits of the unitary tax model for <b>multinational</b> <b>banking.</b> Part 2 below covers the practical implications of accepting formulary apportionment as an 'optimal' regime for taxing <b>multinational</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} <b>multinational</b> <b>banks</b> have {{characteristics}} which are unique and distinguishable from traditional multinational entities. The first distinguishing {{feature is the}} unique nature of the services and consequent products supplied by <b>multinational</b> <b>banks,</b> which are aimed at meeting client global demand. The second distinguishing feature is the non-traditional organisational structure that is adopted. This structure, also designed to meet client global demand, introduces issues previously not recognised in the traditional taxation system, which is designed for the structure of traditional multinational entities. The unique differences between traditional multinational entities and <b>multinational</b> <b>banks</b> means there may be {{the need for a}} distinct international tax regime. It is argued that there are “outmoded economic assumptions” upon which the present tax laws relating to <b>multinational</b> <b>banks</b> are based. An examination of the unique nature of <b>multinational</b> <b>banks</b> leads {{to the conclusion that the}} appropriate tax treatment of these banks is different from the appropriate tax treatment of multinational entities generally...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{identifies}} {{a number}} of recent trends in European cross-border banking. The authors first distinguish between two main modes of international banking: cross-border versus <b>multinational</b> <b>banking.</b> Cross-border banking occurs when a bank in country A lends directly to a borrower in country B. <b>Multinational</b> <b>banking,</b> on the other hand, takes place when a bank in country A lends to a borrower in country B via a local bank affiliate (a branch or a subsidiary) in country B. The chapter describes which countries rely more on cross-border banking and which ones on <b>multinational</b> <b>banking</b> and assess how both forms of banking integration fared during the recent crises. The remainder of the chapter then focuses on trends in European banks’ funding structures, the source countries of cross-border and <b>multinational</b> <b>banking,</b> and the recent growth of corporate bond markets in Europe as an alternative to bank credit...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a stream}} of {{information}} from recent research, as well as analytical interpretations, we still lack a general picture of pre- 1914 <b>multinational</b> <b>banking</b> based on a unifying empirical approach comparable to that recently developed by financial economists for the wave of <b>banks</b> <b>multinational</b> expansion {{in the late twentieth}} century. The main purpose of this article, based on a unique dataset covering the foreign branches of British, French and German banks from 1880 to 1913, is to test in a similar theoretically-driven fashion the determinants of <b>multinational</b> <b>banking</b> during the first globalisation. The empirical strategy is based on an augmented gravity model in which geography and institutions interact with economic factors in determining the patterns of <b>multinational</b> <b>banking.</b> Contrary to what has emerged from recent studies on present <b>multinational</b> <b>banking,</b> I find that the fundamentals of pre- 1914 foreign branching cannot easily be fitted into a gravity-like model, and that no unifying pattern of foreign expansion can be inferred from the data. ...|$|R

We find that parent banks trade-off lending across several countries (“substitution effect”) and that they support weak subsidiaries (“support effect”). This provides evidence for the existence of internal capital markets through which <b>multinational</b> <b>banks</b> manage the credit growth of their subsidiaries. Greenfield subsidiaries are most closely integrated into such internal capital markets. <b>multinational</b> <b>banks,</b> credit supply, internal capital markets...|$|R

40|$|The Zimbabwean banking {{sector has}} been characterised {{by a number}} of {{corporate}} governance disorders. This study aimed at analysing the corporate governance practices by <b>multinational</b> <b>banks</b> in comparison to domestic banks in Zimbabwe. It was hoped that the research would reveal the corporate governance discrepancies between <b>multinational</b> and domestic <b>banks</b> and hence assist the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in pursuing its supervisory role as well as bring awareness to stakeholders in the banking industry. The research adopted a cross-sectional survey research design. The target population consisted of all commercial and merchant banks in Zimbabwe. Primary data was gathered through questionnaires and interviews. Secondary data was also analysed in the research. The selection of the banks {{to be included in the}} sample employed stratified random sampling to ensure representation from each key group of banks in the sample. The study revealed that the awareness on the importance of sound corporate governance practices was of substandard levels for both bank categories. Domestic banks, in particular, had more shortfalls compared to <b>multinational</b> <b>banks.</b> Results further revealed that domestic banks did not represent shareholders? interests in their corporate governance practices and their levels of compliance to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe?s corporate governance requirements was still lacking.
