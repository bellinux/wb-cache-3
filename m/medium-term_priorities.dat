40|$|Cambodia's {{growth over}} 1998 - 2008 has been {{remarkable}} (almost 10 percent per annum for a decade). This paper applies a"growth diagnostic"approach {{to understand how}} this happened {{and how it can}} be sustained. Past growth has been driven by the coincidence of a set of historical and geographic factors (including opportunistic policy responses), together with the use of natural assets (although in a non sustainable way) and the elaboration of productive sector-specific governance arrangements. Several of these factors are unfortunately not self-sustaining and the global economic crisis of 2008 - 09 is exposing these vulnerabilities. A growth diagnostic flags a number of short-term priorities to ensure the competitiveness of existing industries, as well as more <b>medium-term</b> <b>priorities</b> for the country to continue attracting foreign investment and start mobilizing more domestic savings. A key economic policy objective is the diversification of the economy, which requires a reduction in unproductive risks and costs as well as creative solutions to coordination failures.

One of the first short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>priorities</b> in each country was to establish and consolidate standardization and conformity assessment structures. While the concept of “deeper integration beyond abolition of import tariffs and quotas, to further measures to remove market segmentation and promote integration ” (Venables 2000) is by and large not questioned, critical views on potential losses of national standards harming national identity – i. e., what constitutes “rum”, and how to address cheeses made from non-pasteurized sheep milk – are seen as well. The issue of “lost national standards ” is repeated: in 1987 the EU (then European Community) published its visionary plan on new, standardized Europe of 1992; a gain of 7 per cent of European income was estimated from harmonization (Emerson 1988, p. 6). Even then British were opposed to some parts of it, claiming “brilliant green mushy peas ” and “pink sausages ” are part of their national identity, and eventually succeeded in getting the necessary exemptions (Krugman and Obstfeld 2002).

It puts the current tax structure in its historic context, showing {{that there has been}} a steady movement towards simplification. The personal income tax has a lower than average number of bands and, taxes capital income at an unusually low rate. Such a structure favours saving, especially since consumption taxes are particularly high. Nonetheless, there are a number of additional taxes on capital income that serve to raise the overall tax on assets, notably the tax on net wealth. The paper concludes that, if the current budget surplus persists over the <b>medium-term,</b> <b>priority</b> should be given to further reducing corporate taxes and the net wealth tax. At the same time, a number of discriminatory indirect taxes should be replaced by a uniform tax, and the diesel tax reformed. Consideration should also be given to the gradual introduction of a resource tax or to auctioning fishing quotas to help fund the other tax reductions. JEL classification: H...|$|R

It focuses in particular on the impact of public transfers, trends in social spending, the mechanisms by which social vulnerability is reproduced and changing intergenerational and gender relations. These changes pose significant challenges for the role played by the State, the market and families in jointly meeting needs related to the population's welfare. The document is divided into two parts. Part 1 includes the usual chapter on poverty and income distribution in the region and a second chapter that examines these issues in greater depth through an analysis of social spending, monetary transfers and conditional cash transfer programmes. The third chapter examines poverty and social vulnerability in light of the crisis and post-crisis situation and analyses how the countries' social protection systems can mitigate these effects of the crisis. Part 2 focuses on the care economy. It includes a chapter on paid and unpaid work from a gender perspective, highlighting inequalities and outstanding debts in the sexual division of labour; a chapter that looks at population projections and trends and underscores the pressing short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>priorities</b> for care work; and a final chapter on the policy implications of these transformations...|$|E
40|$|Presented {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on commercial suburbanization {{in terms of the}} Prague agglomeration specific aspects and assessment of some of its impacts on the affected locations. The aim is to identify local economic structures from the perspective of commercial suburbanization and assess their level of socio-economic significance in the suburban zone of Prague and their influence on the design of local <b>medium-term</b> <b>priorities.</b> This objective is further specified in terms of the five partial aims and five hypotheses. Monitored spatial units are analyzed at the level of municipalities, administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers and districts of Prague-East and Prague-West. The work represents the first comprehensive attempt to assess the extent of commercial suburbanization in the suburban area of Prague by using index methods. With the use of indexes, impacts of commercial suburbanization have been evaluated, especially the level of local action of companies and the formation of local markets in those local areas. The analysis shows that there is a greater degree of formation of local labor markets compared to rather negligible degree of formation of local markets of goods and services. Local economic structures continue to shape significantly in the regional centers of lower category rather than in the suburban zone of Prague. Following part of the thesis analyzes the socio-economic situation in the selected suburbanized municipality and reflection of key aspects of suburbanization in its medium-term development priorities and brings also a generalization of the findings.

40|$|Approaches that {{prioritise}} chemicals {{according to}} their importance as environmental contaminants have been developed by government agencies and private industries. However, it has been noticed that few approaches, such as one published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), {{address the needs of}} the drinking water industry. There is also no generic approach to the selection, prioritisation and monitoring of organic contaminants in the drinking water value chain. To safeguard drinking water industry customers, it was necessary to develop a generic protocol to assist with the identification of a list of organic contaminants for monitoring in the drinking water value chain. Once the protocol was developed, it was validated in a prototype drinking water value chain. This paper describes the implementation of such a generic protocol. The exercise comprised of testing each step of the protocol, from selection of the ‘pool of organic contaminants’ (Step I) to recommending the final priority list of organic contaminants (Step VII). Successful implementation of the protocol took place in the Rand Water (South Africa) drinking water value chain (from catchment to tap). Expert judgment was emphasized during the implementation as each step was validated and the opinion of key stakeholders used to shape the process. The tailor-made prioritisation criteria, reflecting the drinking water industry perspective, proved to be successful in selecting and prioritising organic contaminants for monitoring in the drinking water value chain. The organic contaminants were successfully prioritised in 3 classes: short-term <b>priority</b> for analysis, <b>medium-term</b> <b>priority</b> for analysis and long-term priority for analysis. This is a very important guide to assist water utilities in optimising their resources while not compromising the role of public health protection.

40|$|M. Comm. (Financial Economics) Enterprise risk {{management}} (ERM) {{is emerging as}} a {{risk management}} methodology that is seemingly superior to that of traditional, silo-based risk management. Although ERM implementation is on the increase, research into ERM is still limited. There is, for instance, a lack of clarity within the literature regarding which factors lead to companies embracing ERM, {{as well as a}} lack of consensus on ERM’s benefits. The {{purpose of this study was}} therefore to explore the drivers of ERM implementation, its inhibitors and enablers, the benefits that are realised through ERM, as well as the advantages and disadvantages associated with ERM as a risk management methodology. Data were gathered through semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with seven risk practitioners working in the South African mining industry. The study found that drivers of ERM implementation include regulatory pressure and compliance with corporate governance and listing requirements, but that there are other incentives. Inhibitors of ERM implementation include the large amount of managerial time needed, competition with other initiatives, resistance, and low initial buy-in levels, as well as a shortage of experienced ERM practitioners. Regarding ERM enablers, the design of the ERM framework is seen as critical, as is sound project discipline in planning and organising the implementation, along with visible support from executive and senior management, and ongoing training. Benefits derived through ERM include greater confidence that the company has a complete understanding of its risk profile, better decision-making, and improved tracking of risk mitigation. Disadvantages associated with ERM include the tendency of it being regarded as a corporate administrative function, subjectivity, and difficulty in aligning ERM to short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>priorities,</b> as compared to longer-term strategic issues. This study makes a unique contribution to the existing body of knowledge on ERM by exploring the disadvantages associated with ERM as a risk management methodology. At a practical level and with reference to the South African mining industry, in particular, this study provides more clarity on the rationale for adopting ERM, as well as the challenges associated with implementing and sustaining ERM programmes. Recommendations are made with respect to ERM in practice, as well as for further research on ERM...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess recent {{strategic}} sustainability policy, planning and assessment efforts in Victoria, Australia. Design/methodology/approach - An interpretive approach to policy analysis provides the methodological foundation for the analysis. Evidence is drawn from the analysis of policy texts and semi-structured interviews. Findings - Sustainability attracted considerable policy attention in Victoria during the first decade of the 21 st century, with stated ambitions for Victoria to become "the sustainable state" and "world leaders in environmental sustainability". In pursuing these ambitions, Victoria&# 039;s efforts centred on hosting a summit, articulating <b>medium-term</b> directions and <b>priorities,</b> releasing a whole of government framework to advance sustainability, and establishing a Department of Sustainability and Environment, and a Commissioner for Environmental Sustainability. However, the evidence indicates these efforts would have benefited from greater public engagement and input, stronger governance arrangements, and a broader conceptualisation of sustainability. Practical implications - The evidence presented highlights the implications associated with efforts to promote sustainability through strategic policy and planning processes. Originality/value - This paper provides an informed, yet policy relevant, analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and possibilities associated with pursuing sustainability at the sub-national level. It also highlights the ways in which policy objectives can be frustrated by failing to establish the solid foundations necessary for building a robust approach to promoting sustainability. The value of progressing sustainability within a strategic improvement cycle is also highlighted...|$|R

Sound economic fundamentals and timely and forceful policy {{responses to the}} crisis, including fiscal stimulus, contributed to rapid economic recovery in the ASEAN- 5. As growth rebounds, these economies are beginning to identify, communicate and implement their strategies for unwinding the fiscal stimulus while addressing long-term growth challenges. In this context, the paper highlights the need for fiscal policies to address infrastructure gaps, stimulate private consumption and expand social safety nets. Creating fiscal space to address these challenges will require raising revenues and reorienting public spending rather than increasing borrowing. Supporting structural reforms, aiming to stimulate private infrastructure investment, could help address long-term growth challenges, while easing the burden on fiscal policy.

40|$|Engagement by the European {{retail sector}} in {{innovation}} is a pre-requisite to the deepening of the Innovation Union. To this end, the European Retail Action Plan established a high-level expert group to recommend possible short- and <b>medium-term</b> <b>priority</b> actions to help increase the sector’s competitiveness through innovation. The {{increased awareness of}} {{the potential of the}} retail sector to contribute in this way derives from the sector’s scale and role: European retailing generated € 2. 6 tn in sales in 2011 from 3. 7 mn businesses (15 % of all European businesses) and € 451 bn in value added. It employs 18. 6 mn people: the largest employment sector in the region. Retailing is also the closest sector to the citizen and consumer in the value chain. This not only permits but requires retail firms to achieve effective co-ordination and development of customer-centric innovation. However, the external perception by many of the retail sector is that firms of all sizes are poorinnovators by comparison with other sectors, and are poorly represented in terms of traditional markers of innovation intensity. This perception largely arises because retailers innovate differently. Whilst retail businesses can be product and process innovators, as well as engaging successfully with both technological and non-technological innovation, many larger retail firms are also marketing, organizational and open innovators, as they seek to co-ordinate not just product and process innovation, but innovation in their value propositions across the value networks in which they operate. The nature of competitive retail markets means that retail firms often exhibit more incremental than radical innovation practices. The geographical and enterprise structure of the retail sector are also important considerations in understanding differential propensity to innovate. Some European markets are at different stages in their retail development. And whilst the European retail sector is the largest private economic sector within the EU 28 in terms of enterprises and employment, it is still highly fragmented, with integrated national chains only accounting for 0. 1 % of all enterprises, although 45 % of the sector’s value added. The sector is intensely entrepreneurial, with over 5. 3 mn self-employed individuals engaged in retailing. The customer-centric nature of retail innovation demands that the process is not just about incrementally improving efficiency in the sector but is also concerned with achieving greater effectiveness in the customer’s experience of the retail offer. Retail innovation is as much an art as a science. At its heart, retail innovation will only be successful if it can substantially increase customers’ quality of life throughout the shopping experience. The future trajectory of innovation within the retail sector is influenced by a number of external and internal drivers of change. The first, and by far the most important, external driver of innovation is the consumer. European consumers are exhibiting several components of change that, in combination, are creating new opportunities for firms. Highly competitive and challenging economic conditions stimulate the development of innovations that lead to cost efficiency, low prices and a higher level of consumer welfare in both the short- and long-run. Digital technologies are acting as transformational drivers of the sector, with consumers at their heart. Regulatory drivers serve to shape the sector’s scale, growth and characteristics, but also influence the kinds of innovations that can be profitablybrought forward. Within the sector, organizational drivers stimulate the development of a culture supportive of creativity, and a lean, flexible organizational structure within which such ideas can be implemented. Finally, the broader value networks within which retailers operate are allowing the larger retailers {{to play the role of}} an ‘innovation hub’ pulling together partners’ expertise and allowing them to share the risk and cost of innovation. We identify five barriers to innovation of particular significance to the retail sector: a lack ofawareness (both amongst retailers of the existence of and ways of participating in existing EUinnovation initiatives, as well as the relative lack of visibility of the sector’s contribution amongst policymakers and society), costs (meaning that it can be hard to secure the finance required to support radical innovation projects given the tight margins within which even the largest firms operate), availability of human resources (notably the scarcity of appropriately skilled labour), risks (particularly for retail SMEs) and regulatory constraints (notably those that presently hinder the completion of the Single Market for services). Our recommendations are narrowly retail innovation-specific. They are generated from a clearer understanding of the characteristics of the phenomenon within retailing and are made not just to the Commission, but to other stakeholders - who have the capacity to influence the future nature, pace and incidence of innovation within European retail firms. Four recommendations seek to build better awareness amongst policymakers of the potentialcontribution of retail innovation to competitiveness, as well as encouraging the development of mechanisms that might help retail firms identify specific opportunities to engage in innovation. These include ways of stimulating greater policymaker engagement with the sector, the auditing of existing initiatives, platforms and programmes, the encouragement of sector participation in European Technology Platforms, and ways of proactively identifying and prioritizing areas of relevance to the sector where harmonization of standards would enhance European retail innovation capability. Six recommendations are designed to prompt greater participation by retail firms of all sizes and sectors in European innovation funding and projects. These include ensuring calls for the Horizon 2020 programme are more relevant to the needs and interest of the sector (including consideration of the funding formulae) and the development of a network of retail laboratories. There is particular consideration given here to the specific needs of retail SMEs, including ways of delivering greater awareness of COSME funding and facilitation, a proposed fast-track route to funding, and asking the existing SME Helpdesk (Your Europe – Business) to make provision for retail SMEs which, after all, make up 20 % of all European SMEs. Four recommendations work to identify, stimulate and support relevant investment in retail skills and education that will increase the potential for innovation and growth in the sector. Here, the Group encourages the work of the Committee for Retail Sector Social Dialogue and the recently established EU Retail Sectoral Skills Council places a priority on co-ordination of support for innovation-related skills training and recruitment activity. It urges the development of ways of exposing senior retail managers to customer-centric innovation through mechanisms such as design thinking and encourages universities, research institutes and member state research councils to engage in more innovationrelevant knowledge exchange activity. In addition, it proposes the establishment of more widespread R&D voucher schemes and support for social networks for information sharing amongst retail SMEs in respect of innovation. Finally, three recommendations in relation to regulatory issues seek to ensure that policymakers use a ‘retail reflex’ in their thinking. This is in particular recognition of the fact that innovation in retailing spans firms, geographies and value chains - including consumers - and that unforeseen consequences for can arise from the design of other policies and regulations in respect of their effects on the capacity for retail innovation...|$|R
