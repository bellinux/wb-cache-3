25|$|The best (but least used) <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> {{coffee is}} using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and {{fermented}} coffee is spread thinly on raised beds, {{which allows the}} air to pass {{on all sides of}} the coffee, and then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.|$|E
25|$|Processing {{of coffee}} in India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing is the traditional <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet processing method, coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, the beans are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. The beans of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E

2500|$|However, in {{the first}} years of {{production}} from 1908 to 1913, the Model T was not available in black but rather only gray, green, blue, and red. [...] Green was available for the touring cars, town cars, coupes, and Landaulets. Gray was only available for the town cars, and red only for the touring cars. By 1912, all cars were being painted midnight blue with black fenders. Only in 1914 was the [...] "any color so long as it is black" [...] policy finally implemented. It is often stated that Ford suggested the use of black from 1914 to 1926 due to the cheap cost and durability of black paint. During the lifetime production of the Model T, over 30 types of black paint were used on various parts of the car. These were formulated to satisfy the different means of applying the paint to the various parts, and had distinct drying times, depending on the part, paint, and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying.</b>|$|E

40|$|Fruits are {{essential}} food items as {{they play a}} vital role in the diet of humans. Fresh fruits are highly perishable and bulky commodities because they contain high moisture. Hence, their transportation to distant places is costly and their condition on arrival in the importing country may be less than satisfactory. Postharvest loss of fruits in Ethiopia is very high. This could be due to their perishable nature, poor postharvest handling and lack of cheap and appropriate postharvest technology. Hence, much effort is needed in the area of generating efficient, low-cost, indigenous technology that minimizes postharvest loss of fruits. One <b>of</b> these <b>methods</b> is to produce local value-added products through the development of micro- and small-scale agro-industries. Solar <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> fruits is one of such agro-industries that can enhance the shelf life of fruits. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the potentials and possible <b>methods</b> and procedures <b>of</b> solar <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> fruits in Ethiopia with major emphasis on <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> and types <b>of</b> solar dryers; nutritive value <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> fruits, influence <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> on quality and utilization <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> products; basic procedures for solar drying, and problems and opportunities in the country to begin fruit solar drying as a business.
