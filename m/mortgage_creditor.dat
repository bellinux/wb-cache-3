40|$|Abstract: The recent {{explosion}} in personal bankruptcy filings has motivated research into whether credit markets are being {{adversely affected by}} generous legal provisions. Empirically, this question is examined by comparing credit conditions and bankruptcy exemptions across states. We note that the literature has focused on aggregate household credit, making no distinction between secured and unsecured credit. We argue that such aggregation obscures important differences in forms of credit. Most significantly, property exemptions do not prevent the home <b>mortgage</b> <b>creditor</b> from foreclosing on the home if not fully repaid. We argue that some property exemptions may in fact have some beneficial effects for home mortgage lenders. Using both household-level data and state-level data, we show that in the 1990 's high exemption levels have tended to reduce mortgage rates and reduce the probability of being denied a mortgage.

30|$|In that context, <b>mortgage</b> <b>creditors</b> {{would like}} to enforce their claims outside {{bankruptcy}} via mortgage foreclosures, but they are quite slow and expensive. According to European Mortgage Federation (2007), their total costs are between the 10 and 12  % {{of the price of}} allocation and their usual length is between 15 and 25 months. As a result, the response of creditors is to rely more on some types of collateral—such as personal guarantees and accounts receivable—that can be realised directly by secured creditors and are not diluted by preferential creditors. These collateral types are used more often than mortgage collateral (Davydenko and Franks 2008).|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} Serbian {{mortgage}} {{law is not}} too long. The mortgage law began in first half of XIX century. The first Act about mortgage was The Intabulation Law from 1839. year. Mortgage is a right of lien on an immovable which authorizes the creditor to seek satisfaction of his claim {{for the value of}} such immovable before of other creditors that do not have mortgage on it, as well as before creditors who have acquired mortgage on such immovable subsequent on him, irrespective of a contingent change of owner of the encumbered immovable. The mortgage was based on some rules. The mortgage is accessory rights. One of the basic features of a security right is its dependence on the claim. The <b>mortgage</b> <b>creditor</b> is entitled to request satisfaction of the claim from the value of immovable encumbered by mortgage, regardless of whether it is still in possession of the mortgage debitor or it has been convened into ownership of a third party. This The Intabulation Law is changed twice. For the first time in 1842 year, and second time in 1853. year. The lack of both changes was missing the principle of speciality. Principle of speciality marks the fact that a guarantee (security), may secure only a definite claim of one creditor and that the guarantee may exist only on a definite set of objects (assets). On one hand speciality of real security interest forbids securing an indefinite number of claims or an indefinite amount of claim, and, on the other, forbids the prospect of indefinite assets, or all assets of the debitor be subject of to such a security interest. This lack are eliminate in the new Intabulation Law from 1854. year, which was incorporated into Serbian Civil Code from 1844. year. The subject of this article is The Intabulation Law from 1854. year...|$|E

40|$|A chattel {{mortgage}} contract is {{the expression of}} a real guarantee that gives the creditor precedence over other creditors, in addition to the general pledge upon the belongings of the debtor.

40|$|Using {{detailed}} information on lobbying and mortgage lending activities, we find that lenders lobbying more on issues related to mortgage lending (i) had higher loan-to-income ratios, (ii) securitized more intensively, and (iii) had faster growing portfolios. Ex-post, delinquency rates are higher in areas where lobbyist'' lending grew faster and they experienced negative abnormal stock returns during key crisis events. The findings are robust to (i) falsification tests using lobbying on issues unrelated to mortgage lending, (ii) a difference-in-difference approach based on state-level laws, and (iii) instrumental variables strategies. These results show that lobbying lenders engage in riskier lending.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} mortgage covered bonds {{as an alternative to}} the originate-to-distribute mortgage funding model. It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of mortgage loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.

40|$|My {{research}} has two main themes [...] - {{the link between}} political economy and economic development, and the causes and effects of economic crises and long recessions. This dissertation samples from some of this ongoing research. The relationship between economic development and democracy is key in political economy. Many commentators have suggested that economic growth increases support for democracy. One proposed mechanism is that modernization, by reducing the demand for low-skilled labor, increases the willingness of elites, particularly in agriculture, to extend the franchise. In Chapter 1 I use subnational variation in South Africa to test this mechanism. I employ national shocks to the mining sector's demand for native black workers and cross-sectional variation in labor market competition induced by apartheid to estimate the effect of black labor scarcity on wages, capital intensity, and changes in partisan voting preferences. I find that reductions in the supply of foreign mine labor following the sudden withdrawal of workers from Malawi and Mozambique (and the increased demand for native black workers) increased mechanization on the mines and on farms competing with mines for labor. I then show that these induced structural changes resulted in differential increases in pro-political reform vote shares in the open districts relative to closed districts, even as mining districts became more conservative and voted more to maintain the non-democratic regime. Chapter 2 also explores {{issues related to the}} close relationships between economic and political institutions. In this chapter, together with my coauthor Sebastien Turban, we show how sovereign debt spreads are impacted by news about executive term limits. Political institutions matter for countries' cost of borrowing. We use an event-study to analyze the markets' response to new information about executive term limits over 101 events in seven emerging markets. Investors respond significantly to news about restrictions on those limits, lowering risk spreads. The one day abnormal returns following news about a restriction is 2 percentage points. Over ten days, the cumulative abnormal return is 5 percentage points. News about term limits extensions are not significant in the medium run. The results are robust to a non-parametric test and are confirmed when looking at the behavior of sovereign CDS prices. Chapter 3 starts the second part of this dissertation which is an investigation into the housing-related aspects of the recent crisis which began as a "subprime crisis" before it became the "Great Recession". In particular, this chapter focuses on the institutional details underpinning these markets. It also serves to set up the analysis in the following chapter which looks at one of the potentially important mechanisms which amplified the severity of the housing crisis. One important feature emerging from this analysis is that it appears that protections for home <b>mortgage</b> <b>creditors</b> were strengthened in the period preceding the subprime crisis. This may have both increased lending, but also the difficulty of modifying home loans ex post. This is more problematic to the extent that there are negative externalities from foreclosures. Chapter 4, co-authored work with David Munroe, shows that completed foreclosures cause neighboring foreclosure lings. We estimate this relationship using administrative data on home foreclosures and sales in Cook County, IL, instrumenting completed foreclosures with randomly assigned chancery-court judges. A completed foreclosure causes 0. 5 to 0. 7 additional foreclosure lings within 0. 1 miles, an effect that persists for several years. Contagion is driven by borrowers on the margins of default, not those severely at risk. We find evidence that borrowers learn about lender behavior from neighboring foreclosures. Finally, a foreclosure causes an increase in housing sales among relatively low-quality properties...|$|R
