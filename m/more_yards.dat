5|$|Virginia Tech {{entered the}} game headed by star quarterback Michael Vick, {{who led the}} Hokies to a 101 regular-season record despite being injured for {{a part of the}} season. Clemson entered the game with a regular-season record of 92 under the command of head coach Tommy Bowden, who was in the second year of his tenure. The contest {{featured}} two high-scoring offenses that emphasized different aspects of the game. These aspects were exemplified in the game, which saw Clemson pass for <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> than Virginia Tech, while the Hokies ran for <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> than the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|His {{abilities}} seemingly in decline, Johnson {{was traded}} to Pittsburgh in 1960, where he had the most productive years of his career, recording two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He remains the oldest player to record a 1,000-yard rushing season {{as well as the}} oldest to rush for 200 or <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> in a game. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Johnson ranked third on the NFL's all-time rushing yards list when he retired, but was best remembered by his peers for the mark he left with his blocking. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Rix {{completed}} a 42-yard pass to Craphonso Thorpe. On the next play, the Seminoles advanced the ball 11 <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> on a running play. From the Tech 18-yard line, the Seminoles were stopped for no gain, endured a sack of Rix, then committed a five-yard false start penalty. After being pushed back to the Tech 34-yard line, the Seminoles were unable to get a first down and elected to try a long field goal kick. Florida State placekicker Xavier Beitia entered the game to attempt a 50-yard kick. The kick was successful, and with 1:27 remaining in the first half, Florida State extended its lead to 103.|$|E
50|$|The Tigers {{finished}} {{the game with}} eight more first downs, 139 <b>more</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> and 111 <b>more</b> total <b>yards.</b> WVU finished with 28 <b>more</b> passing <b>yards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Throughout the game, Arkansas {{recorded}} {{five more}} first downs, 185 <b>more</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> 73 <b>more</b> total <b>yards,</b> and one less penalty. However, Florida recorded 112 <b>more</b> passing <b>yards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Auburn {{finished}} {{the game with}} 9 more first downs, 156 <b>more</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> and 133 <b>more</b> total <b>yards.</b> However, the Trojans out-passed the Tigers by 23 yards.|$|R
5|$|Air Force's post-score kickoff {{went out}} of bounds, {{resulting}} in a penalty that allowed Tech to automatically start its second offensive possession of the game at its 35-yard line. On his first play, Randall completed a 19-yard pass that drove the Hokie offense into Air Force territory {{for the first time}} and gained Tech another first down. Two plays later, Randall completed another pass, this time a 16-yard toss that pushed Tech to the Air Force 30-yard line. Though the Hokies gained several <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> on short plays, they were unable to earn another first down. Tech kicker Carter Warley was sent into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal, but the kick bounced off the right upright and Tech was denied three points. With 4:59 remaining in the first quarter, Air Force still held a 10–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame {{nonetheless}} {{opened the}} season with a 31–7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40–0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20–17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats' second {{possession}} {{of the second half}} was more successful than their first. On the first play of the drive, running back Jacob Ramsey broke free of the Tech defense for a 25-yard run, the longest run of any Cincinnati player in the game. He followed that first-down run by gaining eight <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> on consecutive runs. Pike then ran three yards for a first down at the Tech 44-yard line. There, however, Cincinnati's offense sputtered and could not gain another first down. The Bearcats' punted, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Tech 14-yard line with six seconds remaining in the quarter. The Hokies had time for one play, a 21-yard run by Evans to the Tech 35-yard line. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech had a 13–7 lead over Cincinnati.|$|E
5000|$|Russell Wilson {{became the}} first quarterback in NFL history to have 4,000 or <b>more</b> passing <b>yards,</b> 30 or <b>more</b> passing touchdowns, and 500 or <b>more</b> rushing <b>yards</b> in the same season.|$|R
50|$|New England's defense {{held the}} Ravens to 124 yards of total offense (just one <b>more</b> <b>yard</b> than Dillon had rushing on his own), forcing two {{turnovers}} and not allowing a touchdown, while scoring a touchdown of its own.|$|R
50|$|Montee Ball became {{only the}} fifth FBS player to score 30 {{touchdowns in a}} single season. Ball also rushed for a career-high 224 <b>yards,</b> one <b>more</b> <b>yard</b> than his {{previous}} high which he had two games earlier against Purdue.|$|R
5|$|The Cornhuskers' offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:58 remaining in the third quarter. Nebraska began at its 39-yard line after the kickoff was returned 23 yards. Frost ran four yards, and Benning earned eight yards with two rushes, giving Nebraska a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Frost's first pass of the drive fell incomplete, but Benning ran seven yards and Frost completed his second pass of the drive for nine yards and another first down, this time to the Tech 33-yard line. Three more rushes created 10 <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> and another first down, but a bigger loss came to the Tech defense when Hokie All-American Cornell Brown was injured. Nebraska's offense inexorably pressed onward, aided by a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, and Nebraska capitalized on a six-yard rush by Benning, giving Nebraska a touchdown with 20 seconds remaining in the quarter. The extra point was good, and Nebraska {{returned to}} a 10-point lead, 3121.|$|E
5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense {{advances}} ten or <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{was again}} forced to punt {{in the second}} half from its 15-yard line, and Neely had a 25-yard return to begin the next scoring drive. Williams reached the five-yard line when he was injured in a tackle, and Lynn Bomar went in as a substitute. On the next series of downs, Meiers scored a touchdown. A long pass was intercepted by Rupe Smith, who {{returned}} the ball to his own 35-yard line. Smith ran seven yards, and Bomar crossed the 50-yard line for nine yards and first down. Bomar ran three <b>more</b> <b>yards</b> before Smith ran down to Mercer's 10-yard line. Smith gained a few more on an end run before passing to Ryan for another touchdown. When Mercer again punted, Mixon eluded four tacklers and returned the punt 42 yards before running out of bounds at the Mercer five-yard line. The Commodores failed to score, and the game ended with an exchange of punts. Vanderbilt's starting lineup was McCullough (left end), Bradford (left tackle), Wade (left guard), Sharpe (center), Wilson (right guard), Elam (right tackle), Ryan (right end), Kuhn (quarterback), Godchaux (right halfback), Smith (left halfback), and Williams (fullback).|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the game, Lamar had {{two more}} first downs, 73 <b>more</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> and 66 <b>more</b> total <b>yards.</b> However, Middle Tennessee out-passed Lamar by 6 yards. Lamar halfback Ralph Stone was named the game's most {{valuable}} player.|$|R
50|$|Bomar {{passed for}} <b>more</b> than 300 <b>yards</b> in nine games during his Bearkat career. He threw for passes of <b>more</b> than 50 <b>yards</b> 10 times, {{including}} his longest of 80 yards. He {{is one of}} only 11 players in NCAA FCS history to throw for <b>more</b> than 300 <b>yards</b> and rush for <b>more</b> than 100 <b>yards</b> in a single game (against North Dakota State in 2007).|$|R

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Boston College 20-yard line, and the Eagles began their first full possession of the second quarter. Davis lost a yard on a running play, then was sacked for an eight-yard loss. Facing third down and needing 19 yards for a first down, Harris gained five yards and the Eagles punted after going three and out. The kick {{was returned}} to the Eagles' 36-yard line, and Tech began a possession deep in Boston College territory. The first Tech play lost two yards, but the Hokies regained the lost yardage on the next play, picking up four yards with a pass from Taylor to Evans. Taylor scrambled on third down, gaining eight yards and a first down. The Hokies attempted a short run, then Taylor gained another first down with a pass to the BC 14-yard line. Once there, however, Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty, pushing the Hokies backwards. After the penalty, Taylor was tackled for a loss of seven <b>more</b> <b>yards.</b> Facing a second down and 27 yards, Taylor attempted to pass for the first down, but the ball was batted {{into the air and}} intercepted by a Boston College defender.|$|E
5|$|With the game's {{momentum}} now {{firmly in}} their favor, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Kansas' offense on three straight plays, forcing another Kansas punt. The kick traveled 62yards and was recovered at the Virginia Tech 18-yard line. Virginia Tech's offense, despite the poor field position, moved quickly, {{partly due to}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Kansas. Sean Glennon completed a controversial 37-yard pass to tight end Greg Boone to drive the Hokies deep into Kansas territory. Initially, the pass {{appeared to have been}} intercepted by a Kansas defender, but subsequent replays revealed that Boone had wrested possession of the ball away from the defender. Three rushes deep inside the Kansas red zone netted the Hokies just nine <b>more</b> <b>yards,</b> setting up a fourth-and-one scenario for the Virginia Tech offense. Rather than risk a failed fourth-down conversion, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in kicker Jud Dunlevy to attempt a 25-yard field goal. During the kick, however, Kansas defender Joe Mortensen rushed through the Virginia Tech line and blocked the kick, denying the Hokies three points and preserving a 1714 Kansas lead with 6:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
