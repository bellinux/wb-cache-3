50|$|The {{fascinating}} {{result on}} {{the dependence of}} the network's robustness to its node mixing may be explained as follows. According to their definition, high-degree nodes in assortative networks tend to form a core group among them. Such a core group provides robustness to the network by concentrating all the obvious target nodes together in one portion of the graph. Removing these high-degree nodes {{is still one of}} the most effective ways to destroy network connectivity, but it is less effective (compared to neutral networks) because by removing them all from the same portion of the graph we fail to attack other portions. If these other portions are themselves percolating, then a giant cluster will persist even as the highest degree nodes vanish. On the other hand, the disassortatively <b>mixed</b> <b>network</b> is particularly susceptible to removal of high-degree nodes because these nodes are strewn far apart across the network, so that attacking them is like attacking all parts of the network at once.|$|E

Two of the critical needs identified by the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP) are, "the {{need to be able}} to provide reliable coverage in potentially high capacity environments, even in Over-The-Horizon (OTH) settings", and "the need to make more efficient use of spectrum resources through dynamic sharing of said resources, based on instantaneous demand thereof". Research conducted at Morgan State University (MSU) has focused on providing solutions for both critical problems. The <b>Mixed</b> <b>Network</b> architecture developed by MSU has shown that a hybrid network can be used to provide coverage for TAs that are beyond the coverage area of the GS. The <b>mixed</b> <b>network</b> uses clustering techniques to partition the aggregate network into clusters or sub-networks based on properties of each TA, which currently include signal strengths, and location. The paper starts with a detailed analysis of two parameters that affect the performance of each sub-network: contention between the TAs in the mobile ad-hoc network, and queuing at the Gateway TAs that serve as the link between the mobile ad-hoc and the Cellular networks. Contention and queuing will be used to evaluate two performance (distance) measures for each sub-network: throughput and delay. We define a new distance measure known as "power", which is equal to the ratio of throughput over delay, and is used as a measure of performance of the <b>mixed</b> <b>network</b> for Quality of Service (QOS).

Although a significant effort has been directed at discovering attacks against anonymity networks and developing countermeasures to those attacks, there is little systematic analysis of the quality of service (QoS) for such security and privacy systems. In this paper, we systematically address TCP performance issues of flow-based <b>mix</b> <b>networks.</b> A <b>mix’s</b> batching and reordering schemes can dramatically reduce TCP throughput due to out-of-order packet delivery.

40|$|Its {{more refined}} {{congestion}} control mechanisms, {{also based on}} the estimation of round trip delays, allow TCP Vegas to outperform the more widespread TCP Reno congestion control, based only on the packet loss detection, {{in a number of}} network environments. However, these mechanisms make TCP Vegas less aggressive with respect to TCP Reno; thereby TCP Vegas sources show high weakness in taking the available bandwidth when competing with other TCP Reno sources. This is a major reason that hinders the spread of TCP Vegas among Internet users.

40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, using the Internet is not {{anonymous}} at all. Since the Internet is a packet-switching network, every IP packet must carry the IP addresses of both communication endpoints. Consequently, anyone capable of observing {{at least one}} packet of a communication relationship can tell who is communicating with whom. The problem with this lack of anonymity is that it limits the privacy protection of Internet users. Today, privacy issues in the Internet are usually addressed by legislations that require operators of servers to clearly state their privacy practices and by encrypting the application data exchanged between two communicating parties. In general, privacy practices are difficult to enforce and encrypting the application data does not hide the IP addresses in the IP packets. However, learning the endpoints of communications relationships often reveals {{a lot of information}} about individual Internet users' preferences, habits, and problems; for instance when accessing web sites that provide medical information, religious sites, or the web site of a credit institution. These privacy issues can only be solved by enabling anonymous Internet communication. In this thesis, we work on the problem of achieving anonymous Internet access for low-latency applications such as web browsing. With anonymous Internet access, we mean that a client can connect to and communicate with a server such that the server does not learn the client?s IP address and an attacker interested in learning who is communicating with whom cannot find out the IP addresses of both client and server. Unlike encryption, anonymity cannot be "produced" by the communication endpoints themselves, but must be provided by a third party infrastructure. The concept of <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> is widely considered to be the most promising approach for such an infrastructure, and consequently, we focus on <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> in these thesis. The main contribution of our work is MorphMix, which fulfils the principal goal of this thesis: to develop a practical <b>mix</b> <b>network</b> that enables anonymous low-latency Internet access for a large number of users. With practical, we mean that (1) everybody owning a state-of-the-art computer connected to the Internet can use the system, (2) the performance it offers is good enough such that users won?t turn away from it, (3) it provides good protection from attacks by a realistic adversary, and (4) it scales well and can handle a large number of users. We first analyse traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> that strictly separate between the <b>mix</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure and clients that access servers through the <b>mix</b> <b>network.</b> The conclusion is that traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> are not well suited to achieve our principal goal for various reasons. To overcome their limitations, we propose MorphMix, which presents a novel way of operating and organising a <b>mix</b> <b>network.</b> In contrast to traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks,</b> MorphMix does no longer distinguish between clients and the <b>mix</b> <b>network.</b> Rather, the clients themselves build the <b>mix</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure in a peer-to-peer fashion. After describing the basic functionality of MorphMix, we give detailed analyses to show that MorphMix scales very well and provides good protection from a realistic adversary. To analyse the performance MorphMix offers to its users, we have implemented a simulator. The simulation results show that the expected performance of MorphMix is indeed good enough to attract users, and that the requirements to use MorphMix are modest. We have also specified the complete MorphMix protocol and have implemented a prototype. The main conclusion of our work is that with respect to our principal goal, MorphMix overcomes the limitations of traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> and is the first practical system that enables anonymous low-latency Internet access for a large number of users...|$|R

This configuration gives nodes ability to know the best mode to operate and communicate with other nodes. Node organization is critical to the performance of the <b>mixed</b> <b>network</b> and to improve communication. The configuration of nodes required to optimally organize nodes in MCMN is demonstrated. The problem of evaluating configuration parameters for nodes in a <b>mixed</b> <b>network</b> is a nonlinear and complex one.
