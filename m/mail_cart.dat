500|$|A monthly {{mail route}} {{was set up}} in June 1841, {{travelling}} from Albany to Perth via Kojonup and Williams. The following year, a service through Guildford commenced. The tough conditions of the mail route saw a different contractor providing the service each year. The 1845 contractor James Martin had particular trouble with debts, which led to his mail horse being seized; while he managed to acquire a replacement animal, he also had trouble servicing the resultant debt of £2. In 1847, the Perth–Albany route was adjusted, so that the mail would travel from Albany to Kojonup, then head to Bunbury on the coast, and subsequently up to Perth via Rockingham and Fremantle. The new route still had difficulties, such as flooding in the winter of 1847 that resulted in a [...] "terrible trip" [...] which took a month to complete. The people of Albany, who could travel as passengers on the <b>mail</b> <b>cart,</b> found the trip to Perth long and deplorable.|$|E

40|$|The London Postal Map was {{introduced}} in 1856. It drew a boundary around London, and then divided the city into ten districts: EC, WC, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW. It was a technological innovation that greatly increased the speed and efficiency of the movement of post around London, in a period when the postal service was the primary form of communication. Service became incredibly quick, frequent, and accessible; almost as instantaneous as the internet today. Deliveries began at 7. 22 am, with deliveries on the hour, every hour throughout the day. Letters posted at 7. 30 pm in central London would reach outer London suburbs that same evening. This thesis considers a period from 1830 until 1918, corresponding to {{the period of the}} beginnings of the Map’s story, to a major change in the Map during the First World War. It describes the origins of the Postal Map, and then explores its effects {{in the context of a}} rapidly developing city. It speculates on meanings of mapping the city where new names and boundaries are introduced and visualized. It investigates the development of the city, understanding the post as an essential part of London’s infrastructure. It considers how people experienced a city in which millions of letters, thousands of postmen, and hundreds of <b>mail</b> <b>carts</b> were moving each week. The Postal Map is argued to be one of the causal factors of modernity within London; it meant urban space was linked to a particular temporality – modern, fast-paced, connected. It changed how Londoner’s conceived their city through providing a new framework for labelling places in relation to each other, stating what was east, what was west.   The project uses the extensive archives held by the Postal Museum, which include hundreds of maps, to tell the story of the Postal Map. It combines methodologies from social history, technological and administrative histories, mapping theory, urban planning history, and design history to gain a rich understanding of the full spatial implications of this designed object: the London Postal Map...|$|R

50|$|The villagers' initial {{reaction}} to proposals {{to build the}} railway may have been unenthusiastic. They had already had an unfavourable experience of the 'iron horse' {{in the form of}} a traction engine in 1882, which, drawing two heavy carts, had made the roads almost impassable, killing a boy and overturning a <b>mail</b> <b>cart.</b> In addition a private carriage collided with it, killing one of the occupants.|$|E
50|$|In a large organization, the {{mailroom}} is {{the central}} hub of the internal mail system and the interface with external mail. The postmaster manages the department, clerks assist them and mailboys deliver mail for other employees in different departments using a <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> or a trolley doing regular rounds throughout the day. Sometimes the mailboys will trolley sort using the departmental slots on the trolley to reduce work at the central hub and to speed internal mail.|$|E

Here stood a large inn, the Bird-in-Hand (now the Countryman) and close by was a smithy. In 1817 a shop {{stood near the}} site of the present Norwich bus stop, with numerous outhouses and a large orchard, today the site of Orchard Way. The shop survived until about 1940. In Church Road stood the Cherry Tree public house (now Cherry Tree House) at that time reputed to be a den of poachers.|$|R

Well known in the utility vehicle field, Cushman had manufactured the Airborne, a motor scooter dropped by parachute for ground transport of paratroopers. Later the company's lightweight vehicles became popular for agricultural, industrial, and recreational use. Costing 114,000 shares at 30¢ par, the new acquisition added three-wheel <b>mail</b> carriers, golf <b>carts,</b> and motor scooters to the OMC product line. Besides the Johnson and Evinrude motors then being sold by about 7,000 retail dealers, the swelling list of OMC offerings included Gale Buccaneer motors sold through hardware jobbers, {{as well as a}} number of unbranded models sold for retailers.|$|R

Storey and Davis owned a boat but, in January 1840, when Liardet requested their assistance in unloading supplies hed brought back from Sydney on the William Metcalfe, they refused. In response, Liardet bought a whaleboat from the William Metcalfes captain to unload his goods and then, {{with the help of}} his sons, used this to collect mail from ships anchored in the bay. By August 1840 he had a <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> doing three runs each day from the ships to the settlement of Melbourne.|$|E

A <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> ran from Kareli to Sagar, a distance of 122 km. The trade of Kareli has now considerably declined, but it is still the exporting station for the southern parts of the Rehli tahsil of Sagar and the north of Narsinghpur.

500|$|By 1877 {{there was}} a twice daily <b>mail</b> and {{passenger}} <b>cart</b> connecting Carrick to the railway station at Bishopbourne and [...] "Blair's Bus" [...] ran thrice weekly to Launceston. The Bass Highway, which passed through Carrick, had been designated a National Highway {{as part of the}} Federal National Highway Act 1974. The structure of this type of road required that the centre of Carrick be bypassed. The road through Carrick is now known as the Meander Valley Highway. Bass Highway, which connects Launceston, Burnie and Devonport, passes south of the town. As of 2011 Redline Coaches, runs a daily school bus service that passes through Carrick to many of the Schools in and around Launceston and regular services connecting Carrick to Burnie, Launceston, Hobart and towns in between.|$|R

He slams into Paul Merkin after {{his failure to}} refill the coffee after he's used it, and then Ron Felcher gives a brief description about how the productivity in the office has soared after Terry's arrival from Reebok. Terry then puts more office workers in their places, for various offenses such as failing to recycle an aluminium can, failing to put a cover sheet on a TPS report, stealing a box of ballpoint pens from him, and drinking coffee while not on a break. His friendly side is also shown, as he gives a co-worker a cake on their birthday.

50|$|Mailboy is the {{traditional}} name for the mailroom clerk who collects and delivers mail within a large organisation. A 'mailboy', delivers mail for other employees in different departments using a <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> or a trolley often sorting as he goes using the pouches or wallets {{that are part of}} the trolley. It is typically the most junior of roles and many employees start here so they can get a feel for the entire organisation, get to know everyone rapidly, and then to decide where in an organisation they would like to train for and work within. In the modern workplace it is a role suitable for people with learning difficulties and helps an organisation meet legislative quotas. A trolly with many slots is frequently used so that sorting can take place while the trolly does its rounds thereby reducing the amount of mail that has to be sorted in the mailroom.|$|E

50|$|The robbery {{took place}} on 29 January or 9 February 1791 (sources differ) at Ickles, on the Rotherham edge of Attercliffe Common. Broughton and his {{accomplice}} John Oxley stayed in Sheffield {{the night before the}} robbery and then walked out of the town on the Rotherham road where they met the mail coming towards Sheffield. However, they intended to rob it on its way back to Rotherham so they lay in wait for it to arrive. George Leasley, the boy driving the <b>mail</b> <b>cart,</b> described how he was led into a field, blindfolded with a handkerchief, and his hands tied behind his back and fixed to a hedge. After about an hour he freed himself and found his horse, but the Rotherham post bag was gone. Broughton and Oxley escaped towards Mansfield. On their way they went through the contents of the post bag and found that the only item of value was a French bill of exchange worth £123; they disposed {{of the rest of the}} contents in a brook and parted, with Oxley proceeding to London to cash the bill.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, Eve gives Wesley a {{fragment}} of a relic, saying the Senior Partners {{want to know what}} it is. Gunn arrives and announces that a vampire matching Spike's description has been out on the streets, saving people. Meanwhile, Angel is dreaming that Spike and Buffy are having sex in his bed. He wakes up and goes downstairs, where Gunn tells him to hurry or he will “miss it.” Angel joins the group of people in his office, staring out the windows at L.A. as it burns. Angel realizes what’s going on and heads towards the windows. “You’re blocking the apocalypse,” Harmony tells him. Wesley assures Angel that Spike will take care of it. Lorne suggests that Angel change his clothes, since there’s something on his shirt. Angel looks down to see a bloody stake sticking out of his heart. As Angel dreams in his room, a blue creature feeds off of his chest in the same spot as the stake in his dream. Fred holds out a cake with a picture of L.A. burning and the words “Way to go Spike!” written on it. Everyone sings, “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” and yells for Spike to give a speech. He talks about fulfilling his destiny to turn L.A. into utopia. A blue fairy floats in and sprinkles gold dust on Spike, making his heart beat again. As everyone cheers for Spike, Angel is suddenly a man staffing the <b>mail</b> <b>cart.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} and second Anglo-Maratha wars, it used to take 4-5 weeks to move {{materials}} from Mumbai to Pune. A military road constructed by the company in 1804 reduced the journey to 4-5 days. The company later built a Macademized road between the two cities in 1830 that allowed <b>mail</b> <b>cart</b> service to begin between the two cities. Railway line from Bombay and run by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) reached the city in 1858. In the following decades the line was extended places further east and south of the city. In the east, GIPR extended its line to Raichur in 1871 where it met the line of Madras Railway and thereby connected Poona to Madras. The Pune - Miraj line was completed in 1886. The completion of the Metre gauge Miraj line turned the city into an important railway junction. The Bombay-Poona line was electrified in the 1920s. This cut the travel time between the cities to three hours and made it possible to make day trips between the cities for business or leisure such as Bombay rich coming down to see the Poona races. Although railways came to Pune {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, public bus service took nearly ninety years to follow suit. Unlike Mumbai, Pune never had a tram service. The first bus service was introduced in Pune in 1941 by the Silver bus company. This caused huge uproar amongst the Tanga carriers (horse-drawn carriage) who went on strike in protest. Tangas were the common mode of public transport well into the 1950s. Bicycles were choice of vehicle for private use in the 1930s.|$|E
