In {{an interview with the}} Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: [...] "There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing {{that at the end of}} the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love.

It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'."
