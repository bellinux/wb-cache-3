5000|$|A non <b>electric</b> <b>{{detonator}}</b> is a {{shock tube}} detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally {{for the purpose}} of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500 ft/s (2,000 m/s) {{along the length of the}} tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of Non <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications. Non <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> was invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of Per-Anders Persson, and launched to the demolitions market in 1973. (Nitro Nobel became a part of Dyno Nobel after being sold to Norwegian Dyno Industrier AS in 1986.) Nonel is a contraction of [...] "Non electric detonators".|$|R

40|$|A major {{industrial}} use of pyrotechnic compositions is as <b>delay</b> fuses in <b>electric</b> <b>detonators.</b> Suitable <b>delay</b> times may {{be achieved through}} (i) choice of chemical components (ii) adjustment of composition of the system chosen and, finally, (iii) adjustment {{of the length of}} fuse used. This study forms part of a survey of binary fuel/oxidant combinations in an attempt to provide some fundamental information on the first step above: (i) choice of chemical components. The complete survey has included studies of a single fuel in combination with one of a variety of oxidants, and studies of the oxidation of one of several different fuels separately by barium peroxide and strontium peroxide. This study is part of this second approach and the fuels chosen were iron and zinc powders, mainly for chemical reasons (including the potential for use of thermomagnetometry on the iron systems), but also for possible environmental advantages. The mixed oxide products of pyrotechnic combustion could also have some scientific and/or commercial value. The techniques used included thermal analyses of mixtures and their individual components, and measurements of temperature-time profiles during combustion. Thermodynamic and kinetic information was obtained under a variety of conditions and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and microprobe analyses provided additional information. Possible mechanisms of reactions are discussed in detail. The practical conclusions were that any potential use which the Fe/peroxide systems may have as delay compositions, with burning-rates of from 3 - 30 mm s⁻¹, is offset by the susceptibility of the oxidants to reaction with water and CO₂ in the atmosphere. The Zn/BaO₂ and Zn/SrO₂ systems did not burn under compaction, and combustion of uncompacted powders was erratic. Zinc liquid (and probably zinc vapour) take part in the reaction and the gaseous nature of the combustion makes zinc-fuelled pyrotechnic systems unsuitable for delay applications. All the techniques used showed the heterogeneity of the solid residues of combustion. If these residues were to be of any value, they would need further conventional treatment involving grinding of the residue, possible adjustment of compositions, and calcining to produce uniform materials. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} industrial uses of pyrotechnic compositions is as <b>delay</b> fuses in <b>electric</b> <b>detonators.</b> Many factors influence the rate of burning of such fuses. These include (a) the primary choice of chemical components, followed by (b) the physical properties of these components, particularly the particle-size and distribution of the fuel, (c) the composition of the system chosen and (d) the presence of additives and/or impurities. A full experimental study of the influences of even a few of these factors, while attempting to hold other potential variables constant, would be extremely time consuming and hence attention has been focused on the possibilities of modelling pyrotechnic combustion. Various approaches to the modelling of pyrotechnic combustion are discussed. These include:- (i) one-dimensional finite-difference models; (ii) two-dimensional finite-element models; (iii) particle-packing considerations; (iv) Monte Carlo models. Predicted behaviour is compared with extensive experimental information for the widely-used antimony/potassium permanganate pyrotechnic system, and the tungsten /potassium dichromate pyrotechnic system. The one-dimensional finite-difference model was investigated to give a simple means of investigating the effects of some parameters on the combustion of a pyrotechnic. The two-dimensional finite-difference model used similar inputs, but at the expense of considerably more computer power, gave more extensive information such as the shape of the burning front and the temperature gradients throughout the column and within the casing material. Both these models gave improved results when allowance was made for autocatalytic kinetics in place of the usual assumption of an "order-of-reaction", n ≤ 1. The particle-packing model investigated the qualitative relationship between the maximum burning rate of a pyrotechnic system and the maximum number of contact points (per 1. 00 g composition) calculated for that system. Qualitative agreement was found for those systems which are presumed to burn mainly via solid-solid reactions. The Monte Carlo model investigated the effect of the random packing of fuel and oxidant particles on the variability of the burning rate of a pyrotechnic composition...|$|R

50|$|The MAPED F1 uses a {{very complex}} {{electric}} firing system. It is basically actuated by a contact wire. The battery pack and firing cable are attached to an <b>electric</b> <b>detonator</b> which is inserted in the mine and a spool of contact wire is rolled out. Any contact with the wire after the mine is armed will break the fibre, which collapses an electrical circuit and triggers the mine.|$|R
50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives.

50|$|In {{addition}} to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW detonators are safe from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, {{but it is}} small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full, high voltage high current charge passes through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional <b>electric</b> <b>detonators.</b>|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) has {{developed}} an electromagnetic (EM) fire warning alarm sys-tem for underground mines. The system generates a magnetic field for through-the-earth signal trans-mission to microreceivers carried by individual miners.

The minimum safe distance between a transmitting antenna and a blasting array is the distance where the induced electrical current in the blasting array is 50 mA, which is the safe current level specified in Federal mine safety regulations. Tests indicate that at transmitting power levels of 100 -and 1, 000 -W, separation distances of 9 and 21 m, respectively, were required. These distances are small compared with the dimensions of a mine. Thus, the tests indicate that, with proper placement of the transmitting antenna, the warning system can be used safely in the proximity of blasting arrays...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Application-level {{firewalls}} block traffic {{based on}} the process that is sending or receiving the network flow. They help detect bots, worms, and backdoors that send or receive malicious packets without the knowledge of users. Recent attacks show that these firewalls can be disabled by knowledgeable attackers. To counter this threat, we develop VMwall, a fine-grained tamper-resistant process-oriented firewall. VMwall’s design blends the process knowledge of application-level firewalls with the isolation of traditional stand-alone firewalls. VMwall uses the Xen hypervisor to provide protection from malware, and it correlates TCP or UDP traffic with process information using virtual machine introspection. Experiments show that VMwall successfully blocks numerous real attacks—bots, worms, and backdoors—against a Linux system while allowing all legitimate network flows. VMwall is performant, imposing only a 0 – 1 <b>millisecond</b> <b>delay</b> on TCP connection establishment, less than a <b>millisecond</b> <b>delay</b> on UDP connections, and a 1 – 7 % slowdown on network-bound applications.
