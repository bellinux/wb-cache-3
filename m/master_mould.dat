As a result, {{there has been}} a focus on developing methods for single cell analysis. µCP represents a cheap, simple and versatile method for producing microarrays across a substrate surfaces. The microarrays can be utilized for cell immobilization, which can be coupled to microscopy techniques. There is also an increased interest in using AFM for cell studies, which requires immobilization The focus of this thesis was to develop a method for µCP of PLL to facilitate immobilization of S. cerevisiae on a glass substrate. The idea is to create a pattern that enables immobilization of single cells of S. cerevisiae to achieve SCA. A photolithography procedure was developed to create a <b>master</b> <b>mould</b> for replica moulding. An even film thickness was achieved, but there were persistent problems with edge bead and cracks in the resist due to thermal stress. Replica moulding was used to make PDMS stamps on the created <b>master</b> <b>mould.</b> AFM analysis showed irregularities in the stamps corresponding to the cracks observed in the resist, which resulted in poor conformal contact between the stamp and the substrate surface. The parameters of the replica moulding method were verified using a pre-made <b>master</b> <b>mould</b> to create stamps. This showed that the process was suitable for creating PDMS stamps with micrometre scale features.

Three different 316 -L stainless steel powders, including 5, 10 and 16 μm in size, and two different ceramics powders, including 400 nm alumina and 320 nm titania, were tested. The PhD research process can be divided into three main stages. In the first stage, high quality SU- 8 <b>master</b> <b>moulds</b> and their negative replicas soft moulds are produced using Softlithography technique. The second stage includes preparing the stainless steel slurries, filling the soft micro moulds, obtaining the green micro components, de-binding and sintering. In the third stage, the fabrication process has been developed further to produce stainless steel-ceramic composite micro components. Fabrication process in each stage was investigated in detail and the optimum properties were produced. Dispersant acrylic-based binder is adopted in this research successfully in producing damage-free green micro components. A cold isostatic pressing technique is also adopted to improve the densities and linear shrinkages of the stainless steel green and sintered micro components. A new mixing method is used to improve the homogeneity of the ceramic inclusions in the stainless steel matrix of the composite micro components. Characterization of the sintered stainless steel and composite micro components in terms of shape retention, density, linear shrinkage, internal structure, hardness and surface roughness were investigated in detail.

The success and proliferation of such methods critically rely on the manufacturing of robust and durable <b>master</b> <b>moulds</b> 2. Silicon-based moulds are brittle 3 and have limited longevity 4. Metal moulds are stronger than semiconductors, but patterning of metals on the nanometre scale is limited by their finite grain size. Amorphous metals (metallic glasses) exhibit superior mechanical properties and are intrinsically free from grain size limitations. Here we demonstrate direct nanopatterning of metallic glasses by hot embossing, generating feature sizes as small as 13 nm. After subsequently crystallizing the as-formed metallic glass mould, we show that another amorphous sample of the same alloy can be formed on the crystallized mould. In addition, metallic glass replicas {{can also be used}} as moulds for polymers or other metallic glasses with lower softening temperatures. Using this 'spawning' process, we can massively replicate patterned surfaces through direct moulding without using conventional lithography.

Conventional printing method that has been studied {{for this kind of}} printed electronic such as flexographic, micro contact printing, screen printing, gravure and ink jet. In flexographic and microcontact printing, a printing plate is used to transfer the designed and desired pattern to substrate through conformed contact. Therefore printing plate is play a big role in this area. Printing plate making by photopolymer which used in flexographic have limitation in achieving a micro-scale of pattern size. However, printing plate of microcontact printing have an advantages in producing micro, even nano-scale size by PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). Hence, rapid prototyping 3 D printer was used for developing a PDMS micro-scale printing plate which will be used in reel to reel (R 2 R) flexographic due to high speed, low cost, mass production of this type of printing process. The flexibility of 3 D printer in producing any shape of pattern easily, contributed the success of this study. A nickel plating and glass etching master pattern was used in this study too as master pattern mould since 3 D printer has been reached the micro size limitation.

40|$|A novel imprint process, called Disposable Master Technology {{has been}} {{developed}} using disposable masters replicated from nickel masters using roll-to-roll printing. The disposable masters consist of a polyester terephthalate film coated with a photosensitive resin containing the inverse structure of the nickel master. The use of hydrophobic and oleophobic additives was found to improve release after imprinting. This has enabled structures of deeply submicron periodicity to be imprinted on silicon wafers up to 4 " diameter with good reproducibility. Resist systems have been developed based on urethane acrylates plus a resist based on Oxetanyl Silsesquioxane which contains silicon for improved etch resistance, useful when transferring the imprinted structures into the substrate by reactive ion etching. The addition of fluorinated acrylates {{has been shown to}} improve the substrate coverage during spin coating and to ease disposable master release after imprinting. Silicone acrylate, used as an additive was found to improve the etch resistivity as well as also easing disposable master release. The generation of disposable masters from anodic porous alumina has been investigated. Aluminium sample pre-treatment has been optimized for 2 inch diameter aluminium discs to produce 100 nm and 200 nm spaced pores of 180 to 500 nm depth with conical or cylindrical shape. The self-ordered porous alumina has beef! replicated on to PET film creating polymer nanopillars of down to 50 nm in diameter.

The designed two-dimensional array of structures, extending over ~ 1 mm 2 regions with micron-scale resolution, was laser-ablated into a thin film through the use of femtosecond laser pulses (150 fs, 800 nm) that were spatially shaped via diffraction from a programmable digital multi-mirror device (DMD). The high switching speed of the DMD mirrors in combination with a high repetition rate laser provides the ability to pattern any desired 2 D prototype on the ~ 1 mm scale within a few minutes, circumventing the need for a custom-designed mask and photolithography which is generally needed to produce a specific prototyping <b>master</b> <b>mould.</b> The complementary pattern from the thin film was subsequently transferred into PDMS for fabrication of a mould that was used for micro-contact printing of ink onto a glass substrate.

40|$|Microneedle arrays {{have been}} {{proposed}} for drug delivery and point-of-care diagnostics {{to improve the quality}} of health care delivery systems. Unskilled and painless applications of microneedle patches for blood collection or drug delivery are two of the advantages of microneedle arrays over hypodermic needles. Microneedle designs which range from sub-micron to millimetres feature sizes are fabricated using the tools of the microelectronics industry from materials such as metals, silicon, and polymers. However, to date, large-scale manufacture of microneedles has been limited because of the high cost and complexity of microfabrication techniques. This thesis aims to develop new manufacturing methods that may overcome the complexity of microneedle fabrication and scale-up problems. Two different microfabrication methods were investigated. (1) Silicon microneedles were manufactured through deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) with variable heights and tip sharpness. A series of experiments were also performed to investigate the influence of design and process parameters on the fabrication outcomes. (2) A great variety of microneedle array geometries were manufactured using 3 D laser lithography as a rapid prototyping technique was required for different microneedle geometries. These microstructures were successfully replicated by soft embossing. Furthermore, the mechanical stability of microneedles were analysed by compression tests and finite element analysis (FEA). The data was used to quantitatively define the microneedles fracture force and skin penetration capabilities. A novel microneedle device for subcutaneous fluid sampling and drug delivery was easily manufactured by 3 D laser lithography and soft embossing; fluid was drawn into each microneedle and microwell reservoir by capillary pressure via open channels that draw fluid along the side of microneedle shafts into microwell reservoirs. Time-lapse microscopy showed that microwells fill rapidly by capillary pressure. A rabbit ear skin penetration and drug delivery test demonstrated the potential of this new design for drug delivery and point-of-care diagnostics.

The surface porosity (100 μm), roughness (aragonite structure < 1 μm) and stiffness (8 GPa) of coral scaffolds, which are commonly used in bone-forming bioreactor, were reproduced in the microfluidic chip. To achieve such features, we developed a specific process: i) we proceed firstly to the fabrication of a <b>master</b> <b>mould</b> in elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), reproducing the surface geometric properties of the coral ii) to achieve the desired mechanical stiffness, this elastomeric stamp is then transferred in a thermoplastic material by hot embossing techniques.

The pressure (700 kPa), temperature (170 °C) and time (12 mn) parameters were optimized in order to keep the coral surface geometric properties on the COC polymer. SEM imaging was performed to characterize the surface. Finally, fibroblast cells (NIH 3 T 3 -GFP) were cultivated in standard culture medium and seeded on the biomimetic surface. In static flow, we compare cell morphology and adhesion in our microfluidic chip and in coral and obtain a similar behaviour.

Study design: A metal <b>master</b> <b>mould</b> with four slots of dimensions 25 x 2 x 2 mm was fabricated to obtain samples of standard dimensions. A total of 135 specimens were thus obtained with 45 each of three provisional materials. Further 15 samples of each group were tested after storing for one hour at room temperature and again at intervals of 24 hours and 7 days after storing in artificial saliva. Three point flexural tests were {{carried out in the}} universal testing machine to calculate the flexural strength and the elastic modulus. The changes were calculated and data was analyzed with Fisher's test and ANOVA. Results: The flexural strength of the methyl methacrylate resin reduced significantly while bis-acrylic composite resin showed a significant increase in its flexural strength after storing in artificial saliva for 24 hours and the values of both remained constant thereafter. Contrary to these findings, light polymerized resin showed a significant decrease in flexural strength after storing in artificial saliva for 24 hours and then significantly increased in flexural strength after 7 days. However the changes in the values for elastic modulus of respective materials were statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Methacrylate based autopolymerizing resin showed the highest flexural strength and elastic moduli after fabrication and after storing in artificial saliva and for 24 hours and 7 days.

In the mind, if, thereare evil thoughts, then the words are evil, and sorrow which results from sin follows thatman as the chariot wheel follows the 'drawer' who drags it...|$|R
50|$|Miklós Kis, a Transylvanian Protestant {{priest and}} schoolteacher, became deeply {{interested}} in printing after {{being sent to}} Amsterdam to help print a Hungarian Protestant translation of the Bible. This {{was a period of}} considerable prosperity for the Netherlands and a time when its styles of printing were very influential across Europe, making it a centre for the creation of new typefaces. He developed a second career as a punchcutter, an engraver of the punches used as a <b>master</b> for making <b>moulds</b> for metal type, working on commission for printers and governments. Kis returned to Transylvania around 1689 and may have left matrices (the moulds used to cast type) in Leipzig on his way home. The Ehrhardt type foundry of Leipzig released a surviving specimen sheet of them around 1720.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} shown the {{possibility}} and the process flow to create bendable SU- 8 wafers with a defined surface topology and pointed out the crucial steps during processing of the SU- 8 master. The application of SU- 8 wafers as flexible master structures for double-sided moulding of PDMS was presented. The authors demonstrate {{the process and the}} equipment for double-sided moulding of PDMS and the removal of the structured SU- 8 wafer {{at the end of the}} moulding process. One application for double-sided moulded PDMS is a new design of a micro plasma source based on the principle of dielectric barrier discharge. This plasma source operates at atmospheric pressure and uses the PDMS as patterned dielectric barrier. Managing the alignment of both <b>master</b> structures double-sided <b>moulding</b> of PDMS will give rise to high application potential in the field of microtechnology...|$|R
