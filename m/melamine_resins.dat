The arc susceptibility is tested according to ASTM D495, by point electrodes and continuous and intermittent arcs; it is measured in seconds required to form a track that is conductive under high-voltage low-current conditions. Some materials are less susceptible to degradation than others. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene has arc resistance of about 200 seconds (3.3 minutes).

40|$|<b>Melamine</b> <b>resins</b> are {{polymers}} and {{consist of}} the starting substances (monomers) melamine and formaldehyde.

Consumer products made of <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> such as plates, cups, bowls or cutlery can re-lease melamine and formaldehyde if they are exposed to high temperatures above 70 ° C. Migration limits have been set for the migration of melamine and formaldehyde into foods. Testing by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) as well as test results of the com-petent Länder (regional) authorities for the official control of foodstuffs reveals that the regu-latory migration limits for the migration of melamine and formaldehyde to food are exceeded at higher temperatures. This occurs especially at 100 °C, the boiling point of water. If kitchen utensils made of melamine resin are used for frying and cooking or the heating of foods in a microwave oven, amounts of melamine and formaldehyde which present a health risk can transfer into food. This is especially the case for acidic foods including many fruit and vegetable preparations. Furthermore, the health risk through inhalation of formaldehyde from kitchen utensils is possible, as the substance also distributes into the air. BfR thus maintains that consumers should avoid the use dishes and kitchen utensils made of mela-mine resins when frying or cooking or when heating foods in a microwave oven. If the products are used at temperatures up to 70 °C, they {{are not likely to be}} dangerous to human health.

40|$|A new four-step synthetic-route for {{combining}} chromophores with <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> {{was developed}} and practized. Despite of other <b>melamine</b> <b>resins,</b> the basis molecule of this system is the 2, 4, 6 -trichloro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine, the cyanuric chloride. In the first step the azochromophore was bonded to the s-triazine-ring. Then the residual chlorines of this triazine-chromophore were substituted by ammonia or primary amines. In the third step an aldehyde was added, leading to melamine- chromophore precondensates. For increasing the stability and the solubility of these precondensates the reactive methylolgroups were etherificated with methyl- or butylalcohol. The mass-spectra give evidence that the modified melamine precondensates are monomers and no mixture of different oligomers like else in melamine-aldehyde prepolymers. Though the result of these systems is a crosslinkable melamine-chromophore monomer which is converted in a resin by heating or under acid conditions. It is remarkable that these polymers show an excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature far beyond 300 °:C, a great advantage for using them a s optical materials. Resins, which build homogenous amorphous and highly transparent films, were achieved by thermal treating of the melamine-chromophore-resins. The reaction steps were monitored by online-IR-spectroscopy, which has enabled to find and optimize the reaction conditions of the syntheses steps. Furthermore the characteristic changing IR-bands and time-reaction-profiles were extracted. Concerning their usability in second order nonlinear optics the alignment of the dipoles was investigated by applying a corona discharge. Simultaneously to the poling process, the monomers were polycondensated by thermal heating. The continuously measured UV/Vis-absorptions of the poled polymer films have demonstrated that the absorption of the film have fallen within the first weeks after poling. An electric potential from 10 till 20 V could be measured during this period, indicating orientation processes of the poled films. The E/Z-switching behaviour of the azo-groups were investigated by Kelvin-Probe. The results have demonstrated that the new monomers and polymers are potential candidates for optical switching processes. The fixing of thioles on the triazine-chromophores of the first reaction step has been made successfully.

40|$|The {{feedstock}} recycling of thermosets using the transfer hydrogenolysis with partially hydrogenated aromatics such as tetraline (1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthaline) or 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene was studied. It {{was possible to}} cleave an epoxy resin cured with phthalic anhydride with a yield of more than 99 wt. -% soluble products at a temperature of 340 C in 2 h. A reaction mechanism was proposed. First the thermally most labile bonds in the resin suffer homolysis, then the radicals formed that way are saturated by abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrogen donor. The most important reaction products like phenol, p-isopropylphenol and phthalic anhydride were quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography. The method also worked with a technical epoxy resin sheet reinforced with glass fiber mats and covered with copper foil. Grinding of the resin was not necessary and {{it was possible to}} recover the glass fiber mats and copper foils with very little pollution. Carbon fibers could be recovered too from a reinforced epoxy resin. The hydrogenolysis was successfully applied to liquefy other thermosets like phenolic resins, <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> and crosslinked unsaturated polyesters.

By utilizing the selective reactivity of cyanuric chloride, a plethora of targets from small molecules to large dendrimers may be synthesized. Triazine chemistry was adapted to an educational application {{for the development of}} an undergraduate laboratory to synthesize simazine, a widely used herbicide. The laboratory was designed to foster a sense of the applications of chemistry in the world and its effect on the environment and society. The modification of chitosan for herbicide remediation has been accomplished using triazine chemistry, as well. Treatment of chitosan iteratively with cyanuric chloride followed by piperazine produces dendritic grafts from these flakes. Dendrons of generation one through three were synthesized on chitosan backbones of low, medium, and high molecular weights. The piperazine derivatives were shown to sequester more than 99 % of atrazine from an aqueous 100 ppb solution in a 24 h period. Drug delivery applications of triazine-based dendrimers were investigated. Pegylated G 3 dendrimers with molecular weights of 18 and 34 kDa with 9 % and 17 % iodine content by weight, respectively, were synthesized as potential macromolecular contrast agents. The development of macromolecular contrast agents is of great interest to counteract the drawbacks associated with currently used, small molecule contrast media, including toxicity, extravasation into the extracellular space, and rapid clearance from the bloodstream.

This {{can be achieved by}} introducing a thin coating that preserves the bulk properties of the material, while protecting it from environmental exposure. Suitable materials for such coating technologies are inorganic oxides, such as alumina, titania and silica; however, the fate of these materials during long-term environmental exposure is an open question. In this study, polymer coatings that had been enhanced with the addition of silica nanoparticles (SiO 2 NPs) and subsequently subjected to environmental exposure, were characterized {{both before and after the}} exposure to determine any structural changes resulting from the exposure. High-resolution synchrotron macro ATR-FTIR microspectroscopy and surface topographic techniques, including optical profilometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were used to determine the long-term effect of the environment on these dual protection layers after 3 years of exposure to tropical and sub-tropical climates in Singapore and Queensland (Australia). Principal component analysis (PCA) based on the synchrotron macro ATR-FTIR spectral data revealed that, for the 9 % (w/w) SiO 2 NP/polymer coating, a clear discrimination was observed between the control group (no environmental exposure) and those samples subjected to three years of environmental exposure in both Singapore and Queensland. The PCA loading plots indicated that, over the three year exposure period, a major change occurred in the triazine ring vibration in the <b>melamine</b> <b>resins.</b> This can be attributed to the triazine ring being very sensitive to hydrolysis under the high humidity conditions in tropical/sub-tropical environments.

40|$|A {{combination}} of an alkyd resin with a melamine-formaldehyde resin gives a cured enamel film with {{the flexibility of}} the alkyd constituent and the high chemical resistance and hardness of the melamine resin at the same time. The melamine resin is a minor constituent and plays the role of a crosslinking agent. In this paper, alkyd resins of high hydroxyl numbers based on trimethylolpropane, ricinoleic acid and phthalic anhydride were synthesized. Two alkyds having 30 and 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid were formulated by calculation on alkyd constant. Alkyds were characterized by FTIR and by the determination of acid and hydroxyl numbers. Then synthesized alkyds were made into baking enamels by mixing with melamine-formaldehyde resins (weight ratio of 70 : 30 based on dried mass). Two types of commercial <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> were used: threeisobutoxymethyl melamine-formaldehyde resin (TIMMF) and hexamethoxymethyl melamine resin (HMMMF). Prepared alkyd/melamine resin mixtures were cured in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under non-isothermal mode. Apparent degree of curing as a function of temperature was calculated from the curing enthalpies. Kinetic parameters of curing were calculated using Freeman-Carroll method. TIMMF resin is more reactive with synthesized alkyds than HMMMF resin what was expected. Alkyd resin with 30 wt% of ricinoleic acid is slightly more reactive than alkyd with 40 wt% of ricinoleic acid, probably because it has the high contents of free hydroxyl and acid groups. The gel content, Tg, thermal stability, hardness, elasticity and impact resistance of coated films cured at 150 °C for 60 min were measured. Cured films show good thermal stability since the onset of films thermal degradation determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is observed at the temperatures from 281 to 329 °C. Films based on alkyd 30 are more thermal stable than those from alkyd 40, with the same melamine resin. The type of alkyd resin has no significant effect on the gel content and the hardness of film. Hardness of cured film increases with increasing of Tg. The values of the films elasticity are satisfied for all prepared samples and are independent on the type of alkyd or melamine resin.

30|$|All three plywood {{variants}} made of unmodified beech veneers showed comparable dimensional stability, {{irrespective of}} plasma pre-treatment, production process, and <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> concentration. The authors attribute this {{behavior on the}} one hand to the generally low WPG-value of the unmodified beech veneers after the chosen immersion duration (plasma/reference). On the other hand, it might also be explained by a possible penetration of the <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> from the glue line (despite the presence of additives) during the pressing process of “reference 0 ”, leading to a certain impregnation effect of these samples, which in consequence diminishes the differences between “reference 0 ” and “plasma”. In contrast, the samples made of thermally modified beech veneers showed distinctly improved dimensional stability when veneers are plasma pre-treated, compared to reference 0 and reference samples (for both concentrations). This {{can be explained by the}} fact that the hydrophobic properties of thermally modified veneers impede the penetration of <b>melamine</b> <b>resin</b> into the bulk (applies to the reference and reference 0 samples). The improved dimensional stability of plasma-treated samples made from thermally modified veneers results in a significantly higher melamine uptake (see Fig.  3)—due to the over-proportional plasma effect displayed by the thermally modified beech veneers in comparison to unmodified beech.|$|R
