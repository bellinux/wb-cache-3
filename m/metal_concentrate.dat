5000|$|The Greens Creek {{mine in the}} Admiralty mining {{district}} is the 5th largest silver producer in the world; gold is a byproduct. The mine is an underground operation, with surface disposal of tailings onto two 29 acre sites. The mine and mill site lie on 18 patented claims; the mine has mineral rights to 12 square miles (7500 acres) of surrounding land owned by the Federal government. [...] It is located approximately 25 km south of Juneau, Alaska, on Admiralty Island within the Admiralty Island National Monument. The mine produces ores of silver and gold, and concentrates of zinc and lead, from a structurally and mineralogically complex VMS deposit. Geologists discovered mineralized outcrops in 1975, exploration drilling began in 1978; full-scale development was initiated in 1987 and production of <b>metal</b> <b>concentrate</b> began in 1989. Production was halted, due to low metal prices, {{for a few years}} in the mid-'90s. Concentrates are trucked nine miles (14 km) from the mine/mill complex to a port site on Hawk Inlet; from there they are shipped anywhere worldwide for smelting and refining.|$|E

Feed {{material for the}} leaching procedures described in this report was the high-tension-separated <b>metal</b> <b>concentrate</b> obtained as a fraction from mechanically processing partially stripped electronic units. Initial pretreatment with a 20 -wt-pct-NaOH solution solubilized most of the aluminum. After washing, the resulting residue was incinerated to destroy any organics attached to metal particles. The incinerated residue was leached with 20 -vol-pct H 2 S 04 solution using two methods, countercurrent pressure and ultrasonic-aided leaching to solubilize the base metals, predominantly copper. Silver was recovered from the base metal leach residue using 50 -vol-pct HN 03, and gold contaminated with several percent palladium was recovered from the silver leach residue using aqua regia.

40|$|The {{current study}} was carried out to develop an {{environmental}} benign process for direct recovery of palladium (Pd) and silver (Ag) from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) powder. The process ingeniously combined supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) and supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO 2) extraction techniques. SCWO treatment could effectively enrich Pd and Ag by degrading non-metallic component, and a precious <b>metal</b> <b>concentrate</b> (PMC) could be obtained, in which the enrichment factors of Pd and Ag reached 5. 3 and 4. 8, respectively. In the second stage, more than 93. 7 % Pd and 96. 4 % Ag could be extracted from PMC by Sc-CO 2 modified with acetone and KI-I 2 under optimum conditions. Mechanism study indicated that Pd and Ag extraction by Sc-CO 2 was a complicated physiochemical process, involving oxidation, complexation, anion exchange, mass transfer and migration approaches. Accordingly, this study established a benign and effective process for selective recovery of dispersal precious metals from waste materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} amount of research has gone into the development of a feed pretreatment process for the concentrate refined at Anglo American Platinum's Precious Metals Refiners (PMR). Such a process has the potential to significantly simplify the downstream refining process and reduce the number of unit processes required for purification. One of the considered options involves a high temperature oxidative roast process followed by a high temperature hydrochlorination process to volatilise base metal chlorides and other impurities. The resulting precious group metal (PGM) concentrate is cleaner and thus requires significantly less process steps to final product. The off-gas from hydrochlorination contains predominantly silver, copper, nickel and iron. This off-gas undergoes a quench-scrub to condense the base metal chlorides. The quench-scrub liquor undergoes a dechlorination process with sulfuric acid to precipitate AgCl(s). The filtrate from this process then undergoes an electrochemical reduction process to recover copper <b>metal</b> <b>concentrate.</b> The objectives of this study were to: i. Determine the operating conditions for an electrochemical reduction process aimed at recovering copper as a copper powder from a sulfuric acid stream containing copper, nickel and iron. ii. Develop a conceptual flowsheet for a batch electrochemical process and estimate the capital cost and operating cost...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this task}} was to work with private {{industry}} to refine existing vitrification processes to produce a more stable vitrified product. The initial objectives were to (1) demonstrate a waste vitrification procedure for enhanced stabilization of waste materials and (2) develop a testing protocol to understand the long-term leaching behavior of the stabilized waste form. The testing protocol {{was expected to be}} based on a leaching procedure called the synthetic groundwater leaching procedure (SGLP). This task will contribute to the US DOE`s identified technical needs in waste characterization, low-level mixed-waste processing, disposition technology, and improved waste forms. The proposed work was to proceed over 4 years in the following steps: literature surveys to aid in the selection and characterization of test mixtures for vitrification, characterization of optimized vitrified test wastes using advanced leaching protocols, and refinement and demonstration of vitrification methods leading to commercialization. For this year, literature surveys were completed, and computer modeling was performed to determine the feasibility of removing heavy metals from a waste during vitrification, thereby reducing the hazardous nature of the vitrified material and possibly producing a commercial <b>metal</b> <b>concentrate.</b> This report describes the following four subtasks: survey of vitrification technologies; survey of cleanup sites; selection and characterization of test mixtures for vitrification and crystallization; and selection of crystallization methods based on thermochemistry modeling...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 135 - 145. Saldanha Bay is {{a natural}} deep-water harbour {{situated}} on the Cape West Coast, approximately 100 km north of Cape Town. The bay is not an estuary, {{since there are no}} rivers or streams entering the inlet. Saldanha Bay covers a total area of approximately 9. 61 x 107 m 2 and consists of three interconnected water bodies: Langebaan Lagoon, Big Bay and Small Bay. The latter two are separated from each other by a causeway and a series of jetties. At present, Small Bay is the most developed of the water bodies, supporting activities such as commercial and industrial fishing, the mariculture of mussels, and the exportation of iron ore and <b>metal</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Conflicting demands are being placed on the system, and the sediments are known to be contaminated with a range of trace metals. The handling of ore and <b>metal</b> <b>concentrates</b> in particular, have been identified {{as a threat to the}} survival of the mariculture industries. The overall objective of this study was to provide a geochemical characterisation of the sediments in Small Bay. It focused on identifying the factors which have the greatest influence on the mobilities of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the sediments. This was achieved through a geochemical interpretation of the results obtained from analyses of sediment solid phase samples and pore water samples.
