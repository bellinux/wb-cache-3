25|$|A {{major reason}} why {{quantified}} models of utility are influential {{today is that}} risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing <b>marginal</b> <b>utility</b> implies risk aversion. In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing <b>marginal</b> <b>utility,</b> such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex <b>marginal</b> <b>utility.</b>|$|E

Vancouver, BC, 16 - 21 July 2006 A genetic {{algorithm}} {{has been developed}} to solve bidding strategies in a dynamic multi-unit auction: the Ausubel auction, with independent private values and without dropout information. The {{genetic algorithm}} aims to maximize each bidder’s payoff. To this end two experimental environments have been tested with decreasing and increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities.</b> The bidding strategies are analyzed, along with their effects on revenue and efficiency. With decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> the computational experiments yield to sincere bidding as the evolutionary-stable strategy, {{which is also the}} weakly dominant strategy and the ex post perfect equilibrium. Nevertheless, with increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> there is no theory model developed in order to find the equilibrium. Therefore, the challenge of this work is to study the auction outcome where theoretical predictions are unknown. The genetic algorithm finds bidding sincerely as the evolutionary-stable strategy with increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities...</b>|$|R

Some algorithmic results in the more general case of players with limited complementarities are also presented. The valuations of such buyers are placed within a hierarchy of valuations that exhibit no complementarities, a hierarchy that includes also OR and XOR combinations of singleton valuations, and valuations satisfying the gross substitutes property. While we show that the allocation problem among valuations with decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> is NP-hard, we present an efficient greedy 2 -approximation algorithm for this case. No such approximation algorithm exists in a setting allowing for complementarities.

One such case is examined in this paper, where the main restrictive assumptions are that all users have the same choice set and that all alternatives have the same monetary cost. Individuals have utility functions with constant <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> of time and money, but these <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> vary across individuals, and are assumed to be unobservable. We show that for this model, any toll reform that reduces aggregate travel time and redistributes the toll revenues equally to all users makes everyone better off.

25|$|Depending {{on which}} theory of utility is used, the {{interpretation}} of <b>marginal</b> <b>utility</b> can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility {{as if it were}} quantifiable, that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of <b>marginal</b> <b>utility.</b> Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.|$|E
5000|$|A {{different}} form of dynamic inconsistency arises {{as a consequence}} of [...] "projection bias" [...] (not to be confused with a defense mechanism of the same name). Humans have a tendency to mispredict their future <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> by assuming that they will remain at present levels. This leads to inconsistency as <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> (for example, tastes) change over time {{in a way that the}} individual did not expect.

40|$|In several {{problems}} of decision-making under uncertainty, {{it is necessary}} to study the sign of the covariance between <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities.</b> All of the works that study the covariance signs are based on Chebyschev’s integral inequality. However, this inequality requires that both functions be monotonic. There are many cases, originated basically by new alternative theories, which assume that the <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> of interest are non-monotonic. Thus, we cannot use Chebyschev’s result as it relies on monotonic functions. In this article, I derive some new covariance inequalities for utility functions which have non-monotonic <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities.</b> I also apply the theoretical results to two problems in economics: First, I study some properties of the indiference curve in the mean-variance space for Prospect Theory and for Markowitz utility functions.

However, it is less clear under exactly what circumstances such differences arise, whether they are important, {{and if they can}} be seen as biases in the WTP estimates from MNL. We use datasets created by Monte Carlo simulation to test, in a controlled environment, the effects of the different possible sources of bias on the accuracy of WTP's estimated by MNL. Consistent with earlier research we find that random unobserved heterogeneity in the <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> does not in itself biases the MNL estimates. Furthermore, whether or not the unobserved heterogeneity is symmetrically shaped also does not affect the accuracy of the WTP estimates of MNL. However, we find that if two heterogeneous <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> are correlated then the WTP's from MNL may be biased. If the correlation between the <b>marginal</b> <b>utilities</b> is negative, then the bias in the MNL estimate is negative, whereas if the correlation is positive the bias is positive.

25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the <b>marginal</b> <b>utility</b> of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system.
