The main principle of a RF MEMS based power senor is based on sensing the attractive electrostatic force between the signal line and a free standing electrode that is suspended at a small distance from the signal line. Key objective of this project is to optimize the novel configurations of MEMS based RF power sensor, and to find a design with decreased reflection and insertion losses. The aim includes showcase of a comparison between two design configurations in terms of reflection and insertion losses and general performance. Theoretical and simulated results are presented for the proposed designs of the sensor...|$|R

40|$|BNR and Harvard have jointly {{designed}} {{an experimental}} ATM switch called CreditSwitch with sixteen 622 -Mbps ports. Expected to be operational in early 1995, the <b>switch</b> will <b>support</b> credit-based flow control and full-speed multicast. This paper gives {{a brief overview}} of the switch architecture and its design goals. 1. Introduction ATM switches will need a new level of sophistication to handle a high-volume mix of bursty data and multimedia traffic under, respectively, ABR ("Available Bit Rate") and CBR ("Constant Bit Rate) or VBR ("Variable Bit Rate") services. Such traffic will require <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> for scheduling, policing, congestion control, and multicast. Not only should a <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> these features, but it should support them in a cost-effective manner. Harvard and Bell-Northern Research (BNR) have designed an experimental ATM switch with sixteen 622 -Mbps (Mega bit per second) ports to study new switching methods to meet these requirements. As of October 1994, all the board [...] ...|$|R
