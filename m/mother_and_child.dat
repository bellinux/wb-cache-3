50|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Children</b> (also {{known as}} La Promenade) is an Impressionist {{painting}} by Pierre-Auguste Renoir that {{is housed in}} the Frick Collection. Although the painting is most commonly known as <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Children,</b> Renoir presented it with the title La Promenade in 1876. The painting is displayed in an alcove under a set of stairs at the Frick. Jill Bialosky wrote in her memoir History of a Suicide: My Sister's Unfinished Life that, when she <b>and</b> her <b>mother</b> visited the Frick, <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Children</b> reminded her of {{what life was like}} with her <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> sister Kim before Kim died.|$|R

5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Shashthi's roots {{can be traced}} to Hindu folk traditions. References to this goddess appear in Hindu scriptures as early as 8th and 9th century BCE, in which she is associated with children as well as the Hindu war-god Skanda. Early references consider her a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as an attendant of Skanda, she is said to cause diseases in the <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> and thus needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth. However, over time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E

5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a fetus can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting.

Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E

5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E

40|$|Most {{societies}} {{support the}} view that everyone, <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> in particular, {{should be able to get}} the health care they need, when they need it. In principle, exclusion on the basis of age, sex, income, culture or location is rejected throughout the world. This concern for equity is the basis for the push towards universal coverage. Universal coverage — access to care and financial protection for all <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> as well as for the whole population — is a condition for improving health; it also corresponds to what populations, across the world, expect their governments to guarantee. Universal coverage is the key to improved equity in health; it carries increasing popular support in most countries, but has particular support where <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> are concerned. Progress towards universal coverage is therefore as much a political question as a strategy to improve the health of <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R

5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

5|$|According to Thai tradition, however, Thado Dhamma Yaza and Maha Chakkraphat {{engaged in}} single elephant-combat. (The custom {{of the time}} was for two commanders/leaders of the same status to fight in single combat. It is unclear {{as to why the}} Siamese king would have {{accepted}} to face someone of lesser rank. If he did issue the challenge, he would have challenged his counterpart Tabinshwehti and accepted to face only Tabinshwehti.) The Thai narrative continues that Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy; Thado Dhamma Yaza swiftly gave chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the King and the Viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit. The Viceroy then engaged the Queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also wounding her daughter—both <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> met their deaths {{on the back of the}} same elephant. It is said that the Viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck—as she fell dying her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the Viceroy, drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital. The Burmese chronicles however do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the viceroy of Prome.|$|E
