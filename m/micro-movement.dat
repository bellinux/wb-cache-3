40|$|Pre-clinical {{testing of}} hip endoprostheses is a {{mandatory}} requirement before clinical release. Inadequate loading conditions {{may lead to}} lower elastic and plastic interface movements than those occurring postoperatively in vivo. This study investigated the influence of patient activity on the primary stability of cementless prostheses with a special emphasis on active simulation of muscle forces. A loading set-up, based on validated musculo-skeletal analyses, was used to generate the hip contact force during walking and stair climbing by transmitting muscle forces through the femur. In addition, a loading configuration which only generated the hip contact force occurring during stair climbing at the prosthesis head was simulated. CLS prostheses were implanted in 18 composite femora and subjected to cyclical loading. The relative <b>micro-movements</b> at the bone-prosthesis interface were determined {{and appeared to be}} extremely sensitive to the specific patient activity. Compared to walking, stair climbing generated higher <b>micro-movements,</b> with pronounced axial and rotational components. Stair climbing with the femur loaded by the resultant hip contact force only exhibited a characteristic valgus tilt of the stem with significantly lower interface <b>micro-movements</b> than under active simulation of muscle forces. The analyses suggest that stair climbing induced the highest mechanical instability at the bone-prosthesis interface, a level which may compromise the necessary osseointegration process. Active simulation of muscle forces considerably affects the primary stability of cementless hip endoprostheses. Pre-clinical in vitro tests should therefore simulate stair climbing and include muscle activity in the assessment of initial implant stability, otherwise <b>micro-movements</b> may be underestimated and the primary stability overestimated...|$|R

We define a face template consisting of 26 regions based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We extract the temporal features of each region using 3 D HOG.

30|$|According to many {{previous}} studies, {{many researchers}} believed that after implantation {{in the jaw}} for a future prosthesis, titanium implants should be left submerged to undergo a healing process before {{they are capable of}} functional loading.

The reason for the delayed loading was to avoid <b>micro-movement</b> on the implant, which could interfere with the healing process.

40|$|The genetic {{algorithm}} (GA) {{is a popular}} random search and optimization method inspired by the concepts of crossover, random mutation, and natural selection from evolutionary biology. The real-valued {{genetic algorithm}} (RGA) is an improved version of the genetic algorithm designed for direct operation on real-valued variables.

Finally, we implement the MGAM on the most important application, which is the plasma physics-based model of the solar wind-driven magnetosphere-ionosphere system (WINDMI). In order to use this model for real-time prediction of geomagnetic activity, the model parameters require up-dating every 6 - 8 hours. We use the MGAM to train the parameters of the model in order to achieve the lowest mean square error (MSE) against the measured auroral electrojet (AL) and Dst indices. The performance of the MGAM is compared to the RGA on historical geomagnetic storm datasets.

40|$|Autism {{has been}} defined as a {{disorder}} of social cognition, interaction and communication where ritualistic, repetitive behaviors are commonly observed. But how should we understand the behavioral and cognitive differences that have been the main focus of so much autism research? Can high-level cognitive processes and behaviors be identified as the core issues people with autism face, or do these characteristics perhaps often rather reflect individual attempts to cope with underlying physiological issues? Much research presented in this volume will point to the latter possibility, i. e. that people on the autism spectrum cope with issues at much lower physiological levels pertaining not only to Central Nervous Systems (CNS) function, but also to peripheral and autonomic systems (PNS, ANS) (Torres, Brincker, et al. 2013). The question that we pursue in this chapter is what might be fruitful ways of gaining objective measures of the large-scale systemic and heterogeneous effects of early atypical neurodevelopment; how to track their evolution over time and how to identify critical changes along the continuum of human development and aging. We suggest that the study of movement variability—very broadly conceived as including all minute fluctuations in bodily rhythms and their rates of change over time (coined <b>micro-movements</b> (Figure 1 A-B) (Torres, Brincker, et al. 2013)) —offers a uniquely valuable and entirely objectively quantifiable lens to better assess, understand and track not only autism but cognitive development and degeneration in general. This chapter presents the rationale firstly behind this focus on <b>micro-movements</b> and secondly behind the choice of specific kinds of data collection and statistical metrics as tools of analysis (Figure 1 C). In brief the proposal is that the <b>micro-movements</b> (defined in Part I – Chapter 1), obtained using various time scales applied to different physiological data-types (Figure 1), contain information about layered influences and temporal adaptations, transformations and integrations across anatomically semi-independent subsystems that crosstalk and interact. Further, the notion of sensorimotor re-afference is used to highlight the fact that these layered micro-motions are sensed and that this sensory feedback plays {{a crucial role in the}} generation and control of movements in the first place. In other words, the measurements of various motoric and rhythmic variations provide an access point not only to the “motor systems”, but also access to much broader central and peripheral sensorimotor and regulatory systems. Lastly, we posit that this new lens can also be used to capture influences from systems of multiple entry points or collaborative control and regulation, such as those that emerge during dyadic social interactions...|$|R
40|$|The current {{assessment}} of {{behaviors in the}} inventories to diagnose autism spectrum disorders (ASD) focus on observation and discrete categorizations. Behaviors require movements, yet measurements of physical movements are seldom included. Their inclusion however, could provide an objective characterization of behavior to help unveil interactions between the peripheral and the central nervous systems. Such interactions are critical for the development and maintenance of spontaneous autonomy, self-regulation and voluntary control. At present, current approaches cannot deal with the heterogeneous, dynamic and stochastic nature of development. Accordingly, they leave no avenues for real-time or longitudinal assessments of change in a coping system continuously adapting and developing compensatory mechanisms. We offer a new unifying statistical framework to reveal re-afferent kinesthetic features of the individual with ASD. The new methodology {{is based on the}} non-stationary stochastic patterns of minute fluctuations (<b>micro-movements)</b> inherent to our natural actions. Such patterns of behavioral variability provide re-entrant sensory feedback contributing to the autonomous regulation and coordination of the motor output. From an early age, this feedback supports centrally driven volitional control and fluid, flexible transitions between intentional and spontaneous behaviors. We show that in ASD there is a disruption in the maturation of this form of proprioception. Despite this disturbance, each individual has unique adaptive compensatory capabilities that we can unveil and exploit to evoke faster and more accurate decisions. Measuring the kinesthetic re-afference in tandem with stimuli variations we can detect changes in their <b>micro-movements</b> indicative of a more predictive and reliable kinesthetic percept. Our methods address the heterogeneity of ASD with a personalized approach grounded in the inherent sensory-motor abilities that the individual has already developed...|$|R
