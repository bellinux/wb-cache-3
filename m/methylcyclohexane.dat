5000|$|Furthermore, it is {{considered}} [...] "very toxic to aquatic life". Note, while <b>methylcyclohexane</b> is a substructure of 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM), it is distinct in its physical, chemical, and biological (ecologic, metabolic, and toxicologic) properties.|$|E
5000|$|The methyl {{group in}} toluene {{undergoes}} deprotonation only with very strong bases, its pKa {{is estimated to}} be approximately 41. [...] Hydrogenation of toluene gives <b>methylcyclohexane.</b> The reaction requires a high pressure of hydrogen and a catalyst.|$|E
50|$|Perfluoromethylcyclohexane can be {{manufactured}} by the Fowler process, which involves moderating {{the action of}} elemental fluorine with cobalt fluoride in the gas phase from toluene. This is preferred as the starting material over <b>methylcyclohexane</b> as less fluorine is required.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methyl{{cyclohexane}}</b> is a monosubstituted cyclohexane {{because it}} has one branching via the attachment of one methyl group on one carbon of the cyclohexane ring. Like all cyclohexanes, it can interconvert rapidly between two chair conformers. The lowest energy form of this monosubstituted <b>methylcyclohexane</b> occurs when the methyl group occupies an equatorial rather than an axial position. This equilibrium is embodied {{in the concept of}} A value. In the axial position, the methyl group experiences steric crowding (steric strain) {{because of the presence of}} axial hydrogen atoms on the same side of the ring (known as the 1,3-diaxial interactions). There are two such interactions, with each pairwise methyl/hydrogen combination contributing approximately 7.61 kJ/mol of strain energy. The equatorial conformation experiences no such interaction, and so it is the energetically favored conformation.|$|E
50|$|Typically {{hydrocarbon}} compounds {{are used}} as the feedstocks. For cyclic perfluorocarbon, the aromatic hydrocarbon is the preferred choice, so for example, toluene is the feedstock for perfluoromethylcyclohexane, rather than <b>methylcyclohexane,</b> as less fluorine is required. Often partially fluorinated feedstocks are used, for example, bis-1,3-(trifluoromethyl)benzene to make perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane. Although these are considerably more expensive, they require less fluorine and more importantly, they generally give higher yields, as the cabocation rearrangements are much less likely.|$|E
50|$|Determining {{the strain}} energy within a {{molecule}} requires {{knowledge of the}} expected internal energy without the strain. There are two ways do this. First, one could compare to a similar compound that lacks strain, {{such as in the}} previous <b>methylcyclohexane</b> example. Unfortunately, it can often be difficult to obtain a suitable compound. An alternative is to use Benson group increment theory. As long as suitable group increments are available for the atoms within a compound, a prediction of ΔHfo can be made. If the experimental ΔHfo differs from the predicted ΔHfo, this difference in energy can be attributed to strain energy.|$|E
50|$|Piperidine {{prefers a}} chair conformation, similar to cyclohexane. Unlike cyclohexane, {{piperidine}} has two distinguishable chair conformations: {{one with the}} N-H bond in an axial position, {{and the other in}} an equatorial position. After much controversy during the 1950s-1970s, the equatorial conformation was found to be more stable by 0.72 kcal/mol in the gas phase. In nonpolar solvents, a range between 0.2 and 0.6 kcal/mol has been estimated, but in polar solvents the axial conformer may be more stable. The two conformers interconvert rapidly through nitrogen inversion; the free energy activation barrier for this process, estimated at 6.1 kcal/mol, is substantially lower than the 10.4 kcal/mol for ring inversion. In the case of N-methylpiperidine, the equatorial conformation is preferred by 3.16 kcal/mol, which is much larger than the preference in <b>methylcyclohexane,</b> 1.74 kcal/mol.|$|E
50|$|Fuel surrogates are {{mixtures}} {{of one or}} more simple fuels that are designed to emulate either the physical properties (vapor pressure) or combustion properties (laminar flame speed, heating value, etc.) of a more complex fuel. While surrogate mixtures can demonstrate more than one characteristic of the desired fuel, more often than not different components are required in order to emulate the wide variety of properties that are of interest to researchers. Jet fuel {{is an example of a}} fuel requiring a surrogate for experimental research and numerical modelling due to its complexity and high content variability from one batch to the next. Neat hydrocarbon jet fuel surrogate components include decane, dodecane, <b>methylcyclohexane,</b> and toluene. Gasoline surrogate components include n-heptane and iso-octane. Hexadecane is a diesel surrogate component. Biodiesel surrogate components include methyl butyrate and methyl decanoate.|$|E
50|$|In {{cyclohexane}} derivatives, the two chair conformations {{may have}} different energies, depending upon the identity and location of the substituents. For example, in <b>methylcyclohexane</b> the lowest energy conformation is a chair one where the methyl group is in equatorial position. This configuration reduces interaction between the methyl group (on carbon number 1) and the hydrogens at carbons 3 and 5; more importantly, it avoids two gauche butane interactions (of the C1-CH3 bond with the C2-C3 and C5-C6 ring bonds). Similarly, cis-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane usually has both methyls in the equatorial position {{so as to avoid}} interaction between them. In six-membered heterocycles such as pyran, a substituent next to an heteroatom may prefer the axial position due to the anomeric effect. Finally, the preference of a substituent towards the equatorial conformation is measured in terms of its A value, which is the Gibbs free energy difference between the two chair conformations, with the substituent in equatorial or in axial position. A positive A value indicates preference towards the equatorial position. The magnitude of the A values ranges from nearly zero for very small substituents such as deuterium, to about 5 kcal/mol for very bulky substituents such as the tert-butyl group.|$|E

40|$|The {{developed}} SEMK {{model is}} used to provide an insight into the contribution of individual reactions in the cracking of <b>methylcyclohexane</b> {{as well as the}} site coverage by various carbenium ions. The preferred reaction pathways for the conversion of <b>methylcyclohexane</b> are hydride transfer reactions followed by PCP-isomerizations, deprotonation and endocyclic beta-scission, accounting for 61 %, 22 % and 12 % of its disappearance, respectively, at 693 K and 30 % conversion of <b>methylcyclohexane.</b> Protolysis plays a minor role in the cracking of <b>methylcyclohexane.</b> Once cyclic diolefins are formed, all of them can be instantaneously transformed to aromatics, which are easily interconverted via disproportionation.

40|$|AbstractA compact {{multifunctional}} Pd/alumina {{hollow fibre}} membrane reactor (HFMR) {{has been developed}} and used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of <b>methylcyclohexane</b> to toluene. The developed HFMR consists of a thin and defect-free Pd membrane of 5 μm coated directly onto the outer surface of an alumina hollow fibre substrate. The substrate, was prepared by a phase inversion/sintering method, possess a unique asymmetric structure which can be characterised by a very porous inner surface from which finger-like voids extend across approximately 80 % of the fibre cross-section with the remaining 20 % consisting of a denser sponge-like outer layer. A 50 wt% Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst is directly deposited into the asymmetric support, with a fraction of catalyst particles distributed uniformly in the finger-like macro-voids while the others on the lumen surface forming a “filter-cake”-like layer. A significant increase in gas permeation resistance occurs due to this “filter-cake”-like catalyst layer when the catalyst loading (weight per unit fibre length) is above 2. 3 mgcm- 1. <b>Methylcyclohexane</b> conversion increases with the increasing temperatures, because of the endothermic nature of the reaction; while decreases with the higher sweep gas flow rates due to the more serious catalyst deactivation in the HFMR. For a HFMR with 1. 0 mg cm- 1 of catalyst loading, <b>methylcyclohexane</b> conversion of approximately 26 % can be achieved at 610 °C with the sweep gas flowrate of 20 ml min- 1, while for a porous membrane reactor and a fixed-bed reactor the <b>methylcyclohexane</b> conversion of 50 % and 25 % can be achieved at identical operating temperature...|$|E

40|$|Hydrate {{formation}} rate {{plays an important}} role in making hydrates for the storage and transport of natural gas. Micellar surfactant solutions were found to increase gas hydrate {{formation rate}} and storage capacity. With the presence of surfactant, hydrate could form quickly in a quiescent system and the energy costs of hydrate formation reduced. Surfactants (an anionic surfactant, a non-ionic surfactant and their mixtures) and liquid hydrocarbons (cyclopentane and <b>methylcyclohexane)</b> were used to improve hydrate formation. The experiments of hydrate formation were carried out in the pressure range 3. 69 - 6. 82 MPa and the temperature range 274. 05 - 277. 55 K. The experimental pressures were kept constant during hydrate formation in each experimental run. The effect of anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)) on natural gas storage in hydrates is more pronounced compared to a non-ionic surfactant (dodecyl polysaccharide glycoside (DPG)). The induction time of hydrate formation was reduced with the presence of cyclopentane (CP). Cyclopentane and <b>methylcyclohexane</b> (MCH) could increase hydrate formation rate, but reduced hydrate storage capacity The higher <b>methylcyclohexane</b> concentration, the lower the hydrate storage capacity.

40|$|The {{preignition}} {{behavior of}} several large molecular weight hydrocarbons, neat and binary mixtures, has been examined in a pressurized flow reactor {{in the low}} and intermediate temperature regime (600 – 800 K) at elevated pressures (8 atm). The hydrocarbons examined included n-dodecane, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8 -heptamethyl-nonane (iso-cetane), <b>methylcyclohexane,</b> and 1 -methylnaphthalene. For each experiment, gas-phase samples were extracted to identify and quantify the major oxidation products.

The results were compared to a lumped mechanism developed by Ranzi and Faravelli at Politecnico di Milano [1]. For n-dodecane and iso-cetane, the agreement between the mechanism and experiments were generally acceptable, but the model overestimated the formation of lower molecular weight fragments. The agreement for <b>methylcyclohexane</b> was considerably worse, as the mechanism improperly assumed that the fuel fragments instead of dehydrogenates.

This study aimed {{to verify the}} toxicity and influence on the reproductive system of <b>methylcyclohexane</b> after its repeated injection in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Methods: <b>Methylcyclohexane</b> was injected subcutaneously into male and female SD rats once a day, five times a week, for 13 weeks at different doses (0, 10, 100, and 1, 000  mg/kg/day) for each group. The toxicity of testing material was verified by observing the change in body and organ weight, hematological change, pathological findings, and effect on the reproductive system at each different concentration. Results: In the 1, 000  mg/kg/day group, there were cases of animal deaths. In animals that survived, hematological changes, including {{a decrease in the}} red blood cell count, were observed. A considerable weight gain or loss and pathological abnormalities in the liver, kidney, and other organs were found. However, the 10 and 100  mg/kg/day groups did not cause deaths or other specific abnormalities. In terms of reproductive toxicity, there were changes in hormone levels, including a significant decrease in hormones such as estradiol and progesterone (p < 0. 001) in male animals. Menstrual cycle change for female animals did not show concentration dependency. Conclusion: When injected repeatedly for 13 weeks, <b>methylcyclohexane</b> proved to be toxic for the liver, heart, and kidney at a high dose.

40|$|Catalytic {{cracking}} of <b>methylcyclohexane</b> {{has been}} studied on eight commercially available zeolites, five FAUs and three MFIs, and on two newly developed zeotype materials with bimodal porous structure, BIPOMs. Both BIPOMs are composed of an MFI ultramicropore (< 1 nm) network and a different supermicropore (1. 5 - 2. 0 nm) network. Site time yields obtained on FAU and MFI zeolites with varying acid properties {{are in the same}} range, showing that mass transfer limitations inside the pores of both zeolite frameworks are absent. Site time yields obtained on BIPOM 3 are comparable to those on commercial MFI with similar Si/Al ratio, while BIPOM 1 is significantly less active. Within a given framework type, the zeolite acid properties determine its activity in <b>methylcyclohexane</b> cracking, while the pore topology controls its selectivity. On FAU, <b>methylcyclohexane</b> isomerization, followed by ring opening and subsequent cracking, is the main reaction pathway, while on MFI, protolytic scission, followed by cracking, is predominant.
