5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} <b>matter.</b> <b>More</b> precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes <b>matter</b> <b>more</b> slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant <b>matter</b> <b>more</b> efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E

25|$|Ozenfant and Jeanneret {{felt that}} Cubism {{had become too}} decorative, practiced by so many {{individuals}} that it lacked unity, it had become too fashionable. Their clarity of subject <b>matter</b> (<b>more</b> figurative, less abstract than the Cubists) had been welcomed {{by members of the}} anti-Cubist camp. They showed works that were a direct result of observation; perspectival space only slightly distorted. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, like Lhote, remained faithful to the Cubist idiom that form should not be abandoned. Some of the works exhibited related directly to the Cubism practiced during the war (such as Ozenfant's Bottle, Pipe and Books, 1918), with flatted planar structures and varying degrees of multiple perspective.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of the research questions. Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject <b>matter.</b> <b>More</b> importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the type of setting a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect the answer that the subject gives.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable <b>matter</b> <b>more</b> readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E

As Watt writes, [...] "Over the dinner table, Beneš convinced the British and French that the plebiscite should not be held and that the Allies should simply impose their own decision in the Teschen <b>matter.</b> <b>More</b> than that, Beneš persuaded the French and the British to draw a frontier line that gave Czechoslovakia most of the territory of Teschen, the vital railroad and all the important coal fields. With this frontier, 139,000 Poles were to be left in Czech territory, whereas only 2,000 Czechs were left on the Polish side".|$|E

Scientists indicate fire as the cause; it is also cited as the reason for the black color of Everglades muck. Layers of charcoal have been detected in the peat in portions of the Everglades that indicate the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence in 940 BCE.|$|E

[...] Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a [...] "shallow imitation of its predecessor". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating [...] " [...] the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature, you need to look no further than its title. Long live the Diva." [...] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, [...] "nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range." [...] Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, [...] "Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah bends over backward to show her work."
