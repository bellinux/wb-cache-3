2500|$|Mary Cheney {{left the}} public {{spotlight}} after the 2004 election until May 4, 2006, {{when she was}} interviewed by Diane Sawyer for ABC News' Primetime program to promote her autobiography, Now It's My Turn. In the book, published in 2006, Cheney discusses how she came out to her parents, recounting her father's initial reaction: [...] "You know, look, you're <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> love you and I {{just want you to}} be happy." [...] She also discusses her relationship with her partner, Heather Poe.|$|E
60|$|This came later, when <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{were able}} to {{converse}} alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are on the}} bow hand still, smith. I tell you, <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could {{nose out}} either a fasting hypocrite or a full one. But Father Clement is neither the one nor the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is not often,' he said, 'Martin, that <b>my</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> desert our quiet home {{to pursue}} the giddy round of pleasures that {{revolves}} abroad. But we think of doing so to-day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Madam,' pursued that gentleman, 'as {{you have}} had the {{kindness}} to undertake the--hum--formation of <b>my</b> <b>daughters,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> am persuaded that nothing nearly affecting them can--ha--be indifferent to you--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>my</b> little <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{live with}} <b>my</b> father again." [...] What [...] "came over" [...] her--as they say--to be so frank, {{she could not}} have told.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, sir, {{what do you}} want? Name your errand here, quickly, if you please, for <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are busily {{engaged with}} other and more {{important}} matters than those you come about. Come, sir, address yourself to your business at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} he is here," [...] said Mr. Gilbert, [...] "for {{it would be}} very painful to meet him. <b>My</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will retire very soon, and go away as early to-morrow morning as possible, so as to avoid seeing him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Coulthurst {{raised his}} hand in protest. [...] "It is very {{good of you to}} say so, but, while she is <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am {{naturally}} a trifle proud of her, the advantages would in one sense have been so much in her favour----" ...|$|E
5000|$|Dorries' {{daughter}} {{was among the}} highest earning family members employed by MPs with a salary of £40,000-45,000 as an office manager. This is {{despite the fact that}} her daughter lived 96 miles away from the office. Subsequently her sister was taken on as senior secretary with a salary of £30,000-35,000. Ben Glaze, a journalist with the Sunday Mirror, was threatened by Dorries on Twitter for asking questions about the MP's employment practices: [...] "Be seen within a mile of <b>my</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will nail your balls to the floor... using your own front teeth. Do you get that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Raab Kiuprili (to himself). [...] Righteous Heaven [...] Sent me a <b>daughter</b> once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> repined [...] That {{it was not}} a son. A son {{was given}} me. [...] <b>My</b> <b>daughter</b> died, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> scarce shed a tear: [...] 140 [...] And lo! that son became my curse and infamy.|$|R
6000|$|... "And even that," [...] the Duchess remarked, smiling, [...] "has been yellow for {{the last}} few days. Prince, you know <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> Grace, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am sure that you have met Miss Penelope Morse? We are waiting for two other men, Sir Charles Somerfield and Mr. Vanderpole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Señora is most kind," [...] the Doña Maria replied, seating herself submissively. With {{her dark}} hand she brushed away a tear. [...] "We are ever happy, <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> {{that we have}} known one so good and gentle," [...] she added, feelingly.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she looked}} up and said, [...] "It is Miss Hannay, she was {{captured}} with us in the boats; please help me to carry her over to the wall there, and <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will nurse her; it looks {{as if she had been}} terribly burnt, somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} {{understand}} my situation--my state of mind. Your brother wishes to marry <b>my</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish {{to find out what}} sort of a young man he is. A good way to do so seemed to be to come and ask you; which I have proceeded to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You were in Vienna then!' the Cantankerous Old Lady mused back. 'Lois, my child, don't stare'--she had covenanted {{from the}} first to call me Lois, as <b>my</b> father's <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> confess I {{preferred}} it to being Miss Cayley'd. 'We must surely have met. Dare I ask your name, monsieur?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Master Aylmer, {{that you}} have made <b>my</b> <b>daughter's</b> acquaintance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have told you what news I have gathered, it needs not that I should detain you longer; the hour is getting late already, and your lady may well be getting anxious at your absence. Can you read?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{have more}} than {{obtained}} news, Your Majesty. I have <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> back again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have come to demand justice at your hands.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said so, Sir," [...] {{she replied}} humbly, always {{speaking}} in her feigned voice, [...] "yet forgive {{us if we}} believed you not, since in our journeyings <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have seen many princes, and know that such a thing is contrary to their nature. Still we will show you our wares, for surely all the men in Napata are not unmarried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] Sir Timothy declared, helping himself with care to the pate. [...] "I have no superstitions about {{breaking}} bread with an enemy, or I should not have asked you to visit me at The Sanctuary, Mr. Ledsam. I object to your marriage with <b>my</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall take what steps I can to prevent it." ...|$|E
6000|$|DEARTH. Well, it doesn't matter. Here is the situation; <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have just}} {{met in the}} wood a poor woman famishing for want of food. We were as happy as grigs ourselves, {{and the sight of}} her {{distress}} rather cut us up. Can you give me something for her? Why are you looking so startled? (Seeing the remains of the cake.) May I have this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{will tell}} thee {{something}} that, till this hour, I have hidden from all, {{for it is}} my shame. This Swanhild is <b>my</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> therefore <b>I</b> have loved her and put away her evil deeds, and she is half-sister to thee, Gudruda. See, then, how sore is my straight, who must avenge daughter upon daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} enjoy having <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> marry you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall not pretend to enjoy it. If you don't mind that, {{so much the}} better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Mr Eames, it's {{all over}} now, and we {{understand}} each other; don't we? It made me very unhappy when she was setting her cap at you; it did indeed. She is <b>my</b> own <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't go against her;--could I? But I knew it wasn't in any way suiting. Laws, I know the difference. She's good enough for him {{any day of the}} week, Mr Eames." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Foolish boy," [...] he said, [...] "hast thou {{not lived}} long enough in my shop {{to know that a}} blow will breed a brawl; that a dirk will cut the skin as fast as a needle pierces leather; that I love peace, though I never feared war, and care not which side of the {{causeway}} <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> walk upon so we may keep our road in peace and quietness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a {{suite of}} rooms there which I {{occasionally}} occupy," [...] Sir Timothy replied, [...] "and there are always thirty or forty servants and attendants of different sorts who have their quarters there. I suppose that <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would be there at the present moment but {{for the fact that}} we own this cottage. Both she and I, for residential purposes, prefer the atmosphere there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the King had Ferko {{brought before}} him, and said, 'You {{are accused of}} being a magician who wishes to rob me of <b>my</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> condemn you to death; but if you can fulfil three tasks which I shall set you to do your life shall be spared, on {{condition}} you leave the country; but if you cannot perform what I demand you shall be hung on the nearest tree.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [importantly] Our Prime Minister, Mr Badger Bluebin, {{has come}} to consult the oracle. He is my son-in-law. We are {{accompanied}} by his wife <b>and</b> daughter: <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> granddaughter. <b>I</b> may mention that General Aufsteig, {{who is one of}} our party, is really the Emperor of Turania travelling incognito. I understand he has a question to put to the oracle informally. I have come solely to visit the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I won't be {{anything}} out of pocket. And let me thank you personally {{for what you did}} for <b>my</b> wife <b>and</b> <b>daughter.</b> <b>I</b> just heard of it, as I have been away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God," [...] exclaimed Mr. Brinsmade, fervently. [...] "If {{you will}} excuse me, madam, I shall hurry to tell <b>my</b> wife <b>and</b> <b>daughter.</b> <b>I</b> {{have been able}} to find no one who saw him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Fairfax, {{young ladies}} are very {{sure to be}} cared for.--I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very old friends. I wish my health allowed {{me to be a}} better neighbour. You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. <b>My</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are both highly {{sensible}} of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{distinguish}} a little," [...] {{said the}} Keeper, assuming {{an appearance of}} ease which perhaps his heart was a stranger to; [...] "this is an honour which I have eagerly desired for some time, but which I might never have obtained, save for the accident of the storm. <b>My</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are alike grateful for this opportunity of thanking the brave man to whom she owes her life and I mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Eustacie's first {{view was}} a bright {{pleasure}} in the triumph of her skill; and when her considerate guardian endeavoured to impress on her {{that there was no}} necessity for vexing herself with the task, she turned round on him with the exclamation, 'Nay, dear father, do you not see it is my great satisfaction {{to be able to do}} something for our good hostess, so that <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> be not a burden to her?' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{obedience}} {{to his own}} earnest request, though sorely against the feelings of <b>my</b> wife <b>and</b> <b>daughters,</b> <b>I</b> buried the body of my old friend in the ocean, six days before we made the land.|$|R
6000|$|... "Darkeye!" [...] shouted Laroche, {{suddenly}} {{rising from}} his reclining position and staring the Indian {{in the face}} with a dark scowl. [...] "Why, Jasper, this is the villain who insulted <b>my</b> <b>daughter,</b> <b>and</b> to whom <b>I</b> taught the lesson that an old man could knock him down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before we go further, sir, I {{should like}} an {{explanation}} of the events which have just transpired. By what right, sir, did you interfere between <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Canler? <b>I</b> had promised him her hand, sir, and regardless of our personal likes or dislikes, sir, that promise must be kept." ...|$|R
