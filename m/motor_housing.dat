25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|E
2500|$|The rotor is {{supported}} by bearings, which allow the rotor to turn on its axis. [...] The bearings are in turn supported by the <b>motor</b> <b>housing.</b> [...] The motor shaft extends through the bearings {{to the outside of}} the motor, where the load is applied. [...] Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be overhung.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Motor</b> <b>House</b> (Beit HaMotor) was {{constructed}} in 1910 to house a water pump used to draw water for irrigation; {{it was the first}} pumping station in what would become modern Israel.

50|$|Most of the {{outbuildings}} {{and structures}} {{associated with the}} running of the homestead were erected in 1915: the cattle dip and yards, house well, tank stand, gas house, and septic tank; the <b>motor</b> buggy <b>house</b> at Balnagowan was dismantled and re-erected at Greenmount as a workman's hut; similarly, another <b>motor</b> <b>house</b> and box shed from Balnagowan became a garage at Greenmount. Early in 1916 a <b>motor</b> <b>house</b> was constructed using timber and iron from Balnagowan, a wash house was erected, and the Balnagowan bush house was removed to Greenmount. This was replaced in 1928, and re-built in 1988.|$|R
2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>housing.</b> These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high starting torque. Typically they can have up-to four times as much starting torque than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E

5000|$|Hugger {{ceiling fans}} (also known as [...] "flush mount" [...] or [...] "low profile" [...] ceiling fans) have no downrod or canopy like a {{traditional}} mount fan, and the <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> is mounted {{directly to the}} mount. Hugger style fans generally have spinner motors, and use a special mounting bracket that holds the motor assembly and the <b>motor</b> <b>housing.</b> They are typically used in rooms with low ceilings. A disadvantage to this design it that since the blades are mounted {{so close to the}} ceiling, the air movement is greatly reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Spinner fans {{employ a}} {{direct-drive}} motor {{and do not}} have a stationary decorative cover (<b>motor</b> <b>housing).</b> This accounts for most industrial-style fans (though such fans sometimes have more moderate-quality motors), and some inexpensive residential-style fans (particularly those made overseas).|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{the oldest}} {{existing}} garage in the United Kingdom is in Southport Lancashire. It {{was the first}} <b>motor</b> <b>house</b> or garage to be depicted in an English motoring journal and was in The Autocar of 7 October 1899. It was owned by Dr W.W. Barratt, a local doctor and motoring pioneer and specially designed for his house at 29 Park Crescent Hesketh Park. A two storey building that matched {{the style of the}} house; the ground floor garage having a concrete floor, heating, electric lighting, an engine pit and was fully equipped.

5000|$|A {{vane motor}} {{consists}} of a housing with an eccentric bore, in which runs a rotor with vanes in it that slide in and out. The force differential created by the unbalanced force of the pressurized fluid on the vanes causes the rotor to spin in one direction. A critical element in vane motor design is how the vane tips are machined at the contact point between vane tip and <b>motor</b> <b>housing.</b> Several types of [...] "lip" [...] designs are used, and the main objective {{is to provide a}} tight seal between the inside of the <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> and the vane, {{and at the same time}} to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact.|$|E
5000|$|Table fan: Basic {{elements}} of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, armature and lead wires, motor, blade guard, <b>motor</b> <b>housing,</b> oscillator gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that moves the fan from side to side. The armature shaft comes out {{on both ends of}} the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.|$|E
5000|$|Above this {{maximum speed}} {{centrifugal}} {{force on the}} armature will cause the windings to be thrown outward. In severe cases, {{this can lead to}} [...] "birdnesting" [...] as the windings contact the <b>motor</b> <b>housing</b> and eventually break loose from the armature entirely and uncoil.|$|E

50|$|Unlike air conditioners, fans only move air—they do not {{directly}} change its temperature.
