40|$|Somalia, {{one of the}} world's poorest countries, has {{livestock}} as {{the mainstay}} of the economy, with an estimated 65 % of the population engaged in the livestock sector. This paper presents a gendered study on the traditional livestock breeding practices of Somali pastoralists for camels, cattle, sheep and goats, {{with a focus on}} documenting livestock traits of importance, the criteria used to select <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> and the criteria used to cull female <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> Data for the study were obtained by performing participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) with separate male and female pastoral groups from 20 settlements of the Tog-Dheer region of Somaliland (in north-western Somalia). In total, more than 500 pastoralists were involved. In terms of livestock ownership, goats were the most common species kept (97 % of all households), followed by sheep (64 %), camels (37 %) and cattle (9 %), with considerable herd size variation across households. Traits of key importance to the pastoralists varied by species and gender of the PRA group, but included adaptedness to harsh environmental conditions, high market value/high meat production and high milk production. The pastoralists practised sensible criteria for the selection of <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> for all species, capturing aspects of productivity (milk yield, reproduction), adaptedness (good hardiness) and marketability (body size and conformation). Similarly, they practised sensible criteria for culling of female <b>breeding</b> <b>animals,</b> with females removed from the herd primarily for poor performance, but also to meet the livelihood needs of the family. Differences in the selection and culling criteria were noted by species, as well as gender of the pastoralists. On the whole, there was strong alignment between the livestock selection criteria used by the Somali pastoralists, their reasons for keeping livestock and the market requirements. This is not surprising given the intimate and long-standing relationship between Somali pastoralists and their livestock. Danish International Development AgencyPeer Revie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper gives a {{detailed}} analysis of the applied biosecurity measures in the production of boar sperm at a swine reproduction center. Biosecurity indicators (existence of a written biosecurity plan, isolation, introduction of newly acquired animals into the herd, herd health, assessment of the personnel attitude towards equipment, traffic control, attitude towards visitors, feeding and watering control, manure management, disposal of dead animal carcasses, attitude towards other animals, rodents and birds control, sanitation) were viewed and evaluated by rating scale: (5) - excellent, (4) - very good, (3) -good, (2) - sufficient, (1) - insufficient, there are resources for improvement (0) -insufficient, with no resources for improvement. Obtained data were analyzed in the SWOT process, taking into account all the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities for improving the biosecurity level. The situation in the center is rated as very good, with an average rating of 4. 15. However, one disadvantage is serious and related to the boar facilities isolation possibilities, taking into account their location and the presence of two types of <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> (boars and bulls) in the same location.

25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of secondary sex characteristics in <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> <b>animals,</b> such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. The argument is that female hosts select <b>males</b> for <b>breeding</b> based on such characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|R
40|$|To provide <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> <b>animals</b> {{free from}} {{diseases}} {{is one of}} the biggest problems of small ruminant farming. Farms that can not find suitable <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> materials have to use the same ram or Bucks for long periods of time and thus the herds have not reached the desired levels in terms of the yield and yield declines are the case. By establishing ram-buck provision and test stations, this problem could be solved to according to the expectations of the breeders to provide qualified rams. The main target in the establishment of these centers is to collect ram or buck candidate male offsprings through pre-selection methods from the farms where the breeders can not keep them in their herds due to economical hardships. After the tests, the selected convenient breeding candidates could be utilized in the breeding herds in natural or artificial insemination methods to meet the need for <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> materials. In this article, some difficulties and proposals have been given towards the establishment of test stations to provide <b>breeding</b> <b>male</b> material for small ruminant farming in countries like Turkey, where extensive breeding is in use and where recording systems have not yet been launched yet, and towards the roles of the Breeding Sheep and Buck Breeders’ Associations...|$|R
40|$|Chantier qualité GAStochastic {{simulation}} {{was used}} to compare the efficiency of 3 pig breeding schemes based on either traditional genetic evaluation or genomic evaluation. The simulated population contained 1, 050 female and 50 <b>male</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> It was selected for 10 yr for a synthetic breeding goal that included 2 traits with equal economic weights and heritabilities of 0. 2 or 0. 4. The reference breeding scheme, named BLUP-AM, was based on the phenotyping of all candidates (13, 770 animals/yr) for Trait 1 and of relatives from 10 % of the litters (270 animals/yr) for Trait 2 and on BLUP-Animal Model genetic evaluations. Under the first alternative scenario, named GE- 1 TP, selection was based on genomic breeding values (GBV) estimated with one training population (TP) made up of candidate relatives phenotyped for both traits, with a size increasing from 1, 000 to 3, 430 over time. Under the second alternative scenario, named GE- 2 TP, the GBV for Trait 2 were estimated using a TP identical to that of GE- 1 TP, but the GBV for Trait 1 were estimated using a large TP made up of candidates that increased in number from 13, 770 to 55, 080 over time. Over the simulated period, both genomic breeding schemes generated 39 to 58 % more accurate EBV for Trait 2 than the reference scheme, resulting in 78 to 128 % (GE- 1 TP) and 63 to 84 % (GE- 2 TP) greater average annual genetic trends for this trait. For Trait 1, GE- 1 TP was 18 to 24 % less accurate than BLUP-AM, reducing average annual genetic trends by 27 to 44 %. By contrast, GE- 2 TP generated 35 to 43 % more accurate EBV and 8 to 22 % greater average annual genetic trends for Trait 1 than the reference scheme. Consequently, GE- 2 TP was 27 to 33 % more efficient in improving the global breeding goal than BLUP-AM whereas GE- 1 TP was globally as efficient as the reference scheme. Both genomic schemes reduced the inbreeding rate, the greatest decrease being observed for GE- 2 TP (- 49 to - 60 % compared with BLUP-AM). In conclusion, genomic selection could substantially and durably improve the efficiency of pig breeding schemes in terms of reliability, genetic trends, and inbreeding rate without any need to modify their current structure. Even though it only generates a small TP, limited annual phenotyping capacity for traits currently only recorded on relatives would not be prohibitive. A large TP is, however, required to outperform the current schemes for traits recorded on the candidates in the latter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Accounting for and {{quantifying}} the associative {{effect of}} each animal could improve both {{welfare of animals}} and response to selection. Because of the limitation of REML, Gibbs Sampling could be an alternative technique to estimate the variance component of the associative effect. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the estimation accuracy of the variance component of associative effect by using simulation via Gibbs Sampling. The simulated data comprised five generations of pigs. The <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> of each generation were selected randomly. In the simulation, variations were introduced for the methods of assigning pens (random, mixed sib and full sib), the number of pigs per pen (5 or 10), the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> per generation (162 or 324) and the correlation between genetic direct effect and genetic associative effect (- 0. 5, 0. 1 or + 0. 5). Each set of simulation was run for 30 replications. Results Random assignment or mixed sib assignment resulted in bias of estimated variance components in only 3 of 24 combinations. Furthermore, these 3 cases occurred with 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> With full sib assignment, 9 out of 12 groups of estimates significantly deviated from the true parameter value. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with the full sib assignment were higher than with the other two methods of pen assignment in most of the cases. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with datasets with 324 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> were notably smaller than the datasets from 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> Within each method of pen assignment, the relative bias of the associative effect was significantly smaller with group size 10 than with group size 5. Conclusion Full sib assignment caused difficulties to estimate variance components in most of the cases, due to a lack of identifiability. With random and mixed assignment, most data structures yielded unbiased results but increasing the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> or group size improves the estimation. Thus to get identifiable and unbiased estimates of the genetic associative effect, it is recommended to avoid close genetic relationship between animals within one pen and to use sufficient numbers of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> and sufficient group sizes. </p...|$|R
