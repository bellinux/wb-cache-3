40|$|Mechanization {{has enabled}} many crops to be grown {{on a large}} scale due to the {{development}} and utilization of <b>mechanical</b> crop <b>cultivation,</b> harvesting, and processing technology. However, the development and utilization of specialty crops is commonly obstructed by the lack of harvesting technology available to mechanically harvest the crop. Post-harvest processing of harvested material also poses a challenge for the development of many crops. One such specialty crop that remains under-utilized {{due to the lack of}} mechanical harvesting and processing systems is Physalis alkekengi, or Chinese lantern. Chinese lantern, a herbaceous perennial plant growing to heights of 30 - 110 cm, produces white flowers that result in a papery, inflated sepal that surrounds and encapsulates a berry. This arrangement, consisting of a sepal and berry, known as a lantern, has been identified as an excellent source of carotenoids. These carotenoids exist at a high concentration within the sepal, but not within the berry. A large volume of crop is required in order to realize the opportunities within these carotenoids. In order to be grown as a source of carotenoids, Chinese lantern must be grown over large productions acres with the lanterns harvested and processed mechanically. This research focused on the development and testing of two systems: a mechanized harvesting system capable of detaching the lanterns from the plant stem and conveying them to a collection container, and a post-harvest processing system capable of separating the sepals from the berry. While several harvesting systems were developed, all were based on the same fundamental stripping method. Results from harvesting systems tests have shown that Chinese lantern can be harvested successfully by utilizing stripping elements and a header specifically designed for the crop. Two separation systems were developed and tested as part of this research work. The results from this testing indicate that the sepals can be separated from the berry at a high efficiency through utilization of a differential drying and abrasion process...|$|R

Discovery of phylloxera in Oregon vineyards has led to replacement plantings of grapevines grafted onto phylloxera resistant rootstocks.

The focus {{of this study was}} to determine if <b>mechanical</b> weed management (<b>cultivation)</b> and/or soil factors help to explain observed within-field distributions of feral common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The ridges and furrows created by the ridge–tillage system adds additional microsites to existing spatial heterogeneity for soil characteristics such as soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Experimental areas were selected on the basis of naturally high or low SOC concentration. Cultivation resulted in 100 % mortality of H. annuus seedlings growing in the middle of furrows. Cultivation of pre-emergence herbicide treated and no-herbicide ridges resulted in small but statistically significant (α = 0. 05) reductions in seedling survival. No differences were detected in H. annuus canopy height, stem diameter, stem length, or vegetative biomass between high and low SOC environments. Neither total reproductive biomass (P = 0. 49) nor the biomass of flowers near physiological maturity (an estimate of fecundity; P = 0. 59) were affected by SOC environment. Late season H. annuus lodging was observed to reduce reproductive biomass. Juvenile plants that survived mechanical weed control efforts grew and produced reproductive biomass similarly across SOC environments. The lack of difference in vegetative and reproductive characteristics between high and low SOC environments suggests that SOC (or the edaphic conditions associated with greater or lesser SOC level) was not critical in contributing to the observed distribution of H. annuus from juvenile to flowering stages of growth within well-fertilized, irrigated agricultural habitats...|$|R

Native grass, forb, and shrub seed is needed to restore rangelands of the U. S. Intermountain West. Fernleaf biscuitroot [Lomatium dissectum (Nutt.)

Commercial seed production is necessary to provide {{the quantity and quality of}} seed needed for rangeland restoration and reclamation efforts. Fernleaf biscuitroot has been used for hundreds if not thousands of years in the western United States as a source of food and medicine. Knowledge about fernleaf biscuitroot is confined to ethnobotanical reports, evaluation of some of its chemical constituents, and its role in rangelands. Products derived from fernleaf biscuitroot are sourced from wild plant populations. Little is known about fernleaf biscuitroot cultivation or its seed production. Variations in spring rainfall and soil moisture result in highly unpredictable water stress at flowering, seed set, and seed development of fernleaf biscuitroot. Water stress is known to compromise seed yield and quality for other seed crops.

40|$|Disturbances {{associated}} with row-crop agricultural management systems include <b>mechanical</b> (tillage and <b>cultivation)</b> and chemical (fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides) inputs {{and are often}} co-occurring. Many soil microbes are sensitive to these disturbances, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), important plant mutualists in agricultural systems. AMF associate with many crop plants and provide direct benefits through root pathogen protection, drought resistance, nutrient acquisition and uptake, as well as contribute to ecosystem services by improving overall soil fertility. Examining how different row-crop management system disturbances affect the AMF community is important for understanding and enhancing benefits provided by these important mutualists, and key to developing sustainable agro-ecosystems. For this work I surveyed AMF community composition, structure, and AMF related functions in no-till, biologically-based/organic, early succession, and conventional management plots at the Kellogg Biological Station-Long Term Ecological Study Main Cropping System Experiment. I {{examined the effects of}} tillage and chemical inputs on AMF through an intensive sampling from 2010 to 2012. I also examined the historical effects of these different row crop agricultural management systems on AMF community and function by surveying archived soil samples taken annually following establishment of this site in 1989. Finally, I examined effects of the different management systems on the functioning of whole soil microbial communities in a controlled greenhouse experiment. Overall, I found that AMF communities respond differently to tillage and chemical input disturbances {{associated with}} management. Although long term trends indicate a reduction in both AMF richness and diversity for all row crop management systems, short term richness and diversity were higher in conventional, organic, and reduced input plots, as compared to the no-till and early succession systems. I found AMF community structure to be differently affected by tillage and chemical inputs. For example, AMF community composition and structure was most similar between the conventional and no-till row crop systems, and the reduced input and organic systems, when controlling for year/crop effects, indicating an effect of chemical input on the AMF community. I found measures of AMF function, specifically plant root colonization, to be robust to management system inputs. Under row-crop management, ecosystem services linked to soil carbon sequestration and water-stable aggregate formation and provided by AMF derived soil glomalin, were lower in conventional compared to the organic systems. All active agricultural systems had lower levels of soil glomalin as compared to old fields (agricultural abandonment). My results suggest AMF community composition, structure, and function are altered by these different row crop agricultural management systems, and ecosystem services currently provided by AMF are limited by both historical (+ 100 years) and continued management input disturbances. Following total abandonment of agricultural management, there is some restoration of AMF community structure and function and increased AMF contribution to ecosystem services, but these improvements in function are likely not similar to the functioning of the original soil microbial community...|$|R
