5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are visible through the shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the <b>mark</b> <b>is</b> not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E

5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with <b>Mark</b> <b>Is</b> and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
