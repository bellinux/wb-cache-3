5|$|By the 16th century, when Japanese and European {{cultures}} met, fortification in Europe had <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> castles and {{relied on}} innovations {{such as the}} Italian trace italienne and star forts. Forts in India present a similar case; when they were encountered by the British in the 17thcentury, castles in Europe had generally fallen out of use militarily. Like shiro, the Indian forts, durga or durg in Sanskrit, shared features with castles in Europe such as acting as a domicile for a lord {{as well as being}} fortifications. They too developed differently from the structures known as castles that had their origins in Europe.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> vocal prayer to Christian meditation. These progressions {{resulted}} in two distinct and different meditative practices: Lectio Divina in the West and hesychasm in the East. Hesychasm involves {{the repetition of}} the Jesus Prayer, but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.|$|E

5|$|Formed by Sumner and Hook {{after the}} two {{attended}} a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division soon <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them {{one of the pioneers}} of the late-1970s post-punk movement. The band's self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed the group to his independent label Factory Records. Joy Division's debut album Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979 to critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> the model stage.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{astrophysicist}} Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis {{travel to}} an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting {{the laws of}} physics around them. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane has <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Jane, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Jane, but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.|$|E

5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was already}} {{obsolete}} {{by the time}} it had been completed, as European military design had <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> curved bastions, embracing the angular designs seen in the later star forts. Nonetheless, it remained operational as an artillery fort {{for the rest of the}} century, with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under the command of Chute, rising to 28 men and the captain after 1542. Although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns from the very start, the castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from the land. It had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 sheaves of arrows in 1568, for example, probably for use by the local militia in the event of a war. Polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers, again probably for use by the militia.|$|E
5|$|After this, the 2/14th was {{committed}} to the advance into the Markham Valley and Finisterre Range, {{in the vanguard of}} the 21st Brigade's advance from Kaiapit to Dumpu in late September and early October. Moving through the 2/16th Battalion's position and advancing on to Marawasa, the 2/14th left the Markham Valley and proceeded into the Ramu Valley. The 2/14th then moved on the 2/16th's right flank, protecting it from any Japanese attacks that might have eventuated from the north. On 4 October 1943, the battalion reached Wampun village. It was there that the battalion's commanding officer, Honner, was seriously wounded when he <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> the main defensive position in order to personally carry out a reconnaissance of the surrounding area. A platoon was sent in to extricate Honner as the Japanese began advancing on his position, and after directing a company-level attack against the Japanese, Honner handed over command to Captain Ian Hamilton, commander of 'C' Company, who served as acting commander briefly until Major Mert Lee arrived from brigade headquarters. Lee remained in acting command until the battalion second-in-command, Major Philip Rhoden, returned from a staff course to officially take over command of the battalion as a lieutenant colonel in December.|$|E

5|$|DC often still draws {{criticism}} {{for its use}} of stereotypes for LGBT characters. Firebrand, a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought {{by some to be}} an early example, with his pink or transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter– Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights {{to help him}} fight the pagan Baltic Prussian people, {{who lived in a}} {{territory}} adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the Old Prussians themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including Northern Crusades sponsored by the papacy. The Teutonic Order soon overstepped their authority and <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> the area granted them by Konrad (Chełmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and Lithuania, then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has <b>moved</b> <b>beyond</b> Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E

Some English fleets began to reach the western North Atlantic Ocean by 1480 and found fish so plentiful that the British port of Bristol prospered immensely from the trade.|$|E
