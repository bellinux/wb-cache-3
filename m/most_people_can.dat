25|$|Acetic acid is a two-carbon {{organic acid}} {{produced}} in wine {{during or after}} the fermentation period. It is the most volatile of the primary acids associated with wine and {{is responsible for the}} sour taste of vinegar. During fermentation, activity by yeast cells naturally produces a small amount of acetic acid. If the wine is exposed to oxygen, Acetobacter bacteria will convert the ethanol into acetic acid. This process is known as the “acetification” of wine and is the primary process behind wine degradation into vinegar. An excessive amount of acetic acid is also considered a wine fault. A taster's sensitivity to acetic acid will vary, but <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> detect excessive amounts at around 600mg/l.|$|E
25|$|Most vegan diets contain {{little or}} no vitamin D without {{fortified}} food. People with little sun exposure may need supplements. The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn. According to the National Institutes of Health, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, {{at least twice a}} week. Tanning beds emitting 2–6% UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable.|$|E
25|$|Methane is nontoxic, {{yet it is}} {{extremely}} flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen, and some halogen-containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant {{is much higher than}} the 5–15% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's first {{performance}} of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was on The MDNA Tour (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock {{to experiment with}} the concept of [...] "girl gone wild", {{and come up with a}} routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment {{with the concept of}} Catholic church, along with monks and gargoyles. Her message behind it was that of freedom, [...] "people getting to do whatever they wanted to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at bone breaking dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could [...] "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. What they can do with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> do in front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." [...] The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.|$|E

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again.

2500|$|Guidelines on {{frequency}} of screening vary—typically {{every three to}} five years for those who have not had previous abnormal smears. [...] Some older recommendations suggested screening as frequently as every one to two years, however there is little evidence to support such frequent screening; annual screening has little benefit but leads to greatly increased cost and many unnecessary procedures and treatments. [...] It has been acknowledged since before 1980 that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be screened less often. [...] In some guidelines, frequency depends on age; for instance in Great Britain, screening is recommended every 3 years for women under 50, and every 5 years for those over.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the chronic otitis externa, acute otitis externa (AOE) is predominantly a bacterial infection, occurs suddenly, rapidly worsens, and becomes painful. [...] The ear canal has an abundant nerve supply, so the pain is often severe enough to interfere with sleep. [...] Wax in the ear can combine with the swelling of the canal skin and the associated pus to block the canal and dampen hearing, creating a temporary conductive hearing loss. In more severe or untreated cases, the infection can spread to the soft tissues of the face that surround the adjacent parotid gland and the jaw joint, making chewing painful. In its mildest forms, otitis externa is so common that some {{ear nose and throat}} physicians have suggested that most people will have at least a brief episode at some point in life. While a small percentage of people seem to have an innate tendency toward chronic otitis externa, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> avoid otitis externa altogether once they understand the intricate mechanisms of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Miletski {{believes}} that [...] "Animals {{are capable of}} sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way." [...] It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with ("hump") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes {{that as far as}} cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively. Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and [...] "seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human." [...] Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.|$|E

2500|$|Antelope Island State Park is {{surrounded}} by the Great Salt Lake. The lake is the last remaining part of a vast inland Pleistocene sea, Lake Bonneville. At more than 1,000 feet (305m) deep and more than [...] in area, the lake was nearly as large as Lake Michigan and significantly deeper. With the change in climate, the lake began drying up, leaving Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake as remnants. As Lake Bonneville receded it left behind the [...] Great Basin, which is made of narrow mountain ranges and broad valleys, known locally as basins. The Great Salt Lake is endorheic and has very high salinity, far saltier than sea water. The Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers deposit around 1.1 million tons of minerals in the lake each year. Due to its high salt concentration, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> easily float in the lake {{as a result of}} the higher density of the water.

2500|$|According to {{the free}} market view, a secure system of private {{property}} rights {{is an essential part}} of economic freedom. [...] Such systems include two main rights: the right to control and benefit from property and the right to transfer property by voluntary means. These rights offer people the possibility of autonomy and self-determination according to their personal values and goals. Economist Milton Friedman sees property rights as [...] "the most basic of human rights and an essential foundation for other human rights." [...] With property rights protected, people are free to choose the use of their property, earn on it, and transfer it to anyone else, as long as they do it on a voluntary basis and do not resort to force, fraud or theft. In such conditions <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> achieve much greater personal freedom and development than under a regime of government coercion. A secure system of property rights also reduces uncertainty and encourages investments, creating favorable conditions for an economy to be successful. Empirical evidence suggests that countries with strong property rights systems have economic growth rates almost twice as high as those of countries with weak property rights systems, and that a market system with significant private property rights is an essential condition for democracy. According to Hernando de Soto, much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized property rights. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth. One thinker to question private property was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a socialist and anarchist, who argued that property is both theft and freedom.|$|E
