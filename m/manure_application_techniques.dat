40|$|A {{recent study}} has raised {{doubts about the}} ammonia {{emission}} reduction achieved in the Netherlands when applying manure to grassland by means of low-emission techniques such as narrow band and shallow injection. The critics claim that percentages of ammonia released to the atmosphere associated with low-emission techniques might even overlap with that from surface broadcast spreading given the large alleged experimental uncertainties in measurements. Consequently, the rationale behind the regulations to which farmers are exposed is questioned. In this study, it is shown that the alleged large uncertainties were obtained {{by means of an}} erroneous statistical method and that the real uncertainties are much smaller. It is also shown that, even when there is a large uncertainty in individual measurements, previous conclusions about differences in emission between different <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> are still valid. It is further argued in this study that uncertainty in the percentage of applied ammonia emitted is implicitly taken into account in any comparative statistical analysis conducted in the past. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{water quality}} {{pollution}} control comes from locating critical nonpoint source pollution areas within a watershed and applying site-specific conservation practices. However, management decisions are implemented at the farm-level. While site-specific conservation practices are crucial for environmental protection, reduction strategies must have economic {{benefit to the}} producer {{if they are to}} be implemented and maintained. Increased fuel, fertilizer, and grain prices are greatly impacting farmer profits in small (< 100 ha) northeastern U. S. farms, which have historically imported sizable quantities of nutrients (feed and fertilizer) and corn grain and use proportionally high levels of fuel due to noncontiguous fields and hilly topography. Economic and environmental impacts of conservation practices suitable to the small farms of the northeastern United States were evaluated using field-level experiments, a process-based farm model, and watershed-based tools. The goal was to determine sets of practices acceptable to farmers in the region that minimized nutrient imports and treated or controlled excess nutrients while maintaining or increasing long-term farm profits.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{and other}} regions {{with a high}} density of farm animals, it is {{important}} to reduce ammonia emission, which causes undesirable deposition of nitrogen in ecosystems with a low nitrogen demand and is also involved in environmental acidification. On a dairy farm, the main sources of ammonia emission are the cow house, the grazed pasture and <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> in the field. In this paper, we present a model approach for each of these sources. On the basis of data collected from commercial herds, we also discuss some effects of management on ammonia emission. To validate the cow-house model, we used data from an experiment with several diets that influenced ammonia emission from a cow house. When used under experimental farm conditions {{for a wide range of}} diets and indoor climate conditions, this model accurately predicted NH 3 emissions from a dairy cow house. Important roles in the options for reducing ammonia emission (whether per cow, per hectare, or per herd) are played by the intensity of farming (i. e. cows per hectare), <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>technique,</b> fertiliser rate, feeding management and grazing management.

40|$|With {{progressing}} {{reduction of}} the emissions of other air pollutants, control of ammonia emissions, particularly from agricultural sources, moves into the center stage of air pollution control in Europe. Over the recent years, more countries have implemented practical emission control measures, so that practical experience with such measures has substantially grown compared to a decade ago. This report describes how the new information on potentials and costs for the reduction of ammonia emissions that has been presented by national experts at a recent workshop has been incorporated into the GAINS (Greenhouse gas - Air pollution Interactions and Synergies) model developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). The former GAINS methodology has been modified to align better with the new focus of the UNECE Task Force on Reactive Nitrogen on large installations and to avoid calling for emission reductions on small (hobby) farms. As such a distinction will exclude measures with excessive costs (at small farms), the new cost estimates that address large farms only are lower than earlier calculations that applied to all sources. A comparison of unit cost estimates (costs per amount of ammonia reduced) reveals significant variations across countries, explained by local circumstances that have impacts on costs. Still, the most important patterns remain constant between countries. Animal feeding with low nitrogen diets and <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> that minimize ammonia release are most cost effective, along with efficient application and/or substitution of urea fertilizer. Finally, the report provides also updates to the cost method used to estimate ammonia control costs in GAINS...|$|E
40|$|Manure {{application}} to grassland and arable land {{is an important}} source of ammonia and nitrous oxide losses. For both gasses, national and international policies have been developed with the objective of reducing the emissions. Since the early 1990 s, measurements have been carried out in The Netherlands to assess the gaseous losses from manure application, especially for ammonia. Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions are relatively scarce. This paper presents the results of these measurements with the objective of providing an updated quantification of the effect of techniques for application and incorporation of manure, and to assess influencing factors. The <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> differ in their spreading or placement of the manure onto the grass or soil surface or into the soil. The following techniques are treated in this paper: surface spreading, narrow-band application, shallow injection with open slots on grassland, and surface spreading, surface incorporation, deep placement on arable land. Low emission techniques such as narrow band application, shallow injection, incorporation or injection on arable land show a significant reduction of ammonia emission compared to surface spreading. On grassland, average emission factors (% of total ammonium nitrogen) were 74 % for surface spreading and 16 % for shallow injection. On arable land, the emission factors were 69 % for surface spreading and 2 % for deep placement. However, the nitrous oxide emission factor from manure applied with low ammonia emissions techniques is higher than the emission factor for surface applied manures. In a whole farm context, the higher nitrous oxide emission with shallow injection is partly offset directly by reduced emissions from fertiliser savings and indirectly from lower ammonia losses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a 5 -year field experiment, a {{comparison}} was {{made between the}} <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> practices of two adjacent dairy farms {{in the north of}} the Netherlands. Grassland management systems at Drogeham and Harkema contrasted in <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>technique</b> (surface <b>application</b> versus shallow injection, respectively), quality of applied manure (slurry + MX: slurry with Euromestmix® clay mineral additive versus regular slurry), and some relevant site characteristics (high versus low soil organic matter content and soil moisture supply). Effects of <b>manure</b> types and <b>application</b> <b>techniques,</b> and treatment of the soil with a micro-organism supplement, were tested in a factorial experiment at the two sites, two blocks per site, one with and one without additional application of 157 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 inorganic fertilizer. Apparent N recovery was higher after shallow injection than after surface application. For plots receiving no additional inorganic fertilizer, this difference was largest for slurry + MX applied at site Harkema, since this slurry-site combination resulted in the highest observed average apparent N recovery following shallow injection (47 %) and the lowest N recovery following surface application (20 %). For plots receiving additional inorganic fertilizer N the contrasts between treatments were less pronounced. Year effects on N uptake and dry matter production could be related to cumulative temperature and precipitation surplus over the growing season. A simple comparison between the grassland management systems was carried out based on the response curves derived from the experiment. This demonstrated that the grassland system where slurry was applied by shallow injection is not necessarily the lowest in actual amount of N not accounted for (i. e., potentially lost). The efficiency of the Harkema system strongly depended on high N recovery, but showed high potential losses in some years and a high herbage crude protein content in other years, due to the low DM production capacity. On the other hand, the Drogeham system was tuned to high DM production and was characterized by higher system stability, as reflected by more stable relationships between DM production and N not accounted for and herbage crude protein content. These differences between the systems were probably to a large extent caused by differences in water balance and soil organic matter content...|$|R

An incubation study was carried out to assess the effects of type of mineral N fertilizer and <b>manure,</b> <b>application</b> <b>technique</b> and <b>application</b> rate on N 2 O emission from a sandy soil with low organic matter content. Fluxes of N 2 O were measured 30 times over a 98 -day period. The total N 2 O emission from mineral N fertilizer ranged from 2. 1 to 4. 0 % of the N applied. High emissions were associated with manures with high contents of inorganic N, easily mineralizable N and easily mineralizable C, such as liquid pig manure (7. 3 - 13. 9 % of the N applied). The emission from cattle slurries ranged from 1. 8 to 3. 0 % and that of poultry manures from 0. 5 to 1. 9 %. The total N 2 O emission during the experimental period tended to increase linearly with increasing N application rate of NH 4 NO 3 and liquid pig manure. The N 2 O emission from surface-applied NH 4 NO 3 was significantly smaller than that following the incorporation of NH 4 NO 3 in the soil. The N 2 O emission from pig manure placed in a row at 5 cm depth was significantly higher than from surface-application and other techniques in which manure was incorporated in the soil.

40|$|Government {{targets for}} ammonia {{emission}} and for N and P loss per hectare (ha) of agricultural land {{were used to}} assess carrying capacity for poultry production in The Netherlands with data from 1990. In addition, the effect of alternative management strategies on carrying capacity was determined. Ammonia emission from poultry production in 1990 [20. 5 gigagrams (Gg) N] exceeded the target for 2000 (i. e., 6. 9 Gg N). Targets defined for 2000 and 2010 (i. e., 4. 6 Gg N) can be achieved, however, without reducing poultry numbers, assuming national introduction of measurements studied. Measures that reduced ammonia emission directly, i. e., introduction of low-emission housing or <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques,</b> were most effective. In 1990, N and P losses equalled 215 kg/ha for N and 31 kg/ha for P. The N loss was slightly lower than the target for 2000 (219 kg N/ha) but exceeded the target for 2010 (144 kg N/ha). Reduction of application of artificial N fertilizer, however, reduced N loss effectively from 215 to 22 kg/ha. National P loss in 1990 exceeded the target for 2000 (15. 3 kg P/ha). Reduction of application of artificial P fertilizer reduced P loss most effectively from 31 to 14 kg/ha. To achieve the target for 2010 (8. 7 kg P/ha), additional reduction in P excretion by poultry is required. This reduction can be achieved by use of phytase in layer and br oiler feed and by use of a coarse Ca source in layer feed. Unlike pig production, carrying capacity for poultry production in The Netherlands is not limited by governmental targets for acidification, eutrophication, or drinking water contamination...|$|E

This thesis links papers reporting field measurements, modelling studies and reviews of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their abatement from agriculture, in particular from livestock production. The aims of the work were to: quantify GHG emissions from litter-based farmyard manures; evaluate means by which GHG emissions from agricultural production may be abated; assess synergies and conflicts between the abatement of other N pollutants on emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O); analyse two records of soil temperature from 1976 - 2010 from Wolverhampton (UK) and Vienna (Austria). Agricultural emissions of GHGs are not readily abated by ‘end of pipe’ technologies. Large decreases in agricultural GHG emissions may require changes in the production and consumption of food that could have unwelcome impacts on both consumers and producers. However, identifying and prioritizing both modes and locations of production, together with utilizing inputs, such as N fertilizer and livestock feeds, more efficiently can reduce GHG emissions while maintaining outputs. For example, GHG emissions from livestock production may be lessened by increasing the longevity of dairy cows, thereby decreasing the proportion of unproductive replacement animals in the dairy herd. Sourcing a larger proportion of calves from the dairy herd would decrease emissions of GHGs from beef production. The distance between the region of food production to that of consumption has relatively little impact on total GHG emissions per tonne of food product. Due to greater productivity or lesser energy inputs, importing some foods produced {{in other parts of the}} world may decrease GHG emissions per tonne compared with UK production, despite the additional emissions arising from long-distance transport. <b>Manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> to abate ammonia (NH 3) emissions do not axiomatically increase emissions of N 2 O and may decrease them.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the major}} source of ammonia (NH 3). Methodologies are needed to {{quantify}} national NH 3 emissions and to identify the most effective options to mitigate NH 3 emissions. Generally, NH 3 emissions from agriculture are quantified using a nitrogen (N) flow approach, in which the NH 3 emission is calculated from the N flows and NH 3 emission factors. Because of the direct dependency between NH 3 volatilization and Total Ammoniacal N (TAN; ammonium–N + N compounds readily broken down to ammonium) an approach based on TAN is preferred to calculate NH 3 emission instead of an approach based on total N. A TAN-based NH 3 -inventory model was developed, called NEMA (National Emission Model for Ammonia). The total N excretion and the fraction of TAN in the excreted N are calculated from the feed composition and N digestibility of the components. TAN-based emission factors were derived or updated for housing systems, manure storage outside housing, <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques,</b> N fertilizer types, and grazing. The NEMA results show that the total NH 3 emission from agriculture in the Netherlands in 2009 was 88. 8 Gg NH 3 –N, of which 50 % from housing, 37 % from manure application, 9 % from mineral N fertilizer, 3 % from outside manure storage, and 1 % from grazing. Cattle farming was the dominant source of NH 3 in the Netherlands (about 50 % of the total NH 3 emission). The NH 3 emission expressed as percentage of the excreted N was 22 % of the excreted N for poultry, 20 % for pigs, 15 % for cattle, and 12 % for other livestock, which is mainly related to differences in emissions from housing systems. The calculated ammonia emission was most sensitive to changes in the fraction of TAN in the excreted manure and to the emission factor of manure application. From 2011, NEMA will be used as official methodology to calculate the national NH 3 emission from agriculture in the Netherland...|$|E

Two major potential sources of pollution from beef feedlots is storm runoff and solid waste (manure). The objectives of this research were to determine the characteristics of storm runoff from a beef feedlot, to determine the nitrogen transformations and ammonia volatilization from soils receiving large <b>manure</b> <b>applications,</b> to determine the chemical quality of surface runoff and groundwater from plots receiving large <b>manure</b> <b>applications,</b> to evaluate <b>techniques</b> of deep plowing large amounts of manure into the soil, and to determine the crop quality and yields on field plots receiving large <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates. Feedlot runoff was found to carry large amounts of chemical elements. The concentrations of chemical elements did not vary with size and intensity of rainstorm as much as by differences in topography of the watersheds. More ammonia was volatilized from limed soil columns than unlimed but an unexplained decrease in total nitrogen of 10 to 20 percent occurred in the unlimed and limed soil columns, respectively. A 30 -in. moldboard plowing 30 to 36 -in. deep can safely turn under up to 900 tons/acre of manure and not create a major surface water pollution problem. An increase of chemical elements in the groundwater occurred during the first year and then were reduced to initial values during the second year. No N 03 pollution of groundwater occurred.

40|$|This review {{analyzes}} published data on {{manure management}} practices used to mitigate methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from animal operations. Reducing excreted nitrogen (N) and degradable organic carbon (C) by diet manipulation {{to improve the}} balance of nutrient inputs with production is an effective practice to reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emissions. Most CH 4 is produced during manure storage; therefore, reducing storage time, lowering manure temperature by storing it outside during colder seasons, and capturing and combusting the CH 4 produced during storage are effective practices to reduce CH 4 emission. Anaerobic digestion with combustion of the gas produced is effective in reducing CH 4 emission and organic C content of manure; this increases readily available C and N for microbial processes creating little CH 4 and increased N 2 O emissions following land application. Nitrous oxide emission occurs following land application as a byproduct of nitrification and dentrification processes in the soil, but these processes may also occur in compost, biofilter materials, and permeable storage covers. These microbial processes depend on temperature, moisture content, availability of easily degradable organic C, and oxidation status of the environment, which make N 2 O emissions and mitigation results highly variable. Managing the fate of ammoniacal N {{is essential to the}} success of N 2 O and CH 4 mitigation because ammonia is an important component in the cycling of N through manure, soil, crops, and animal feeds. <b>Manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> such as subsurface injection reduce ammonia and CH 4 emissions but can result in increased N 2 O emissions. Injection works well when combined with anaerobic digestion and solids separation by improving infiltration. Additives such as urease and nitrification inhibitors that inhibit microbial processes have mixed results but are generally effective in controlling N 2 O emission from intensive grazing systems. Matching plant nutrient requirements with manure fertilization, managing grazing intensity, and using cover crops are effective practices to increase plant N uptake and reduce N 2 O emissions. Due to system interactions, mitigation practices that reduce emissions in one stage of the manure management process may increase emissions elsewhere, so mitigation practices must be evaluated at the whole farm level...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we compare}} the {{relative}} importance of climate change to technological, management, price and policy changes on European arable farming systems. This required linking four models: the SIMPLACE crop growth modelling framework to calculate future yields under climate change for arable crops; the CAPRI model to estimate impacts on global agricultural markets, specifically product prices; the bio-economic farm model FSSIM to calculate the future changes in cropping patterns and farm net income at the farm and regional level; and the environmental model INTEGRATOR to calculate nitrogen (N) uptake and losses to air and water. First, the four linked models were applied to analyse the effect of climate change only or a most likely baseline (i. e. B 1) scenario for 2050 as well as for two alternative scenarios with, respectively, strong (i. e. A 1 -b 1) and weak economic growth (B 2) for five regions/countries across Europe (i. e. Denmark, Flevoland, Midi Pyrenées, Zachodniopomorski and Andalucia). These analyses were repeated but assuming in addition to climate change impacts, also the effects of changes in technology and management on crop yields, the effects of changes in prices and policies in 2050, and the effects of all factors together. The outcomes show that the effects of climate change to 2050 result in higher farm net incomes in the Northern and Northern-Central EU regions, in practically unchanged farm net incomes in the Central and Central-Southern EU regions, and in much lower farm net incomes in Southern EU regions compared to those in the base year. Climate change in combination with improved technology and farm management and/or with price changes towards 2050 results in a higher to much higher farm net incomes. Increases in farm net income for the B 1 and A 1 -b 1 scenarios are moderately stronger than those for the B 2 scenario, due to the smaller increases in product prices and/or yields for the B 2 scenario. Farm labour demand slightly to moderately increases towards 2050 as related to changes in cropping patterns. Changes in N 2 O emissions and N leaching compared to the base year are mainly caused by changes in total N inputs from the applied fertilizers and animal manure, which in turn are influenced by changes in crop yields and cropping patterns, whereas NH 3 emissions are mainly determined by assumed improvements in <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> <b>techniques.</b> N emissions and N leaching strongly increase in Denmark and Zachodniopomorski, slightly decrease to moderately increase in Flevoland and Midi-Pyrenées, and strongly decrease in Andalucia, except for NH 3 emissions which zero to moderately decrease in Flevoland and Denmark...|$|E

30|$|Increased {{dry matter}} accumulations on plots {{subjected}} to higher cattle <b>manure</b> <b>applications</b> {{was followed by}} higher uptake of N from the applied fertilizers (Table  7).

With improved accumulations of dry matter and N uptake in plots subjected to higher <b>manure</b> <b>applications,</b> the applied N in manure was effectively sequestered from the wetland soil where it may be subjected to loss through emissions of N 2 O.

40|$|Field data on ammonia {{emission}} after liquid cattle <b>manure</b> (‘slurry’) <b>application</b> to grassland were statistically analysed {{to reveal the}} effect of manure and field characteristics and of weather conditions in eight consecutive periods after <b>manure</b> <b>application.</b> Logistic regression models, modelling the emission expressed {{as a percentage of}} the ammonia still present at the start of each period as the response variable, were developed separately for broadcast spreading, narrow band application (trailing shoe) and shallow injection. Wind speed, temperature, soil type, total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) content and dry matter content of the <b>manure,</b> <b>application</b> rate and grass height were selected as significant explanatory variables. Their effects differed for each application method and among periods. Temperature and wind speed were generally the most important drivers for emission. The fitted regression models were used to reveal seasonal trends in NH 3 emission employing historical meteorological data for the years 1991 – 2014. The overall average emission was higher in early and midsummer than in early spring and late summer. This seasonal trend was most pronounced for broadcast spreading followed by narrow band application, and was almost absent for shallow injection. However, due to the large variation in weather conditions, emission on a particular day in early spring can be higher than on a particular day in summer. The analysis further revealed that, in a specific scenario and depending on the <b>application</b> <b>technique,</b> emission could be reduced with 20 – 30 % by restricting <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> to favourable days, i. e. with weather conditions with minimal emission levels...|$|R

40|$|Manure {{has been}} used {{effectively}} to improve crop production and soil properties because it contains nutrients and organic matter. While it is generally accepted that the improved soil properties associated with <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> lead to changes in runoff and soil erosion, few studies have quantified these impacts. Water quality models used to assess watershed management and estimate total maximum daily load must accurately predict loading rates from fields where manure has been applied.

40|$|More {{intensive}} {{production of}} hogs and cattle in Quebec {{during the past}} decade has benefited local economies, but led to over-fertilization of agricultural soils and eutrophication of waterways. Provincial ministries responded to this issue by developing regulations to control <b>manure</b> <b>applications.</b> The objective of this thesis was to determine the environmental risk associated with applying farm manure in the late fall. Spreading manure in fall after harvesting corn was a common practice for many agricultural producers in Quebec, but this period is now viewed as very risky, having more negative environmental consequences than other <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> periods. This two-year study used common diagnostic tools to compare the fertilization efficiency of solid dairy farm manure (DFM) spread in early fall, late fall and spring on a heavy clay soil used for corn production. In the first year, when DFM was the only nutrient source, {{there was no difference in}} corn yield that could be attributed to the <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> period. In the second year, each DFM plot was split and six levels of inorganic fertilizer (from 55 to 240 kg N ha- 1) were applied ("Strip Split Plot") after planting. Corn tissue analysis (chlorophyll content, leaf N content at silking, cornstalk NO 3 concentration) indicated that more residual N was supplied from late fall <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> than other <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> periods. Monitoring of soil NO 3 -N concentrations indicated that most of the NO 3 -N migration through the soil profile occurred after the early fall <b>manure</b> <b>application.</b> Late fall <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> appears to be the most efficient at supplying N for corn production, without deleterious environmental impacts, when DFM is applied to a heavy clay soil...|$|R
40|$|Alternative <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates {{represent}} {{an integral part}} of current nutrient management efforts on animal feeding operations (AFOs). Previous studies have indicated that lower <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates tend to increase farm production costs. In this study, the Comprehensive Economic and Environmental Optimization Tool - Macro Modeling System (CEEOT-MMS) was used to evaluate the farm-level economic implications of alternative <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates for all AFOs in the 48 contiguous states of the U. S. Representative farms derived through statistical disaggregation of national databases and K-means clustering were simulated within the the Farm-level Economic Model (FEM) to determine the economic impacts of four <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates. The highest <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rate scenario investigated here (two times the N rate, or 2 N) resulted in the highest net farm returns to AFOs. Similarly, the lowest <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rate scenario considered in this study (the Half P rate), is projected to cost AFO operators the most, about $ 4, 300 relative to the standard N rate scenario. Results of the study show that the larger AFOs would be required to haul out a much greater portion of on-farm manure than the smallest AFOs. Furthermore, the largest AFOs incur the highest per farm and per animal unit costs when <b>manure</b> <b>application</b> rates are reduced to rates below the P rate. However, under the Half P scenario all farm size groups would be required to haul out significant portions of manure generated on the farm. The total annual cost of the Half P scenario tops $ 1 billion dollars for AFOs in the 48 contiguous states.

The need arose for more quantitative knowledge about NH 3 volatilization and for practical tools to reduce the NH 3 volatilization from manure. A database of field measurements was analysed to identify factors that effect the volatilization of NH 3 from manure applied by various techniques on grassland and arable land. The analyses showed that NH 3 volatilization is substantially reduced by <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> like narrow band application and shallow injection, and by effective manure incorporation techniques. Also the <b>manure</b> composition, the <b>application</b> rate and the weather conditions substantially influenced the NH 3 volatilization rate. Draught force required for different <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> on grassland varied considerably. The design of the shallow injection element, the working depth and soil circumstances had a substantial influence on the required draught force. For the trailing foot a lower draught force was required than for shallow injection. On arable land the time-lag between application and incorporation of the manure substantially affected the total NH 3 volatilization. The costs of <b>application</b> <b>techniques</b> designed to reduce NH 3 volatilization were assessed across a range of farm characteristics, and compared with the conventional technique of broadcast spreading.
