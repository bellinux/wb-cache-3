50|$|Less typical {{habitats}} {{include the}} dense temperate forests used by European black storks, or the rainforest habitat sought by Storm's stork in South East Asia. They generally avoid marine habitats, {{with the exception}} of the lesser adjutant, <b>milky</b> <b>stork</b> and <b>wood</b> <b>stork,</b> all of which forage in mangroves, lagoons and estuarine mudflats. A number of species have adapted to highly-modified human habitats, either for foraging or breeding. In the absence of persecution several species breed close to people, and species such as the marabou and white stork will feed at landfill sites.|$|R
