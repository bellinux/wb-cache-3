25|$|Later, however, Cuff {{realizes that}} in {{approaching}} and deactivating Hickey's device, he himself <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a full dose of radiation, damaging his own germ plasm. Hence he can never risk having children {{for fear of}} producing monsters, and that, as he will ultimately tell his son Peter, is why he chose to adopt.|$|E
25|$|While {{growing up}} Davis {{was known as}} Little Pops. His second home was the Phyllis Wheatley {{settlement}} house. Its director Gertrude Brown gave the area's children continuing education {{in a safe place}} to go after school. Davis <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> into trouble at some point as it was a juvenile parole officer who suggested he attend Phyllis Wheatley. There with his friends, Davis learned boxing, etiquette and Robert's Rules of Order. They met Chick Webb and danced to Duke Ellington and Count Basie who stayed there on tours to the Orpheum Theatre. In 1941, he graduated from North High School where he lettered in and won a city championship in boxing. Davis attended the University of Minnesota and later in life received an honorary doctorate in law from Macalester College.|$|E

6000|$|This seemed wholly absurd, but {{the worst}} {{bitterness}} I had yet experienced made itself felt when Haldane pulled up his team, and, pointing to a figure {{on the threshold of}} his homestead, said: [...] "Lucille <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>getting</b> impatient. She is watching for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because the big-wigs {{make sure}} some {{one out of}} the Bailey <b>must</b> <b>have</b> dropped them, <b>getting</b> into the town through the Cathedral at night' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They say Doctor Montgomery <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>getting</b> {{ready to}} leave," [...] said Phil, {{who had been}} to Rockville. [...] "He owes a board bill at the hotel {{as well as at}} his boarding-house. Mrs. Dunn is back, and is very angry to think the doctor got away during her absence." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{about one}} {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, at the school, Miner hitched the children's horse, [...] "Old Maude," [...] to their light sleigh and told Hazel to wait while {{he went back to}} the school's barn to get his horse. Hazel wasn't strong enough to keep the horse from heading out into the {{blizzard}} before her father came back from the barn. William Miner searched for his children, but soon realized they <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> lost and went home to organize a search party. Via telephone, farm families from the surrounding countryside summoned men to join the search for the missing Miner children.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2013 Academy Award broadcast, {{host and}} emcee Seth MacFarlane {{mentioned}} Jeremy {{in his opening}} monologue, [...] "From Whoopi {{all the way down}} to Ron Jeremy, it eventually found its way to me", joking about the number of rejections that Oscar organizers <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> from potential hosts before they arrived at him. Later in the April issue of AVN magazine in the Crossover Report section, with roughly 1 billion viewers worldwide, the writer observed that [...] "... the mere fact that his name made its way into one of MacFarlane's opening lines would suggest that he has officially reached household status on a global scale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{some things}} in my name from Mr. Dickley, and he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> those shoes from Mr. Wecks, too. If the party went there in person {{and said he was}} Dave Porter, I don't think it could have been any one but Ward Porton, because, so far as I know, he's the only fellow that resembles me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what will}} you do for meals? You <b>must</b> <b>have</b> time to <b>get</b> them?" [...] went on Richard, anxious lest his friend should be {{assuming}} too much.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He was a stranger; it says so. Good God!' said Lawford, 'how he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{wanted to}} <b>get</b> home! He killed himself, poor wretch, {{think of the}} fret and fever he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been in--just before. Imagine it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum! How much of England do {{you suppose}} you could see if you went there in the {{capacity}} of a teacher? A strange notion you <b>must</b> <b>have</b> of <b>getting</b> a clear and definite idea of a country! All you could see of Great Britain would be {{the interior of a}} school, or at most of one or two private dwellings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} see how they are making {{out in front of the}} boathouse!" [...] cried Randy. [...] "Some of the skaters <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. We haven't laid {{an eye on}} him, {{along the}} road. He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> into Fargo long before we did. Now {{tomorrow}} I think----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} come here {{after he left the}} old cabin," [...] said Snap. [...] "See, there is some food. He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> that last night, when he raided Spink's place." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Vitaly <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{begun to}} take {{pictures}} of the resting bear, but the tree trunks and branches were in the way, and he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> decided to <b>get</b> inside the grove. His footprints lead into the grove after the bear. He approached the bear at a distance of three meters", Rebrikov said.|$|R
6000|$|He sighed {{before he}} {{answered}} sadly: [...] "Ay, thou'lt take thy own road; it's born in thee. Then follow it steadfastly, and God bless thee. Some day I'll {{come back to}} Fairmead, but I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> time to <b>get</b> over this blow." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cole {{was awarded}} the CB {{for his work on}} the Great Exhibition and was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1875. Often {{referred}} to in the press as [...] "Old King" [...] Cole, he was known to have the closest personal backing of the Queen and especially of the Prince Consort, who when he needed a facilitator for one of his pet projects, was heard to remark: [...] "We <b>must</b> <b>have</b> steam, <b>get</b> Cole".|$|R
6000|$|... "Merrick <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> hold of that {{envelope}} at {{the time}} he stole the bonds," [...] said Dick. [...] "Maybe that is what made him trace up this story of the treasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That mustang {{belongs to}} me. I {{was trying to}} break him in when the call to arms came. He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> away from my boys. But {{what is he doing}} away out here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl's scalp tickled, but {{he tried}} to be very offhand in remarking: [...] "You <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> that dress in New York, didn't you? Why haven't you ever told me about New York? You've hardly told me {{anything}} at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'This {{will not}} do,' {{he said to}} himself. 'If I {{go on like this}} I shall become a crazy fool. This must stop! I promised the doctor I would not take tea. Faith, he was pretty right! My nerves <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>getting</b> into a queer state. Funny I did not notice it. I never felt better in my life. However, it is all right now, and I shall not be such a fool again.' ...|$|R
60|$|On hearing which Mrs. Andrews {{threw her}} arms round George's neck and burst into tears of happiness. She was not very strong, {{and the thought of}} the sacrifices these two boys <b>must</b> <b>have</b> made to <b>get</b> a house {{together}} for her completely overpowered her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now," [...] said Mr. Brooke, {{meeting and}} kissing her. [...] "You have left Casaubon with his books, I suppose. That's right. We <b>must</b> not <b>have</b> you <b>getting</b> too learned for a woman, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|The elder officer {{looked at}} the younger compassionately. [...] "You're all wrought up, Thompson," [...] he said. [...] "Go and take a good sleep. You have been on this job now {{for a long while}} and it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> on your nerves." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{some time}} during the battle they <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> their {{artillery}} into favorable position, for now, suddenly, the whole interior of our breastworks was swept with ball and grape-shot, more blood being shed within five minutes than had been spilled on our side in all the terrible work thus far.|$|E
6000|$|... "Two cars behind. And {{from the}} way the three talked they <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> on at Albany. The fellow Brassy had {{something}} to do with is tough enough, but the other two men seem to be much worse. By their talk, they are cattle men, and I shouldn't be surprised if they have been cowboys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, quite so," [...] he answered, in a {{very dry}} voice, not daring to {{contradict}} the man. He knew just what <b>had</b> happened. Guy <b>must</b> <b>have</b> come to <b>get</b> the money himself, and the cashier <b>must</b> <b>have</b> mistaken him for the proper owner of the purloined six thousand. They were so very much alike. Nobody ever distinguished them.|$|R
60|$|Phillips <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{seen her}} <b>getting</b> off the bus, for he came forward at once {{from the other}} side of the gate, his face radiant with boyish delight. A young man and woman, {{entering}} the park at the same time, looked at them and smiled sympathetically.|$|R
6000|$|He {{declined}} the offers of motors; he walked off, his arm about {{the shoulder of}} Nat Hicks the sporting tailor, with the elegant Harry Haydock carrying one of his enormous pale leather bags, Del Snafflin the other, Jack Elder bearing an overcoat, and Julius Flickerbaugh the fishing-tackle. Carol noted that though Bresnahan wore spats and a stick, no small boy jeered. She decided, [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> Will <b>get</b> a double-breasted blue coat and a wing collar and a dotted bow-tie like his." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Alicia came in, {{and with}} her a man whom I had never before seen. Yet I {{instantly}} bethought myself of a lean black snake, with a glittering and evil eye, which I had seen in Mrs. Montressor's garden two summers agone, and which was like to have bitten me. John, the gardener, had killed it, and I verily thought that if it had a soul, it <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> into this man.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{man is a}} criminal, {{and he did it}} {{to throw}} you off his track," [...] {{announced}} Sam. [...] "Do you know what I think?" [...] he continued to his brothers. [...] "I think Blackie Crowden <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> on {{to the fact that we}} were at Fernwood, and made up his mind to clear out as soon as possible. Then he got afraid that we might question folks, including this stage driver, and so jumped from the auto-stage to throw us off his trail, provided we should follow the stage." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ah--THERE {{was a point}} {{which he}} had been {{overlooking}} from the start: {{it had to be a}} service which he had rendered [...] "possibly without knowing the full value of it." [...] Why, really, that ought to be an easy hunt--much easier than those others. And sure enough, by-and-by he found it. Goodson, years and years ago, came near marrying a very sweet and pretty girl, named Nancy Hewitt, but in some way or other the match had been broken off; the girl died, Goodson remained a bachelor, and by-and-by became a soured one and a frank despiser of the human species. Soon after the girl's death the village found out, or thought it had found out, that she carried a spoonful of negro blood in her veins. Richards worked at these details a good while, and in the end he thought he remembered things concerning them which <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> mislaid in his memory through long neglect. He seemed to dimly remember that it was HE that found out about the negro blood; that it was he that told the village; that the village told Goodson where they got it; that he thus saved Goodson from marrying the tainted girl; that he had done him this great service [...] "without knowing the full value of it," [...] in fact without knowing that he WAS doing it; but that Goodson knew the value of it, and what a narrow escape he had had, and so went to his grave grateful to his benefactor and wishing he had a fortune to leave him. It was all clear and simple, now, and the more he went over it the more luminous and certain it grew; and at last, when he nestled to sleep, satisfied and happy, he remembered the whole thing just as if it had been yesterday. In fact, he dimly remembered Goodson's TELLING him his gratitude once. Meantime Mary had spent six thousand dollars on a new house for herself and a pair of slippers for her pastor, and then had fallen peacefully to rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have quite}} enough flesh on you," [...] Skinner said critically. [...] "If {{you have lost}} a stone you <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>getting</b> beastly fat. You fellows in the Guards do not take enough exercise. The time was when the Guards used to row and {{had a very good}} eight, but they never do that sort of thing now. It would do you all a lot of good if, instead of {{wandering}} between London and Windsor and Dublin, you were to take your turn for foreign service." ...|$|R
60|$|The Martians {{seem to have}} {{calculated}} their descent {{with amazing}} subtlety--their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours--and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet--it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war--but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>getting</b> ready.|$|R
60|$|I {{never saw}} any man so {{astonished}} in my life! He was utterly flabbergasted. Charles thought he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> expected to <b>get</b> clear away at once, and that this prompt action on our part had taken the fellow so much by surprise as to simply unman him. He gazed about {{him as if he}} hardly realised what was happening.|$|R
