5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline toll plaza was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane toll plaza was built for fast cashless toll collection in Demerje. The Demerje toll plaza is available via a <b>motorway</b> <b>fork</b> accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje toll plaza default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline toll plaza, between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system has raised the nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour. As of September 2010 northbound traffic leaving the A1 must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to be integrated into the tolled motorway network, as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Lučko toll plaza. That will require construction of a Horvati interchange south of the Lučko toll plaza.|$|E
50|$|The A3 {{belongs to}} the Swiss {{motorway}} network. It starts at the border in Basel, where it connects to French motorway A35. From the Wiese <b>Motorway</b> <b>Fork,</b> the route is shared with the A2.|$|E
50|$|At Augst, the {{motorway}} splits, {{with the}} A2 branching {{off and the}} A3 continuing past Rheinfelden and Frick. After the Bözberg tunnel is the Birrfeld <b>Motorway</b> <b>Fork,</b> near Birmenstorf. Here, the A1 and A3 share the same route as far as Motorway Interchange Limmattal, where the A3 goes towards Urdorf and the Uetliberg Tunnel which was opened on May 4, 2009. After Zurich the motorway weaves through the hills of the south-east bank of Lake Zurich. It continues along the Walensee (Walen Lake), and on to Mels where it ends at a junction with the A13.|$|E
