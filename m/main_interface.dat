The firewall has several updated features in this version. A Block Traffic button present in the <b>main</b> <b>interface</b> blocks all incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. Another new feature, the Visual Tracker, graphically maps attacks back to their origin. The firewall blocked all port scans conducted by CNET, stealthing each port.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the <b>main</b> <b>interface</b> between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E

25|$|Kaito was {{the only}} one sold using the Vocaloid 1.1 engine; the {{previous}} Vocaloids before him were sold as Vocaloid 1.0, which he was also supplied with. However, he needed the additional Vocaloid 1.1.2 patch to work on the Vocaloid 1.0 engine. A patch was later released to update all Vocaloid engines to Vocaloid 1.1.2, adding new features to the software, although there were differences between the output results of the engine. Even though Kaito and Meiko were Japanese and sung using Japanese phonetics, the <b>main</b> <b>interface</b> was in written using English for both English and Japanese Vocaloids.|$|E
25|$|Ivan Sutherland {{developed}} Sketchpad in 1963, {{widely held}} {{as the first}} graphical computer-aided design program. It used a light pen to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in realtime with coordinated graphics. In the late 1960s, researchers at the Stanford Research Institute, led by Douglas Engelbart, developed the On-Line System (NLS), which used text-based hyperlinks manipulated with a then new device: the mouse. In the 1970s, Engelbart's ideas were further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at Xerox PARC and specifically Alan Kay, who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used a GUI as the <b>main</b> <b>interface</b> for the Xerox Alto computer, released in 1973. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system.|$|E
