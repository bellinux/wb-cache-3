5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the <b>monkeys</b> {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the <b>monkeys</b> flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel <b>monkeys</b> include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often {{moves through the}} trees on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American squirrel <b>monkeys,</b> but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 <b>monkeys,</b> {{with a mean of}} 41 <b>monkeys.</b> Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs have {{traditionally}} been regarded as being less intelligent than anthropoid primates, with <b>monkeys</b> and apes often described as having more cunning, guile, and deceptiveness.
