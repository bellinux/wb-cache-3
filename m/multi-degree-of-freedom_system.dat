40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the inverse problem for Lagrangian {{dynamics}} for linear <b>multi-degree-of-freedom</b> <b>systems.</b> New results for linearly damped systems are obtained using extensions of results for single-degree-of-freedom systems. First, for a two-degree-of-freedom linear system with linear damping, the conditions {{for the existence of}} a Lagrangian are explicitly obtained by solving the Helmholtz conditions. Next, since the Helmholtz conditions are near-impossible to solve for general n-degree-of-freedom systems, a new simple procedure that does not require the use of the Helmholtz conditions and that is easily extended to n-degree-of-freedom linear systems, is developed. The emphasis is on obtaining the Lagrangians for these <b>multi-degree-of-freedom</b> <b>systems</b> in a simple manner, using insights obtained from our understanding of the inverse problem for single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems. Specifically we include systems that commonly arise in linear vibration theory with positive definite mass matrices, and symmetric stiffness and damping matrices. This method yields several new Lagrangians for linear <b>multi-degree-of-freedom</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally, conservation laws for these damped multi degree-of-freedom systems are found using the Lagrangians obtained.

In particular the new method is a parallel interfield procedure instead of a staggered one. The merits of the new method which can couple arbitrary Newmark schemes with diferent time steps in different subdomains and advance all the substructure states sinzultaneously, are analysed in terms of accuracy, stability and error propagation.

With application of the Galerkin method to the basic equation, the ordinary differential equation in a <b>multi-degree-of-freedom</b> <b>system</b> is reduced.

The resonance frequency in each mode of vibration decreases with the increment of the mass in the rotor. The amplitude of nonlinear response decreases with the increment of the cross section in the belt. The magnetic force acting on the belt changes the characteristics of nonlinear spring from the hardening type to the softening-hardening type.
