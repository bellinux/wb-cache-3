25|$|The D'Arsonval/Weston meter {{movement}} uses a <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> {{which carries}} a pointer and rotates on pivots or a taut band ligament. The coil rotates in a permanent magnetic field and is restrained by fine spiral springs which {{also serve to}} carry current into the <b>moving</b> <b>coil.</b> It gives proportional measurement rather than just detection, and deflection is independent of {{the orientation of the}} meter. Instead of balancing a bridge, values could be directly read off the instrument's scale, which made measurement quick and easy.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{extremely}} thin and light diaphragm membrane, often {{only a few}} micrometers thick, and the complete absence of moving metalwork, the frequency response of electrostatic headphones usually extends well above the audible limit of approximately 20kHz. The high frequency response means that the low midband distortion level is maintained {{to the top of}} the audible frequency band, which is generally not the case with <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> drivers. Also, the frequency response peakiness regularly seen in the high frequency region with <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> drivers is absent. Well-designed electrostatic headphones can produce significantly better sound quality than other types.|$|E

50|$|In principle, coilguns {{can also}} be {{constructed}} in which the <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> are fed with current via sliding contacts. However, the practical construction of such arrangements requires the provision of reliable high speed sliding contacts. Although feeding current to a multi-turn coil armature might not require currents as large as those required in a railgun, {{the elimination of the}} need for high speed sliding contacts is an obvious potential advantage of the induction coilgun relative to the railgun.|$|R
25|$|Other {{types of}} {{transducers}} include variable-reluctance (or moving-armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on {{the surfaces of}} gaps, and <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> (or electrodynamic) transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{regulator}} can be automated via a {{servo control}} mechanism {{to advance the}} movable coil position {{in order to provide}} voltage increase or decrease. A braking mechanism or high ratio gearing is used to hold the rotating coil in place against the powerful magnetic forces acting on the <b>moving</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E
25|$|The basic <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> meter is {{suitable}} only for direct current measurements, {{usually in the}} range of 10 microamperes to 100mA. It is easily adapted to read heavier currents by using shunts (resistances in parallel with the basic movement) or to read voltage using series resistances known as multipliers. To read alternating currents or voltages, a rectifier is needed. One of the earliest suitable rectifiers was the copper oxide rectifier developed and manufactured by Union Switch & Signal Company, Swissvale, Pennsylvania, later part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, from 1927.|$|E
40|$|Ab stract- Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT) is an imaging {{technique}} for passive electrical properties used in industrial and biological imaging. In {{the case of}} biological purposes, high resolution measures of the magnetic field induced {{in the body and}} the ability to acquire data at several points along its border are two major challenges of MIT. In a previous work we have developed a prototype that allows accurate placement of sensing and source coils, improving data quality and quantity for the tomographical image processing. Several alternatives for stability and resolution improvements have been presented. However, all of them had limitations in terms of stability and resolution for a <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> system.

50|$|Crystal earpieces {{are usually}} {{monaural}} devices with very low sound fidelity, but high sensitivity and impedance. Their peak use was probably with 1960s era transistor radios and hearing aids. They {{are not used}} with modern portable media players due to unacceptable sound quality. The main causes of poor performance with these earpieces are low diaphragm excursion, nonlinearity, in-band resonance and the very short horn shape of the earpiece casing. The resulting sound is very tinny and lacking in bass. Modern headphones use electromagnetic drivers that work similarly to speakers, with <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> or <b>moving</b> iron cores in a magnetic field.|$|R
25|$|Multimeters {{were invented}} {{in the early}} 1920s as radio {{receivers}} and other vacuum tube electronic devices became more common. The invention of the first multimeter is attributed to British Post Office engineer, Donald Macadie, who became dissatisfied {{with the need to}} carry many separate instruments required for maintenance of telecommunications circuits. Macadie invented an instrument which could measure amperes (amps), volts and ohms, so the multifunctional meter was then named Avometer. The meter comprised a <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> meter, voltage and precision resistors, and switches and sockets to select the range.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, when it {{was more}} common for {{electric}} recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era. Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, {{making it possible to}} improve the damping of spurious resonances. Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives. The dynamic or <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932. Both of these high quality microphones became widespread in motion picture, radio, recording, and public address applications.|$|E
25|$|The newly invented Western Electric <b>moving</b> <b>coil</b> or dynamic {{microphone}} {{was part of}} the Wide Range System. It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing. Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time. Additionally, the problem of inner groove distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction and optimisation {{of a new}} apparatus to produce Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of 87 Rb atoms. The main aim in building this system was to include a high resolution imaging system capable of resolving single atoms. Optical access for the imaging system was created by including a stage of atom transport in which the atoms are magnetically transferred ~ 50 cm from a magneto-optical trap (MOT), where they are initially collected, to a glass science cell where experiments are carried out and imaging takes place. Two magnetic transport schemes have been demonstrated, based on approaches first used in other laboratories. First, a scheme in which the atoms are transferred in a moving pair of magnetic trapping coils. Second, a hybrid scheme where the atoms are translated part of the distance in the <b>moving</b> <b>coils,</b> {{and the rest of}} the way by switching the current in a chain of fixed coils. This second scheme was designed to allow optical access for a high numerical aperture microscope objective to be placed immediately next to the science cell for high resolution imaging. The atoms were first collected in a large pyramid MOT which can be loaded with 3 × 10 ^ 9 atoms in a time of 20 s. Around half of these atoms – those in the |F = 1, mF = − 1 > magnetic substate – were then magnetically trapped prior to transport. The typical fraction of the trapped atoms transferred to the science cell was ~ 30 % and ~ 18 % for the <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> and hybrid schemes respectively. Evaporative cooling was carried out on the atom cloud following transport with the <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> and loading into a time-orbiting potential trap. The optimised cooling sequence lasted for 28 s and consistently produced a pure condensate with 5 × 10 ^ 5 atoms. A BEC has also been produced by evaporative cooling following hybrid transport. The next experimental steps will be to optimise the hybrid transfer approach further and install the high resolution imaging system. The system is well-placed to continue an ongoing series of experiments in which ultracold atoms are trapped in RF-dressed potentials. These potentials will be used to study low-dimensional quantum gases as well as in experiments where small atom number BECs are rapidly rotated to enter the fractional quantum Hall regime. </p...|$|R

25|$|The meter {{movement}} in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil galvanometer of the d'Arsonval type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands {{to support the}} <b>moving</b> <b>coil.</b> In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1milliampere from a circuit at full scale deflection. More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.|$|E
25|$|A contact {{microphone}} picks up vibrations {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (<b>moving</b> <b>coil)</b> transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the {{contact microphone}} that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|E

This paper presents a novel triple-redundant voice coil motor (TRVCM) used for redundant DDVs. The TRVCM features electrical/mechanical hybrid triple-redundancy by securing three stators along with three <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> in the same frame. A permanent magnet (PM) Halbach array is employed in each redundant VCM to simplify the system structure. A back-to-back design between neighborly redundancies is adopted to decouple the magnetic flux linkage. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is implemented to optimize design parameters based on the analytical magnetic circuit model. The optimization objective function {{is defined as the}} acceleration capacity of the motor to achieve high dynamic performance. The optimal geometric parameters are verified with 3 D magnetic field finite element analysis (FEA). A research prototype has been developed for experimental purpose.

50|$|Instruments with <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> can be {{calibrated}} {{for direct}} current or power frequency currents up {{to a few}} hundred hertz. At radio frequencies a common method is a rectifier circuit arranged to respond to current in a transmission line; the system is calibrated for the known circuit impedance. Diode detectors are either directly connected to the source, or used with a sampling system that diverts {{only a portion of}} the RF power through the detector. Thermistors and thermocouples are used to measure heat produced by RF power and can be calibrated either directly or by comparison with a known reference source of power. A bolometer power sensor converts incident radio frequency power to heat. The sensor element is maintained at a constant temperature by a small direct current. The reduction in current required to maintain temperature is related to the incident RF power. Instruments of this type are used throughout the RF spectrum and can even measure visible light power. For high-power measurements, a calorimeter directly measures heat produced by RF power.|$|R

Separation of the two <b>moving</b> <b>coils</b> is usually from 10 to 30 metres. Using an AC bridge (also called compensator bridge), Field Strength Ratio is measured in percent and Phase Difference in degrees.
