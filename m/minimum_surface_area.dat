25|$|The {{process that}} leads to the {{formation}} of a bait ball typically starts when predators locate a fish school deep below the surface. The predators make rushes and use various scare tactics to force the fish school to the surface, herding {{it at the same time}} into a compact volume. The alarmed fish, trapped against the surface above and surrounded all about, abandon their coordinated schooling movements and become chaotic. Their graceful and disciplined schooling strategies of uniform spacing and polarity degrade into frenetic attempts by each fish to save itself. In this way, a dense bait ball forms as each fish scrambles to get away from the surface of the ball and hide in the interior. The symmetry of this centripetal action forms a sphere, the shape with the <b>minimum</b> <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> for a given volume, thereby exposing the fewest number of fish on the surface to the predators. The movement, sound and smell can attract more predators, including different predator species, until there is a carousel of them, each species using its own characteristic predatory strategies. Fish that break loose are singled out and eaten. A frenzy can develop as predators compete, the water reddening with blood as shredded flesh and scales drift to the depths. As the bait ball reduces in size and number, it becomes progressively easier for the predators to target the survivors.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} was conducted {{within the scope}} of the Monash Vision Group’s (MVG) development of a cortical visual prosthesis “bionic eye” to provide visual information to blind people, using electrodes that penetrate into primary visual cortex to stimulate layer 4 and evoke the perception of spots of light called phosphenes. Platinum/iridium (PtIr), the electrode material used by MVG, is estimated to have a charge injection capacity of 50 - 150 µC/cm²/phase, much lower than the charge densities required for phosphene perception using standard electrode designs with small exposed stimulation tips. To overcome this, MVG proposed a novel design with an annular active area on the electrodes as the larger active <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> could reduce the charge densities required for effective stimulation. My original contribution is the engineering and biomedical examination of this design for effective cortical stimulation within the electrochemical “safe” limits for PtIr. I first used analytical and finite element modelling for theoretical predictions. Analytical modelling showed that due to the kill zone (the region of dead nerve cells) expected around each electrode after implantation into cortex, the electrode <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> for <b>minimum</b> power consumption during threshold stimulation is 49, 700 µm, much larger than the <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of stimulating intracortical electrodes currently used. Thus, increasing the electrode’s <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> from current designs will reduce the power consumption, an important consideration in the wirelessly powered device MVG proposes to develop. Finite element modelling demonstrated the annulus electrode has a more uniform primary current density distribution than the commonly used tip electrode, likely reducing any tissue or electrode damage during stimulation. Balancing the advantage of increasing electrode <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> in reducing power consumption, is that a smaller <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> is needed for specificity and resolution of stimulation. In acute studies in rats I determined the <b>minimum</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> of the annular electrodes for safe and effective stimulation. The effect of coating electrodes with sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) to increase charge injection capacity was also studied. Using electrodes with varying <b>surface</b> <b>areas,</b> the charge injection capacity of TiN-coated and uncoated PtIr electrodes was measured with voltage transients, and compared to charge densities to evoke a motor response in anaesthetised rats. The <b>minimum</b> geometric <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> for effective stimulation within safe limits were 38, 000 µm² and 16, 000 µm² for uncoated and TiN-coated PtIr electrodes respectively. Finally, chronic studies were performed to test the safety and stability of stimulation over the long term when a glial sheath forms around the electrode through the brain’s inflammatory response to a foreign object. Charge densities of up to 71. 4 µC/cm²/phase were measured, which is greater than the charge injection capacity of 18 µC/cm²/phase for PtIr found in the acute studies. No neuronal loss or evidence of electrode degradation occurred that could be attributed to stimulation,suggesting less conservative safety limits could be used. Overall, the results support the use of annular electrodes in stimulating cortical prostheses. It is recommended that the electrodes are coated with TiN so that smaller electrodes can be used and device resolution increased...|$|R
40|$|Partitioning space into polyhedra with a <b>minimum</b> total <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> is a {{fundamental}} question in science and mathematics. In 1887, Lord Kelvin conjectured that the optimal partition of space is obtained with a 14 -faced space-filling polyhedron, called tetrakaidecahedron. Kelvin’s conjecture resisted a century until Weaire and Phelan proposed in 1994 a new structure, made of eight polyhedra, obtained from numerical simulations. Herein, we propose a stochastic method for finding efficient polyhedral structures, maximizing the mean isoperimeter Q, instead of minimizing total area. We show that novel optimal structures emerge with non-equal cell volumes and uncurved facets. A partition made of 24 polyhedra, is found to surpass the previous known structures.

40|$|The use {{of active}} {{packaging}} gives added protection to foods and provides extended shelf life. One {{of the most}} used active packaging techniques is oxygen absorbing systems composed of iron powder. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to develop iron-based oxygen absorbing plastic films that could extend the shelf life of oxygen sensitive foods. To achieve the objective, the effectiveness of current commercial iron-based oxygen absorbing sachets to retard lipid oxidation was compared to other methods (antioxidants, <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> reduction and nitrogen flushing). Next, the oxygen absorption kinetics of powdered iron containing NaCl as a catalyst were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) at different temperatures and relative humidities. Finally, oxygen absorbing plastic films were developed and their oxygen absorption kinetics determined. ^ Menhaden oil was used as a model system to evaluate different methods to retard lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation was measured mainly by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) analysis. Oxygen absorption of powdered iron and plastic films containing iron-based compounds was measured by a constant volume manometric method. ^ Oxygen absorbing sachets prevented the oxidation of menhaden oil and thus proved to be the most effective method. The sachets were also the easiest and quickest method to use. ^ RSM analysis for oxygen absorption by powdered iron predicted a maximum rate of 6. 54 % O 2 /hr at 56 °C, 78 % relative humidity and 0. 8 % NaCl. Activation energies determined for this oxygen absorption were lower than those of relevant food deteriorative reactions (lipid oxidation and nutrient loss). Therefore, powdered iron will protect food from oxidative deteriorative reactions. ^ Plastic films made from low density polyethylene (LDPE) containing iron-based oxygen absorbers effectively absorbed oxygen at significant rates to be useful in food packaging. The <b>minimum</b> <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> determined to absorb ambient oxygen levels (20. 9 %) in one day varied from 490 to 730 cm 2 for films 228. 6 to 76. 2 μm thick, respectively. However, less <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> was needed to absorb ambient oxygen levels over two days, 300 to 440 cm 2 for films 228. 6 to 76. 2 μm thick, respectively. ^ Overall, oxygen absorbing systems are very useful to retard oxidative reactions in packaged foods. These systems were shown to remain active when incorporated into plastic films. Therefore, active packages made from these films will provide extended shelf life for many foods. ...|$|R

40|$|Measuring the {{similarity}} of curves is a fundamental problem arising in many application fields. There has been considerable interest in several such measures, both in Euclidean space and in more general setting such as curves on Riemannian surfaces or curves in the plane minus a set of obstacles. However, so far, efficiently computable similarity measures for curves on general surfaces remain elusive. This paper aims at developing a natural curve similarity measure {{that can be easily}} extended and computed for curves on general orientable 2 -manifolds. Specifically, we measure similarity between homotopic curves based on {{how hard it is to}} deform one curve into the other one continuously, and define this "hardness" as the <b>minimum</b> possible <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> swept by a homotopy between the curves.

The spectra sample three key points in the SN 2009 ip lightcurve, corresponding to its initial brightening in August (2012 -A) and its dramatic rebrightening in early October (2012 -B). Based on line fluxes and velocities measured in our spectra, we find a surprisingly low I(H-alpha) /I(H-beta) ~ 1. 3 - 1. 4 in the 2012 -B spectra. Such a ratio implies either a rare Case B recombination scenario where H-alpha, but not H-beta, is optically thick, or an extremely high density for the circumstellar material of n_e > 10 ^ 13 cm^(- 3) The H-alpha line intensity yields a <b>minimum</b> radiating <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of >~ 20, 000 AU^ 2 in H-alpha {{at the peak of}} SN 2009 ip's photometric evolution.

40|$|Abstract. A self-flow {{refractory}} castable (SFRC) without cement requires {{a matrix of}} fine particles and a broad size distribution of coarse particles (aggregate). The matrix ensures the rheological behaviour and performs the binding role of the absent refractory cement. The presence of the aggregate coarse particles hinders the flowability index (FI), but improves the castable mechanical strength and reduces firing shrinkage. A new methodology of SFRC particle distribution design was developed, using response surface statistical modelling and commercial alumina powders (reactive and tabular). First, {{the composition of the}} fine matrix was optimised, seeking minimum water content and maximum IF. To this matrix, various aggregate distributions, combining six tabular alumina size fractions and with different Andreasen distribution modulus, q, between 0. 18 to 0. 28, were added, to identify the composition with maximum FI. The results obtained show that a <b>minimum</b> specific <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> (SSA) of 2. 22 m 2 /g is necessary to reach the self-flow turning point, after which the largest FI requires the maximisation of the aggregate maximum paste thickness (MPT), corresponding to a distribution with q= 0. 22.
