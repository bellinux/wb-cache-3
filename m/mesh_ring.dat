Current mobile backhauls are predominantly deployed in tree or ring topologies, which simplify traffic management. Yet, with the increasing demand on backhaul capacity and the immense cost pressure on mobile backhaul solutions, meshed wireless mobile backhauls {{have been identified as}} a promising evolution. While traffic management in wireless mesh networks have been studied extensively in the literature, so far there is no quantitative analysis comparing the different topology options, i. e. <b>mesh,</b> <b>ring</b> and tree, regarding network performance and deployment cost.

40|$|As the multiple-decade long {{increase}} in clock rates starts to slow down, main-stream general-purpose processors evolve towards single-chip parallel processing. On-chip interconnection networks are essential components of such machines, supporting the communication between processors {{and the memory}} system. This task is especially challenging for some easy-to-program parallel computers, which are designed with performance-demanding memory systems. This study proposes an interconnection network, with a novel implementation of the Mesh-of-Trees (MoT) topology. The MoT network is evaluated relative to metrics such as wire area complexity, total register count, bandwidth, network diameter, single switch delay, maximum throughput per area, trade-offs between throughput and latency, and post-layout performance. It is also compared with some other traditional network topologies, such as <b>mesh,</b> <b>ring,</b> hypercube, butterfly, fat trees, butterfly fat trees, and replicated butterfly networks. Concrete results show that MoT provides higher throughput and lower latency especially when the input traffic (or the on-chip parallelism) is high, at comparable area cost. The layout of MoT network is evaluated using standard cell design methodology. A prototype chip with 8 -terminal MoT network was taped out at $ 90 nm$ technology and tested.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} different {{schemes for}} tolerating faults in hypercube multiprocessors. A study of hypercube algorithms reveals {{that in many}} cases, the computations that require local communication are mapped onto topologies such as <b>meshes</b> or <b>rings</b> and the hypercube topology is used for global data communication. Therefore, a faulty hypercube needs to be reconfigured to perform both local and global communication {{as required by the}} algorithm, effectively and with minimal performance degradation. Two general approaches can be identified. The first approach looks into ways of utilizing the healthy processors and links of a hypercube with faulty nodes/links, for embedding topologies such as lower dimensional hypercubes, <b>rings,</b> <b>meshes</b> and trees for performing communication. The second approach makes use of hardware redundancy in the form of spare nodes and/or links and usually requires modifications in the communication hardware.

40|$|MIng (Computer and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Network {{failures}} can {{originate from}} or {{be located in}} any one of several network layers as described by the OSI model. This investigation focuses on the role of physical topological design parameters in determining network reliability and performance as can be expected {{from the point of view}} of a typical client-server based connection in an Ethernet local area network. This type of host-to-host IP connection is found in many commercial, military and industrial network based systems. Using Markov modelling techniques reliability and performability models are developed for common network topologies based on the redundancy mechanism provided by IEEE spanning tree protocols. The models are tested and validated using the OPNET network simulation environment. The reliability and performability metrics calculated from the derived models for different topologies are compared leading to the following conclusions. The reliability of the entry-nodes into a redundant network is a determining factor in connection availability. Redundancy mechanisms must be extended from the entry-node to the connecting hosts to gain a significant benefit from redundant network topologies as network availability remains limited to three-nines. The hierarchical mesh network offers the highest availability (sevennines) and performability. Both these metrics can be accurately predicted irrespective of the position of the entry-node in the <b>mesh.</b> <b>Ring</b> networks offer high availability (five to sevennines) and performability if the ring remains small to medium sized, however for larger rings (N≥ 32) the availability is highly dependant on the relative position of the entry-node in the ring. Performability also degrades significantly as the ring size increases. Although star networks offer predictable and high performability the availability is low (four-nines) because of the lack of redundancy. The star should therefore not be used in IP networked systems requiring more than four-nines availability. In all the topologies investigated the reliability and performability can be increased significantly by introducing redundant links instead of single links interconnecting the various nodes, with the star topology availability increasing from four-nines to seven-nines and performance doubling.

40|$|Applications {{running on}} custom {{architectures}} {{with hundreds of}} specialized processing elements (PEs) on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can gain 10 x or greater speedups versus desktop or embedded processors. Applications benefiting from such many-core PE networks include applications with non-centralized communication and memory requirements, like real-time emulation of physical systems, video streaming applications, signal processing, and more. Synchronous many-core networks (syncMCs) consist of synchronized many-core PE networks that execute distributed computations in parallel, keeping each PE in the network in lockstep through a regular, periodic communication phase. An FPGA has limited logic and routing resources on which to place a synchMC network. Large or densely connected synchMCs can overwhelm the available resources and severely impact the resulting FPGA circuit frequency, and thus application performance. This dissertation focuses primarily on methods for successfully implementing large synchMCs, consisting of hundreds of PEs and thousands of interconnects, on an FPGA. An approach is described that considers the natural structure of a physical model, such as a <b>mesh,</b> <b>ring,</b> or cube, to perform a graph embedding of a synchMC on a 2 -dimensional grid of physical PE regions. The described PE placement techniques reduce critical path length and allows previously unroutable designs able to complete place-and-route. In addition, an automated approach {{to reduce the number}} of wires in a synchMC allows applications of arbitrary size and complexity to fit within the resource constraints of a target FPGA. Time-multiplexed communication for synchMCs is introduced, and a greedy scheduler, a heuristic scheduler, and an integer linear program scheduler are described. Finally, an approach for exploring the configuration space of a synchMC executing real-time emulation of a physical model is described. Using the described synthesis approaches, synchMCs enable the fastest emulation of physical models on a moderately priced platform, executing 15 x faster than a desktop PC, 26 x faster than a GPU, 9 x faster than a network-on-chip (NoC), and 9 x faster than a circuit produced via high-level synthesis (HLS) ...|$|E

To {{keep pace with the}} growing demand for digital communications and entertainment, fiber optic networks and technologies continue to grow and mature. As new applications in telecommunications, computer networking and entertainment emerge, reliability, scalability, and high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are increasing the complexity of optical transport networks.;This dissertation is devoted to providing a discussion of existing and emerging technologies in modern optical communications networks. To this end, we first outline traditional telecommunication and data networks that enable high speed, long distance information transport. We examine various network architectures including <b>mesh,</b> <b>ring</b> and bus topologies of modern Local, Metropolitan and Wide area networks. We present some of the most successful technologies used in todays communications networks, outline their shortcomings and introduce promising new technologies {{to meet the demands of}} future transport networks.;The capacity of a single wavelength optical signal is 10 Gbps today and is likely to increase to over 100 Gbps as demonstrated in laboratory settings. In addition, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) techniques, able to support over 160 wavelengths on a single optical fiber, have effectively increased the capacity of a single optical fiber to well over 1 Tbps. However, user requirements are often of a sub-wavelength order. This mis-match between individual user requirements and single wavelength offerings necessitates bandwidth sharing mechanisms to efficiently multiplex multiple low rate streams on to high rate wavelength channels, called traffic grooming.;This dissertation examines traffic grooming in the context of circuit, packet, burst and trail switching paradigms. Of primary interest are the Media Access Control (MAC) protocols used to provide QoS and fairness in optical networks. We present a comprehensive discussion of the most recognized fairness models and MACs for ring and bus networks which lay the groundwork for the development of the Robust, Dynamic and Fair Network (RDFN) protocol for ring networks. The RDFN protocol is a novel solution to fairly share ring bandwidth for bursty asynchronous data traffic while providing bandwidth and delay guarantees for synchronous voice traffic.;We explain the light-trail (LT) architecture and technology introduced in [37] as a solution to providing high network resource utilization, seamless scalability and network transparency for metropolitan area networks. The goal of light-trails is to eliminate Optical Electronic Optical (O-E-O) conversion, minimize active switching, maximize wavelength utilization, and offer protocol and bit-rate transparency to address the growing demands placed on WDM networks. Light-trail technology is a physical layer architecture that combines commercially available optical components to allow multiple nodes along a lightpath to participate in time multiplexed communication without the need for burst or packet level switch reconfiguration. We present three medium access control protocols for light-trails that provide collision protection but do not consider fair network access. As an improvement to these light-trail MAC protocols we introduce the Token LT and light-trail Fair Access (LT-FA) MAC protocols and evaluate their performance. We illustrate how fairness is achieved and access delay guarantees are made to satisfy the bandwidth budget fairness model. The goal of light-trails and our access control solution is to combine commercially available components with emerging network technologies to provide a transparent, reliable and highly scalable communication network.;The second area of discussion in this dissertation deals with the rapid prototyping platform. We discuss how the reconfigurable rapid prototyping platform (RRPP) is being utilized to bridge the gap between academic research, education and industry. We provide details of the Real-time Radon transform and the Griffin parallel computing platform implemented using the RRPP. We discuss how the RRPP provides additional visibility to academic research initiatives and facilitates understanding of system level designs. As a proof of concept, we introduce the light-trail testbed developed at the High Speed Systems Engineering lab. We discuss how a light-trail test bed has been developed using the RRPP to provide additional insight on the real-world limitations of light-trail technology. We provide details on its operation and discuss the steps required to and decisions made to realize test-bed operation. Two applications are presented to illustrate the use of the LT-FA MAC in the test-bed and demonstrate streaming media over light-trails.;As a whole, this dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive discussion of current and future technologies and trends for optical communication networks. In addition, we provide media access control solutions for ring and bus networks to address fair resource sharing and access delay guarantees.
