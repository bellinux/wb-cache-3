25|$|The <b>minimum</b> <b>message</b> <b>length</b> {{principle}} of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning {{was developed by}} C.S. Wallace and D.M. Boulton in 1968. MML is Bayesian (i.e. it incorporates prior beliefs) and information-theoretic. It has the desirable properties of statistical invariance (i.e. the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (i.e. even for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (i.e. the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible). C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).|$|E

2500|$|The minimum {{instruction}} set {{of a universal}} Turing machine requires approximately the same length description across different formulations, and is small compared to the Kolmogorov complexity of most practical theories. Marcus Hutter has used this consistency to define a [...] "natural" [...] Turing machine of small size as the proper basis for excluding arbitrarily complex {{instruction set}}s {{in the formulation of}} razors. Describing the program for the universal program as the [...] "hypothesis", and the representation of the evidence as program data, it has been formally proven under Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory that [...] "the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized." [...] Interpreting this as minimising the total length of a two-part message encoding model followed by data given model gives us the <b>minimum</b> <b>message</b> <b>length</b> (MML) principle.|$|E

Its approximations, namely, the <b>Minimum</b> Description (or <b>Message)</b> <b>Length</b> (MDL) principles, are adopted in practice in the efficient, but non-universal form. Recent attempts to bridge this gap leaded to development of the Repre-sentational MDL principle that originates from formal decomposition of the task of induction. In this paper, possible extension of the RMDL principle in the context of universal intelligence agents is considered, for which introduction of representations is shown to be an unavoidable meta-heuristic and a step toward efficient general intelligence.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two party network where each party wishes to compute {{a function of}} two correlated sources. Each source is observed {{by one of the}} parties. The true joint distribution of the sources is known to one party. The other party, on the other hand, assumes a distribution for which the set of source pairs that have a positive probability is only a subset of those that may appear in the true distribution. In that sense, this party has only partial information about the true distribution from which the sources are generated. We study the impact of this asymmetry on the worst-case <b>message</b> <b>length</b> for zero-error function computation, by identifying the conditions under which reconciling the missing information prior to communication is better than not reconciling it but instead using an interactive protocol that ensures zero-error communication without reconciliation. Accordingly, we provide upper and lower bounds on the <b>minimum</b> worst-case <b>message</b> <b>length</b> for the communication strategies with and without reconciliation. Through specializing the proposed model to certain distribution classes, we show that partially reconciling the true distribution by allowing a certain degree of ambiguity can perform better than the strategies with perfect reconciliation as well as strategies that do not start with an explicit reconciliation step. As such, our results demonstrate a tradeoff between the reconciliation and communication rates, and that the worst-case <b>message</b> <b>length</b> {{is a result of the}} interplay between the two factors...|$|R

40|$|PLAYTHROUGH ring {{performance}} is studied with self-similar traffic patterns. Measurements made by others on local networks {{connected to the}} Internet have shown that TCP traffic is self-similar. Self-similar traffic can be generated using heavy-tailed distributions. In particular, others {{have shown that the}} Weibull distribution provides a good fit for TCP connection interarrival times. The Weibull distribution, with specific parameters measured in real networks, is used to simulate the operation of the PLAYTHROUGH ring under self-similar traffic. Simulation results reveal that the mean waiting time performance of the PLAYTHROUGH ring under self-similar traffic is markedly worse than that of hitherto assumed traffic patterns using the exponentially distributed interarrival times and geometrically distributed <b>message</b> <b>lengths.</b> Furthemore, it appears that, in general, mean waiting times are significantly greater for PLAYTHROUGH ring under exponential interarrival times and Weibull-distributed <b>message</b> <b>lengths</b> than in the case when message interarrival times and <b>message</b> <b>lengths</b> are assumed to be Weibull-distributed and geometrically distributed, respectively. An analytical model is derived for various PLAYTHROUGH ring performance metrics under the assumption of exponential interarrivals and Weibull-distributed <b>message</b> <b>lengths,</b> including the moments of the number of minipackets, control frame round trip time, transmission time, service time, blocking duration, and waiting time. When Weibull interarrival times are assumed, finding an analytical model for waiting times is a seemingly intractable problem because the Laplace transform of the Weibull distribution does not have a closed form. However, it is shown that, under heavy loads, mean waiting times under the assumption of exponentially distributed interarrival times and geometrically distributed <b>message</b> <b>lengths</b> are, in general, a lower bound on mean waiting times under the assumption of Weibull interarrivals and geometrically distributed <b>message</b> <b>lengths.</b> Moreover, under heavy loads, mean waiting times under the assumption of exponentially distributed interarrival times and Weibull <b>message</b> <b>lengths</b> are, in general, upper bounds on mean waiting times under the assumption of Weibull interarrivals and geometrically distributed <b>message</b> <b>lengths.</b> This work provides the first analytical approxiamtion that predicts the performance of PLAYTHROUGH ring under self-similar traffic.
