5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia coccinea appears to be most closely related to Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri. Banksia coccinea plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. Widely considered one of the <b>most</b> <b>attractive</b> Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant {{and one of the most}} important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in several countries including Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Israel. In cultivation, B.coccinea grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil, but it cannot survive in areas with humid or wet summers.|$|E

5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong, somewhat wedge-shaped, equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The mid-rib is usually folded longitudinally, and they are characterized by parallel transverse veins. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches long (2.5 to 5.1cm) and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The plant displays purple flowers during season; they are described as their <b>most</b> <b>attractive</b> {{in the month of}} January. It typically grows to 45 – 50cm in height, and can grow on mountains with an altitude of over 3000ft. (914 m). Both diploid (22 chromosomes) and tetraploid (44 chromosomes) cytotypes have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The village {{changed little}} in either {{character}} or structure {{after the end}} of World War II, though in 1965 plans were drawn for the further development of Durham Road which drew criticism from residents. By 1974, when the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead was formed, Low Fell had transformed from those early, village days and was by that time a bustling suburb with a considerable independent commercial hub attracting a high volume of vehicular traffic. That character is relatively unchanged today, but Low Fell remains one of the <b>most</b> <b>attractive</b> places to live in the North East of England, retaining a distinctive village feel and containing a thriving community of shops, restaurants, schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the <b>most</b> <b>attractive.</b> The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can vaporize an ordinary human soldier. If {{they do not}} strike a living target, the flechette charge up for several seconds and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the <b>most</b> <b>attractive</b> options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the <b>most</b> <b>attractive</b> Banksia species, B.coccinea is a popular garden plant {{and one of the most}} important Banksia species for the cut flower industry; it is grown commercially in Australia, South Africa, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, Israel, and trialled in France, Spain and South America. Its striking terminal inflorescences and furry new growth are its main horticultural attributes. However, it is highly sensitive to dieback and succumbs readily when exposed. It is difficult to keep alive in areas of heavy soils or summer rainfall or humidity, such as the Australian east coast. Furthermore, flowering may be sparse or not occur when cultivated in warmer climates such as Perth. Pruning promotes branching, which leads to more flower spikes being produced.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and <b>most</b> <b>attractive</b> wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
