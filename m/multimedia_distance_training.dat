40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} a concurrency and an {{access control system}} which is running on a web based <b>multimedia</b> <b>distance</b> education environment A <b>multimedia</b> <b>distance</b> education system includes advanced services, coordination services, cooperation services, and media services. Advanced services consist of various subclass modules. This subclass module provides the basic services, while advanced services layer supports mixture of various basic services. Advanced services include creation/deletion of shared video window and of creation/deletion of shared window. Coordination services include session control module, and floor control module. Session control module controls the access to the whole session. Cooperation services include window overlays module, and window sharing module. There are two approaches to software architecture on which applications for a web based <b>multimedia</b> <b>distance</b> education environment are based. Those include CACV(Centralized-Abstraction and Centralized-View) and RARV(Replicated-Abstraction and Replicated-View). The environment of concurrency and access control {{is based on a}} hybrid software architecture which is adopting the advantage of CACV and RARV. Key-Words:- concurrency and access control, a web based <b>multimedia</b> <b>distance</b> education system, advances services, coordination services, cooperation services CACV, RARV, hybrid software architecture...|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. The {{purpose of}} this {{literature}} {{study was to identify}} guidelines for the design of a media supported <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programme for Telkom personnel. The board of Telkom SA decided to add media supported <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> to their existing contact training method to help fulfil their training needs. Existing training officers in the service of Telkom SA will be used to train employees by using media support in <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programmes. It was found that training officers do not have the necessary guidelines to train as successfully as they do in the usual class situation. With respect to media support in <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programmes, the following aspects should be planned together, so that effective training and learning can take place: initiation; planning and preparation; presentation of the programme; and student evaluation. After having researched the above aspects, the following guidelines were proposed to provide Telkom training officers with the necessary training skills for media supported <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programmes: determining training needs; programme planning with respect to the lesson phases as in contact training; curriculum design for study content; reduction of study content; selection of media; planning and determining interaction during presentation; planning, determining and preparation of an evaluation strategy; and monitoring students during the training and learning process. In order to train as successfully as in contact training, training officers should adapt to a media supported <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programme. Using the abovementioned guidelines, existing Telkom training officers can develop their skills for media supported <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programmes...|$|R

40|$|Several studies {{highlighting}} {{best practices}} {{in the field of}} <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> suggest that strategic planning is the key factor in achieving a much greater likelihood for success in sustaining <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programs. Although it is necessary for an organization to address issues of technology and learning effectiveness, it is equally important for an organization to address issues surrounding organizational leadership, culture, infrastructure and change. Building a strategic foundation includes: developing a learning architecture that coordinates elearning {{with the rest of the}} organization’s learning efforts, reviewing an infrastructure that uses the organization’s existing technological capabilities to design and deliver elearning, providing leadership support across all levels of the enterprise, overcoming barriers by implementing an effective change management strategy, and developing a sound business and communication plan that includes elearning as part of the organizational culture. The more pieces in this foundation that support the elearning initiative, the more likely the initiative will be sustained (Rosenberg, 2001, p. 33). This paper discusses that foundation in greater detail and outlines the most common challenges associated with sustaining <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programs. It identifies the key issues impacting organizational planning and highlights several possible solutions used to implement and maintain <b>distance</b> <b>training</b> programs. Rationale is supported and referenced through various research and literature in the field of <b>distance</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R
