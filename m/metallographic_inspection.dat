40|$|The {{functional}} behaviour of many components {{is determined}} by the intrinsic properties - residual stresses and microstructure - of sub-surface near zones. Therefore, in order to improve the static and dynamic mechanical properties of these surface near states, mechanical and/or thermal treatments such as laser hardening, inductive hardening, case hardening, nitriding, grinding and shot peening are applied.

40|$|The International Space Station's {{starboard}} Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) {{experienced a}} breakdown of the joint's race ring surface. The starboard SARJ mechanism was cleaned and lubricated with grease. To provide some guidance on the expected behavior of the damaged SARJ ring with continued operations, experiments were conducted using rollers and a vacuum roller test rig. The approach of the experimental work involved three main steps: (1) initiate damage using conditions representative of the SARJ with inadequate lubrication; (2) propagate the damage by operating the test rollers without lubrication; and (3) assess the durability of the roller by testing to simulate the equivalent of 15 years of SARJ operation on the damaged surface assuming adequate grease lubrication. During the rig testing, additional and/or replacement grease was introduced at regular intervals to maintain good lubrication in the rig. The damage to the nitride layer continued even after application of grease. The grease lubrication proved to be effective for limiting the value of the axial force that can be developed. Limiting the axial force on the SARJ mechanism is important since the larger the axial force the more concentrated the load pressure becomes on the blend-radius location on the SARJ roller. After the testing simulating 15 years of SARJ operations, the wear depths were the order of 0. 2 mm for the nitrided 15 - 5 roller and the order of 0. 06 mm for the mating 440 C roller. <b>Metallographic</b> <b>inspections</b> were done to search for indications of impending fatigue or other fracture indications that might eventually propagate and cause structural failure.

As thermally highest loaded part of the machine, the target plates of the of the divertor will be exposed to maximum heat loads of 10 MW/m" 2 up to 1000 s. Due to safety reasons the target elements should sustain heat loads up to 12 MW/m" 2 and short time failure loads of 15 MW/m" 2 without damage. The position of the cryopumps behind the target plates will lead to special elements including a cooling flow reversal element. Under this boundary conditions an alternative concept of target elements has been developed, analyzed and tested. Thermomechanical analyzes at 10 MW/m" 2 using the method of Finite Elements are performed to select the optimum cross-section geometry and a proper material combination. Due to the lowest surface temperature of 830 C, the lowest peaking factor and the lowest residual stresses in the carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (CFC-material), the monoblock concept using the CFC material DMS 704 or N 11 brazed onto two parallel copper tubes of 26 mm distance is chosen as best solution for the realization of the target elements. The bonding of the copper tubes with the CFC will be done by active brazing with a partial liquid phase. The liquid brase phase is formed by the interaction of a deposited thin layer of titanium with the surface of the copper tubes. Heat load experiments in the electron beam facility TSEFEY and the ion beam facility MARION, nondestructive and <b>metallographic</b> <b>inspections</b> show that the main reason for defects in the braze interface are due to a lack of liquid phase. In order to avoid these defects, the braze gap at room temperature must be adjusted as small as possible. In addition a large amount of braze depots are placed on the rear side of the target elements to overcome the problem of manufacturing tolerances. One target element, manufactured under these conditions, is successfully tested up to power densities of 10. 5 MW/m" 2, using a coolant flow velocity of 10 m/s. At higher power densities a failure of the cooling is observed and large cracks occur in the CFC material parallel to the fiber planes. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by Scheerer, M.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of alternative materials {{and in particular}} aluminium alloys, for vehicle body applications has impelled {{the development of new}} joining techniques. Traditional joining methods such as spot-welding and arc-welding are being challenged. Self-piercing riveting has attracted considerable interest by the automotive industry and has been used as an alternative to spot-welding in vehicle body assembly. However, self-piercing riveting is a relatively new joining method and as such it is not well understood. The aim of this project was therefore to develop an understanding of the mechanical behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints. The effects of paint-baking, shelf-life, pre-straining and surface condition of the sheet material on the joint quality and behaviour were therefore examined. Aluminium alloy sheet materials, 5754 and AA 6111, were used in this investigation. The project began with a <b>metallographic</b> <b>inspection</b> of cross-sections of samples that were joined under different conditions in order to examine the effect of process variables on the joint quality. This part of the investigation led to the identification of suitable setting parameters that produced joints which, by <b>metallographic</b> <b>inspection,</b> were of good quality. It was also observed that some process variables, such as sheet thickness combination, rivet and die design and setting force, affected the joint quality and therefore needed to be taken into consideration in the choice of the processing parameters. Subsequent work focused on mechanical testing. Lap shear, T-peel, pull-out and fatigue tests were carried out in order to examine the mechanical behaviour and to analyse the failure mechanisms of the joints. The work showed that the strength, the thickness and the surface condition of the riveted sheets affected the strength and the failure mechanisms of the joints. The joint strength was also observed to be dependent on the rivet and anvil design as well as the setting force. In addition, the joint strength and behaviour differed as the specimen geometry thus emphasising the need for a test standard for self-piercing riveted joints. Paint baking led to a marginal and insignificant reduction in the static strength, whilst resulting in a reduction in the fatigue strength of the joints as a consequence of recovery of the 5754 alloy and the removal of the wax-based surface lubricant.

Vickers micro-hardness tests were conducted at the mid thickness of the cross sections of the joints and its variation in function of the distance from the welding line was achieved. Two tensile strength tests for each welding condition were performed in order to evaluate the mechanical properties of the welds. Results revealed a contained extent of the FZ and HAZ in the cross sections. The reduction of mechanical properties of the welds in comparison with those typical of the parent metal was about 20 %, which is a good result in comparison with other previous research works...|$|E

In cases where a weld fatigue issue is discovered in the field the customer desires to have low-cost methods to increase service life. This research was initiated to recommend a process for treating welded joints on heavy trucks that can be accomplished in the field with limited manufacturing resources. Surface peening is a cold working process that introduces beneficial residual compressive stresses in {{the surface of a}} work piece. Two different surface peening processes were evaluated for their ability to increase fatigue life in fillet welds. These processes were hammer peening and rotary flap peening. T-shaped fillet weld test samples were fabricated and subjected to cyclic loading in three configurations; as-welded, welded and hammer peened, and welded and flap peened. <b>Metallographic</b> <b>inspection</b> was used to further evaluate the test samples following fatigue testing. Fatigue life estimation methods were considered based on both experimentally measured strain data and stress/strain results obtained through the use of finite element methods. Stress-life analyses based on weld classifications established by British Standard BS 7608 were conducted. Strain-life analyses based on the use of A 36 steel fatigue properties with the application of a fatigue notch factor were also conducted...|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores {{new methods}} for {{achieving}} load-carrying joints between the dissimilar materials of continuous fibre reinforced polymer matrix composites and structural metals. The new composite-to-metal joining methods investigated {{in this work}} exploit the metal-to-metal joining techniques of arc micro-welding, resistance spot welding, and metal filler brazing, to form novel micro-architectured metal adherends {{that can be used}} for enhanced composite-to-metal joining. Through a combination of equipment instrumentation and <b>metallographic</b> <b>inspection</b> of fabricated prototype joints, understanding is gained of how materials respond when processed by manufacturing techniques that have not previously been exploited for dissimilar material joining. Mechanical testing of prototype joints; both to ultimate loading strength and partial failure states, with subsequent inspection of specimens and comparative performances evaluation enabled joining performance characterisation of the new joining methods. Key results include: the identification of micropin reinforced adhesive joints to exhibit pseudo-ductile failure characteristics, resistance spot weld reinforcement of adhesive joints to boost bonding performance, and the use of a polymer infused metal foam to overcome difficulties of thermoplastic to metal adhesion. Through this work knowledge of how novel micro-architectures reacted under mechanical loading enabled insights to be gained into how perceived manufacturing defects can benefit joining performance. Such examples include, localised material weakness that lead to global pseudo-ductile failure behaviour, and low-strength secondary joining mechanisms boosting primary load transfer systems. By comparison of the diverse joining methods investigated in this work, trends were identified that suggest joining performance between the two dissimilar materials is improved by increasing the direct interaction between the composite reinforcement fibres and the metal structure. It is demonstrated that joining improvements are gained by forming mechanical connections between metals and composite precursory material before the final manufacturing process of the composite...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} study is the lack of specialized analysis regarding internal failure caused by the adiabatic shear hand (ASB) phenomenon in the cold-headed products. Its aim was to present an integrated workability study to improve and assist cold-heading (CH) multistage design procedures to replace the current design rules of thumb, as they are neither effective nor adequate in fulfilling the needs of the new developments in the rapidly expanding CH industry. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive testing methodology and FE modeling, implemented within ABAQUS/Explicit, were established. This methodology includes an instrumented Drop Weight Compression Test (DWCT) tower equipped with a guided pocket die-set configuration capable of developing internal failure at different stages of ASBs and integrated <b>metallographic</b> <b>inspection</b> techniques. A validated FE model of the DWCT and guided pocket die-set configuration was a valuable tool in establishing the failure criteria and indicating the workability limits. A detailed experimental and FE study for the ASB stages in the CH process was introduced to uncover the affect of different parameters controlling the failure mechanisms within the ASBs in the CH process. This study investigated the effect of the thermal, geometric and the material flow softening and hardening mechanisms affecting ASB evolution. Moreover, a detailed metallurgical and FE study of the internal ductile and Transformed Adiabatic Shear Band (TASB) failures caused by the ASB phenomenon in DWCT was conducted. Three ductile failure criteria were introduced to predict the initiation and location of the internal ductile failure in the ASBs. One TASB failure criteria was introduced to predict the phase transformation to undesirable brittle martensite. These failure criteria were employed to establish integrated workability methodologies to indicate the objective workability limits. Applying these workability methodologies on multistage CH FE models showed that these methodologies are an efficient tool to predict the damage levels and failure initiation locations within the cold-headed bolts. Moreover, these methodologies were successful in optimizing the die designs in order to reduce damage levels...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{automotive}} industry and, in general, transportation one increasingly needs light components {{in order to}} reduce total weights and therefore limit harmful emissions and fuel consumption. The diecasting process, on one hand, is a versatile and high productivity process but, on the other, the amount of defects found in the castings is high and sometimes compromising the characteristics of the final product. Thus the reduction or, at least, the limitation of defects is capital in order to obtain much more reliable components, especially in the automotive field. For this reason {{it is important to know}} how the process works and investigate all the variables and parameters that may have consequences on the products and may compromise their mechanical characteristics, or worse may cause disease. This implies an increasingly detailed knowledge of process, castings’ microstructure and properties. The paper presents the results of analyses carried out on a reference casting specifically designed to generate as many kinds of defects as possible, at different levels of severity. The purpose of such a casting is to make the evaluation of defects quality level simpler, to generate defects of different degree through controlled variations of process parameters and to make the process monitoring easier and more effective by means of in-mold sensors. The paper also presents analyses and results carried out on industrial production diecastings, adopting the same way of proceeding optimized thanks to the reference casting mentioned above. The possible correlations between process parameters, microstructure and mechanical properties have been deduced analyzing all data collected through the equipments installed on the die casting machine, as in-mold pressure, temperature, plunger velocity/displacement sensors and thermo-cameras which monitor the temperature variation of both movable and fixed mold during the entire cycle, and also by means of analyses performed on the diecastings: X-ray NDT, <b>metallographic</b> <b>inspection,</b> tensile, three points bending, hardness tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy investigations. The main defects revealed are: porosities (caused both by the presence of gas or shrinkage during solidification), oxide films, incomplete filling of the casting and cracks, presence of segregation bands and ESCs, presence of flash and deformation of the casting. All of them have been detected, analyzed and related to one or more causes...|$|E
