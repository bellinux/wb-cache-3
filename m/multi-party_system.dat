5|$|After {{independence}} {{and before the}} adoption of the 1995 Constitution, the Armenian Republic took place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic with the President is the head of state and of a <b>multi-party</b> <b>system.</b> Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. The unicameral parliament was the Supreme Council of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a <b>multi-party</b> <b>system</b> in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|India is the world's {{most populous}} democracy. A {{parliamentary}} republic with a <b>multi-party</b> <b>system,</b> it has seven recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), {{and more than}} 40 regional parties. The Congress is considered centre-left in Indian political culture, and the BJP right-wing. For most of the period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held {{a majority in the}} parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP, as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions at the centre.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a <b>multi-party</b> <b>system.</b> In {{the first five years}} of independence, he consolidated his control of the central government, seeking to prevent the entrenchment of tribal power bases by removing the autonomy of the country's provinces. He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E
5|$|Legislative {{power is}} divided between {{federal and state}} legislatures. The {{bicameral}} federal parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives and the upper house, the Senate. The 222-member House of Representatives is elected for a maximum term of five years from single-member constituencies. All 70 senators sit for three-year terms; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies, and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister's recommendation. The parliament follows a <b>multi-party</b> <b>system</b> {{and the government is}} elected through a first-past-the-post system. Since independence Malaysia has been governed by a 13-party coalition known as the Barisan Nasional.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Portuguese Carnation Revolution {{against the}} authoritarian Estado Novo {{returned}} Portugal to a <b>multi-party</b> <b>system</b> and facilitated {{the independence of}} the Portuguese colonies Angola and East Timor. In Africa, where Angolan rebels had waged a multi-faction independence war against Portuguese rule since 1961, a two-decade civil war replaced the anti-colonial struggle as fighting erupted between the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Cubans and the Soviets, and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), backed by the United States, the People's Republic of China, and Mobutu's government in Zaire. The United States, the apartheid government of South Africa, and several other African governments also supported a third faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Without bothering to consult the Soviets in advance, the Cuban government sent a number of combat troops to fight alongside the MPLA. Foreign mercenaries and a South African armoured column were deployed to support UNITA, but the MPLA, bolstered by Cuban personnel and Soviet assistance, eventually gained the upper hand.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the conviction that there is inadequate conceptual understanding of the phenomena of ‘realignment’ and ‘dealignment’ in <b>multi-party</b> <b>systems.</b> It aims to fill this gap by examining empirically both phenomena in eleven cases of <b>multi-party</b> <b>systems,</b> {{in order to develop}} a conceptual understanding. It proposes a unified approach to studying the phenomena of alignment, and examine whether ‘realignment’ or ‘dealignment’ have occurred in two manifestations of alignment: partisan alignment, and voter alignment along a cleavage and the possible effects of the models of realignment and dealignment on patterns of stability and change of the party system structure. This research is designed as a comparison between “relatively similar” cases, and studies eleven European <b>multi-party</b> <b>systems</b> with electoral systems of proportional representation. It begins in 1950 and covers sixty years, concluding in 2010. It is based on repeated observations {{over long periods of time}} (or so-called longitudinal analysis), and examines individual-level and aggregate data. Promotores: P. Mair, P.

5|$|The {{government}} {{sought help}} from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and P. R. China for funding for several projects and military advice. The failure of several GDR-led projects including the New Zanzibar Project, a 1968 urban redevelopment scheme to provide new apartments for all Zanzibaris, led to Zanzibar focussing on Chinese aid. The post-revolution Zanzibar government was accused of draconian controls on personal freedoms and travel and exercised nepotism in appointments to political and industrial offices, the new Tanzanian government being powerless to intervene. Dissatisfaction with the government {{came to a head}} with the assassination of Karume on 7 April 1972, which was followed by weeks of fighting between pro and anti-government forces. A <b>multi-party</b> <b>system</b> was eventually established in 1992, but Zanzibar remains dogged by allegations of corruption and vote-rigging, though the 2010 general election was seen to be a considerable improvement.|$|E

50|$|<b>Multi-party</b> <b>systems</b> are {{political}} parties {{of three or}} more groups.

Our results indicate that while more sophisticated voters view the party system more similar to experts, this dierence is sub-stantially smaller in ideologically polarized party systems.

40|$|While {{positive}} party {{identification is}} one of the most used concepts in election studies, negative partisanship (NPID) is rarely analyzed. Evidence from two-party systems or settings with majority voting shows that hostility towards one of the other parties has its own unique impact on voting behavior. However, this effect has not been analyzed in the context of European <b>multi-party</b> <b>systems</b> with proportional voting. In this paper, I utilize data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, Module 3, which demonstrates that negative partisanship has its own positive effect on turnout (about nine percentage points). In addition, negative partisanship affects vote choice by 2 – 6 percentage points. However, contrary to previous findings, NPID does not always affect voting for one of the other parties; no significant relationship was found between NPID and vote choice for Conservative/Christian Democratic and Liberal parties. The results of this study add to the growing literature on negative partisanship and demonstrate its importance in the analysis of voting behavior in <b>multi-party</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
