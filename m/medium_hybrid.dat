40|$|Thepresent study {{examined}} the effects of two treatments on the approach / avoidance responses of pair-housed female domestic chicks of a Ross broiler and two laying strains (one docile ISA Brown <b>medium</b> <b>hybrid,</b> one flighty White Leghorn light hybrid) to a visible experimenter. Chicks in the visual contact (VC) group were  allowed to see the experimenter for 30 s twice a day from 1 day of age until testing at 10 or 11 days whereas controls (CON) received minimal human exposure throughout the study. Apart from the visible presence of the experimenter, treatment procedures were similar for the two groups. All chicks were tested individually but pair means were used as data points. Chicks of all three strains which had received the VC treatment showed considerably lower avoidance of humans than did their CON counterparts. The present results demonstrate that fear of humans was markedlyreduced by a simple regime of close visual contact with the experimenter presumably through habituation, and that this effect was common to chicks of flighty as well as docile strains. These findings are discussed in terms of their imphcations for resource management in the laboratory and on the farm. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} Gram-negative bacteria, {{including}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa, actively secrete {{a subset of}} periplasmic proteins into their surrounding medium. The presence of a putative extracellular targeting signal within one such protein, exotoxin A, was investigated. A series of exotoxin A truncates, fused to beta-lactamase, was constructed. Hybrid proteins, which carry at their N- termini 120, 255, 355 or the entire 613 residues of the mature exotoxin A, were stable and were secreted into the extracellular <b>medium.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> proteins which carry residues 1 - 30 and 1 - 60 of the mature exotoxin A were unstable; however, they could be detected entirely within the cells after a short labeling period. A hybrid with beta-lactamase was constructed which carried only the N-terminal residues 1 - 3 and region 60 - 120 of exotoxin A. It was also secreted into the culture medium, suggesting that a specific 60 amino acid domain contains the necessary targeting information for translocation of exotoxin A across the outer membrane. The secretion of the hybrid proteins is independent of the passenger protein, since a similar exotoxin A-murine interleukin 4 hybrid protein was also secreted. The extracellular targeting signal between amino acids 60 and 120 is rich in anti-parallel beta-sheets. It has been shown previously {{to be involved in}} the interaction of the exotoxin A with the receptors of the eukaryotic cells. In the three- dimensional view, the targeting region is on the toxin surface where it is easily accessible to the components of the extracellular secretion machinery...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of European Commission related to climate and energy is the well-known 20 - 20 - 20 targets to be achieved in 2020 : Europe has to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20 % below 1990 levels, 20 % of EU energy consumption {{has to come from}} renewable resources and, finally, a 20 % reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, has to be achieved by improving energy efficiency. In order to reach these objectives, it is necessary to reduce the overall emissions, mainly in transport (reducing CO 2, NOx and other pollutants), and to increase the penetration of the intermittent renewable energy. A high deployment of battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), with a low-cost source of energy storage, could help to achieve both targets. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) use a combination of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with one (or more) electric motor. There are different grades of hybridation from micro-hybrids with start-stop capability, mild hybrids (with kinetic energy recovery), <b>medium</b> <b>hybrids</b> (mild hybrids plus energy assist) and full <b>hybrids</b> (<b>medium</b> <b>hybrids</b> plus electric launch capability). These last types of vehicles use a typical battery capacity around 1 - 2 kWh. Plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) use larger battery capacities to achieve limited electric-only driving range. These vehicles are charged by on-board electricity generation or either plugging into electric outlets. Typical battery capacity is around 10 kWh. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are only driven by electric power and their typical battery capacity is around 15 - 20 kWh. One type of PHEV, the Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV), operates as a BEV until its plug-in battery capacity is depleted; at which point its gasoline engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle's range. The charging of PHEVs (including EREVs) and BEVs will have different impacts to the electric grid, depending on the number of vehicles and the start time for charging. Initially, the lecture will start analyzing the electrical power requirements for charging PHEVs-BEVs in Flanders region (Belgium) under different charging scenarios. Secondly and based on an activity-based microsimulation mobility model, an efficient method to reduce this impact will be presented...|$|R

The effects of interference on ecophysiological characteristics of Abutilon theophrasti Medic. and three morphologically diverse grain sorghum hybrids was evaluated to determine the relative tolerance and suppressive ability of the three hybrids and specific traits that may contribute to those differences. A tall hybrid was more tolerant to A. theophrasti interference than two <b>medium</b> stature <b>hybrids.</b> Early leaf area growth of two medium-stature sorghum hybrids was reduced by A. theophrasti interference, whereas early growth of a tall hybrid was unaffected. The height of A. theophrasti was greater than two moderate-stature hybrids but lower than the tall hybrid. Greatest leaf area density (LD) of the tall sorghum hybrid was above that of A. theophrasti, whereas greatest LD of medium-stature hybrids was below that of the weed. In monoculture, the partitioning of new biomass to various plant organs was similar among sorghum hybrids, whereas the tall sorghum hybrid partitioned less biomass to leaves and more to stems than <b>medium</b> <b>hybrids</b> in mixture.

When the disease symptoms were observed, evaluation of each line and genotype was done based on percentage and severity of the disease symptom.

40|$|International audienceThis paper explores {{from the}} point of view of {{numerical}} analysis a method for solving the acoustic time-harmonic wave equation in a locally non-uniform 2 D waveguide. The multimodal method is based on a spectral description of the acoustic field in each transverse section of the guide, using Fourier-like series. In the case of sound-hard boundaries, the weak point of the method lies in the poor convergence of such series due to a poor approximation of the field near the boundaries. A remedy was proposed by Athanassoulis & Belibassakis (1999, J. Fluid Mech., 389, 275 - 301), where the convergence is improved thanks to the use of enhanced series.
