40|$|A {{project in}} Civil EngineeringThe damage and failure of <b>computer</b> <b>equipment</b> {{typically}} supported by raised access floors in critical data processing facilities could have serious safety and economic implications. Current design provisions provide {{general guidance on}} how to estimate the seismic demand on non-structural elements within a structure. However, the possible lack of conservatism is of particular concern at locations near active faults where the vertical ground motion components have high amplitudes. Through reduced-order simplified modeling of a frame building and its raised access floors and <b>computer</b> <b>equipment,</b> findings are presented on the insufficiencies of current industrial spectra considering a suite of risk-targeted ground motions with both vertical and horizontal components. Excessive seismic axial force demands are found for both access floors and <b>computer</b> <b>equipment.</b> This investigation concludes that caution should be taken for seismic qualification and design of raised access floor and <b>computer</b> <b>equipment</b> systems considering vertical ground motions...|$|R

40|$|Graph-based post {{incident}} {{internal audit}} method of <b>computer</b> <b>equipment</b> is proposed. The {{essence of the}} proposed solution consists in the establishing of relationships among hard disk damps (image), RAM and network. This method is intended for description of information security incident properties during the internal post incident audit of <b>computer</b> <b>equipment.</b> Hard disk damps receiving and formation process {{takes place at the}} first step. It is followed by separation of these damps into the set of components. The set of components includes a large set of attributes that forms the basis for the formation of the graph. Separated data is recorded into the non-relational database management system (NoSQL) that is adapted for graph storage, fast access and processing. Damps linking application method is applied at the final step. The presented method gives the possibility to human expert in information security or computer forensics for more precise, informative internal audit of <b>computer</b> <b>equipment.</b> The proposed method allows reducing the time spent on internal audit of <b>computer</b> <b>equipment,</b> increasing accuracy and informativeness of such audit. The method has a development potential and can be applied along with the other components in the tasks of users’ identification and computer forensics...|$|R
