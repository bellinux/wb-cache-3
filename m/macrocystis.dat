25|$|Canopy kelps {{include the}} largest species and often {{constitute}} floating canopies that {{extend to the}} ocean surface (e.g., <b>Macrocystis</b> and Alaria).|$|E
25|$|The term kelp {{refers to}} marine algae {{belonging}} to the order Laminariales (phylum: Heterokontophyta). Though not considered a taxonomically diverse order, kelps are highly diverse structurally and functionally. The most widely recognized species are the giant kelps (<b>Macrocystis</b> spp.), although numerous other genera such as Laminaria, Ecklonia, Lessonia, Alaria, and Eisenia are described.|$|E
25|$|Black {{abalones}} are herbivorous gastropods, {{and feed}} mostly on drift algae and kelp. Their primary food species {{depend on the}} habitat. In southern California habitats, black abalones are thought to feed on the giant kelp (<b>Macrocystis</b> pyrifera) and feather boa kelp (Egregia menziesii), while in central and northern California habitats they feed on the bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana).|$|E
25|$|Kelps are {{primarily}} associated with temperate and arctic waters worldwide. Of the more dominant genera, Laminaria is mainly associated {{with both sides}} of the Atlantic Ocean and the coasts of China and Japan; Ecklonia is found in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa; and <b>Macrocystis</b> occurs throughout the northeastern and southeastern Pacific Ocean, Southern Ocean archipelagos, and in patches around Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The region with the greatest diversity of kelps (>20 species) is the northeastern Pacific, from north of San Francisco, California, to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Multiple kelp species often co-exist {{within a}} forest; the term {{understory}} canopy {{refers to the}} stipitate and prostrate kelps. For example, a <b>Macrocystis</b> canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the kelps Eisenia and Pterygophora reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these kelps, a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor. Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies. For example, in California, <b>Macrocystis</b> pyrifera forests, the nudibranch Melibe leonina, and skeleton shrimp Caprella californica are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch Brachyistius frenatus, rockfish Sebastes spp., and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; brittle stars and turban snails Tegula spp. are {{closely associated with the}} kelp holdfast, while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and benthic fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various gastropods, and echinoderms live over the encrusting coralline algae. In addition, pelagic fishes and marine mammals are loosely associated with kelp forests, usually interacting near the edges as they visit to feed on resident organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock or sand), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual irradiance dose > 50 E m−2). Especially productive kelp forests {{tend to be}} associated with areas of significant oceanographic upwelling, a process that delivers cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s mixed surface layer. Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column. Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, giant kelp (<b>Macrocystis</b> spp.) can grow as much as 30-60 cm vertically per day. Some species, such as Nereocystis, are annuals, while others such as Eisenia are perennials, living for more than 20 years. In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods, and increased storm frequency.|$|E
500|$|Of {{more than}} a dozen species of Scutellinia, S.scutellata is the most common and widespread, though a {{microscope}} is required to differentiate between some of them. It is also the type species of the genus. It is differentiated from most other Scutellinia by its larger size, and its distinctive [...] "eyelashes". Although David Arora describes S.scutellata as [...] "easily recognizable", it can be mistaken for S.umbrarum (which has a larger fruiting body and larger spores, as well as having shorter, less obvious hairs) S.erinaceus (which is slightly smaller, and orange to yellow in colour, with smooth spores), Cheilymenia crucipila (which is much smaller, with short, pale hairs and spores lacking oil droplets) and Melastiza chateri, which is bright orange with small brown hairs. The [...] "Pennsylvania eyelash cup" [...] (S.pennsylvanica) is a smaller North American version that has smaller hairs and spores that are more coarsely warted than S.scutellata. S.barlae is very similar as well, and can only be reliably distinguished by its roughly spherical ascospores that are typically 17–23µm in diameter. Species from the Lamprospora genus are smaller and hairless. Similar fungi that favour dung over rotting wood include Cheilymenia coprinaria, C. theleboides, and Coprobia granulata while species such as Anthracobia <b>macrocystis,</b> Anthracobia melaloma, Trichophaea abundans, Pyronema omphalodes, Pulvinula carbonaria and Pulvinula archeri are cup fungi that favour burned-over ground.|$|E
