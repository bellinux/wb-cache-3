5|$|The Gliders {{returned}} to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, {{in front of a}} capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders reverse this in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 {{in the first half of}} third, 6–4 in the last half of the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the last half of the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven assists. The loss raised the prospect that Australia <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> the finals at all, but Crispin remained confident that they could.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the possibility that he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E

XLR8Rs Chas Reynolds said that while the album's [...] "narrative ambivalence" [...] <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> Morning/Evening Hebden's most [...] "immediate" [...] record, it lent Morning/Evening a [...] "near infinite replay value". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the album [...] "isn't among the most substantive Four Tet albums, but it does reward repeated casual listening." [...] Angus Finlayson, reviewing the album for Resident Advisor, called the album [...] "the prettiest Four Tet record in some time" [...] and said that [...] "in its best moments, Morning/Evening is perfectly paced."

He wanted to cast unknown actors due to his [...] "phobia of stars", but after considering that he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> another film, he asked Emmanuelle Devos, Irene Jacob and Valeria Golino to appear in the film and they all accepted. Sattouf sought actors who were [...] "ugly ducklings with unusual features, and their own way of talking, of walking" [...] and who could express emotions without [...] "acting". He struggled to find teenage actors who were like their characters and were willing to be filmed in an unflattering way. He said that Vincent Lacoste and Anthony Sonigo were less concerned about their appearances when he showed them a picture of himself as a [...] "very ugly" [...] teenager. Three days before the beginning of principal photography, Lacoste broke his knee at a music concert, and so his resulting limp was added to the character.
