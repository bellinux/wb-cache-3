5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station <b>model</b> <b>will</b> read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the <b>model</b> <b>will</b> not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

40|$|The work {{presents}} {{a research project}} in its first phase of implementation. The research project deals with the manufacturing of architectural models which use new technology, for thermal and lighting investigation and using one heliodon as means of building assessment. The models to be produced will be chosen from built examples of the Modern Architecture of the XX Century. Initially virtual <b>models</b> <b>will</b> be constructed and afterwards the <b>models</b> <b>will</b> be printed in 3 D. Once the three dimensional models were built they will be examined in one heliodon to evaluate their thermal and light performance.

25|$|While posing, a {{model is}} {{expected}} to remain essentially motionless, and usually remains silent. Exact requirements may vary depending upon the artist or instructor, but an experienced <b>model</b> <b>will</b> not speak, wriggle, scratch, or readjust during the pose. To accommodate the physical limitations, a schedule such as 20 to 25 minutes of posing, with five- or ten-minute breaks is observed. These breaks—during which the model usually wears a robe or puts on clothing—allow the model to stretch, relax and attend to other needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} a <b>model</b> <b>will</b> be given, {{at least in}} part, by the degree of {{accuracy}} and precision of the model. An accurate model with relatively poor precision could be useful to study the evolutionary relationships between the structures {{of a set of}} proteins, whereas the rational drug design requires both precise and accurate models. A model that is not accurate, regardless of the degree of precision with which it was obtained will not be very useful.|$|E

25|$|In {{areas of}} {{language}} modeling, there are {{limitations on the}} applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different. When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language <b>model</b> <b>will</b> fare {{in the same way}} as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes. This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.|$|E
25|$|A model {{organism}} is a non-human {{species that}} is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, {{with the expectation}} that discoveries made in the organism <b>model</b> <b>will</b> provide insight into the workings of other organisms. Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason that}} the study of inner models is of {{interest}} is that {{it can be used to}} prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model V of ZF satisfies the continuum hypothesis or the axiom of choice, the inner model L constructed inside the original <b>model</b> <b>will</b> satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.|$|E
