5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> in operations against the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the anemic Italian economy could not support significant naval construction programs. Additionally, Italy had received several modern light cruisers from the defeated Germans and Austro-Hungarians, and these ships formed {{the backbone of}} the Italian cruiser force.|$|E
5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became <b>more</b> <b>useful.</b> In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium-256, the {{chemically}} {{most important}} isotope of mendelevium, decays through electron capture 90.7% {{of the time}} and alpha decay 9.9% of the time. It is most easily detected through the spontaneous fission of its electron-capture daughter fermium-256, but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission, alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium-256 (7.205 and 7.139MeV) can provide <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> identification.|$|E

5|$|One of the <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> {{physical}} properties is the diagnostic chemical {{shift of the}} carbenic carbon atom in the 13C-NMR spectrum. Typically this peak is in the range between 200 and 300 ppm, where few other peaks appear in the 13C-NMR spectrum. An example is shown on the left for a cyclic diaminocarbene which has a carbenic peak at 238 ppm.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the electric potential. Usually expressed in voltspermetre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E
5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified to make them <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount}} of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E

The Amflora potato produces a <b>more</b> industrially <b>useful</b> blend of starches. Cows have been engineered to produce more protein in their milk to facilitate cheese production. Soybeans and canola have been genetically modified to produce more healthy oils. The first commercialised GM food was a tomato that had delayed ripening, increasing its shelf life.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1668 when Angulo y Sandoval's predecessor, Juan de Urtarte, wrote a {{memorandum}} to the King of Spain {{stating that the}} San Antonio de la Eminencia castle was unfit for defense. Several years later (and without proper authorization), Angulo y Sandoval began construction of a fortress that would be <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> {{for the defense of}} the city than the two existing fortifications. The castle underwent several renovations to repair damage caused by severe earthquakes. A 1684 quake severely damaged the castle and another in 1929 left the structure in ruins. The castle was declared a cultural and municipal asset in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} BSD kernels (and those of most modern {{operating}} systems), DragonFly employs a built-in kernel debugger {{to help the}} developers find kernel bugs. Furthermore, , a debug kernel, which makes bug reports <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> for tracking down kernel-related problems, is installed by default, {{at the expense of}} a relatively small quantity of disk space. When a new kernel is installed, the backup copy of the previous kernel and its modules are stripped of their debugging symbols to further minimize disk space usage.|$|E

5|$|Strontium {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E
5|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, {{based on the}} type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and/or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be <b>more</b> <b>useful,</b> the FAB system is still widely used.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of {{blood vessels in the}} skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory would find additional support if Torosaurus was found to be the mature form of Triceratops, as this would mean the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> for display than defense.|$|E

5|$|The {{response}} from non-governmental organizations {{has been more}} favorable.

The study overseen by the MWBP was cited in an academic journal and submitted to an international conference. Living River Siam's spokesperson Pianporn Deetes was invited to a United Nations Environment Programme conference on dams.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> to humans. It {{makes it possible}} to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E

He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. He understands that his administrative skill is <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Barrow became {{manager of}} the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players during World War I, Barrow {{encouraged}} owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia Athletics for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). During the season, Barrow feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined Barrow's leadership. The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also a great power hitter, Barrow had Ruth pinch hit on days when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. When Ruth told Barrow that he could only pitch or hit, Barrow decided that Ruth's bat was <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher into an outfielder.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December, Eisenhower {{had been}} {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and moved to England. As media attention surrounding the incident began to subside, McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command. Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in Operation Dragoon, but Eisenhower felt his experience would be <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> in the Normandy campaign. Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow-on field army after Bradley's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy; Bradley would then command the resulting army group. Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only {{that he would be}} relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe. In his diary, he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army. On 26 January 1944, formally given command of a newly arrived unit, the Third United States Army, he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit's inexperienced soldiers for combat. This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944.|$|E
