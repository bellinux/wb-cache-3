25|$|Due to {{a severe}} ankle injury that he {{suffered}} during the Celtics pre-season training camp, the franchise {{was no longer}} interested in offering him a contract because Gerald Henderson had taken his place, and his injury would keep him out for the foreseeable future. It was then that Galis decided to pursue a professional career in Greece's Basket League. Later, while playing in Greece, he would be offered NBA contracts by the Celtics and the New Jersey Nets. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, FIBA did not have professional status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the national team level. Since playing for the Greek national team <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> him, he stayed in Greece.

Between 1925 and 1935, the General Education Board appropriated over $5million to Black {{liberal arts colleges}} and universities. Immediately after the announcement of Rosenwald's gift, McKenzie wrote the General Education Board requesting Fisk's inclusion among the recipients of the fund. McKenzie request noted that [...] "colored citizens of the United States constitute not only {{a tenth of the}} population, but are the most needy and least provided for large group in that population." [...] He also highlighted Fisk's unique contribution within Black education, noting that as the nation's largest private Black university, Fisk [...] "hopes that the quality of its work and the correctness of its ideals will also justify you in providing an adequate endowment for its teacher salaries." [...] After suggesting that a $1,000 annual increase for fifty of Fisk's faculty would help secure and retain [...] "the best possible teachers," [...] McKenzie requested that Fisk be granted [...] "at least a million dollars for teachers' salaries," [...] and declaring [...] "we believe that this institution that has <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the nation should be placed in the front ranks of those to be endowed by Mr. Rockefeller." [...] In May 1920, the General Education Board granted Fisk $500,000 towards a campaign of $1million [...] "to be set aside and maintained inviolate by Fisk University as endowment, the income to be used in providing permanently or increases in teachers' salaries. Fisk was to raise matching funds of $500,000 including a condition that Fisk raise $50,000 in Nashville. As a result, McKenzie engaged with White community groups more fully than any previous Fisk president, becoming a member of the Kiwanis Club, the Chamber of Commerce, {{and the director of the}} Community Chest. He attended luncheons, hosted groups on Fisk's campus and frequently spoke at organizational gatherings. A calculated strategy, his outreach led to [...] "white friendship for the school that was stronger than during any preceding administration." [...] Despite the challenges, McKenzie eventually succeeded, with the significant help of Kate Trawick, a Fisk trustee and leader in Nashville's YWCA [...] movement, in securing the $50,000 from Nashville required as part of the campaign, including $2,500 from the Community Chest of Nashville.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E

60|$|There was {{misunderstanding}} on both sides. The Indians naturally {{supposed that}} their own country belonged to them, and the colonists supposed that their eastern and western borders were the two oceans. These were commonly the boundaries which the English king had given them; {{and when he had}} not been quite clear about it in his grants of territory which he had never even imagined, they did not allow him to deal less splendidly with them than such a prince ought. He had, as we know, given the Ohio Company of Virginia a large tract of the best land beyond the Ohio even while the French still claimed the West, and he had encouraged the Virginians to believe they had a right to settle it and to fortify it. But after the capture of Quebec, when the West, as well as Canada, fell into the power of Great Britain, the English king, or rather his ministers, began to change their minds about letting the colonists take up lands in the Back Country, as they called it. The jealousy between the colonies grew less, but the jealousy between them and Great Britain grew greater; there were outbreaks here and there against her rule, and there was discontent nearly everywhere. The colonists were disappointed and embittered that the West should be treated as a part of Canada, by the mother country, when it ought to have been shared among the English provinces. The British government tried to hinder the settlement of the whites on the Indians' lands; and though it could not keep them off altogether, it did enough to make the savages feel that it was their friend against its own subjects. In 1774, Parliament passed a law which declared the whole West, between the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and below the Great Lakes, a part of the Province of Quebec. This was felt by our colonies to be so great an injury that it was charged against Great Britain in the Declaration of Independence, as one of the causes for separation. It was in fact an act hostile to a people of the British race, language, and religion, and it was <b>meant</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> help the savages, as to hurt the colonists, though it did really help the savages. When the Revolutionary War broke out a year or two later, the British government did not scruple {{to make use of the}} cruel hatred of the Indians against its rebellious subjects.|$|R
40|$|Integrated High-Fidelity Planetary Mission Simulators: A Toolkit for Fidelity Evaluation Susmita Mohanty Department of Architecture Chalmers University of Technology ABSTRACT Future {{missions}} to deep space or other planets will {{rely heavily on}} Planetary Mission Simulators. Simulators {{will be used to}} replicate the experience and conditions of such missions as faithfully as possible within terrestrial constraints. Past simulators have largely been partial simulators. They have chosen, perhaps because of complexity, time and cost, to reproduce only a subset of a complete mission. Thus, there exists neither enough literature on high-fidelity integrated full mission simulators nor guidelines and templates on how to set about designing and building one. The primary goal of this doctoral research is to start filling that void - by proposing a holistic, three-part Fidelity Evaluation Framework: (1) The first is a set of four Checklists spanning key domains of simulator design and operation [...] architectural, operational, environmental, and psychological. These Checklists specify various aspects of simulator fidelity for an integrated full mission simulator. Further, for each aspect, the Checklists specify key criteria that need to be met or accounted for. Using these lists, a simulator can be designed, and then evaluated at every stage of development. (2) The second is a Baseline Mission Visualization Tool that helps represent all parts of a reference mission and their interactions using a schematic. Such a schematic lets the simulator team clearly visualize, understand, discuss and track constituent parts of an integrated simulator and their interactions during all phases of simulator design and operations. (3) The third tool facilitates studies of Trade-Offs intrinsic to simulator design and operations, such as between size and weight, and those brought about by resource constraints such as size and duration of project funds. A broad-based, empirical approach was used in this research to cast a wide net on all aspects of the design and implementation of simulators. The case study method was the dominant methodology employed in the research. An exhaustive survey of past, present and planned simulators was used to understand the historical simulator landscape. Survey data collected from simonauts of different simulators, fidelity data from simonaut diaries, and data from European Space Agency (ESA) studies was triangulated for the first order Fidelity Evaluation Checklist, which was then refined using insights from Simulation Managers of eight different simulation campaigns. A Baseline Mission Visualization Tool and Trade-Off Studies were proposed based on a design study for an integrated full mission simulator that the author and her colleagues conducted for ESA. Ultimately, the framework itself was validated by applying it to a full mission case study simulator. The framework developed is a toolkit for simulator system architects, simulation planners, managers, operators and controllers. It is <b>meant</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be a definitive work as a useful and practical, application-centric beginning in a hitherto unexplored area. It is expected that users of this framework will further develop and improve upon these ideas based on their observations and experiences. Language: English.
