As {{it became clear that}} the Senators could not finance a needed highway interchange without government backing, the Government of Ontario was persuaded successfully to provide a $27 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> for the highway interchange construction. In the end, the firm of Ogden Entertainment, a New York City facilities management firm, backed the project with a $20 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> in exchange for a 30-year contract to manage the facility. In addition, American banks loaned $110 million, the federal government gave the Senators $6 million, $10 million from Terrace and $15 million from a Canadian pension fund.|$|E

By the end of 1996, speculation was rampant that if the NFL placed a franchise in Toronto, it would {{mean the end of}} the CFL.

5|$|By 1960, the Cold War raged {{between two}} superpowers: the United States, a {{capitalist}} liberal democracy, and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist–Leninist socialist state {{ruled by the}} Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist–Leninist states. Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, fibers, and hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100 <b>million</b> <b>loan.</b> Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries – then controlled by the U.S. corporations Shell and Esso – to process Soviet oil, but under U.S. pressure, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E

5|$|With the {{extension}} to Paddington still under construction, the LER published {{a bill in}} November 1911 for the continuation to Queen's Park. The extension was to continue north from Paddington, running past Little Venice to Maida Vale before curving north-west to Kilburn and then west to parallel the LNWR main line, {{before coming to the}} surface a short distance to the east of Queen's Park station. Three intermediate stations were to be provided: on Warwick Avenue at the junction with Warrington Avenue, Clifton Villas and Clifton Gardens; at the junction of Elgin and Randolph Avenues (named Maida Vale); and on Cambridge Avenue (named Kilburn Park). The LNWR gave a £1 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> to the LER at 4% interest in perpetuity to help finance {{the extension}}. The bill received royal assent on 7 August 1912 as the London Electric Railway Act, 1912.|$|E
5|$|The club held an {{architecture}} competition, and received six bids. On 28 September 2005, Start Toppfotball {{announced that they}} had selected the design by Kjell Kosberg from Kosbergs Arkitektkontor, who had previously designed Aker Stadion and Briskeby Arena. The default proposal contained a spectator capacity for 9,948 people, but the plans were scalable, allowing for increased capacity if the club so wanted. Ernst Ravnaas, co-owner of the club, stated that given the recent high attendance, he {{wanted to build a}} larger stadium than the default proposal. Financing was planned with a free lot from Kristiansand Municipality, a NOK40 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> from the municipality, a NOK20 million grant from Cultiva, a municipal culture fund, NOK20 in value added tax refund, NOK10 to 20 million in naming rights, the sale of commercial property, NOK30 to 40 million in a bank loan, and the remaining with share capital from Start Toppfotball.|$|E

That week Benfica made more squad adjustments, paying €5million for 18-year old Sidnei and releasing Petit after six years with the club. Early in August, Benfica won the Cidade de Guimarães Trophy against Paris Saint-Germain and Vitória de Guimarães, drawing with the former and defeating the latter. Before their presentation match with Feyenoord, Benfica signed Spanish winger José Antonio Reyes in a €2.6 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> deal.

5|$|Start won the 2012 Norwegian First Division {{and were}} {{promoted}} to the top league for their 2013 season. Start Stadion {{had been involved in}} a legal suit with the Norwegian Tax Administration over whether value added tax was to be paid for the stadium's naming rights. The company lost the case both in Agder Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, resulting in the company having to pay NOK9 million in taxes. As the company did not have such values, it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013. At the time the company had a debt of NOK107 million. At the time the municipality has commenced negotiations with Sparebanken Sør to purchase the stadium. Football economist Tor Geir Kvinen stated that Sparebanken Sør had by then spent NOK200 million on subsidizing Start and that in reality the municipality and bank were funding the repeated deficits in the club. The municipality announced a plan in October 2013, whereby they would purchase the bank's NOK54 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> for NOK44 million and receive all the shares in the stadium company. The bank would then buy the naming rights for ten more years for NOK10 million and yet unsold commercial property. The municipality would then be owed NOK64 million by the stadium company, up from NOK46 million.|$|E
5|$|The IND Second System {{proposal}} from 1929 {{estimated that the}} cost of the southern tunnel route from Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, to Fort Hamilton would cost upward of $75,000,000, though the tunnel was not officially part of the subway plans and was illustrated as a vehicular tunnel on the map of the plans. Many of the proposals were part of this ambitious expansion plan, which would have connected the tunnel to the IND South Brooklyn Line (today's IND Culver Line). An updated proposal in 1931 had the connection to the IND at the current Smith-Ninth Streets station, with the tunnel traveling north from Staten Island through Red Hook and Gowanus. Yet another update, from 1933, was projected to cost $45,000,000, running the original route between Saint George and 67th Street in Bay Ridge. The line would then run on Second Avenue north through the Bay Ridge Flats on Brooklyn's western shore, meeting up with the Culver Line near Hamilton Avenue (the current Gowanus Expressway) between the Smith-Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue stations; it was suggested that the Hylan tunnel shafts be used. An application for a $47 <b>million</b> <b>loan</b> for this extension was approved by the Board of Estimate in 1937.|$|E

Under Treasurys Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), initiated in early 2009, servicers have modified almost 1 <b>million</b> <b>loans</b> between 2009 and 2011. During the same period, servicers modified nearly 1 <b>million</b> additional <b>loans</b> under programs administered by the Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Veterans Affairs (VA), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the enterprises). Servicers have also modified about 2. 1 <b>million</b> <b>loans</b> under nonfederal loan modification programs resulting in a total of about 4 million modifications between 2009 and 2011. However, a large number of borrowers have sought assistance, but were unable to receive a modification. For example, approximately 2. 8 million borrowers had their HAMP loan modification application denied or their trial loan modification canceled. Further, the volume of federal modifications has declined since 2010. Recent efforts have expanded refinancing programs. However, low participation rates in FHAs program raise questions about the need for Treasurys financial support, which could reach a maximum of $ 117 million. ...|$|R
