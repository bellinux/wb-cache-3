The instrumented telephone line damaged in the K-3 test went from Zhezqazghan through Qaraghandy (Karaganda), northward to Aqmola (now called Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan) and ended at an unknown location just north of Aqmola.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} has been presented to integrate command to line-of-sight (CLOS) guidance and proportional navigation (PN) guidance {{in order to reduce}} miss distance and to increase the effectiveness of surface to air missiles. Initially a comparison of command to line-of-sight guidance and proportional navigation has been presented. Miss distance, variation of angle-of-attack, normal and lateral accelerations and error of <b>missile</b> <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> from direct line-of-sight have been used as noteworthy criteria for comparison of the two guidance laws. Following this comparison a new {{approach has}} been proposed for determining the most suitable guidance gains in order to minimize miss distance and improve accuracy of the missile in delivering the warhead, while using CLOS guidance. This proposed technique is based on constrained nonlinear minimization to optimize the guidance gains. CLOS guidance has a further limitation of significant increase in normal and lateral acceleration demands during the terminal phase of missile flight. Furthermore, at large elevation angles, the required angle-of-attack during the terminal phase increases beyond design specifications. Subsequently, a missile with optical sensors only and following just the CLOS guidance has less likelihood to hit high speed targets beyond 45 º in elevation plane. A novel approach has thus been proposed to overcome such limitations of CLOS-only guidance for surface to air missiles. In this approach, an integrated guidance algorithm has been proposed whereby the initial guidance law during rocket motor burnout phase remains CLOS, whereas immediately after this phase, the guidance law is automatically switched to PN guidance. This integrated approach has not only resulted in slight increase in range of the missile but also has significantly improved its likelihood to hit targets beyond 30 degrees in elevation plane, thus successfully overcoming various limitations of CLOS-only guidance approach. Hence, proposing an approach to determine most suitable gains for CLOS guidance and integration of CLOS and PN guidance for enhanced effectiveness and accuracy of surface to air missiles are the two significant contributions of this work...|$|E

50|$|Analysis of {{telemetry}} data {{confirmed that}} the Atlas had malfunctioned due to hot exhaust gases being recirculated into the thrust section, which burned through wiring and caused loss of thrust, combined with high vibration levels. The pneumatic system also malfunctioned as tank pressure never properly transitioned to in-flight levels and along with propellant flow and pressure steadily decreased during ascent. The flight was considered a partial success because the missile had otherwise performed well. In particular, the Atlas's inflated balloon structure, which engineers doubted would even fly at all, had held together as the <b>missile</b> tumbled.

50|$|The Predator was a fire-and-forget weapon {{utilizing}} a pre-launch system where the gunner tracked the target three seconds before launch {{and the internal}} system measured target speed and direction and was {{used in conjunction with}} known <b>missile</b> <b>flight</b> performance to predict where the target would be when the missile {{was in a position to}} intercept. The <b>missile's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> would overfly the target aim point. A dual laser and magnetic sensor would detect the target and trigger the detonation of the warhead. The laser sensor would locate the positions of the leading and trailing edges of the tank, and the magnetic sensor would provide confirmation of the position of the tank. The missile also used an inertial guidance unit to guide the weapon over the predicted intercept point, compensating for crosswind and launcher motion (the launcher may be mounted on or fired from a vehicle). For direct attacks the missile acted as an unguided, flattened trajectory, line-of-sight weapon and the warhead detonates on impact.|$|R

Most antitank SACLOS systems such as Milan and TOW use a strobe or flare (visible, infrared (IR) or ultraviolet (UV) light) in the tail of the missile with an appropriate sensor on the firing post, to track the <b>missile's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>path.</b> The launching station incorporates a tracking camera with two lenses. A wide field of view lens that locates and [...] "gathers" [...] the missile {{near the center of the}} gunners line of sight immediately after launch, and a narrow view lens with automatic zoom that accomplishes the fine tracking adjustments. In most configurations, the narrow field camera utilizes electronics that translate the brightest spot in the view - the flare or strobe of the missile - into an electrical impulse. This impulse changes as the missile leaves the center of the field of view, and the electronics automatically apply a correction instruction in the opposite direction of the change to re-center the missile.|$|R

50|$|So far, the Atlas F {{test program}} had gone well {{and nobody was}} {{prepared}} for the upcoming disaster on April 9, 1962 when Missile 11F exploded only one second after liftoff from LC-11. Subsequent investigation found that the sustainer LOX turbopump exploded due to the impeller blades rubbing against the metal casing and causing a spark that ignited the LOX. This failure mode also occurred in two static firing tests of the MA-3 engines, and it led to a plastic liner being added to the turbopump casing. Testing now began at Vandenberg AFB and Missile 15F flew successfully from 576-E on August 1. Nine days later, Missile 57F launched from OSTF-1 and failed to perform its roll maneuver. The pitch sequence was executed properly, {{but the lack of}} the roll program prevented the missile from attaining the correct trajectory and it was blown up by Range Safety 67 seconds into the launch. An electrical short in the programmer was found to be the cause, although the specific failure point was not determined. The roll signal had been extremely weak and barely enough to have any effect, as a consequence the <b>missile's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> was about 53° {{to the right of the}} planned trajectory. The next test launch took place from the now-repaired LC-11 at the Cape two days later and all subsequent R&D flights went without a hitch except for 13F on November 14 which experienced a thrust section fire at liftoff that led to sustainer shutdown. The booster engines retained attitude control until BECO, at which point the absence of sustainer thrust resulted in immediate missile tumbling and loss of the mission. The cause of the thrust section fire was unknown, however a fuel leak was suspected. The next launch, Missile 21F, successfully concluded the R&D phase of the Atlas F program.|$|R
40|$|How {{to develop}} a novel missile {{guidance}} law that can act effectively against very high speed incoming targets, such as ballistic missiles, {{has been a major}} concern in the defense technique. It has been unveiled recently in the literature that the most effective way for a lower speed interceptor to successfully engage an incoming target with very high speed is to limit the aspect angle between the <b>missile</b> and target <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> to within 180 degrees plus or minus few degrees. On the basis of this requirement, a new integrated fuzzy guidance law is developed in this paper against very high-speed maneuverable targets on three-dimensional space. An integrated fuzzy type guidance law is explored for midcourse and terminal phases. It is shown that the integrated guidance scheme offers excellent tracking performance as well as performance sensitivity with respect to some parametric variations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: When {{deriving}} {{an objective}} assessment of piloting performance from flight data records, {{it is common}} to employ metrics which purely evaluate errors in <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> parameters. The adequacy of pilot performance is evaluated from the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> of the aircraft. However, in large jet transport aircraft these measures may be insensitive and require supplementing with frequency-based measures of control input parameters. Method: <b>Flight</b> <b>path</b> and control input data were collected from pilots undertaking a jet transport aircraft conversion course during a series of symmetric and asymmetric approaches in a flight simulator. The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> data were analyzed for deviations around the optimum <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> while flying an instrument landing approach. Manipulation of the flight controls was subject to analysis using a series of power spectral density measures. Results: The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> metrics showed no significant differences in performance between the symmetric and asymmetric approaches.
