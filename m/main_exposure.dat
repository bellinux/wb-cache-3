2500|$|Gold {{and copper}} values occupy a northeast-trending iron {{formation}} within the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. This mineralization is only known to exist southeast of Cooke Lake and immediately south of Net Lake. A unit of chert, magnetite and pyrrhotite outcrops along the southwest shore of Net Lake at Temagami North. Pyrrhotite, {{the most common}} sulfide mineral, occurs as small veins and disseminations. Small amounts of pyrite, sphalerite and exsolved pentlandite and chalcopyrite are present with the pyrrhotite. The <b>main</b> <b>exposure</b> lies immediately south of the Kanichee Mine Road, which branches off Highway 11. Minor gold and copper values constitute this zone. This sulfide-bearing unit is located within felsic volcanic rocks of the Older Volcanic Complex and is capped by large, dark green, iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. It has been interpreted that the sulfide zone represents a volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit based {{on the structure of}} the sulfide zone and the associated rock types. These ore deposits are created by volcanic-associated hydrothermal events in submarine environments. However, there is evidence that the sulfide mineralization does not have a volcanogenic origin. An unusual feature of this sulfide deposit is the large degree of magnetite at the actual showing. Studies have shown that the chert-magnetite iron formations in the West and North Pits of Sherman Mine extend under and along a series of small lakes from Vermillion Lake to Net Lake. These iron formations are located at roughly the same stratigraphic position as the magnetite-bearing iron formation on the southwestern shore of Net Lake. A northwest-trending cross fault is accompanied by drag folding of a chert-magnetite iron formation unit southeast of Cooke Lake. Also exposed in this area is a dark yellow [...] wide quartz vein composed of pyrite that cross cuts the iron formation at the northeastern end.

30|$|The <b>main</b> <b>exposures</b> of {{interest}} in this analysis are diet quality, physical activity, sedentary behaviour (or screen time) and body weight. On the basis of students’ nutrient intake and dietary information from the YAQ and Canadian Nutrient Files (Health Canada 2007), we calculated intake of nutrients and daily energy intake, as well as number of daily servings of fruits and vegetables. We then calculated a Diet Quality Index (DQI) score based on the composite measure, DQI-international (DQI-I) (Kim et al. 2003). The DQI-I constitutes four components: variety, adequacy, moderation and overall balance of the diet (Kim et al. 2003). The DQI-I score ranges between 0 and 100, with a higher score indicating a better diet quality. We divided the DQI-I score into tertiles (low, middle, high) in the analysis.|$|R

An examination of relevant articles in PubMed (1960 – 2012) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs revealed that 26 cancer sites, such as mesothelioma, nasal, larynx, liver, ovarian cancer, bone sarcoma, and hematopoietic malignancies were consistently linked to occupational factors. <b>Main</b> <b>exposures</b> included asbestos, wood dust, metals/metalloids, formaldehyde, benzene, vinyl chloride, and radiation. There was inconsistent evidence regarding 22 rare malignancies. We did not identify relevant data for 19 rare cancers.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} exposure on initiation of tobacco use among adolescents. DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, ABI/INFORM, and Business Source Premier through October/November 2005 was conducted. Unpublished studies were solicited from researchers. STUDY SELECTION: Of 401 citations initially identified, 51 (n = 141 949 participants) met the inclusion criteria: reporting on exposure and tobacco use outcomes and participants younger than 18 years. Included studies reported 146 effects; 89 were conceptually independent effects. Data were extracted independently by 3 of us using a standardized tool. Weighted averages were calculated using a linear mixed-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. <b>Main</b> <b>Exposures</b> Exposures (tobacco advertising, promotions, and samples and pro-tobacco depictions in films, television, and videos) were categorized as low or high engagement based {{on the degree of}} psychological involvement required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were categorized as cognitive (attitudes or intentions) or behavioral (initiation, tobacco use status, or progression of use). RESULTS: Exposure to pro-tobacco marketing and media increases the odds of youth holding positive attitudes toward tobacco use (odds ratio, 1. 51; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 08 - 2. 13) and more than doubles the odds of initiating tobacco use (odds ratio, 2. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 79 - 2. 77). Highly engaging marketing and media are more effective at promoting use (odds ratio, 2. 67; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 19 - 3. 25). These effects are observed across time, in different countries, with different study designs and measures of exposure and outcome.
