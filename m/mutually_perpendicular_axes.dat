5000|$|Attitude {{control is}} the {{exercise}} {{of control over the}} orientation of an object with respect to an inertial frame of reference or another entity (the celestial sphere, certain fields, nearby objects, etc.). The attitude of a craft can be described using three <b>mutually</b> <b>perpendicular</b> <b>axes</b> of rotation, generally referred to as roll, pitch, and yaw angles respectively (with the roll axis in line with the primary engine direction of thrust). Orientation can be determined by calibration using an external guidance system, such as determining the angles to a reference star or the Sun, then internally monitored using an inertial system of mechanical or optical gyroscopes. Orientation is a vector quantity described by three angles for the instantaneous direction, and the instantaneous rates of roll in all three axes of rotation. The aspect of control implies both awareness of the instantaneous orientation and rates of roll and the ability to change the roll rates to assume a new orientation using either a reaction control system or other means. Newton's second law, applied to rotational rather than linear motion, becomes: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{anisotropic}} magnetoresistance {{effect of}} Permalloy (Ni 0. 82 Fe 0. 18) {{is used in}} a contactless angle detector. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in a Permalloy thin film causes {{a difference between the}} direction of magnetization and the magnetic field direction. This leads to a systematic error in the angle detector output. The effects of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy can be reduced by using Permalloy multilayers with different orientations of their anisotropy axes. A double layer with <b>mutually</b> <b>perpendicular</b> anisotropy <b>axes</b> is found to be sufficient for application in an angle detector.
