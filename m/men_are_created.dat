5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|Tensions {{erupted into}} battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British {{attempted}} {{to capture and}} destroy Colonial military supplies at Lexington and Concord in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in {{what became known as}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal.|$|E
500|$|With the antislavery {{movement}} gaining momentum, {{defenders of}} slavery such as John Randolph and John C. Calhoun {{found it necessary}} to argue that the Declaration's assertion that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people. During the debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1853, for example, Senator John Pettit of Indiana argued that the statement [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] was not a [...] "self-evident truth" [...] but a [...] "self-evident lie". Opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, including Salmon P. Chase and Benjamin Wade, defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.|$|E
500|$|Like Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln {{argued that}} the Declaration of Independence was a {{founding}} document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified {{more than a decade}} after the Declaration. The Constitution did not use the word [...] "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: [...] "Four score and seven years ago [...] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal." ...|$|E

These include the Haitian declaration of January 1, 1804 during the Haitian Revolution, the United Provinces of New Granada in 1811, the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816, the Chilean Declaration of Independence in 1818, Costa Rica in 1821, El Salvador in 1821, Guatemala in 1821, Honduras in (1821), Mexico in 1821, Nicaragua in 1821, Peru in 1821, Bolivian War of Independence in 1825, Uruguay in 1825, Ecuador in 1830, Colombia in 1831, Paraguay in 1842, Dominican Republic in 1844, Texas Declaration of Independence in March 1836, California Republic in November 1836, Hungarian Declaration of Independence in 1849, Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand in 1835, and the Czechoslovak declaration of independence from 1918 drafted in Washington D.C. with Gutzon Borglum among the drafters. The Rhodesian declaration of independence, ratified in November 1965, {{is based on the}} American one as well; however, it omits the phrases [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] and [...] "the consent of the governed". The [...] from December 1860 also mentions the U.S. Declaration of Independence, though it, like the Rhodesian one, omits references to [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] and [...] "consent of the governed".|$|E
500|$|In October 1859, {{abolitionist}} John Brown and sympathizers {{raided the}} federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia). Tensions in Washington between pro- and anti-slavery forces increased greatly. Johnson gave a major {{speech in the}} Senate in December, decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery. The Tennessee senator stated that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] from the Declaration of Independence {{did not apply to}} African Americans, since the Constitution of Illinois contained that phrase—and that document barred voting by African Americans.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideals of}} the French Revolution of 1789 spread across Europe and the Americas as well. The {{overthrow}} and execution of King LouisXVI and Queen Marie Antoinette ended centuries of monarchy and removed the privileges of the nobility. Liberal ideals {{in the political and}} economic fields developed and spread through the Atlantic Revolutions across most of the Western world. The concept of the divine right of kings was questioned by the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, by the oft-quoted statement that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] in the United States Declaration of Independence and even by the Spanish church.|$|E

500|$|The {{apparent}} {{contradiction between}} {{the claim that}} [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] {{and the existence of}} American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Great Britain's role in the slave trade, but this was deleted from the final version. [...] Jefferson himself was a prominent Virginia slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves. Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist Thomas Day wrote in a 1776 letter, [...] "If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves."(2) [...] At: : : [...]|$|E
500|$|In 272 words, {{and three}} minutes, Lincoln {{asserted}} {{the nation was}} born not in 1789, but in 1776, [...] "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was {{now part of the}} national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end {{as a result of the}} losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that [...] "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.|$|E

500|$|The {{meaning of}} the Declaration was a {{recurring}} topic in the famed debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify {{the independence of the}} United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any [...] "inferior or degraded race". Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. [...] "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere," [...] he said. During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration: ...|$|E
500|$|The Senate {{campaign}} {{featured the}} seven Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858, {{the most famous}} political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that [...] "The Slave Power" [...] was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting {{the values of the}} Founding Fathers that all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal, while Douglas emphasized his Freeport Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Dred Scott decision.|$|E

[...] In so doing, Nellie fails {{to live up to}} the American ideal that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal", which Emile had earlier affirmed. This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, {{initially}} unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word [...] "Polynesian", responds with [...] "colored". [...] This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. [...] As Frank Rich of The New York Times commented, [...] "it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype– she's lovable... But how can we love a racist?"

500|$|The Rhodesian Minister for Justice and Law and Order, Desmond Lardner-Burke, {{presented}} {{the rest of}} the Cabinet with a draft for the declaration of independence on 5 November 1965. When Jack Howman, Minister of Tourism and Information, said that he was also preparing a draft, the Cabinet decided to wait to see his version too. The ministers agreed that if an independence proclamation were issued, they would all sign it. On 9 November, the Cabinet jointly devised an outline for the proclamation document and the accompanying statement to be made by Smith. The final version of the declaration of independence was prepared by a sub-committee of civil servants headed by Gerald Clarke, the Cabinet Secretary, with the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, the only other such proclamation ever issued by British colonials, used as a model. Strongly alluding to Thomas Jefferson's text throughout, the Rhodesians used one phrase —"a respect for the opinions of mankind"—but no reference was made to the assertion that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal", nor to the [...] "consent of the governed", two omissions later stressed by a number of commentators.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish-American {{authorities}} {{banned the}} circulation of the Declaration, but it was widely transmitted and translated: by Venezuelan Manuel García de Sena, by Colombian Miguel de Pombo, by Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte, and by New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler, who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821. [...] The North Ministry did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer John Lind to publish a response entitled Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress. British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of [...] "life, liberty, {{and the pursuit of}} happiness" [...] to African Americans. Thomas Hutchinson, the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal. These pamphlets challenged various aspects of the Declaration. Hutchinson argued that the American Revolution was the work of a few conspirators who wanted independence from the outset, and who had finally achieved it by inducing otherwise loyal colonists to rebel. Lind's pamphlet had an anonymous attack on the concept of natural rights written by Jeremy Bentham, an argument that he repeated during the French Revolution. Both pamphlets asked how the American slaveholders in Congress could proclaim that [...] "all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>created</b> equal" [...] without freeing their own slaves.|$|E
