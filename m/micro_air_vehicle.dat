Michelson was the NATO/RTA (Research and Technology Agency) lecturer at the Turkish Air Force Academy (Hava Harp Okulu) in Istanbul in 2006, and invited lecturer on <b>Micro</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Vehicle</b> technology at both the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (1999 & 2003) and the Royal Military Academy (2001) in Brussels.

500|$|Michelson {{directed}} various efforts {{pertaining to}} future transportation. His team invented battery-state-of-charge estimation techniques, developed electric vehicle systems simulation tools, and experimented with actively blown surfaces on passenger vehicles. During the mid-1990s, Michelson's research {{began to focus}} almost entirely on unmanned vehicle systems, especially those {{with the power of}} flight. [...] He directed efforts with both U.S. Government agencies and private industry pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles systems (UAS). [...] One of his first UAS development programs was for a traffic surveillance drone using a compound ducted fan design, made to fly over Atlanta's highways in order to fill surveillance gaps in the State's tower-mounted traffic camera system. [...] It also could be sent to traffic accident locations to gather and relay vital information in advance of first-responder arrival. Funding shortfalls resulted in the cancellation of the project before its maiden flight, but the design was later marketed for military use. [...] Michelson's focus turned to smaller vehicle systems that could fly indoors autonomously without the aid of global positioning system (GPS) reference signals. [...] Under various contracts to DARPA and the Air Force, and using internal research and development funds from the Georgia Tech Research Institute, his design team designed a <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> (MAV) known as the entomopter. [...] The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts recognized the unique flight qualities of the entomopter and awarded Michelson two contracts to explore the feasibility of the entomopter for slow flight in Mars' lower atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|From 1971 to 1973 Michelson was a {{research}} engineer working on aerospace radar systems at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C. [...] He spent the next 30years in various engineering and management capacities within the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Atlanta, Georgia. [...] During the 1970s and 1980s Michelson primarily developed radar signal processing and control hardware, but was also interested in the automation of remote sensing systems ranging from the tracking of endangered species {{to the creation of}} realistic soldier training scenarios and simulation and testing of foreign military radar assets. In the late 1980s he became Head of the Georgia Tech Research Institute's Technology Development Division and his interests turned to unmanned aerial vehicle systems as a fusion of autonomy, information technology, and aeronautics. [...] In particular, [...] "aerial robotics" [...] (a term he coined in 1990 to represent the infusion of cognition into unmanned aerial vehicles) dominated his research for the next two decades. Since the mid-1990s, Michelson's work has concentrated on biologically inspired <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicle</b> design. [...] From 1997 through 2004 Michelson was adjunct associate professor to the School of Aerospace Engineering, teaching classes in avionics for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [...] and Micro/Mini Air Vehicle (MAV) design. Michelson retired from the Georgia Tech Research Institute in September 2004 and currently holds the title of Principal Research Engineer Emeritus with the Institute. [...] In 2004 he created Millennial Vision, LLC to continue research into biologically inspired aerial robots and remote sensing.

40|$|Flapping {{flight is}} {{considered}} from {{the perspectives of}} the history of human-powered aviation and the relatively recent technological developments in <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Propulsion and control issues are examined for three types of aircraft configuration; fixed wing, rotating wing and flapping. The typical flight environment of nature&# 039;s fliers and <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles</b> is documented and shown to be characterised by relatively high levels of turbulence inherent in the lower levels of the atmospheric boundary layer. This highly dynamic environment can result in large rolling moment inputs which reduce only slightly as wingspans reduce, whereas the resistance to roll inputs decreases rapidly with wingspan. It was concluded that flapping wing propulsion is not beneficial for <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles</b> per se but the high level of control authority afforded by large wing movements is useful in countering the effects of turbulence and for precise control...|$|R

In this letter, harvesting energy from the wing morphing is studied to power cameras, sensors, or communication devices of <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles</b> and {{to aid in the}} management of their power. The aerodynamic loads on flapping wings are simulated using a three-dimensional unsteady vortex lattice method. Active wing shape morphing is considered to enhance the performance of the flapping motion. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used to pinpoint the optimal kinematics maximizing the propellent efficiency. To benefit from the wing deformation, we place piezoelectric layers near the wing roots. Gauss law is used to estimate the electrical harvested power. We demonstrate that enough power can be generated to operate a camera. Numerical analysis shows the feasibility of exploiting wing morphing to harvest energy and improving the design and performance of <b>micro</b> <b>air</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

In particular, optical flow, inspired by flying insects, {{is used to}} perceive vehicle movement {{with respect to the}} surroundings or sense changes in the environment. However, optical flow does not directly provide us the distance to an object or velocity, but the ratio of them. Thus, using optical flow in control involves nonlinearity problems which add complexity to the controller. To deal with that, we propose an algorithm that estimates distance and velocity of the vehicle based on optical flow measured from a monocular camera and the knowledge of control inputs. This algorithm applies an extended Kalman filter to state estimation and uses the estimates for landing control. We implement and test our algorithm in computer simulation and on board a Parrot AR.
