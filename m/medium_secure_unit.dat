40|$|BACKGROUND: Offenders with {{personality}} disorder represent a considerable burden {{on mental health}} and criminal justice services. Millfields Unit {{was one of the}} pilot <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>units</b> (MSUs) established by the UK Department of Health and Ministry of Justice to provide dedicated services for such individuals. AIMS: Our study aimed to describe a complete cohort of referrals made to the service and to explore decisions on admissions to the Unit. METHODS: File review was used to collect a structured data set of information on the first 158 referrals. These were then analysed descriptively and inferentially. RESULTS: Previous psychological treatment in prison and evidence of motivation for further treatment were the strongest predictors of admission to the service. People admitted showed evidence of more extensive criminal histories, prior treatment failure and higher level of risk than those accepted into conventional <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>units.</b> Despite the stated purpose of the units being for people with {{personality disorder}}, a high number of patients with a primary diagnosis of psychotic illness were referred.

40|$|Background Risk {{assessment}} of future violent acts {{is of great}} importance for both public protection and care planning. Structured clinical assessments offer a method by which accurate assessments could be achieved. Aims To test {{the efficacy of the}} Historical, Clinical and Risk Management Scales (HCR– 20) structured risk assessment scheme on a large sample of male forensic psychiatric patients discharged from <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>units</b> in the UK. Method In a pseudo-prospective study, 887 male patients were followed for at least 2 years. The HCR– 20 was completed using only pre-discharge information, and violent and other offending behaviour post-discharge was obtained from official records. Results The HCR– 20 total score was a good predictor of both violent and other offences following discharge. The historical and risk sub-scales were both able to predict offences, but the clinical sub-scale did not produce significant predictions. The predictive efficacy was highest for short periods (under 1 year) and showed a modest fall in efficacy over longer periods (5 years). Conclusions The results provide a strong evidence base that the HCR– 20 is a good predictor of both violent and non-violent offending following release from <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>units</b> for male forensic psychiatric patients in the UK...|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s {{the number of}} {{patients}} had greatly declined, largely due to the recommendations of the Mental Health Act (1983) with its emphasis on care in the community. Following a gradual winding down of hospital services and operations, the entire hospital {{with the exception of a}} small secure unit had closed by late 1991. The secure unit moved into what had been the Coulsdon Cottage Hospital: in 2006 it held 23 patients and was run by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM). The unit closed in February 2008, with the patients and staff being transferred to the River House, a new <b>Medium</b> <b>Secure</b> <b>Unit</b> at Bethlem Royal Hospital.|$|E
50|$|After closure, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} fell into rapid decline, suffering from arson, vandalism and theft. By 2003 the site had become popular with urban explorers who came to document the vast abandoned complex. In mid-2010, work began to clear the site for new housing. Only {{a few of the}} original buildings now remain, although the Ashen Hill secure unit continued to operate on site until early 2012. Another low secure unit is on the site known as Southview which was opened in 1995. The new <b>Medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>unit,</b> known as The Hellingly Centre opened in April 2012, with 46 beds split between 3 wards at a cost of £17.5 million. Plans are underway for more units alongside the new housing.|$|E
25|$|The {{general public}} are {{familiar}} with the names of the High Secure Hospitals due to the frequency that they are mentioned in the news reports about the people who are sent there.

40|$|Background: It {{is thought}} that women are {{responsible}} for {{a small minority of}} recorded crime, especially violent offences. Popular explanations of female crime reify social constructions of gender, and draw on discourses of femininity. These powerful discourses dictate female behaviour, and imply that 'proper' women cannot be violent as it is not in accordance with their gender role. Little is known about the effect of these discourses on how women who have committed a violent offence see themselves. Aim: To explore how women in a <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>unit</b> talk about femininity. Particular attention was paid to the consequences of their talk, such as how they position themselves and other women, and the possibilities for action and resistance from these positions. Methods: Seven one-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with women detained under the Mental Health Act (1983) in a <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>unit.</b> Foucauldian Discourse Analysis was utilised to analyse the data. Results: Four discourses were generated from the data; difficulties in existing as women in a "man's world", motherhood as a natural role for women, the importance of appearance in defining femininity, and crime as a challenge to female identity. Participants talked about difficulties in achieving the feminine ideal due to both being in the unit, and others' attitudes to their violent actions, which included explanations of illness or masculinity. Consequently, they were positioned as different to other women, and their actions pathologised. They discussed possible implications of this such as hostility from others and uncertainty about future opportunities in society after discharge from the unit. Implications: Clinical psychologists {{are in a position to}} offer less pathologising understandings of violent women's actions that do not rely on dominant discourses of femininity, and to challenge these discourses which maintain social inequalities...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – A {{consultant}} forensic {{psychiatrist and}} {{an individual with}} autism under his care discuss their experiences of working with autism in secure care. Dr Ghosh is a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist who analyses some of the practice issues and concerns for clinicians working with people with autism in secure care. He includes comments on {{the issues raised by}} one individual with autism (who has consented to sharing his thoughts) in secure care based on his experiences. This is particularly relevant given the recent publication of Building the Right Support, which offers national guidance to develop community services and close inpatient facilities for people with a learning disability and/or autism who display challenging behaviour, including those with a mental health condition. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – X is an autistic patient on a <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>unit.</b> His viewpoint, together with his then inpatient consultant psychiatrist ' s view, is given. Findings – There are multiple issues for patients and staff to consider when on a secure unit. The approach to take is focusing on holistic management. Originality/value – This paper starts with the patient perspective of his experiences with autism in the community and in hospital. This provides a framework for the paper to demonstrate how theoretical knowledge and holistic, patient-centred management can be applied to address the issues raised for an autistic patient who has spent a number of years as an inpatient on a <b>medium</b> <b>secure</b> <b>unit.</b> It shows how such plans can directly involve the patient and be adapted to suit the patient ' s self-identified needs and wishes. It also looks at the challenges longer-term inpatients with autism face in their rehabilitative journey from the patient and clinician perspectives.
