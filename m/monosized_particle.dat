40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} (PSD) {{plays a key}} role in fluidization behavior. The effect of PSD in fluidized, gas-solid mixtures is elucidated by considering two types of bimodal particle mixtures. In the first case, a mixture of "large" particles, which engage in particle-particle collisions, and "small" particles or fines, which follow the fluid streamlines, are considered. In this case, one net effect of the fines is to decrease the pressure drop required to convey a given solids flux in a riser. In the second case, a mixture of two sizes of larger particles in which collisions between like and unlike particles occur are considered. In this case, a reduction in particle phase stress in the bimodal mixture as compared to a <b>monosized</b> <b>particle</b> mixture with the same mean particle diameter is predicted. For dilute flow, this stress reduction is minimal but increases in significance as the suspension becomes more concentrated...|$|E

The spheres were made of ammonium fluorescein and polystyrene standards (M_W= 3700, 18, 700, and 114, 200 amu). The use of <b>monosized</b> <b>particles</b> with carefully controlled properties leads to a narrow distribution of sphere-surface adhesion forces, facilitating {{the determination of the}} particle entrainment threshold. The spheres were exposed to well-characterized shear stresses in two different flows, (i) laminar channel flow; and (ii) a normally impinging gas jet. Threshold shear stresses were found to be more sensitive to particle size than predicted by the existing resuspension theories, which are based on equilibrium adhesion models. Furthermore, resuspension was also found {{to be sensitive to the}} duration of the applied shear stress. This sensitivity depends upon the particle size and material properties.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a numerical {{framework for the}} computation of the effective transport properties of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) porous electrodes from three-dimensional (3 D) constructions of the microstructure. Realistic models of the 3 D microstructure of porous electrodes are first constructed from measured parameters such as porosity and particle size distribution. Then each phase in the model geometries is tessellated with a computational grid. Three different types of grids are considered: Cartesian, octree, and body-fitted/cut-cell with successive levels of surface refinement. Finally, a finite volume method is used to compute the effective transport properties in the three phases (pore, electron, and ion) of the electrode. To validate the numerical approach, results obtained with the finite volume method are compared to those calculated with a random walk simulation for {{the case of a}} body-centred cubic lattice of spheres. Then, the influence of the sample size is investigated for random geometries with <b>monosized</b> <b>particle</b> distributions.

Reaction control can be achieved by control of hydrolysis and condensation, solvent, temperature, catalyst, additives and complex formers. Especially the use of complex formers have proved to be a successful mean with respect to the control of the gel structure, the generation of <b>monosized</b> <b>particles</b> and even the control of particle size and distribution. Another mean for controlling rates is the homogeneous generation of water for condensation within a reacting system by a chemical reaction; e. g. by ester formation.

The nanoparticle suspensions generally exhibited a pseudoplastic, flow behavior, indicating an existence of particle aggregations in the liquid medium. The suspensions became apparently thixotropic as phi was increased above 0. 1. Relative viscosity (eta(r)) of the suspensions followed an exponential form with phi, i. e., eta(r) = 13. 47 e(35. 98) phi, revealing a pronounced increase {{in the degree of}} particle interactions as phi increased. Fractal dimension (D-f) was estimated from the suspension yield-stress (tau(gamma)) and phi dependence, and was determined as D-f similar to 1. 46 - 1. 78 for the flocculated nanoparticle suspensions. This suggested that the suspension structure was probably dominated by the diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation, due mostly to the strong attractions involved in the interparticle potentials. Maximum solids loading (phi(m)) of the suspensions was determined as phi(m) = 0. 146. This relatively low value of phi(m) (compared with the random close packing of <b>monosized</b> <b>particles,</b> phi(m) similar to 0. 64) partially vindicated the existence of a porous, three-dimensional aggregate network of interconnected nanoparticles in the carrier liquid.

Large host silica gel (SG) particles (d 50 = 55 μm) were coated with fine invited particles of magnesium stearate (MS, d 50 = 4. 6 μm) for different contents of MS in the mixture. The real MS mass fraction wI obtained after mechanical treatment has been determined thanks to calibration from TGA measurements. The surface structure and morphology of MS coatings were observed using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) [26, 27]. AFM has been also {{used to measure the}} adhesion forces between particles. Interaction forces between the material attached to the cantilever (Magnesium Stearate MS) and the surface of the composite material (Silica Gel SG or Magnesium Stearate MS) have been determined at different surface locations. For different compositions wI of the mixture MS-SG, the numeric distribution and the mean value f of the forces fH obtained for MS-SG interactions or fI for MS-MS interactions have been established and the experimental curve showing the evolution of f versus wI has been derived.

Different types of distribution of I materials onto the surface of H have been considered: for examples a discrete monolayer –or multilayers- of <b>monosized</b> <b>particles</b> I on the H surface.

30|$|Biomedical {{applications}} like {{magnetic resonance}} imaging, magnetic cell separation, or magnetorelaxometry control the magnetic {{properties of the}} nanoparticles in magnetic fluids. Furthermore, these applications also depend on the hydrodynamic size. Therefore, in many cases, {{only a small portion}} of particles contributes to the desired effect. The relative amount of the particles with the desired properties can be increased by the fractionation of magnetic fluids [133]. Common methods currently used for the fractionation of magnetic fluids are centrifugation [134] and size-exclusion chromatography [135]. All these methods separate the particles via nonmagnetic properties like density or size. Massart et al [136] have proposed a size sorting procedure based on the thermodynamic properties of aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles. The positive charge of the maghemite surface allows its dispersion in aqueous acidic solutions and the production of dispersions stabilized through electrostatic repulsions. By increasing the acid concentration (in the range 0.1 to 0.5 mol l- 1), interparticle repulsions are screened, and phase transitions are induced. Using this principle, these authors describe a two-step size sorting process in order to obtain significant amounts of nanometric <b>monosized</b> <b>particles</b> with diameters between typically 6 and 13 nm. As the surface of the latter is not modified by the size sorting process, usual procedures are used to disperse them in several aqueous or oil-based media. Preference should be given, however, to partitions based on the properties of interest, in this case, the magnetic properties. So far, magnetic methods have been used only for the separation of magnetic fluids, for example, to remove aggregates by magnetic filtration [137]. Recently, the fractionation of magnetic nanoparticles by flow field-flow fractionation was reported [138]. Field-flow fractionation is a family of analytical separation techniques [139, 140], in which the separation is carried out in a flow with a parabolic profile running through a thin channel. An external field is applied at a right angle to force the particles toward the so-called accumulation wall [141, 142].|$|R

30|$|One {{reason for}} the general {{scarcity}} of the shape-dependency effects on biological performance is the more difficult fabrication of nanoparticles with controlled rod-like morphology due to surface energy minimization during synthesis, leading to spherical shapes[6]. Especially for more novel materials' classes, the first hurdles to overcome include obtaining well-dispersed, <b>monosized</b> <b>particles</b> throughout all processing steps[7]. One promising materials' class {{in the sense of}} nanomedicine is mesoporous silica, which can be produced with nanoscale particle diameters and with tunable properties when it comes to both particle size and morphology, meso (pore) structure and size as well as surface chemistry[8]. The controllable characteristics of these materials have boosted research regarding their potential use within the biomedical field during the last decade, especially so for targeted cancer therapy and diagnostics[9 – 11]. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been successfully loaded with a range of different chemotherapeutics for efficient intracellular delivery and subsequent elimination of the cancer cells. A vast array of sizes and surface modifications have been produced and studied both in vitro and in vivo, while only a few studies have been devoted to the shape effect on MSN biobehavior[12 – 16]. To add to the increased understanding of shape-induced effects for MSNs, we have, in this study, synthesized two similarly sized but differently shaped rod-like (NR-MSP) and spherical (S-MSP) fluorescently labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles in order to investigate the morphology effect on cellular internalization. Additionally, both the rods and spheres were functionalized to yield different surface charges in order to distinguish morphology from surface charge-induced effects and, in the best case scenario, find the dominant parameter. In vitro studies were carried out in two different cancer cell lines, HeLa (cervical carcinoma cells) and Caco- 2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells), to investigate the particle characteristic impact on cells of different origin. According to our results, all of the studied factors (particle shape, surface charge, the nature of the coating as well as the targeted cell populations) are important to be considered when designing new nanocarrier formulations for targeted cancer therapies or other potent drugs that require tight dose control.|$|R

Dense granular flows, characterized by multiple contacts between grains, {{are common in}} many industrial processes and natural events, such as debris flows. Understanding the characteristics of these flows is crucial to predict quantities such as bedrock erosion and distance traveled by debris flows. However, the rheological properties of these flows are complicated due to wide particle size distribution and presence of interstitial fluids. Models for dense sheared granular materials indicate that their rheological properties depend on particle size, but the representative particle size for mixtures is not obvious. Using the discrete element method (DEM) we study sheared granular binary mixtures in a Couette cell to determine the relationship and rheological parameters such as stress and effective coefficient of friction and particle size distribution. The {{results indicate that the}} stress does not depend monotonically on the average particle size as it does in models derived from simple dimensional consideration. The stress has an additional dependence on a measure of the effective free volume per particle that is adapted from an expression for packing of <b>monosized</b> <b>particles</b> near the jammed state. The effective friction also has a complicated dependence on particle size distribution. For these systems of relatively hard particles, these relationships are governed largely by the ratio between average collision times and mean-free-path times. The characteristics of shallow free surface flows, important for applications such as debris flows, are different from confined systems. To address this, we also study shallow granular flows in a rotating drum. The stress at the boundary, height profiles and segregation patterns from DEM simulations are quantitatively similar to the results obtained from physical experiments of shallow granular flows in rotating drums. Individual particle-bed impacts rather than enduring contacts dominate the largest forces on the drum bed, which vary as the grain size squared and the 1. 2 power of particle-bed impact velocity. In the presence of interstitial fluids (water + fine particles) these characteristics might change significantly. Modeling particle-particle and fluid-particle interaction in dense granular flows is still a challenge. We propose a modification to the DEM to account for specific effects of the interstitial fluid on the dynamics of certain granular fluid flows. The results from this simple model are qualitatively similar to results from experiments...|$|R

On this model, the band appears strong and narrow only in dust clouds where the flux of UV starlight is high and the H atom gas density is low. The width of the band increases from diffuse to dense clouds mainly {{as a result of}} gas-phase H atoms accreted on to the grain surface.

There is a charge reversal from positive to negative as the pH is increased, with an isoelectric point (IEP) of about 7. 4. The chemical composition of the powders was determined by thermal, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic, and chemical analyses to be Y(OH) CO[subscript] 3 ·H[subscript] 2 O;The stability of aqueous suspensions of particles with a radius of 0. 21 [mu] was studied as a function of pH (in the range of 7 - 12. 3) using a turbidimetric method. The suspensions are stable in the pH range 8. 4 through 11. 6, with maximum stability being achieved at pH 10. 8. Maximum flocculation appears around the isoelectric point. Ordered particles {{were prepared}} from suspensions with particle volume fractions of 0. 2. Particle ordering was attributed to flocculation in the secondary minimum in some cases and to ordering of the Kirkwood-Alder character in others. Particles ordered in the secondary minimum were arranged in a close-packed structure of high coordination number. The IEP was exploited, in the former case to rapidly 2 ̆ 2 freeze 2 ̆ 2 the ordered structure into the primary minimum. ftn*DOE Report IS-T- 1302.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{relating to}} haze formation, methods of separation, coalescence mechanisms, and models by which droplets < 100 μm are collected, coalesced and transferred, have been reviewed with particular reference to particulate bed coalescers. The separation of secondary oil-water dispersions was studied experimentally using packed beds of <b>monosized</b> glass ballotini <b>particles.</b> The variables investigated were superficial velocity, bed depth, particle size, and the phase ratio and drop size distribution of inlet secondary dispersion. A modified pump loop {{was used to}} generate secondary dispersions of toluene or Clairsol 350 in water with phase ratios between 0. 5 - 6. 0 v/v%. Inlet drop size distributions were determined using a Malvern Particle Size Analyser;effluent, coalesced droplets were sized by photography. Single phase flow pressure drop data were correlated {{by means of a}} Carman-Kozeny type equation. Correlations were obtained relating single and two phase pressure drops, as (ΔP 2 /μc) /ΔP 1 /μd) = kp Ua Lb dcc dpd Cine A flow equation was derived to correlate the two phase pressure drop data as, ΔP 2 /(ρcU 2) = 8. 64 * 107 [dc/D]- 0. 27 [L/D] 0. 71 [dp/D]- 0. 17 [NRe] 1. 5 [e 1]- 0. 14 [Cin] 0. 26  In a comparison between functions to characterise the inlet drop size distributions a modification of the Weibull function provided the best fit of experimental data. The general mean drop diameter was correlated by: q_p q_p p_q /β      Γ ((q- 3 /β) + 1) d qp = d fr . α        Γ ((P- 3 /β + 1 The measured and predicted mean inlet drop diameters agreed within ± 15 %. Secondary dispersion separation depends largely upon drop capture within a bed. A theoretical analysis of drop capture mechanisms in this work indicated that indirect interception and London-van der Waal's mechanisms predominate. Mathematical models of dispersed phase concentration m the bed were developed by considering drop motion to be analogous to molecular diffusion. The number of possible channels in a bed was predicted from a model in which the pores comprised randomly-interconnected passage-ways between adjacent packing elements and axial flow occured in cylinders on an equilateral triangular pitch. An expression was derived for length of service channels in a queuing system leading to the prediction of filter coefficients. The insight provided into the mechanisms of drop collection and travel, and the correlations of operating parameters, should assist design of industrial particulate bed coalescers...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{granular}} flow, comprising {{granular material}} flowing {{on the surface}} of a heap of the same material, occurs in several industrial and natural systems. The rheology of such a flow was investigated by means of measurements of velocity and number-density profiles in a quasi-two-dimensional rotating cylinder, half-filled with a model granular material - <b>monosize</b> spherical stainless-steel <b>particles.</b> The measurements were made at the Centre of the cylinder, where the flow is fully developed, using streakline photography and image analysis. The stress profile was computed from the number-density profile using a force balance which takes into account wall friction. Mean-velocity and root-mean-square (r. m. s.) -velocity profiles are reported for different particle sizes and cylinder rotation speeds. The profiles for the mean velocity superimpose when distance is scaled by the particle diameter d and velocity by a characteristic shear rate gamma(C) = [g sin(beta(m) - beta(s)) /d cos beta(s) ] 1 / 2 and the particle diameter, where beta(m) is the maximum dynamic angle of repose and beta(s) is the static angle of repose. The maximum dynamic angle of repose is found to vary with the local flow rate. The scaling is also found to work for the r. m. s. velocity profiles. The mean velocity is found to decay exponentially with depth in the bed, with decay length lambda = 1. 1 d. The r. m. s. velocity shows similar behaviour but with lambda = 1. 7 d. The r. m. s. velocity profile shows two regimes: near the free surface the r. m. s. velocity is nearly constant and below a transition point it decays linearly with depth. The shear rate, obtained by numerical differentiation of the velocity profile, is not constant anywhere in the layer and has a maximum which occurs at the same depth as the transition in the r. m. s. velocity profile. Above the transition point the velocity distributions are Gaussian and below the transition point the velocity distributions gradually approach a Poisson distribution. The shear stress increases roughly linearly with depth. The variation in the apparent viscosity eta with r. m. s. velocity u shows a relatively sharp transition at the shear-rate maximum, and in the region below this point the apparent viscosity eta similar to u(- 1. 5). The measurements indicate that the flow comprises two layers: an upper low-viscosity layer with a nearly constant r. m. s. velocity and a lower layer of increasing viscosity with a decreasing r. m. s. velocity. The thickness of the upper layer depends on the local flow rate and is independent of particle diameter while the reverse is found to hold for the lower-layer thickness. The experimental data is compared with the predictions of three models for granular flow...|$|R
