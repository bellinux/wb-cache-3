5000|$|The {{myeloproliferative}} neoplasms (MPNs), previously <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> (MPDs), are a {{group of}} diseases of the bone marrow in which excess cells are produced. They are related to, and may evolve into, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, although the <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> on the whole have a much better prognosis than these conditions. The concept of myeloproliferative disease was first proposed in 1951 by the hematologist William Dameshek. In the most recent World Health Organization classification of hematologic malignancies, this group of diseases was renamed from [...] "myeloproliferative diseases" [...] to [...] "myeloproliferative neoplasms". This reflects the underlying clonal genetic changes that are a salient feature of this group of disease.|$|E
40|$|The bcr-abl {{oncogene}} plays {{a critical}} role in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The fusion of Bcr sequences to Abl constitutively activates the Abl protein tyrosine kinase. We have recently shown that expression of Bcr-Abl in bone marrow cells by retroviral transduction efficiently induces in mice a <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> resembling human CML and that Abl kinase activity is essential for Bcr-Abl to induce a CML-like <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> However, it is not known if activation of the Abl kinase alone is sufficient to induce a <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> In this study, we examined the role of the Abl SH 3 domain of Bcr-Abl in induction of <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> and tested whether c-Abl activated by SH 3 deletion can induce a CML-like disease. We found that Bcr-Abl with an Abl SH 3 deletion still induced a CML-like disease in mice. In contrast, c-Abl activated by SH 3 deletion induced only lymphoid malignancies in mice and did not stimulate the growth of myeloid colonies from 5 -fluorouracil-treated bone marrow cells in vitro. These results indicate that Bcr sequences in Bcr-Abl play additional roles in inducing <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> beyond simply activating the Abl kinase domain and that functions of the Abl SH 3 domain are either not required or redundant in Bcr-Abl-induced <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease.</b> The results also suggest that the type of hematological neoplasm induced by an abl oncogene is influenced not only by what type of hematopoietic cells the oncogene is targeted into but also by the intrinsic oncogenic properties of the particular abl oncogene. In addition, we found that ΔSH 3 c-Abl induced less activation of Akt and STAT 5 than did Bcr-Abl, suggesting that activation of these pathways plays {{a critical role}} in inducing a CML-like disease...|$|R

Patients with reactive thrombocytosis had considerably lower mean platelet volumes than those with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, or normal subjects.

There were no differences in mean platelet volume or platelet distribution width between patients with <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> and a high or normal platelet count. The increased platelet heterogeneity in <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>disease</b> was caused by an increase of both small and large platelets.

50|$|Patients with ETV6-ABL1 fusion gene-positive disease {{present with}} various {{hematological}} disorders. Children present predominantly with hematological findings similar to acute lymphocytic leukemia and less commonly with findings of acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic variants {{of these two}} leukemias. Adults {{are more likely to}} present with findings similar to acute myelogenous leukemia or myeloproliferative neoplasms. In a study of 44 patients with this fusion gene, eosinophilia was found in all patients with myelogenous and <b>myeloproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> but only 4 of 13 with acute lymphocytic leukemia presentations. The prognosis was very poor in adults with acute leukemia forms of the disease; ~80% of these patients suffered fatal disease progression or relapse. Five patients with the myeloproliferative form of the disease responded to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib or sequential treatment with imatinib followed by recurrence and treatment with a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib; dasatinib is also a recommended second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating the disease. Follow-up of these patients is too short to determine the overall length of time to relapse and the efficacy of single or serial tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments. Patients with the blast cell phase of this disease have very poor responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a median survival of ~1 year. Thus, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including second-generation inhibitors, in the treatment of ETV6-ABL1-positive hematological malignancies have shown varying responses; it is suggested that further investigations into the clinical efficacy of these drugs in ETV6-ABL1-induced clonal hypereosinophilia is warranted.|$|E

The first case was planned for shunting, while another case sustained bleeding on what account his anticoagulant therapy was discontinued, but it caused mesenterial thrombosis resulting in lethal outcome. Another two patients had hepatic veins thrombosis.

An immediate postoperative period was manifested by multiple thrombosis and hemorrhages that ended in his death. A patient with the acute Budd-Chiari syndrome was administered myelosuppressants and anticoagulants on time so reperfusion was restored.
