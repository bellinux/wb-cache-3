5000|$|The Sir Vival was {{a concept}} car created by Walter C. Jerome of Worcester, Massachusetts in 1958.

While never {{produced}} commercially the Sir Vival featured many innovative car safety concepts that would later become standard such as seat belts, a roll cage, sliding side doors, rubber bumpers, and side lights. However, the most distinctive feature of the car are a two-part construction that separates the engine and front wheels from the <b>main</b> passenger <b>cab</b> via an articulated universal joint and the driver's turret, an elevated seat where the driver commands a near-360 degree visibility thanks to a cylindrical glass enclosure.

In many libraries data on collection activities results from daily routines and is facilitated by integrated library systems, but the collection of data on reference activities is left to periodic sampling, generated by hand tallying. In 1994 at the Medical Sciences Library of Texas A&M University we began to investigate, design, and implement a method of collecting statistical data on the computer based on a program developed at the Houston Academy of Medicine/Texas Medical Center Library in 1993. By 1995 we had a fully functional, customized Management Information System, using the Paradox relational database software, that tracked not only client serve interactions at the reference desk, but also administrative operations such as billing. The system was migrated to Microsoft Access in 1998. The MIS is still used to track reference desk transactions, mediated searches, librarian-taught classes, and activities in the Clinical Veterinary Librarian program.

40|$|Conference Home Page: [URL] In late 20 th {{and early}} 21 st centuries, library {{automation}} and the Internet revolutionized information access and library operations around the world. The effect on academic institutions has been profound. It enables users to access library resources from sites {{hundreds or thousands}} of miles away. Libraries in academic institutions can now provide information access to off-campus faculty and students wherever they are located. To meet the ever increasing demands for information availability, academic libraries must now subscribe to electronic resources such as e-books, full-text e-journals and online bibliographic databases in addition to the printed formats. While the availability of these electronic resources enable remote access to needed information, concomitantly they present issues and challenges. Some of the issues and challenges are: Access Control. Volatility of coverage by aggregation services. Overlapping coverage of the same title by multiple vendors This paper will describe in detail and depth these and other issues and challenges facing two university libraries in the United States and librarians attempts to resolve the problems.

The Veterinary Medical Library took a low key approach to assisting users waiting for them to come to us for help. A special web page and database was developed and user group sessions were held during the 2001 - 2002 academic year. When a new librarian, Plato Smith, was assigned to the project in July 2002, a more proactive approach helped to incorporate the Library into the program in the Fall of 2002 when the next round of Visors were distributed. We have also worked locally to develop a clinical log on HanDBase for fourth year students to keep their required clinical diaries on their Visors and transfer it easily to MS Word. The authors will share their experiences working directly with faculty and students in a variety of problem solving situations, circulating pda books, and teaching a variety of training sessions.

During these times of stagnant journal budgets, rising inflation, and a growing preference of library users for 24 / 7 desktop access, libraries are facing "either/or" decisions on whether to purchase online or print versions of journals. Electronic journals are appealing due {{to the absence of}} costs for check-in claiming, binding, shelving, and storage required for print versions. However, concerns about archive instability, cover-to-cover content coverage, missing issues, retracted articles, changing publishers, and access limitations surround electronic journals. This study is a comparison of selected online and print issues of 12 veterinary journals available via 12 different vendors/publishers. Content providers examined in this evaluation include Science Direct, Synergy, BioOne, ProQuest, Ingenta, and others. The major focus of this study centers on the differences in content, if any, between print and electronic formats. How do these different providers define full text? Are all articles, including supplementary material, included in both versions? Other features such as editorials, letters to the editors, editorial board listings, errata, advertisements, case reports, news items, society business, meeting abstracts, proceedings, and special issues, will be compared for inclusion and completeness in both formats. Access stability, quality of illustrations and plates, availability of color, currency, and archival access are other factors that must also be considered. Better information on content in the online and print versions will enable libraries to make better decisions on when online is, or is not, enough.

Results of a pilot survey will be presented that was made in preparation of a more wide scale investigation into the information needs and use of various groups of users and (even more important) non-users to be carried out in October-November 2003. Reference questions, received personally by the Reader's Service during the past three years, or through the homepage integrated search engine are also analyzed. The library has been building a homepage with an increasing amount of information content for three years, and has elaborated its digitization strategy taking the intentions of authorities (the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, and the Ministry of Informatics and Communications) into account. We try to match or confront the two sides: needs and possibilities in order to find ways to improve our electronic services and to increase their use. Our homepage is the most important means of providing electronic services, we focus on its (bilingual) development.

Criticisms of the website ranged from boring to "not intuitive" and difficult to navigate. Library staff groups were created to support an evolutionary approach to website development and improvement. This proved ineffective. In 2001, redesign of the library's website became {{an integral part of}} the library's strategic plan. Things began to happen. Funded by a Texas Infrastructure Fund (TIF) grant, a commitment was made to purchase and implement a content management system (CMS), a set of software tools that would provide the framework for distributed web content development and management. A diverse team with representatives from all areas of the libraries was brought together to implement this new library web presence. The hope was that, besides making the redesign happen, the Web Implementation Team (WIT) would build library-wide buy in for the project. WIT's charge was to make key decisions regarding the selection of products to accomplish the redesign, state the implementation process, develop templates for various web content, solicit and encourage feedback from library staff and users, and communication progress to both groups. WIT chose the content management system and developed a navigational paradigm for the site. It is currently coordinating the development of templates for the many different types of pages included on the site and gathering staff and end user feedback to refine and enhance the site. The expected launch date for the sites is the Spring 2003 semester. Team members are currently [providing leadership on a variety of task forces to guide further development of the web site and services such as portal management, virtual reference, knowledge bases, subject representation of web resources, FAQ management, marketing, and site analysis and metrics.

Basically the Z 39. 50 protocol stack exists between the TCP/IP protocol stack and the client front end interface. Z 39. 50 consists of basic structural blocks (Initialization, Search, Retrieval, Sort, etc.) for communication between the origin and the target (client/server). A wide spectrum of programming approaches in the development of threes systems can be detected. For example, ZACK, a system for simultaneous searching in several library databases was developed in the Technical University of Berlin (free download from [URL] Commercial software is often based on more complicated approaches allowing efficient interaction (e. g. OCLC SiteSearch Suite, EndNote, Elektra and others). The importance of the development of co-operative bibliographic retrieval networks is paramount for the computer and Internet implementation in scientific libraries. Search engines provide access to information that can be indexed on the Internet, basically web pages and FTP archives. While pure search engines employ robots, Web catalogues give access to systematized information under certain categories. It is the trend, that most search engines develop to portals. Existing virtual libraries are the WWW Virtual Library Veterinary Medicine, NetVet and Vetgate. Our own virtual library ViFaVet at: [URL] and [URL] went online September 2001. It offers: -Subject Guide, - Databases, - Online Contents Veterinary Medicine, - Full Text Documents, - OPAC, - Project Information, - What's New?

The University of Pretoria's e-initiative to extend learning to distance students gave impetus {{to the introduction of}} portals [...] in various formats. The Academic Information Service, Service Unit: Veterinary Science (the library at the Faculty of Veterinary Science) extended the learning horizon, making information available to users beyond the campus e. g. private practitioners needing information for Continuing Professional Development purposes, post graduate students (including a disabled student as well) doing distance learning courses as well as students in other African countries. Unique products developed for this market will be described, such as the African Goat Web, the Ostrich Web, the African Wildlife Web, and the Arnold Theiler digitisation project. These products were developed as an aid in providing information on topics that are rapidly increasing in popularity. Portals to enable registered users of the Academic Information Service to access e-information with the least effort and confusion such as the "Library in you Office" will also be featured. This very basic portal allows the user to access some of the more important information resources for veterinary use and then afterwards directly connect to UpeXplore, the Academic Information Service's OPAC catalogue for the electronic journal collection of the Academic Information Service or the automated article requesting system run by SABINET (South African Bibliographic and Information Network). The development of the library's electronic newsletter which serves as an user education and information aid for wider, off-campus usage will also be discussed.

Service quality assessments and focus groups sent a clear message to us that our users {{want to be able to}} access full text articles from their desktops, at work and at home. As a result of our success in providing online resources, we have seen definite changes in use patterns that have significant implications for how the collection evolves. We have systematically collected use information for our collection since the early 1980 's. Over the past year we began analyzing our use data. We compared historical data to the data we collected from 1995 to the present, examining trends in the use of print journals, comparing online usage to print usage, and calculating cost per use figures for all of our journal titles. Our data reveals several consistent trends: Print usage is now often only 10 - 25 % of what it was 3 years ago. Print usage is declining not only for those titles with electronic access, but also for those available only in print. Many print titles with electronic access availability have cost per use ratios that do not support retaining the print subscriptions. We have also begun an analysis to compare these trends in the 3 major subject areas of our journal collection: biomedical research, clinical human medicine and veterinary medicine. Analysis of this data led to several conclusions and actions: We have set forth on a new path for developing the collection that converts a significant number of our print journal subscriptions to electronic format only. We have targeted groups of print titles for enhancement with electronic access. In order to support this growing emphasis on electronic resources, we have redefined one of our positions to be dedicated full time to serials and electronic resources, a Serials and Electronic Collections Coordinator. We continue to gather user feedback and suggestions concerning our move to electronic journals. Sharing our data usually leads our users to the same conclusions. The road to an electronic journal collection has been quite smooth, paved by our use data.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Oyuk genişlemesi teorisinin temelini oluşturduğu oyuk genişlemesi analizleri geoteknik mühendisliğinde karşılaşılan birçok problemin çözümünde kullanılmaktadır. Özellikle son yirmi yılda kazıklı temellerin ve zemin ankrajlarının kapasitelerinin araştırılmasında, arazi deneylerinin yorumlanmasında, tünellerin ve yeraltı kazılarının davranışlarının analizlerinde ve kuyu stabilitesinde oyuk genişlemesi yaklaşımları oldukça yararlı sonuçlar vermiştir. Bu çalışma kapsamında killi bir zemin içerisinde drenajsız koşullar altında oyuk genişlemesi analizleri ele alınmış olup zemin içerisinde var olan bir oyuğun çapının iki katına çıkartılması suretiyle oyuk genişlemesi sırasında ve konsolidasyon sonrasında oyuk çevresinde meydana gelen gerilme, şekil değiştirme ve boşluk suyu basıncı değişimi araştırılmıştır. Bu amaç doğrultusunda oyuk çevresini oluşturan zemin, Boston Mavi Kili (Boston Blue Clay) olduğu kabul edilerek Plaxis 2011 2 D kullanılarak ve Modified Cam Clay (MCC), Soft Soil (SS) ve Hardening Soil (HS) malzeme bünye modelleri ile sonlu elemanlar analizleri yapılarak incelenmiştir. Konsolidasyon analizlerinde iki boyutlu bütünleşik analizler kullanılarak minumum boşluk suyu basıncı elde edilmiştir. Ayrıca oyuk genişlemesi sırasında oyuk çevresindeki zeminin gerilme geçmişi ile boşluk suyu basıncını arasındaki ilişki de araştırılmıştır. Oyuk genişlemesi probleminin incelenmesi için gerçekleştirilen sayısal analizlerde aksi simetrik geometrik idealizasyonu yapılmış ve problem iki boyutlu olarak ele alınmıştır. İlk olarak oyuk çapının iki katına çıkartılması suretiyle oyuk genişlemesi sırasında oluşan zemin deformasyonları teorik ve ölçüme dayalı sonuçlarla karşılatırılmış ve sonuçların birbiriyle çok uyumlu olduğu görülmüştür. Bir sonraki aşamada yapılan analizler sonucunda oyuk çevresinde meydana gelen gerilme, şekil değiştirme ve boşluk suyu değişimleri ile zemin gerilme geçmişi ve boşluk suyu basıncı ilişkisi elde edilerek literatürde yapılan benzer çalışma sonuçları ile karşılaştırılmıştır. MCC ve SS ve HS bünye modülleri için oyuk genişlemesi hemen sonrasında elde edilen gerilmeler literatür çalışmalarıyla uyumlu dağılımlar gösterirken oyuk çevresinde oluşan plastik bölge alanı HS model için daha geniş alan kapladığı görülmüştür. Ayrıca SS ve HS bünye modülü için oyuk genişlemesi sonrasında aşırı konsolidasyon oranının artması ile boşluk suyu basıncında önemli bir değişim görülmezken, MCC bünye modelinde aşırı konsolidasyon oranının artması ile elde edilen boşluk suyu basıncında önemli düşüş görülmüş ve bu sonuç literatürde görülen teori ve ölçüme dayalı sonuçlarla uyum göstermiştir. Killi bir zemin içerisindeki drenajsız oyuk genişlemesi problemi üzerine gerçekleştirilen iki boyutlu sayısal analiz çalışma sonuçları literatürde yapılan benzer teorik ve ölçüme dayalı çalışmalarla uyumlu sonuçlar verirken aynı zamanda benzer problemler için daha hızlı ve pratik çözüm olanakları sağlamıştır ve ayrıca sayısal modellemeler için seçilen malzeme bünye modüllerinin de önemini bir kez daha göstermiştir. The cavity {{expansion}} methods {{forming the}} basis of theory of cavity expansion is widely used {{to solve the problems}} encountered in geotechnical engineering. In recent decades, cavity expansion methods have given beneficial results in the areas of soil testing and the <b>main</b> soil properties <b>cab</b> specifically be obtained such as shear modulus, total horizontal in-situ stress, undrained shear strength and coefficient of horizontal consolidation thanks to similar mechanical action formed by cavity expansion and cone penetration and pressumeter expansion. Cavity expansion theory is used with considerable success in the interpretation of these types of in-situ soil tests. Moreover, cavity expansion methods are used in the prediction of end-bearing and shaft capacities of a driven pile in soils and {{can also be used to}} estimate the pull-out capacity of earth anchors. They are also applied to the design and construction of tunnels and underground excavations in order to provide stability and serviceability and, furthermore, they are used to estimate ground settlements due to tunneling and designing tunnel support systems to maintain stability. Cavity expansion method also provides a useful prediction of borehole instability. For the first time, cavity expansion analysis emerged to figure out the problems of metal indentation, which became more important when the industrial revolution intensified in the late 19 th century and early 20 th century. After metal indentation, the concerns were related to explosions within the ground and how the stress waves generated by these explosions would propagate. As a result of these improvements, geomechanics with more of a geotechnical engineering property followed notably with works by Ladanyi (1972), Palmer (1972), Vesic (1972) who attempted to capture the important feature of soil stress-strain nonlinearity. The next generation of cavity expansion analyses appeared in the 1980 s, 1990 s, and 2000 s (notably, Randolph et al. 1979; Yu and Houlsby 1991; Collins et al. 1992 and Salgado et al. 1997). Cavity expansion processes can be divided into two basic types, firstly expansion from a finite radius and secondly expansion from zero initial radius. Although different types of analyses can be used to solve each of these problems, this study presents numerical analysis that provides the solution to both problems simultaneously. The expansion of cavity in soil is a one-dimensional boundary value problem. To solve it using the principles of continuum mechanics, a mathematical constitutive model is needed to describe the stress-strain behavior of soil. However, soil is some of the oldest and most complex construction materials and, therefore, a description of soil behavior can only be achieved by developing a constitutive model. The most widely used theories for developing soil models are the assumptions of elasticity and plasticity. Linear or nonlinear elastic models, viscoelastic or viscoelastic-plastic models or elastic-plastic models (perfectly plastic or strain hardening/softening) may be used to adequately describe the stress-strain behavior of soils. In this study, cavity expansion analysis was used in Plaxis finite element code’s soil models to describe the stress-strain behavior of soils. Some of them are Modified Cam Clay (MCC), Soft Soil (SS) and Hardening Soil (HS). The Modified Cam Clay model (Roscoe and Burland, 1968; Schofield and Wroth, 1968) represents the hardening behavior of the elasto-plastic materials based on the critical state concept and involves logarithmic relationship between the mean effective stress and void ratio. Yield surface of the MCC is described by an ellipse and therefore the plastic strain increment vector (which is vertical to the yield surface) for the largest value of the mean effective stress is horizontal, and hence no incremental deviatoric plastic strain takes place for a change in mean effective stress. The Soft Soil is based on the modified Cam Clay model especially meant for primary near-normally consolidated clays, clayey silts and peat also to describe the non-linear stress-strain behavior of soils, beside the Cam Clay model, the pseudo-elastic (hypo-elastic) type of model has been developed. Soft Soil model also provides some features in Plaxis such as stress dependent stiffness, memory of preconsolidation stress, failure behavior based on Mohr- Coulomb criterion. The Hardening Soil model is an advanced model for simulation of soil behavior such as different types of soil both soft soils and stiff soils and well known hyperbolic model (Duncan and Chang, 1970). Basic feature of the Hardening soil model is the stress dependency of soil stiffness so that all stiffnesses increase with pressure. In the concept of this study, the cavity expansion methods were studied and the changes in stresses, pore-water pressures and displacements caused by the undrained expansion of cylindrical cavity were investigated during and subsequent consolidation by doubling initial radius of the cavity existing in a clayey soil. For this purpose, the surrounding soil of cavity, which is assumed Boston Blue Clay, was investigated by using Plaxis 2011 2 D and Modified Cam Clay (MCC), Soft Soil (SS) and Hardening Soil (HS) constitutive models and by making finite element analysis. In addition, the relation between the surrounding soil stress history and the pore-water pressure during the expansion of the cavity was explored. In the numerical analysis of the cavity expansion problem, modelled as undrained expansion of an existing cavity with an initial radius 1 m, and a length of 10 m, axisymmetric geometric idealization was assumed and the surrounding soil (Boston Blue Clay) using 15 node triangular elements was generated in Plaxis 2 D. During the modeling of cavity expansion, the expansion took place by assigning prescribed displacement in the radial direction along the side of the initial cavity. Plastic calculation was used to carry out elastic-plastic deformation analysis for undrained behavior in the expansion step. The modeling of undrained behavior based on effective stiffness parameters was available for all materials in plaxis such as Undrained (A), Undrained (B) and Undrained (C). During the plastic phase, Undrained (A) that enables modelling undrained behavior using effective parameters for stiffness and strength was used in all material models in this study. During the cavity expansion, assuming sufficient time for excess pore pressure dissipation, soil behaviour was arranged to undrained. Subsequently, the soil modelling was allowed to consolidate until the excess pore pressure at any point dissipated below 1. 0 kPa. Consolidation (EPP) coupled two-dimensional analysis was used to in consolidation phase. First of all, the cylindrical cavity expansion analysis showed good agreement with measurements of radial soil displacement around a cavity mid-depth in the field (Cooke and Price, 1973; Pestana et al., 2002) and in the laboratory model tests (Randolph et al., 1979 a; Randolph et al., 1979 b; Steenfelt et al., 1981) and cavity expansion analytical solutions. At the second stage, as a result of the analysis carried out in this thesis, the change of stresses, pore-water pressures and displacements in soil, the relation between the surrounding soil stress history and the pore-water pressure were obtained. These results were compared with the results of the similar studies of the literature made in the mentioned area such as Randolph et al. (1979 a) who provided numerical analysis for an undrained expansion of a cylindrical cavity by using BBC parameters and MCC constitutive model and presented the changes of stresses, displacements and pore pressures in the surrounding soil of cavity during cavity expansion and after subsequent reconsolidation as a function of radial distance. When compared with the results provided by Randolph et. al. (1979 a), SS and HS constitutive models show an acceptable level whereas MCC Model results obtained match quite well results for the stress distributions during radial expansion. However, after the subsequent consolidation, the change of stresses, pore water pressures in surrounding soil of cavity results were compared with the results of Randolph et al. (1979 a) and these results were seen to be different from each other. The reason for this is that Randolph et al. (1979 a) used Tergazhi’s one-dimensional consolidation analysis whereas this study used two-dimensional coupled consolidation analysis as a more realistic method. Moreover, when compared with the other constitutive models, the plastic zone around the cavity for HS constitutive model was observed to be occupying larger area. Furthermore, when the relation between the excess pore pressure near the cavity face and the overconsolidation was concerned, no significant change was observed in SS and HS models with respect to the excess pore pressure depending on the increase of overconsolidation ratio. However, in the MCC constitutive model, a significant decrease was observed in the increasing overconsolidation ratio and excess pore water pressure. Nonetheless, Coop and Wroth (1989) at Oxford University and Bond and Jardine (1991) at Imperial College measured pore water pressures generated at the pile soil interface during pile installation in clay and they observed a decrease,to a considerable extent, in pore pressure along the pile (assume cavity) for overconsolidation clays. That is why, numerical solution is in agreement with the theory and based on the measurement results. In particular, in agreement with the field-testing, the results of numerical analysis were consistent with the results of the similar studies of the literature made in the mentioned area and numerical modeling also demonstrated the importance of constitutive models selected for the description of soil behavior. Despite some restrictions and simplifications in geometric idealizations and soil properties during the cavity expansion approaches and related numerical modelling solutions dealt within the context of this thesis, the study hopefully aims to contribute to the efficient and effective solutions of the cavity expansion problems as quite many problems encountered in geotechnical engineering have been closely associated with the problems of cavity expansion. Since the related studies carried out in Turkey are limited in number, this study is bound to play a vital role in this field to a considerable extent. If some recent researches carried on interpretation of in-situ soil testing and investigation of capacity of pile foundations are taken into account, the current numerical solutions might be improved on sandy soil analysis. Finally, numerical analyses developed for the cavity expansion problems presented matching results with the similar studies and findings based on measurement as well as producing rapid and effective solutions for the similar problems, and the materials selected for numerical modelling once more showed the importance of constitutive models.
