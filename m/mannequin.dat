5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size <b>mannequin</b> of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in the glove. This <b>mannequin</b> was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, {{a far cry from}} the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, {{the band}} began the Strength In Numbers Tour, {{a tour of}} Canada with Canadian band Finger Eleven; Die <b>Mannequin</b> opened each of Sum 41's shows. During the tour, Whibley {{sustained}} a herniated disk. As a result, the group cancelled {{the rest of its}} shows.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Black {{announced}} through French radio station, Skyrock, {{that the}} album had no confirmed title, revealing she had considered the names Black Rainbow and <b>Mannequin</b> Factory, but that those titles {{might not make}} it to the album as she had recorded more songs.|$|E
50|$|In {{first aid}} courses manikins {{may be used}} to {{demonstrate}} methods of giving first aid (e.g., resuscitation). Fire and coastguard services use <b>mannequins</b> to practice life-saving procedures. The <b>mannequins</b> have similar weight distribution to a human. Special obese <b>mannequins</b> and horse <b>mannequins</b> have also been made for similar purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Shop <b>mannequins</b> {{are derived}} from dress forms used by fashion houses for dress making. The use of <b>mannequins</b> {{originated}} in the 15th century, when miniature [...] "milliners' mannequins" [...] were used to demonstrate fashions for customers. [...] Full-scale, wickerwork <b>mannequins</b> came into use in the mid-18th century. Wirework <b>mannequins</b> were manufactured in Paris from 1835.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mannequins</b> are {{a common}} theme in horror fiction. Many people find <b>mannequins</b> {{disturbing}} (due in part perhaps to the uncanny valley effect), especially when not fully assembled. In the 1970 Doctor Who serial Spearhead from Space, an alien intelligence attempts to take over Earth with killer plastic <b>mannequins</b> called Autons. <b>Mannequins</b> come to life and attack the living in [...] "The Trevi Collection" [...] (episode 14 of the T.V. series Kolchak: The Night Stalker). Abandoned nuclear test sites consisting of entire towns populated by <b>mannequins</b> appear in such films as Kalifornia, Mulholland Falls, and the 2006 remake of The Hills Have Eyes.|$|R
5|$|Rathnavelu {{used the}} 435 Xtreme camera and also wrote a 1,600-page manual, {{in which he}} listed all of the {{possible}} angles from which the characters played by Rajinikanth could be filmed. Legacy Effects and the Hong Kong-based visual effects companies Kinomotive Studios and Menfond Electronics took responsibility for the film's CGI work. To create the robots with Rajinikanth's appearance, a complete scan of his face in 3Ddigital format in all possible lighting conditions was conducted using the Doom Light Stage, so that his face could be replicated on the mannequins. The technique, according to Shankar, was previously used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). The robot Chitti featured in the film was a <b>mannequin</b> made by a Legacy Effects team of 100technicians in Los Angeles. For every robotic <b>mannequin</b> used, six puppeteers were employed to control the mannequin's movements.|$|E
5|$|Saxobeats was commercialized {{with three}} {{different}} covers shot by Andrei Nemirschi. For European standard releases, it featured Stan wearing a bob {{in front of a}} black-white backdrop, with one of her hands being attached to her head. In Japan, the release was accompanied by a photograph of the singer standing with headphones on her shoulders against a black background. All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic <b>mannequin,</b> sporting a blue blouse along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture: Acupuncture, the {{traditional}} Chinese medicinal practice of inserting needles into specific {{points of the}} body for therapeutic purposes and relieving pain, was first mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing compiled from the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC (Warring States period to Han Dynasty). The oldest known acupuncture sticks made of gold, found in the tomb of Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC), date to the Western Han (203 BC– 9 AD); the oldest known stone-carved depiction of acupuncture was made during the Eastern Han (25–220 AD); the oldest known bronze statue of an acupuncture <b>mannequin</b> dates to 1027 during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mannequins</b> {{are used}} by apparel {{retailers}} to display their products in-store and in the window display. They are a tool used to show consumers what their products look like on a person. The <b>mannequins</b> will commonly be styled to match trends as well display the latest products available. A study found that retailers projected an ideal image to consumers with the size and proportions of the <b>mannequins.</b> This is used to further reinforce the characteristics of their target market. However, consumers found the size of <b>mannequins</b> to be unrealistic but would give a favorable response to the <b>mannequins</b> when they were headless. This was because {{the participants in the}} study found the faces of the <b>mannequins</b> unrealistic and could not relate to them. Therefore, it is important for retailers to understand the thoughts and opinions of consumers on visual stimuli such as <b>mannequins</b> so they can create a more desirable shopping environment for the consumers.|$|R
50|$|This {{technology}} is a convergence of two techniques: using real models and dress-up <b>mannequins.</b> Instead of photographing garments on people similar to customer’s shape and size, images are made using shape-shifting, robotic <b>mannequins.</b> The computer-controlled <b>mannequins</b> quickly morph {{through a series of}} body shapes and sizes while garments - in each different size - are photographed and the image stored in a database together with the measurements that generate the image. Since the <b>mannequins</b> are computer-controlled, the whole process is relatively fast.|$|R
30|$|Three male <b>mannequins</b> {{were used}} as test materials. <b>Mannequins</b> were filled with sand with an amount of normal male weight between 70 and 75  kg.|$|R
5|$|Prior to full production, {{the team}} created a tech demo in 2012 {{to test the}} {{creation}} and movement of highly detailed models and environments. This tech demo was titled Agni's Philosophy, which also acted as a test demo for the Luminous Studio engine which {{would be used for}} Final Fantasy XV. Character designs and modelling was overseen by Business Division 2; the team was led by Kazuaki Iwasawa, the character model supervisor. The character Crowe's hair was based on the hairstyle for the main female protagonist of Agni's Philosophy. The hairstyles for both Crowe and Lunafreya were first modelled using a real <b>mannequin</b> wig to ensure they could be managed. Their fully rendered wigs were composed of three thousand curves each, a thousand more than originally estimated.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), {{a teenage}} shop assistant, is {{being chased by}} mannequins in the {{basement}} of Henrik's, the department store where she works. She is rescued by the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home where he is attacked by a plastic <b>mannequin</b> arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive (Mark Benton), who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose the Doctor is dangerous, and that if he's there, something bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic doppelgänger.|$|E
5|$|A {{more serious}} crisis {{occurred}} in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrès, whose early {{affiliation with the}} Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Péret and others as witnesses (a <b>mannequin</b> stood in for Barrès). Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, Dada au grand air ("Dada in the Open Air") or Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol ("The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.|$|E

Starting with the Uniqlo flagship store in Shanghai they {{worked with the}} architectural firm Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in making multiple <b>mannequins</b> flying in a 20-meter atrium and an overhead carousel of rotating <b>mannequins</b> in acrylic pods. [...] Those concepts helped Bohlin Cywinski Jackson to win the EuroShop RetailDesign award in 2012.|$|R
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted <b>mannequin</b> heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, Triple H {{would begin}} a {{controversial}} feud with Kane, {{leading to a}} match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a <b>mannequin</b> in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.|$|E
5|$|Scaramanga then {{proposes a}} pistol duel with Bond on the beach; {{the two men}} stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands {{in the place of}} a <b>mannequin</b> of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's {{security}} chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the helium of the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.|$|E

50|$|The Three <b>Mannequins</b> (German:Die drei <b>Mannequins)</b> is a 1926 German silent film {{directed}} by Jaap Speyer and starring Hans Albers, Anton Pointner and Paul Graetz. The film's sets {{were designed by}} the art director Hans Jacoby.|$|R
50|$|The first fashion <b>mannequins,</b> made of papier-mâché, {{were made}} in France in the mid-19th century. <b>Mannequins</b> were later made of wax to produce a more lifelike appearance. In the 1920s, wax was supplanted by a more durable {{composite}} made with plaster.|$|R
5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a <b>mannequin,</b> had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E

50|$|Graham Ibbeson {{created the}} lifelike <b>mannequins</b> {{used in the}} Jorvik experience. At first the faces of these <b>mannequins</b> were {{modelled}} from modern day people. Through advances in facial reconstruction technology eight new <b>mannequins</b> have been modelled through this process, which uses a low-powered laser beam and a video camera. These recreations were based on skulls found in a Viking age cemetery, {{although there is no}} guarantee that the skulls were Norse, and there is the possibility that they were Saxon.|$|R

25|$|Mindful of {{the fact}} the killer had evidently {{returned}} to sites of his previous murders to move the bodies, possibly in a sexual ritual, police theorized the killer may also attempt to return to this latest crime scene. Although earlier attempts to enforce news blackouts as {{to the discovery of}} victims Dawn Basom and Alice Kalom had proven unsuccessful, on this occasion, police successfully ordered a news blackout relating to the discovery of this latest victim. Beineman's body was replaced with that of a tailor's <b>mannequin,</b> and the gully surrounding this <b>mannequin</b> monitored by undercover officers.|$|E
