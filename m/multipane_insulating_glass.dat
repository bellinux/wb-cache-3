40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{vacuum insulated}} glazing {{in comparison to}} the <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> unit filled with inert gas. It describes the biggest problem of vacuum insulated glazing and presents solution. The first part describes component elements of a vacuum insulated glazing and <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> unit. Presented are all of the modes of energy transition through the glazing unit. Using various of glazing materials, we perform the calculations of construction physical parameters of glazing units in computer program WINDOW 7. 2. With the program we compare coefficient of heat transfer, the transmission of solar radiation and the transmission of light between vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> and insulation glass unit. Second part of the thesis presents the innovative method of flexible edge sealing for vacuum <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Flexible edge was developed in Swiss Federal Institute EMPA as a part of Winsmart project which was accepted inside the Seventh framework programme or short EP 7. Today's vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> unit on the market contains rigid edge seal. The temperature differences between the inner and outer pane causes the problem of differential expansion of the panes, which with a large temperature differences leads to bending and also breaking vacuum <b>insulated</b> <b>glass</b> unit. Winsmart project overcomes these problems by using the flexible edge seal. The thesis contains results of various tests made by developing the method and also the problems that we encounter by anodic bonding which is crucial to the flexible edge. We made three vacuum <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> units containing the innovating flexible edge which are presented including with there problems and weaknesses...|$|R

50|$|By far {{the most}} common glazing type, glass can be of an almost {{infinite}} combination of color, thickness, and opacity.For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4 inch (6 mm) monolithic and 1 inch (25 mm) <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Presently, 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in spandrel areas, while <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> {{is used for the}} rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2 inch (12 mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some inert gases, such as argon or krypton may be used to offer better thermal transmittance values. In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) <b>insulating</b> <b>glass.</b> Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, relative humidity, or sound transmission requirements, such as laboratory areas or recording studios.|$|R

40|$|The façade {{significantly}} {{influences the}} energy {{efficiency of the}} building. However, in addition to high insulating properties, modern architecture demands a high transparency for natural illumination and the compliance with inner comfort criteria in the building. The increasing use of glass {{can be seen as}} the architectural intention to combine those well-being and energetic principles. The highest transparency can be achieved with point-fitted glass units. Though, insufficient knowledge is present to use point fittings for insulation glass units, which are required to comply with the demand for energy-efficiency. Therefore, research has been carried out to investigate in the load bearing mechanism of different point-fitted <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> units in order to find an innovative point fitting connection system for <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> units to the steel substructures. This paper presents results of this research campaign and provides information on how to design point-fitted <b>insulating</b> <b>glass</b> units...|$|R
