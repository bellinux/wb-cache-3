5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> attempt at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of WS-120A, the Air Force <b>made</b> <b>no</b> further development of new ICBMs until 1972. In that year the M-X project was begun, {{which resulted in the}} development of the LGM-118 Peacekeeper. The Peacekeeper entered service in the mid-1980s and served until 2005; the Minuteman III is still in service, and has outlasted both of its planned replacements.|$|E

5|$|Chekhov had {{at first}} written stories only for {{financial}} gain, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which {{have influenced the}} evolution of the modern short story. He <b>made</b> <b>no</b> apologies for the difficulties this posed to readers, insisting that the role of an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them.|$|E
5|$|Coandă and his 1910 {{aircraft}} {{were absent}} from much of aviation {{literature of the}} day. None of the annual issues of Jane's All the World's Aircraft ever mentioned the Coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant. The Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin <b>made</b> <b>no</b> mention of Coandă in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early '30s.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground.

There were very few men left by this time, what men there were, were formed into six troops. No. 1 and 2 Troops were made up of L Detachment based at Geneifa under the command of David Stirling, while 60 men from the disbanded No. 11 (Scottish) Commando <b>made</b> up <b>No.</b> 3 Troop. <b>No.</b> 51 Commando <b>made</b> up <b>No.</b> 4 and No. 5 Troops and the Special Boat Section <b>made</b> up <b>No.</b> 6 Troop. These designations, however, were largely ignored as the men referred to themselves by their old designations.|$|R
5|$|Icke <b>made</b> <b>no</b> {{effort at}} school, {{but when he}} was nine, he was chosen for the junior school's third-year {{football}} team. It {{was the first time he}} had succeeded at anything, and he came to see football as his way out of poverty. He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 James {{wrote an}} account of the operation, {{entitled}} I Was Monty's Double (published in the United States as The Counterfeit General).
