50|$|The LaMer {{model for}} the {{kinetics}} {{of the formation of}} hydrosols is widely applicable for production of monodisperse systems, and it was originally hypothesized that the Stöber process followed this monomer addition model. This model includes a rapid burst of nucleation forming all of the particle growth sites, then proceeds with hydrolysis as the rate-limiting step for condensation of triethylsilanol monomers to the nucleation sites. The production of <b>monodisperse</b> <b>particle</b> sizes is attributed to monomer addition happening at a slower rate on larger particles as a consequence of diffusion-limited mass transfer of TEOS. However, experimental evidence demonstrates that the concentration of hydrolyzed TEOS stays above that required for nucleation until late into the reaction, and the introduction of seeded growth nuclei does not match the kinetics of a monomer addition process. Consequently, the LaMer model has been rejected in favour of a kinetic model based around growth via particle aggregation.|$|E

Major considerations and conclusions of the development are: the best material to use is Type A, which is capable of ultra-high-purity and which does not show the 0. 243 micrometer absorption band; the reflection efficiency of fused silica is decreased at higher temperatures due to the bathochromic shift of the ultraviolet cut-off; for a given silica material, over the wavelength region and particle sizes tested, the <b>monodisperse</b> <b>particle</b> size configurations produce higher reflectances than continuous particle size configurations; and the smaller <b>monodisperse</b> <b>particle</b> size configurations give higher reflectance than the larger ones.

40|$|By {{combining}} X-ray tomography {{data and}} computer-generated porous elec- trodes, {{the impact of}} microstructure on the energy and power density of lithium-ion batteries is analyzed. Specifically, for commercial LiMn 2 O 4 electrodes, results indi- cate that a broad particle size distribution of active material delivers up to two times higher energy density than monodisperse-sized particles for low discharge rates, and a <b>monodisperse</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution delivers the highest energy and power density for high discharge rates. The limits of traditionally used microstructural properties such as tortuosity, reactive area density, particle surface roughness, morphological anisotropy were tested against degree of particle size polydispersity, thus enabling the identification of improved porous architectures. The effects of critical battery processing parameters, such as layer compaction and carbon black, were also rationalized {{in the context of}} electrode performance. While a <b>monodisperse</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution exhibits the lowest possible tortuosity and three times higher surface area per unit volume with respect to an electrode conformed of a polydisperse particle size distribution, a comparable performance can be achieved by polydisperse particle size distributions with degrees of polydispersity less than 0. 2 of particle size standard deviation. The use of non-spherical particles raises the tortuosity by as much as three hundred percent, which considerably lowers the power performance.
