40|$|The {{justification}} {{of the use}} of firearms and other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> – art. 53 of the Italian Criminal Code - is throughout examined, covering all the aspects that such a defense involves. After having enucleated the limits and differences of the justification in comparison with other defenses such as the self- defense and the public duty defense, the article examines the categories of public officers to which it applies, concluding that they are defined by laws that in specific parts of the legal system give the possibility of using physical force or even firearms in order to enforce other duties (i. e. preventing a commission of a crime, effecting an arrest, or a seizure, etc.). A particular focus is used in mentioning the limits that the local police encounters in using firearms under this rule. The specific elements – violence and resistance to authority –, necessary for the justification to arise, are defined, and attention is centered on the problem of applying the defense in occurrence of disobedience or escape. Proportionality, not expressly mentioned in the norm like necessity, is surely affirmed as a requisite, given that the article 53 is interpreted {{in the light of the}} Constitution and also in the light of the article 2 of the ECHR, viewed here as an instrument to restrict, not certainly to expand, the limit of the justification. These limits are affirmed in the special rule for the prevention of crime too, disciplined in second part of article 53. A final part is dedicated to special laws that mention the use of force or firearms in different areas of the legal system, such as in the article 41 of l. 354 / 1975, in the article 24 of the t. u. l. p. s. and in the l. 100 / 1958...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Increasing {{evidence}} indicates that harmful effects {{are associated with the}} use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> OBJECTIVES: To characterize the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> in intensive care units. Prevalence, adherence to protocols, and correlates of the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> were determined. For comparisons between ICUs, adjustments were made for differences in patients' characteristics. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional, observational multicenter study with a representative sample (n = 25) of all Dutch intensive care units, ranging from local hospitals to academic centers. Each unit was visited twice, and all 379 patients admitted during these visits were included and were examined for use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> RESULTS: <b>Physical</b> <b>restraint</b> was used in 23 % of all patients (range, 0 %- 56 % for different units). Of all 346 nurses interviewed, 31 % reported using a protocol when applying <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> When corrections were made for clustering within units, the risk for use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> was increased in patients with delirium or coma, in patients who could not communicate verbally, and in patients receiving psychoactive or sedative medications. Sex, severity of illness, and nurse to patient ratio were not independently related to use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> In 11 units (44 %), use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> was more frequent than expected on the basis of patients' characteristics, although this finding was not significant.

40|$|Background: The use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> {{by family}} {{caregivers}} with home-dwelling elders {{has not been}} extensively studied {{but it might be}} widespread. Furthermore, it is also not clear how home care providers who support family caregivers perceive the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> in elders’ homes. This study assessed family caregivers’ and home care providers’ knowledge and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> used with elders living at home in Japan, a country with the highest proportion of elders in the world and where family caregiving is common. Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional study of 494 family caregivers, 201 home helpers, 78 visiting nurses, 131 visiting physicians, and 158 care managers of home-dwelling frail elders needing some care and medical support in Japan, using questionnaires on knowledge <b>of</b> 11 <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> procedures prohibited in institutions and 10 harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints,</b> perceptions <b>of</b> 17 reasons for requiring <b>physical</b> <b>restraints,</b> and experiences involving <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> use. Results: Family caregivers were aware of significantly fewer recognized prohibited <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> procedures and recognized harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> than home care providers, and differences among home care providers were significant. The average importance rating from 1 (least) to 5 (most) of the 17 reasons for requiring <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> was significantly higher among family caregivers than home care providers, and significantly different among the home care providers. Moreover, these differences depended in part on participation in <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> education classes. While 20. 1 % of family caregivers had wavered over using <b>physical</b> <b>restraints,</b> 40. 5 % of home care providers had seen <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> used in elders’ homes and 16. 7 % had advised <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> use or used <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> themselves. Conclusions: Knowledge and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> differed between family caregivers and home care providers and were also diverse among home care providers. Because both groups might be involved in <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> use with home-dwelling elders, home care providers should acquire standardized and appropriate knowledge and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> to help family caregivers minimize abusive <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> use. 浜松医科大学学位論文　医博論第 514 号（平成 26 年 6 月 20 日...|$|R
40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>restraint</b> is {{a common}} nursing {{intervention}} in intensive care units and nurses often use it to ensure patients' safety and to prevent unexpected accidents. However, existing literature indicated that the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> is a complex one because of inadequate rationales, the negative physical and emotional effects on patients, {{but the lack of}} perceived alternatives. This paper is aimed to interpret the clinical decision-making theories related to the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> in intensive care units in order to facilitate our understanding on the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> and to evaluate the quality of decisions made by nurses. By reviewing the literature, intuition and heuristics are the main decision-making strategies related to the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> in intensive care units because the rapid and reflexive nature of intuition and heuristics allow nurses to have a rapid response to urgent and emergent cases. However, it is problematic if nurses simply count their decision-making on experience rather than incorporate research evidence into clinical practice because of inadequate evidence to support the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> Besides that, such a rapid response may lead nurses to make decisions without adequate assessment and thinking and therefore biases and errors may be generated. Therefore, despite the importance of intuition and heuristics in decision-making in acute settings on the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint,</b> it is recommended that nurses should incorporate research evidence with their experience to make decisions and adequate assessment before implementing <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> is also necessary...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Criminal Justice) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> {{in order}} to control violent or {{aggressive}} adolescents and adults continues to be practiced widely throughout various agencies, as it has for many years. Historically the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> in educational settings has typically been in special education programs, but recent reports show that the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> is believed to be used more broadly and being widely integrated into more schools. While there is no exact number on the amount or extent of injuries to students or to staff {{as a result of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint,</b> it is believed that the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> has increased as more students with difficult or severe behavioral needs are being served in schools throughout the nation. Injuries and deaths associated with the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in school settings have come to the attention of the public and have created an increased concern of the use of these procedures in school settings. While most professionals view restraint as an emergency procedure, little is known about its intended purpose or outcomes, let alone whether it achieves that purpose or is effective in achieving desired outcomes. The dearth of information about the purpose, use and outcome <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> in school settings is of great concern considering that educators are supposed to rely on evidence-based practices that are supported by scientific research. This study aims to determine the relationship between the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> and subsequent injuries in school settings. Sources of Data 	This study is based on data gathered from nonpublic agency records of a Non-Public School located on site of a California Residential Treatment Facility for adolescent males from September 1, 2004 to August 31, 2005. Within the facility is a staff operated incident report database containing information on every incident for the entire facility, for which an incident report was required to be written. From the incident report database facility staff created a new database excluding all personal information that could have been used to identify the students or staff involved in the <b>physical</b> <b>restraint.</b> Data for this study were gathered from the newly created incident report database excluding all personal information. Conclusions Reached 	The highest number <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> occurred within the fall months of September, October and November throughout the 2004 - 2005 school year. With 87 total restraints in September, 83 <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in October, and 72 <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in November, this data supported Hypothesis 4 that the highest number of restraints would occur within the fall months, specifically September, October and November, when comparing the number <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> <b>of</b> all four seasons. 						This study also revealed that students yielded a higher number <b>of</b> injuries from <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> compared to staff, supporting Hypothesis 1. Specifically there were 96 student injuries, compared to 36 staff injuries. Another finding was the time of day in which the highest percentage of injuries as an effect <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> occurred was from 11 : 01 am to 12 : 00 pm. These findings did not support Hypothesis 3, which stated that the highest percentage of injuries would occur during the first hour of school, specifically 8 : 00 am to 9 : 00 am. 								Lastly, the Team Prone Restraint yielded the highest number of injuries compared to any other type <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint,</b> with 60 injuries between students and staff.

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> in {{residential}} treatment centers for children {{has been shown}} to be detrimental to both staff and the children. Although there have been nationwide initiatives to reduce or eliminate the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> on children, to date, researchers have not yet identified the organizational factors that predict the likelihood <b>of</b> using <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> on children. Based on the two-factor theory, in which two different types of predictors of motivation and behavior in the workplace were identified, the purpose of this quantitative non-experimental study was to examine whether satisfaction with pay, a hygiene factor, and satisfaction with supervision and perceived organizational support, motivating factors, predict the frequency of the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints.</b> Satisfaction with pay and supervision were measured using the Job Satisfaction Survey and perceived organizational support was measured using the Perceived Organizational Support Survey.

The results indicated that satisfaction with supervision was negatively and statistically significantly related to the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> on children {{in residential}} care and satisfaction with pay approached significance.

Methods: APA members were surveyed regarding their use or avoidance <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> and alternate techniques to facilitate induction; factors affecting choice of technique; and extent of preoperative discussion. The anonymous online survey used both structured and free-text responses. Results: Of 596 surveys, 310 were returned, a 52 % response rate. Use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> and extent <b>of</b> restraint employed declines with increasing child age.

The present thesis is based on three main data collections, two census surveys conducted within institutional care for old people in the county of Västerbotten in 2000 (n= 3, 804) and 2007 (n= 2, 970) and one cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) including 40 group dwellings for people suffering from dementia where the intervention consisted of staff education. The use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> increased slightly between 2000 and 2007 (16. 2 % to 18. 4 %, p= 0. 016). Analyses suggest that the increase might be independent of any change in resident characteristics. Restrained residents were also subjected to restraints for longer times in 2007. During a six-month follow-up 64 / 160 (40. 0 %) residents in group dwellings for those with dementia sustained at least one fall. Independent risk factors for falls were ‘requiring help with hygiene’, ‘displaying verbally disruptive/attention-seeking behavior’, ‘able to rise from a chair’, ‘walking with assistive devices’, and ‘participating in outdoor walks’, which explained 36. 1 % of the falls. The majority of the 191 falls were un-witnessed, 35 % occurred during the night and anxiety and confusion were the most common symptoms preceding the falls. A six-month restraint minimization program showed a positive impact on staff knowledge, attitudes and work environment as well as on the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> and subjectively estimated quality of care. Residents in the intervention group present throughout the entire study period had lower odds, relative to the residents in the control group of being physically restrained at follow-up (OR= 0. 21, CI 95 %= 0. 08 - 0. 57) after controlling for potential confounders and the cluster effect. Adjusted analyses including all residents present at either baseline or follow-up also showed that the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> was less in the intervention group relative to the control group at follow-up. There was no change in the occurrence of falls or use of psychoactive drugs. The intervention also reduced stress of conscience, job demands and strain in the staff, and improved their job control and the caring climate. Subgroup analysis indicated a greater effect in units where the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> had been reduced or remained constant. In conclusion, <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> use and falls remains common in institutional care of old people. The practice <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraint</b> seems to have changed. In the RCT it was found that it is possible to change restraint practice and also to improve staff work environment. Falls among residents with dementia require a certain mobility function and anxiety and confusion are common symptoms preceding falls...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of dementia care for nursing home residents is the management of symptoms such as behavioral problems and wandering. Nursing homes can manage these symptoms using a mix of labor, medications and <b>physical</b> <b>restraints.</b> Medications such as antipsychotics are hypothesized to be a substitute for direct care staff, while <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> {{are considered to be}} a complement to staff time. Using an instrumental variables approach, we investigate whether an increase in nursing home wages leads to greater substitution towards antipsychotic medications and away from the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints.</b> Our results suggest a 10 % increase in weekly nursing home wages increases the inappropriate use of antipsychotics among dementia patients by 1. 1 % to 3. 5 %, while it decreases the use <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>restraints</b> by roughly 26 % to 28 %. These findings suggest policymakers should consider nursing home market factors when overseeing and regulating issues of nursing home quality.
