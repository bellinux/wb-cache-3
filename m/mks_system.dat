40|$|This paper {{discusses}} systematic errors which {{arise from}} exclusive {{use of the}} <b>MK</b> <b>system</b> to determine reddening. It is found that implementation of uvby, beta photometry to refine the qualitative MK grid substantially reduces stellar mismatch error. A working definition of 'identical' ubvy, beta types is investigated {{and the relationship of}} uvby to B-V color excesses is determined. A comparison is also made of the hydrogen based uvby, beta types with the <b>MK</b> <b>system</b> based on He and metal lines. A small core correlated effective temperature luminosity error in the <b>MK</b> <b>system</b> for the early B stars is observed along with a breakdown of the MK luminosity criteria for the late B stars. The second part investigates the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction in the ultraviolet wavelength range observed with the TD- 1 satellite. In this study the sets of identical stars employed to find reddening are determined more precisely than in previous studies and consist only of normal, nonsupergiant stars. A multivariate analysis of variance techniques in an unbiased coordinate system is used for determining the wavelength dependence of reddening...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the changes made from Cal Poly’s initial railgun <b>system,</b> the <b>Mk.</b> 1 railgun, to the <b>Mk.</b> 1. 1 <b>system,</b> {{as well as}} the design, fabrication, and testing of a newer and larger <b>Mk.</b> 2 railgun <b>system.</b> The <b>Mk.</b> 1. 1 <b>system</b> is developed as a more efficient alteration of the original <b>Mk.</b> 1 <b>system,</b> but is found to be defective due to hardware deficiencies and failure, as well as unforeseen efficiency losses. A <b>Mk.</b> 2 <b>system</b> is developed and built around donated hardware from the Naval Postgraduate School. The <b>Mk.</b> 2 <b>system</b> strove to implement an efficient, augmented, electromagnetic railgun and projectile system capable of firing an approximate 1 g aluminum projectile to speeds exceeding 2 km/s. A novel three part projectile is proposed to mitigate rail and projectile degradation. Projectile and sabot system kinematic equations are derived and the projectile is designed and tested along with Mk. 2 barrel. A numerical electromechanical model is developed to predict the performance of the <b>Mk.</b> 2 <b>system</b> and projectile assembly, and predicts a final velocity for the fabricated system exceeding 3. 5 km/s and an efficiency as high as 24 %. Testing of the <b>Mk.</b> 2 <b>system</b> showed catastrophic failure of the projectile during initial acceleration, resulting in very short acceleration times and distance, low velocity projectiles, and low efficiencies. During further testing of various projectile configurations, the barrel structure failed due to a large internal arc. Future work for the <b>Mk.</b> 2 <b>system</b> is discussed, a revised external barrel structure suggested, and a solid, more conventional solid chevron projectile design suggested...|$|R

500|$|In 1837 {{the metric}} system was re-adopted by France, and also {{during the first}} half of the 19th century was adopted by the {{scientific}} community. In the middle of the century, James Clerk Maxwell put forward the concept of a coherent system where a small number of units of measure were defined as base units, and all other units of measure, called derived units, were defined in terms of the base units. Maxwell proposed three base units: length, mass and time. This concept worked well with [...] mechanics, but attempts to describe electromagnetic forces in terms of these units encountered difficulties. By the end of the 19th century, four principal variants of the metric system were in use for the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena: three based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS system), and one on the metre-kilogram-second system of units (<b>MKS</b> <b>system).</b> This impasse was resolved by Giovanni Giorgi, who in 1901 proved that a coherent system that incorporated electromagnetic units had to have an electromagnetic unit as a fourth base unit.|$|E
5000|$|Historically {{the use of}} the <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> {{of units}} succeeded the centimetre-gram-second system of units (CGS) in {{commerce}} and engineering, (1889). The metre and kilogram system served {{as the basis for the}} development of the International System of Units, which now serves as the international standard. Because of this, the standards of the CGS system were gradually replaced with metric standards incorporated from the <b>MKS</b> <b>system.</b> The exact list of units used in the <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> changed over time. It incorporated base units other than the metre, kilogram, and second in addition to derived units. An incomplete list of the base and derived units appears below. Since the <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> of units never had a governing body to rule on a standard definition, the list of units depended on different conventions at different times.|$|E
50|$|The gram was the {{fundamental}} {{unit of mass}} in the 19th-century centimetre-gram-second system of units (CGS). The CGS system co-existed with the <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> of units, first proposed in 1901, {{during much of the}} 20th century, but the gram has been displaced by the kilogram as {{the fundamental}} unit for mass when the <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> was chosen for the SI base units in 1960.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, W. W. Morgan and William P. Bidelman {{published}} {{a paper on}} interstellar reddening using the <b>MK</b> <b>system</b> of spectral classifications and photoelectric photometry.

5000|$|In 1946, Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) {{resolution}} 2 standardized {{the unit}} of force in the <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> of units to be the amount needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass {{at the rate of}} 1 metre per second squared. In 1948, the 9th CGPM resolution 7 adopted the name [...] "newton" [...] for this force. The <b>MKS</b> <b>system</b> then became the blueprint for today's SI system of units.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of an electrical impedance mammography (EIM) {{system with a}} rotary planar electrode array, named RPEIM, is presented. The RPEIM system is an evolution of the Sussex <b>MK</b> 4 <b>system,</b> which is a prototype instrument for breast cancer detection. Comparing it with the other planar electrode EIM systems, the rotation feature enables {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of independent measurements. To assist impedance evaluation exploiting electrode array rotation, a synchronous mesh method is proposed. Using the synchronous mesh method, the RPEIM system is shown to have superior performance in image accuracy, spatial resolution and noise tolerance over the <b>MK</b> 4 <b>system.</b> To validate the study, we report simulations based on a close-to-realistic 3 D digital breast phantom, which comprises of: skin, nipple, ducts, acinus, fat and tumor. A digital breast phantom of a real patient is constructed, whose tumor was detected using the <b>MK</b> 4 <b>system.</b> The reconstructed conductivity image of the breast phantom indicates that the breast phantom is a close replica of the patient’s real breast as assessed by the <b>MK</b> 4 <b>system</b> in a clinical trial.

40|$|The {{design of}} the 300 <b>mK</b> <b>system</b> for Herschel-SPIRE is complex, with many difficult, {{sometimes}} conflicting, requirements and constraints placed upon it. Five detector arrays, mounted from a 2 K box, are linked to a single 3 He sorption-cooler tip by a high-conductance copper strap network. This strap retains high thermal conductance, even though it incorporates an electrical break {{to comply with the}} SPIRE grounding scheme. It requires stiffness to withstand launch vibrations, but needs compliance to avoid transmission of loads to the detector arrays. The strap is stiffly supported by novel, compact cryogenic stand-offs which provide a high degree of thermal isolation from the 2 K stage. An additional complication is that the detectors reside in a 2 K environment, whilst the cooler tip is in a 4 K environment. Two of the cryogenic stand-offs also act as light-tight feed-throughs to pass the strap from the 4 K environment {{to the inside of the}} 2 K detector boxes. Active thermal control is provided on the 300 <b>mK</b> <b>system</b> to address the detector stability requirements. This paper describes the system, and gives results of the performance in SPIRE flight model ground tests...|$|R
50|$|With {{advances}} {{in the theory of}} electromagnetism and in quantity calculus, it became apparent that a coherent absolute system of units could only include one electromagnetic base unit.

5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 19th century, after James Clerk Maxwell's discoveries, it {{was clear}} that {{electric}} measurements could not be explained in terms of the three fundamental units of length, mass and time, and that some irrational coefficiens appeared in the equations without any logical physical reason.

50|$|As an {{undergraduate}} at Harvard College, Bidelman received an Honorary Harvard College Scholarship for academic excellence in 1939. He graduated in 1940.
