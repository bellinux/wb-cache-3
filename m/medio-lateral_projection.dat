40|$|AIM: To {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} grid technology to produce a database of mammograms and supporting patient data, specifically using breast density as a biomarker of risk for breast cancer, for epidemiological purposes. METHOD: The cohort comprised 1737 women from the UK and Italy, aged 28 e 87 years, mean 54. 7 years, who underwent mammography after giving consent {{to the use of}} their data in the project. Information regarding height, weight, and exposure data (mAs and kV) was recorded. The computer program Generate-SMF was applied to all films in the database to measure breast volume, dense breast volume, and thereby percentage density. Visual readings of density using a six-category classification system were also available for 596 women. RESULTS: The UK and Italian participants were similar in height, but the UK women were significantly heavier with a slightly higher body mass index (BMI), despite being younger. Both absolute and percentage breast density were significantly higher in the Udine cohort. Images from the <b>medio-lateral</b> <b>projection</b> (MLO) give a significantly lower percentage density than cranio-caudal (CC) images (p < 0. 0001). Total breast volume is negatively associated with percentage density, as are BMI and age (p < 0. 0001 for all), although 80...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The use of {{bone graft}} is still {{debatable}} for treating comminuted fracture. Autograft is the gold standardof bone graft. However, {{it has a}} limitation in supply. Therefore, the use of other source of graft (allograft, xenograft,or synthetic) is increasing. Graft must have good biocompatibility {{in order to enhance}} fracture healing. Materials and methods. Randomized post test only control group was conducted in 30 Sprague-Dawley rats inorder to evaluate biocompatibility of the scaffold. We used hidroxyapatite (HA) -Bongros®, nanocrystalline (HA) -CaSO 4 (Perossal®), nanocrystalline HA (Ostim®), morselized bovine xenograft (BATAN), dan local HA from dr. Sutomo Hospital as the scaffold. Tissue reaction (foreign body giant cell (FBGC) and lymphocyte), radiological andhistological score was evaluated at 8 th weeks. Results. The amount of FBGC and histological score showed significant difference (p= 0, 003 and p= 0, 013). LocalHA scaffold showed the most FBGC accumulation. There {{was no significant difference in}} the amount of lymphocyte(p= 0, 397) and radiological score (p= 0, 204 for antero-posterior projection and p= 0, 506 for <b>medio-lateral</b> <b>projection).</b> There was significant correlation between the amount of foreign body giant cell and histological score (p= 0, 034). Conclusions. Both physical and chemical factor influenced biocompatibility of scaffold. Scaffolds that have poresshowed better histological score compared to that has none. Chemical compound of the scaffold play important rolein tissue reaction. The amount of FBGC showed the cytotoxic level of the scaffold...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of two cases of osteochondritis dissecans affecting the lateral ridge of the trochlea of the tibial tarsal bone is described. Radiographs taken in <b>medio‐lateral</b> and oblique <b>projections</b> proved to be the most valuable for diagnosis. The lesions were treated surgically via a limited cranio‐lateral approach. The lameness improved following surgery. Copyrigh...|$|R
30|$|Screening {{mammography}} is a standardised procedure {{composed of}} four views (also named projections), two for each breast: the cranio-caudal <b>projection</b> and the <b>medio-lateral</b> oblique <b>projection.</b> In some countries, clinical breast examination {{is a part}} of the procedure, even though its added value in the screening setting, when mammography is performed, is negligible [4]. Screening mammography can be performed by a radiographer alone; the resulting images are usually read by two radiologists, independently, in separate sessions. If the examination is judged to not reveal any abnormality suspicious for malignancy, the woman receives a letter communicating this result. If something suspicious is found, the woman is recalled for a tailored further assessment that can be variably composed of additional mammographic views, tomosynthesis, ultrasound, MRI, CESM or needle biopsy. When this assessment is concluded, a formal written report will be prepared by the radiologist and given to the woman during a dedicated interview for complete information.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the radiation dose and image quality in conventional screen-film mammography and full-field digital mammography in women referred to mammography examination. Participants underwent bilateral, two-view screen-film mammography or full-field digital mammography. The visibility of anatomical regions and overall clinical image quality was rated by experienced radiologists. Total of 387 women and 1548 mammograms were enrolled in the study. Image quality was assessed in terms of image quality score, whereas patient dose assessment was performed in terms of mean glandular dose. Average mean glandular dose for cranio-caudal projection was 1. 5 mGy and 2. 1 mGy in full-field digital mammography and screen-film mammography, respectively. For <b>medio-lateral</b> oblique <b>projection,</b> corresponding values were 2. 3 and 2. 1 mGy. Overall image quality criteria scoring was 0. 82 and 0. 99 for screen-film and digital systems, respectively. The scores were in the range from 0. 11 to 1. 0 for different anatomical structures. Overall, full-field digital mammography was superior both in terms of image quality and dose over the screen-film mammography. The results have indicated that phantom dose values can assist in setting the optimisation activities in mammography and for comparison between mammography units. To obtain accurate diagnostic information with an acceptable radiation dose to breast, it is necessary to periodically perform patient dose and image quality surveys in all mammography units...|$|R
