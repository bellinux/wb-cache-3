5|$|Leaders of {{the main}} rebel coalition, the Syrian National Coalition, were angered by the agreement.

5|$|Shackleton {{had given}} Mackintosh the {{impression}} that he would if possible attempt his crossing during the coming 1914–15 Antarctic season. Before departing for the Weddell Sea, he changed his <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the feasibility of this timescale. Mackintosh was not informed of this change of plan; this misunderstanding led to the underprepared and near-chaotic depot-laying journeys of January–March 1915.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} King had only insisted on that oath {{to protect the}} {{stability}} of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, to swear that the King had changed his <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933, he was {{employed}} at the Sheba Gold Mine at Baberton. He enjoyed the work {{so much he}} contemplated studying for a mining degree.

5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him. Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki {{wanted them to be}} subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin would stay in Kaoru's dojo.|$|E

At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests how terrible it would be if immigrants were deported, explaining they make the United States thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes, with 95% of voters voting yes. After the ballot is passed, the only person deported is Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E

5|$|Danish author Steen Steensen Blicher, {{an amateur}} {{archaeologist}} {{and one of}} the first to visit the site, made the first literary reference to the Haraldskær Woman. In 1836, he published his novella Gravhøjen which was a parody about a mistaken archaeological find. However, by 1841 Blicher seemed to have changed his <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the Haraldskær Woman's identity when he wrote the poem Dronning Gunhild, a lament for the dead queen in the bog. In 1846, the Danish playwright Jens Christian Hostrup wrote his comedy, A Sparrow Doing a Crane Dance, (En Spurv i Tranedans), in which the ghost of Queen Gunnhild gives a magical ring to a scheming tailor and makes everyone blind to his actions. Hostrup's play indirectly satirized the theory that the Haraldskær Woman was Queen Gunnhild, and became the first major public endorsement of Worsaae’s hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut as a second-half {{substitute}} in Valencia's Champions League group-stage defeat {{at home to}} Chelsea, and started the next league match, another home defeat against Espanyol, but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores, who had signed him, or by successor Ronald Koeman. With the transfer window approaching, Koeman had given Žigić two weeks to convince him he was worth keeping. Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December, Valencia had not scored for six matches, and they were soon 1–0 down to third-tier opponents Real Union. Žigić came on and scored twice to turn the match around, and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw at Real Zaragoza. A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman changed his <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the player leaving, but he made only nine league appearances (two starts) in {{what remained of the}} season, and was sent off in the first of those.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{business}} issues forced Tibbets's family {{to return to}} Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only {{a year and a}} half as he changed his <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> wanting to become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E

5|$|Keen to {{strengthen}} Bolton for a European push in the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, {{and in an}} unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who changed his <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two {{games of the season}} left to play, and the following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E
5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own <b>mind</b> <b>about</b> the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
