5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit <b>moonlight</b> avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to <b>moonlight.</b> During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we examine the cyclicality by sex of <b>moonlighting</b> and <b>moonlighting</b> hours. We find that, once we account for the sample {{selection}} into employment, {{both men and women}} exhibit procyclical <b>moonlighting</b> probabilities. Likewise, <b>moonlighting</b> hours for male multiple job holders are procyclical. These findings contradict the frequent claim that <b>moonlighting</b> increases during economic downturns due to economic hardship. Instead, <b>moonlighting</b> appears responsive to growing employment opportunities during economic expansions. At any rate, the systematic variation of <b>moonlighting</b> over the business cycle may have implications for the procyclical nature of real wages...|$|R

40|$|Civil {{servants}} such {{as teachers}} and doctors allocate their resources into service delivery which benefit society, and <b>moonlighting</b> for alternative means of income. An actor balances service delivery against <b>moonlighting</b> when the <b>moonlighting</b> production function is concave. Then <b>moonlighting</b> decreases if the actor’s salary {{of service delivery}} increases, or his unit cost of service delivery or the value of <b>moonlighting</b> decreases. As the production efficiency of <b>moonlighting</b> increases above zero, <b>moonlighting</b> initially increases, continues to increase if the efficiency is high, and eventually decreases if the value of service delivery is high. Conversely, with linear or convex <b>moonlighting</b> production, the actor chooses either service delivery or <b>moonlighting.</b> Survey data from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Senegal is used to show the significance of poor service delivery within education and healthcare services.

40|$|Background: <b>Moonlighting</b> {{proteins}} perform {{two or more}} cellular functions, {{which are}} selected based on various contexts including the cell type they are expressed, their oligomerization status, and the binding of different ligands at different sites. To understand overall landscape of their functional diversity, {{it is important to}} establish methods that can identify <b>moonlighting</b> proteins in a systematic fashion. Here, we have developed a computational framework to find <b>moonlighting</b> proteins on a genome scale and identified multiple proteomic characteristics of these proteins. Results: First, we analyzed Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of known <b>moonlighting</b> proteins. We found that the GO annotations of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins can be clustered into multiple groups reflecting their diverse functions. Then, by considering the observed GO term separations, we identified 33 novel <b>moonlighting</b> proteins in Escherichia coli and confirmed them by literature review. Next, we analyzed <b>moonlighting</b> proteins in terms of protein-protein interaction, gene expression, phylogenetic profile, and genetic interaction networks. We found that <b>moonlighting</b> proteins physically interact with a higher number of distinct functional classes of proteins than non-moonlighting ones and also found that most of the physically interacting partners of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins share the latter’s primary functions. Interestingly, we also found that <b>moonlighting</b> proteins tend to interact with other <b>moonlighting</b> proteins. In terms of gene expression and phylogenetically related proteins, a weak trend was observed that <b>moonlighting</b> protein...|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we examine the cyclicality of <b>moonlighting</b> by gender. We {{estimate}} a random effects Tobit model of <b>moonlighting</b> among {{working men and women}} and find that, while male <b>moonlighting</b> behavior does not fluctuate significantly with the business cycle, female <b>moonlighting</b> does. The cyclicality of female <b>moonlighting</b> has, nonetheless, varied {{over the course of the}} past 35 years. Female <b>moonlighting</b> seemed to behave counter-cyclically during much of the 1980 s and early 1990 s, confirming the popular media belief that <b>moonlighting</b> is more likely to occur during periods of economic distress. Yet, this counter-cyclical behavior disappears during the 1993 - 99 period to become pro-cyclical by the early twentieth century. The recent pro-cyclicality of female <b>moonlighting</b> supports the idea that female workers respond to a need for “just-in-time” employment following the economic upturn of the mid to late 1990 s. ...|$|R
40|$|Proteins able to {{participate}} in unrelated biological processes have been grouped under the generic name of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins. Work with different yeast species has uncovered a great number of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins and shown their importance for adequate functioning of the yeast cell. <b>Moonlighting</b> activities in yeasts include such diverse functions as control of gene expression, organelle assembly, and modification of the activity of metabolic pathways. In this review, we consider several well-studied <b>moonlighting</b> proteins in different yeast species, paying attention to the experimental approaches used to identify them and the evidence that supports their participation in the unexpected function. Usually, <b>moonlighting</b> activities have been uncovered unexpectedly, and up to now, no satisfactory way to predict <b>moonlighting</b> activities has been found. Among the well-characterized <b>moonlighting</b> proteins in yeasts, enzymes from the glycolytic pathway appear to be prominent. For some cases, it is shown that despite close phylogenetic relationships, <b>moonlighting</b> activities are not necessarily conserved among yeast species. Organisms may utilize <b>moonlighting</b> to add a new layer of regulation to conventional regulatory networks.

50|$|A {{number of}} the {{currently}} known <b>moonlighting</b> proteins are evolutionarily derived from highly conserved enzymes, also called ancient enzymes.

40|$|Biological <b>moonlighting</b> {{refers to}} {{proteins}} which express {{more than one}} function. <b>Moonlighting</b> proteins occur in pathogenic and commensal {{as well as in}} Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The canonical functions of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins are in essential cellular processes, i. e., glycolysis, protein synthesis, chaperone activity, and nucleic acid stability, and their <b>moonlighting</b> functions include binding to host epithelial and phagocytic cells, subepithelia, cytoskeleton as well as to mucins and circulating proteins of the immune and hemostatic systems. Sequences of the <b>moonlighting</b> proteins do not contain known motifs for surface export or anchoring, and it has remained open whether bacterial <b>moonlighting</b> proteins are actively secreted to the cell wall or whether they are released from traumatized cells and then rebind onto the bacteria. In lactobacilli, ionic interactions with lipoteichoic acids and with cell division sites are important for surface localization of the proteins. <b>Moonlighting</b> proteins represent an abundant class of bacterial adhesins that are part of bacterial interactions with the environment and in responses to environmental changes.

Objective: This paper examines the potential health system consequences of agency nursing and <b>moonlighting</b> among South African nurses. Methods: During 2010, a cluster random sample of 80 hospitals was selected in four South African provinces. On the survey day, all nurses providing clinical care completed a self-administered questionnaire after giving informed consent. The questionnaire obtained information on socio-demographics, involvement in agency nursing and <b>moonlighting,</b> and self-reported indicators of potential health system consequences of agency nursing and <b>moonlighting.</b> A weighted analysis was done using STATA † 13.

40|$|Background Advancements in {{function}} prediction algorithms are enabling large scale computational annotation for newly sequenced genomes. With {{the increase in}} the number of functionally well characterized proteins it has been observed that there are many proteins involved in more than one function. These proteins characterized as <b>moonlighting</b> proteins show varied functional behavior depending on the cell type, localization in the cell, oligomerization, multiple binding sites, etc. The functional diversity shown by <b>moonlighting</b> proteins may have significant impact on the traditional sequence based function prediction methods. Here we investigate how well diverse functions of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins can be predicted by some existing function prediction methods. Results We have analyzed the performances of three major sequence based function prediction methods, PSI-BLAST, the Protein Function Prediction (PFP), and the Extended Similarity Group (ESG) on predicting diverse functions of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins. In predicting discrete functions of a set of 19 experimentally identified <b>moonlighting</b> proteins, PFP showed overall highest recall among the three methods. Although ESG showed the highest precision, its recall was lower than PSI-BLAST. Recall by PSI-BLAST greatly improved when BLOSUM 45 was used instead of BLOSUM 62. Conclusion We have analyzed the performances of PFP, ESG, and PSI-BLAST in predicting the functional diversity of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins. PFP shows overall better performance in predicting diverse <b>moonlighting</b> functions as compared with PSI-BLAST and ESG. Recall by PSI-BLAST greatly improved when BLOSUM 45 was used. This analysis indicates that considering weakly similar sequences in prediction enhances the performance of sequence based AFP methods in predicting functional diversity of <b>moonlighting</b> proteins.
