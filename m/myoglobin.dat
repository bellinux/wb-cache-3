Carbon monoxide bound to <b>myoglobin</b> may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from <b>myoglobin,</b> which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. <b>Myoglobin</b> was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than <b>myoglobin</b> being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by <b>myoglobin.</b> Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of <b>myoglobin</b> in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating <b>myoglobin</b> and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of <b>myoglobin</b> exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of <b>myoglobin</b> in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , <b>myoglobin</b> interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

In this paper, the relevance of guest-host interactions in xenon complexes with paramagnetic <b>myoglobins</b> (Mbs) is thoroughly analyzed, and the issue {{about the use of}} xenon to detect and characterize voids within flexible biomolecules is critically discussed. A detailed 1 H NMR study useful for describing the hydrophobic cavities close to the active site of low-spin ferric <b>myoglobins</b> with respect to their interaction with the xenon atom is presented. The method is subsequently validated by the analysis of Xe-Mb with two different <b>myoglobins,</b> extracted from horse and pig. These <b>myoglobins</b> differ by 14 amino acids. One of these, Ile 142 in horse Mb, is located in the proximal cavity, which is the main xenon binding site in horse Mb, and is replaced by Met 142 in pig Mb. We demonstrated specific behaviors associated with the capacity of each of the two <b>myoglobins</b> to bind xenon and provided site-specific information on the host-guest interaction. Moreover, 1 H NMR measurements produce a picture of xenon-related local distortions of the protein, associated with a functionally relevant residue located right at the active site, the proximal hystidine E 7 (His 93). According to the 1 H NMR data, xenon induces the tilt of the residue His 93 relative to the heme plane and consequently causes an alteration of the magnetic axes. Similar conclusions are obtained both for pig cyano-myoglobin and for horse cyano-myoglobin, the structural deformation being in the former of minor entity...|$|R

The native molecules are monomeric with M(r) 16, 000 - 17, 000 and pI 6. 5 - 7. 5. In each species, {{at least four}} different globin isoforms occur. Primary structure was determined at the protein level. The globin chains contain 147 amino acid residues. Although major determinants of the globin fold are conserved, characteristic substitutions are present. A Tyr residue occurs at the helical positions B 10 and E 7 (distal position). This is confirmed by MMR measurements (Zhang, W., Rashid, K. A., Haque, M., Siddiqi, A. H., Vinogradov, S. N., Moens, L. & La Mar, G. N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3000 - 3006). A distal Tyr normally provokes oxidation of the iron atom and the inability to bind oxygen, whereas a Tyr-B 10 is indicative for a high oxygen affinity. In contrast, trematode <b>myoglobins</b> are functional molecules with a high oxygen affinity. Molecular modeling predicts two possible positions for the aromatic ring of Tyr-E 7 : one being outside the heme pocket making it freely accessible to the ligand and one within the heme pocket potentially able to form a second hydrogen bond with the iron-bound oxygen.

5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. <b>Myoglobin,</b> on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than <b>myoglobin</b> in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that dry-aged buffalo (B. bubalis) meat becomes dark faster than bovine (B. taurus) meat, discouraging consumer purchase. We have investigated whether this faster darkening process might depend on structural and/or kinetic differences between buffalo and bovine <b>myoglobins</b> (Mbs). To this end, we have purified to homogeneity buffalo Mb from Longissimus dorsi muscle and obtained both its Mr (17, 034. 5) and the complete amino acid sequence, which, {{compared with the}} bovine one, showed three amino acid substitutions: Dbo 141 Ebu, Abo 19 Tbu and Abo 117 Dbu. As revealed by the 3 D structure, they were located {{on the surface of}} the protein, far from the heme binding pocket, and did not cause appreciable structural changes. Autoxidation rates of purified buffalo and bovine <b>myoglobins</b> at 37 °C, pH 7. 2, were almost identical (0. 052 ± 0. 001 h− 1 and 0. 054 ± 0. 002 h− 1, respectively), as were their oxygen-binding Kd values (3. 7 ± 0. 1 μM and 3. 5 ± 0. 1 μM, respectively). These data indicate that the structure of the heme pockets in the two proteins is similar, with similar functional properties. Moreover, the percent of MetMb values in the purified buffalo and bovine samples, after the same time from slaughtering, were almost identical (57 % and 47 %, respectively). The results presented here suggest that the faster darkening of buffalo meat depends on factors other than the oxidation rate of its Mb, as, for example, the Mb content (0. 393 ± 0. 005 g/ 100 g) and consequently its MetMb content, which is almost twice as high as bovine meat (0. 209 ± 0. 003 g/ 100 g), and likely other factors...|$|R

5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale <b>myoglobin</b> by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E

Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight.
