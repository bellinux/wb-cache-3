50|$|The {{precentral gyrus}} (a.k.a. <b>motor</b> <b>strip)</b> is a {{prominent}} structure {{on the surface}} of the posterior frontal lobe. It is the site of the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4).|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, lesions {{exclusively}} to Broca's area (the {{foot of the}} inferior frontal gyrus) do not produce Broca's aphasia, but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia,sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria. Not much is known about what other areas must be damaged {{in order to produce}} Broca's aphasia, but some maintain damage to the inferior preorlandic <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> (the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control) is also necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{regions of}} the frontal lobe {{responsible}} for motor skill include the primary motor cortex, the supplemental motor area and the premotor cortex. The primary motor cortex {{is located on the}} precentral gyrus and is often visualized as the motor homunculus. By stimulating certain areas of the <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> and observing where it had an effect, Penfield and Rassmussen were able to map out the motor homunculus. Areas on the body that have complex movements, such as the hands, have a bigger representation on the motor homunculus.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibility to discriminate the representation sites of lip and tongue movement in the primary motor cortex (PMC). In contrast to preceding studies this research was particularly focused on single subject analysis. Procedures: Six healthy right-handed volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by means of a 1. 5 tesla scanner. Using a block design the subjects had to perform two different motor tasks: horizontal tongue movement and symmetrical lip pursing. To ensure that only the functional selec-tive cortical representations for each particular motor task were determined, the approach of contrasting both motor paradigms was followed during data analysis. Principle results: Selective cortex activations for both motor tasks were detectable in the <b>motor</b> <b>strips</b> and could be spatially discrimi-nated for the whole group and for the majority of the single subjects in both hemispheres. Furthermore, expanded regions responsive to both motor tasks were found bilaterally. Conclusions: The individually proven possibility to differentiate the cortical representation sites of tongue and lip move-ments opens the chance to monitor therapeutic cortical effects after neuro-reconstructive surgery, e. g. hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) ...|$|R

5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary <b>motor</b> cortex, a <b>strip</b> of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "M1" [...] and {{the term}} [...] "primary motor cortex" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably. However, they come from {{different}} historical traditions and refer to different divisions of cortex. Some scientists suggested that the motor cortex could be divided into a primary <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> that was more posterior and a lateral premotor strip that was more anterior. Early researchers who originally proposed this view included Campbell, Vogt and Vogt Foerster, and Fulton. Others suggested that the motor cortex could not be divided in that manner. Instead, in this second view, the so-called primary motor and lateral premotor strips together composed a single cortical area termed M1. A second motor area on the medial wall of the hemisphere was termed M2 or the supplementary motor area. Proponents of this view included Penfield and Woolsey. Today {{the distinction between the}} primary motor cortex and the lateral premotor cortex is generally accepted. However, the term M1 is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to the primary motor cortex. Strictly speaking M1 refers to the single map that, according to some previous researchers, encompassed both the primary motor and the lateral premotor cortex.|$|E

[Method] Total 16 epilepsy patients were included in this study. <b>Motor</b> <b>strip</b> detection on MRI was performed based on the Iwasaki's method. F-MRI was performed using 1. 5 tesler MRI, task of tapping fingers in each hand. The activated area was visualized over the MRI and compared {{with the results of}} other modalities. [Results] We divided the patients into two groups based on the identification of <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> on MRI. Ten patients showed clear anatomical <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> on MRI, in which nine exhibited single gyrus activation, concordant with the anatomical <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> on MRI. Only one patient showed two gyri activation. Six patients showed unclear <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> on MRI, in which 3 demonstrated single gyrus activation, concordant with the direct cortical stimulation results. Three patients presented two gyri activation, evolving true <b>motor</b> <b>strip.</b> Four patients underwent MEG examination, which showed concordant results with the cortical stimulation results. [Conclusions] F-MRI is useful for the preoperative motor area estimation, especially for the patients with clear central sulcus on MRI.

40|$|Extract] When {{one of us}} (A. G. B.) {{was rather}} younger than he is today, he {{acquired}} the solemn responsibility for mowing the family lawn with a somewhat battered two-stroke motor mower. Each week, he would wheel it out, prime the carburettor and pull the starter cord. Occasionally it would start, but most weeks it would not. Out came the spanners, screwdrivers and a handy hubcap to keep all the bits, as the <b>motor</b> was <b>stripped</b> down and rebuilt. Finally, it would be repaired and the lawn mowed. But a paradox remained, for every time the mower was stripped down and rebuilt, a few pieces were left over: a split washer, a few screws, a nut or a strangely shaped piece of metal that seemed to fit… nowhere. After some years of this treatment, the question had to be asked: How few pieces can a lawnmower have and still run? The contemporary history of experimental models in immunology has taken something of an opposite path. Once the T-cell receptor (TCR) was cloned {{and the structure of}} the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -encoded ligands determined (and that nasty business with I-J swept under the carpet), there was a general feeling that the vertebrate immune system did not need many parts. It should be possible (it was reasoned) to create an experiment that would demonstrate at what point tolerance was induced and what cell or factor was responsible for its production. And so the three pieces of the machine were assembled: TCR; peptide antigen; and restriction molecule. The critical tool in the assembly was the use of transgenic technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} dynamics, quantified through {{the analysis of the}} electrodermal activity (EDA), is modulated according to affective haptic stimuli. Specifically, a haptic display able to convey caress-like stimuli is presented to 32 healthy subjects (16 female). Each stimulus is changed according to six combinations of three velocities and two forces levels of two <b>motors</b> stretching a <b>strip</b> of fabric. Subjects were also asked to score each stimulus in terms of arousal (high/low activation) and valence (pleasant/unpleasant), in agreement with the circumplex model of affect. EDA was processed using a deconvolutive method, separating tonic and phasic components. A statistical analysis was performed in order to identify significant differences in EDA features among force and velocity levels, as well as in their valence and arousal scores. Results show that the simulated caress induced by the haptic display significantly affects the EDA. In detail, the phasic component seems to be inversely related to the valence score. This finding is new and promising, since it can be used, e. g., as an additional cue for haptics design...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of those}} brain areas defined by Brodmann {{have their own}} complex {{internal}} structures. In a number of cases, brain areas are organized into topographic maps, where adjoining bits of the cortex correspond to adjoining parts of the body, or of some more abstract entity. A simple example {{of this type of}} correspondence is the primary <b>motor</b> cortex, a <b>strip</b> of tissue running along the anterior edge of the central sulcus. Motor areas innervating each part of the body arise from a distinct zone, with neighboring body parts represented by neighboring zones. Electrical stimulation of the cortex at any point causes a muscle-contraction in the represented body part. This [...] "somatotopic" [...] representation is not evenly distributed, however. The head, for example, is represented by a region about three times as large as the zone for the entire back and trunk. The size of any zone correlates to the precision of motor control and sensory discrimination possible. The areas for the lips, fingers, and tongue are particularly large, considering the proportional size of their represented body parts.|$|R
40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} of the pedunculopontine nucleus and surrounding region (PPNR) is a novel treatment strategy for gait freezing in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). However, clinical results have been variable, {{in part because of}} the paucity of functional information that might help guide selection of the optimal surgical target. In this study, we use simultaneous magnetoencephalography and local field recordings from the PPNR in seven PD patients, to characterise functional connectivity with distant brain areas at rest. The PPNR was preferentially coupled to brainstem and cingulate regions in the alpha frequency (8 - 12 Hz) band and to the medial <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> and neighbouring areas in the beta (18 - 33 Hz) band. The distribution of coupling also depended on the vertical distance of the electrode from the pontomesencephalic line: most effects being greatest in the middle PPNR, which may correspond to the caudal pars dissipata of the pedunculopontine nucleus. These observations confirm the crucial position of the PPNR as a functional node between cortical areas such as the cingulate/ medial <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> and other brainstem nuclei, particularly in the dorsal pons. In particular they suggest a special role for the middle PPNR as this has the greatest functional connectivity with other brain regions...|$|E

Seizure frequency ranged from 4 - 10 per night. Scalp EEG showed few right frontal convexity spiking and intense secondary bilateral syncrhony (SBS). High resolution MRI directed to the frontal lobes was normal. Ictal SPECT suggested a right fronto-lateral focus. Ictal video-EEG showed no focal onset. She was submitted to invasive recordings after subdural plates implantation. Electrodes covered all the frontal convexity and mesial surface bilaterally. Ictal recordings disclosed stereotyped seizures starting from the right mesial frontal. Using a high-resolution tool to measure intra and interhemispheric latencies, the timing and direction of seizure spread from the right fronto-mesial region were studied. <b>Motor</b> <b>strip</b> mapping was performed by means of electrical stimulation.

40|$|Volatile anesthetics are potent bronchodilators, but {{the site}} of action for the {{dilation}} is unclear. To determine {{the site of}} action of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on the peripheral vagal <b>motor</b> pathway, isolated <b>strips</b> of canine trachealis muscle were stimulated before and during exposure to halothane at 0. 3, 1. 0, 1. 7, or 2. 4 MAC, enflurane at 1 MAC, or isoflurane at 1 MAC. The sites and methods of stimulation were: 1) postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the intramural parasympathetic ganglia, with 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP); 2) postganglionic cholinergic nerve fibers, with electrical field stimulation (EFS); and 3) muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the smooth muscle, with acetylcholine (ACh). The concentration-response curve to DMPP was significantly shifted to the right by 0. 3 MAC halothane, whereas 0. 3 MAC halothane had no {{significant effect on the}} concentration-response curves to ACh and EFS. At concentrations greater than 1 MAC of halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane, concentration-response curves to all three stimuli were shifted significantly to the right; i. e., the contractile responses to ACh, EFS, and DMPP were reduced. At all concentrations of halothane the force of contraction was significantly more reduced during stimulation with DMPP than during stimulation with ACh, and at halothane concentrations {{greater than or equal to}} 1. 7 MAC the response to EFS was significantly more reduced than that to ACh. We conclude that halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane attenuated airway constriction by several mechanisms, including 1) reduced excitability of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptors of the intramural parasympathetic ganglia and 2) an effect on the smooth muscle and/or on the muscarinic receptors.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to develop new techniques for rolling mill setup and supervisory control. The study was based around three main components, namely a mathematical model of the process, its associated adaptation and an expert system. A novel architecture was developed to integrate the three components into a setup control system, along with some additional functions. The objective of the mill setup system {{is to determine the}} optimum mill actuator set points and control targets prior to the rolling of the slab. It is the function of the mill setup and supervisory control system to ensure that the material produced is of primary quality and that a high productivity level is achieved.;The novel control architecture incorporates three main components. Firstly, process models are used to predict the states of the rolling process prior to rolling. These models predict the rolling load, <b>motor</b> power and <b>strip</b> temperature, thermal camber of the work rolls, deflection of the mill stack and the profile and shape of the strip. Adaptation ensures that there is a good agreement between measurements and the model predictions. The adaptation is split into two main levels. A Kalman filter is used to predict short term errors in the process model from one pass to the next. Long term variations in the process are tracked using the recursive least squares algorithm. Finally the expert system is used to schedule the mill, diagnose possible faults occurring within the process and to supervise the activities of the other components in the control system.;The system is demonstrated in simulation and comparisons are made with and without the expert system control.

40|$|The {{region of}} cortex over which {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) can delay saccadic eye movement was investigated. With TMS delivered in the reaction time foreperiod of auditory-triggered saccades, saccade onset could be delayed by up to 60 ms.

These results demonstrate that the referential meaning of action words has a correlate in the somatotopic activation of motor and premotor cortex.

40|$|PURPOSE: To create {{qualitative}} maps of cerebral {{blood flow}} (CBF) with the EPISTAR (echo-planar imaging and signal targeting with alternating radio frequency) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EPISTAR technique was performed in a pig model of hypercapnia and then tested in 26 volunteers by using various paradigms for cortical activation. Echo-planar images were acquired with and without use of a radio-frequency inversion pulse applied to inflowing arterial spins. A qualitative map of CBF was then created by subtracting the image obtained without the radio-frequency pulse from that obtained with the radio-frequency pulse. RESULTS: Progressively more distal portions of the tagged vessels were seen as the inflow time was lengthened until cortical enhancement was seen for inflow times of approximately 1 second or longer. Signal intensity increases from rest to sensorimotor activation ranged from 13 % to 193 %.

Functional imaging in three modalities was performed preoperatively to compare the reliability of localization using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a conventional scanner with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Similar tasks were used for each imaging modality in an attempt to activate and identify the sensory and motor cortex. Data from all three modalities converged for the sensory task, and fMRI and PET data converged for the motor task.

The data confirmed the conclusions derived from the preoperative evaluations. This study demonstrates how conventional MRI scanners can be used for functional studies of use in surgical planning. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} of the human cortical substrate underlying simple horizontal saccadic eye movements was investigated using echoplanar {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in young healthy volunteers. Echoplanar imaging with signal targeting and alternating radiofrequency (EPISTAR), a novel perfusion technique, measured signal intensity changes in one to four contiguous 10 -mm slices centered to include both striate cortex and putative frontal eye fields during horizontal saccade and fixation conditions. Subtraction images of self-paced visually guided saccadic versus fixation conditions showed bilateral marked and statistically significant localized signal increases in the precentral region (Brodmann areas 4, 6) and peristriate cortex (areas 17, 18, 19) and qualitative increases in the superior medial frontal region, as identified by a Talairach-Tournoux generalized template in the brain slices that were scanned. Additional parietal activation occurred during a target-guided saccade task. Our data (i) support the localization of the human FEF, as identified by simple, nonexploratory saccadic eye movements, in the precentral <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> and premotor cortex, (ii) show individual variability in the exact anatomical {{location of}} saccade-related activations, and (iii) confirm that the EPISTAR technique can demonstrate localized signal increases during a behavioral task...|$|E
40|$|A new subtype of {{autoimmune}} encephalitis {{associated with}} antibodies against GABAB receptor was recently identified. Although immune-mediated functional abnormalities are suggested for the pathogenesis, functional brain imaging such as perfusion SPECT {{has not been}} documented. A 62 -year-old woman with anti-GABAB receptor associated encephalitis underwent 123 I-IMP SPECT in the beginning and after methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the cortical distribution of perfusion abnormality. The patient presented with clinical features of subacute limbic encephalitis. Antibodies to GABAB receptor were identified in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but no tumor was detected. Despite normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, the first SPECT revealed hypoperfusion of the frontal, parietal and medial temporal lobes, as well as thalamus, and cerebellum. These areas are known to contain high levels of GABAB receptors. In contrast, the SPECT revealed hyperperfusion in the <b>motor</b> <b>strip</b> and left temporal lobe, which are areas related to some of the patient's symptoms, including seizures, orolingual dyskinesia, and Wernicke aphasia. After treatment with pulses of methylprednisolone, the neuropsychiatric symptoms resolved and the SPECT findings showed substantial improvement in most of these regions. In conclusion, the findings suggest that immunotherapy improved the cortical dysfunction mediated by GABAB receptor antibodies...|$|E
