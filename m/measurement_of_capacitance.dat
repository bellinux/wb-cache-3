Furthermore, a novel, yet simplistic methodology for characterising various carbon nanomaterials (in terms of their edge and basal content) without recourse to expensive laboratory equipment is presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of 2 D-finite-element simulations of the periodic change in capacitance between two periodic structures, one sliding and one fixed (i. e. sense-structure). These structures are potentially interesting for long-range and high-accuracy position detection of microactuators. The use of periodic geometries and the combination of a discrete (incremental) and analog measurement relieves the demands for accuracy. The discrete measurement involves counting the number of periods. The (capacitance) analog measurement determines the position within one period, preferably with nm-accuracy. Two concepts are presented: (i) open-loop <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacitance</b> change versus slider displacement, (ii) closed-loop control of capacitance change versus slider displacement (i. e. sense-structure is actuated in orthogonal direction to the slider motion). These concepts are independent of their application in micro-scale devices but the realization raises particular challenges involving capacitance measurement and micromachining techniques. The periodic patterns examined in these simulations contain rectangular, triangular and sinusoidal shapes and several combinations. Simulation results for both concepts show measurable periodic changes in capacitance. For two arrays of 50 rectangular finger pairs along the sides of the slider the capacitance Cs 15 fF and ΔCmax 7 fF are predicted. Application of this concept in a micromachined device is advantageous because sensor and actuator are integrated in the same structural layer and allows fabrication using one lithographic mask only...|$|E
40|$|When polymer {{power cables}} were {{introduced}} into mediumvoltage {{applications in the}} late 1960 s, the degradationphenomenon later referred to aswater treeingwas still unknown. However, this changedwithin a relatively short space of time. Just 5 - 10 years afterthese first polymer applications, faults began to appear thatcould {{be attributed to the}} new phenomenon-water treeing. Sincethen, cable manufacturers have been improving their designsgradually, and cables produced today are assumed to have muchlower susceptibility to water trees. However, water treeing isstill assumed {{to be the most important}} degradation process inthese applications. There are huge amounts of polymer cable installations thatare degraded by water trees. Since many of these cables areinstalled in the same grid nets, one cable fault oftengenerates another. If two or more cables fail at the same time,the consequences can be extensive. A non-destructive diagnosticmethod makes it possible to assess cables and take action priorto failures. This thesis presents the results of research work on thedevelopment of a measurement technique and diagnostic methodfor the assessment of medium voltage XLPE cables in the field. The method used is called high voltage dielectric spectroscopy,and involves the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacitance</b> and loss as afunction of frequency at high voltages. The method is used in ashort frequency range of approximately one decade in thelow-frequency region (normally from 1 down to 0. 1 Hz). Thevoltage levels used initially are all below the service-voltagelevel. If the cable is assessed to be free from water trees, aslightly increased voltage can be used. Based on dielectric-spectroscopy measurements, specificwater-tree analysis and breakdown tests, a set of measurementprocedures and criteria that take into account differences incable designs has been proposed for the assessment of mediumvoltage XLPE cables. The characteristic responses of XLPEcables (in both non and water-tree-deteriorated cases) make itpossible to separate the cable response from the influence ofaccessories. Field experience shows thatwater-tree-deteriorated cables with relatively low breakdownstrengths can remain in service for many years.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of our study}} {{was to develop a}} novel capacitive force sensor that enables simultaneous measurements of yaw torque around the pressure axis and normal force and shear forces at a single point for the purpose of elucidating pressure ulcer pathogenesis and establishing criteria for selection of cushions and mattresses. Methods Two newly developed sensors (approximately 10 mm× 10 mm× 5 mm (10) and 20 mm× 20 mm× 5 mm (20)) were constructed from silicone gel and four upper and lower electrodes. The upper and lower electrodes had sixteen combinations that had the function as capacitors of parallel plate type. The full scale (FS) ranges of force/torque were defined as 0 – 1. 5 N, – 0. 5 - 0. 5 N and − 1. 5 - 1. 5 N mm (10) and 0 – 8. 7 N, – 2. 9 - 2. 9 N and − 16. 8 - 16. 8 N mm (20) in normal force, shear forces and yaw torque, respectively. The capacitances of sixteen capacitors were measured by an LCR meter (AC 1 V, 100 kHz) when displacements corresponding to four degrees of freedom (DOF) forces within FS ranges were applied to the sensor. The measurement was repeated three times in each displacement condition (10 only). Force/torque were calculated by corrected capacitance and were evaluated by comparison to theoretical values and standard normal force measured by an universal tester. Results In measurements of capacitance, the coefficient of variation was 3. 23 % (10). The Maximum FS errors of estimated force/torque were {{less than or equal to}} 10. 1 (10) and 16. 4 % (20), respectively. The standard normal forces were approximately 1. 5 (10) and 9. 4 N (20) when pressure displacements were 3 (10) and 2 mm (20), respectively. The estimated normal forces were approximately 1. 5 (10) and 8. 6 N (10) in the same condition.

40|$|Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) {{exhibit a}} number of {{physical}} properties that have opened new doors for technological advancements in space-based micropropulsion, focused ion beam, energy storage, and other research and industrial applications. As a family of concentrated electrolytes, RTIL electrochemical properties deviate from classical theories whose mean-field approach glossed over effects arising from the constituent ions' size and shape. Further development {{in the understanding of}} RTIL electrochemistry will drive better design towards enabling technologies, and this research contributes to the growing body of experimental data for RTIL electrochemical behavior with particular focus on applications towards electrospray propulsion devices. Electrochemical system behavior is governed by interfacial properties, in particular the electrical double layer (EDL). With no neutral solvent to fill the space between ions, the RTIL EDL takes on a complex, multilayered structure which lead to properties distinct from traditional aqueous electrolytes. A direct consequence of the layered structure is a differential capacitance curve that exhibits a local minimum at the potential of zero charge, flanked by two peaks followed by decaying wings. Recent modeling efforts have begun to capture these effects qualitatively, but require further tuning in order to quantitatively describe real systems. An electrochemical cell was designed to allow experimental <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacitance</b> curves, and the curves for two previously unreported RTILs are presented. The electro-chemical window is a limiting potential at which electrochemical reactions start. RTILs typically have large windows on the order of 4 - 6 V, as compared to the 1. 229 V at which water begins electrolysis. In micropropulsion, a large electrochemical window allows for longer continuous operation without adverse reactions. In energy storage, this allows for higher energy capacity by the square of potential. Another way to increase emission duration or capacity is by increasing the available electrode surface area, so that more charge can be stored before breaching the stability window. Porous materials can provide enormous specific areas, with the carbonized resorcinol-formaldehyde synthesized in this work giving approximately 1 m² g-¹ of electrode surface. Through a systematic comparison of this porous electrode and a flat metal electrode, it was confirmed that an electrode with mean pore size of approximately 2 [mu]m locally exhibits the same impedance as at a nonporous surface. Two electrospray emitter devices were used to study the charging dynamics of flat and porous electrodes under constant current charging. Electrode charging was observed to be governed not only by capacitance, but also by ion species, current polarity, current magnitude, and ion transport dynamics. Using the Scalable ion Electrospray Propulsion System, a 480 -emitter thruster developed in the Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it was also shown that large charging currents saturated the effects of current magnitude and resulted in charging dynamics that collapse together when parametrized by surface charge density. The work concludes by using the observed trends to propose several guidelines for future electrode design in electrospray applications. Electrospray propulsion in particular promises to become an area of concentrated research as micro- and nano-satellites enter the market. Current propulsion systems cannot be effectively miniaturized for use on such platforms, but electrospray thrusters have demonstrated packaging in the 1 cm 3 range including the fuel reservoir. In addition, {{the next step in the}} recently popular field of gravitational waves will employ space-based observatories, with the LISA Pathfinder technology demonstrator testing an RTIL-based propulsion system for its fine resolution control. It is the hope of the author that the work presented here will contribute to the further refinement of theoretical understanding of RTILs and provide guidance in the design of future RTIL-based technologies. by Kento Masuyama.
