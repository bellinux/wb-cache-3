40|$|Guaranteed IO {{resource}} allocation is a challenging prob-lem in storage servers {{due to the}} variability and unpre-dictability in their dynamic capacity. Existing scheduling mechanisms for CPU and memory allocation are insuffi-cient in providing the guarantees that are needed by appli-cations in today’s shared system infrastructures. In this paper, we examine the problem of providing pro-portional bandwidth allocation, with a <b>minimum</b> reser-vation <b>per</b> <b>application</b> for shared IO access. We look at two practical use cases: (1) I/O resource management in virtualized servers, and (2) Distributed storage infras-tructure. We present a scheduling algorithm, Reservation Based Fair Queuing RBFQ,that provides proportionate al-location while meeting per-application reservation con-straints. RBFQ uses two novel ideas (i) real-time dual tagging and (ii) prioritized scheduling to accomplish its goals. We also propose idle credits as a mechanism to handle bursts in IO workloads and improve IO efficiency. Experiments with RBFQ, using both a prototype imple-mentation in VMware’s ESX Server and a distributed storage environment, show that it provides good isolation, and meets reservations {{in the presence of}} fluctuating ca-pacity, dynamic workloads, and hot-spotting by various clients. ...|$|R

Simple formulas for the <b>minimum</b> energy <b>per</b> bit and the wideband slope, both for coded modulation and for bit-interleaved coded modulation, are given. The wideband slope can be decomposed into {{the product of}} two terms, respectively due to the fading characteristics and the modulation and binary labeling rule. BICM {{is found to be}} suboptimal in the sense that its <b>minimum</b> energy <b>per</b> bit can be larger than the corresponding value for coded modulation schemes. The <b>minimum</b> energy <b>per</b> bit using standard Gray mapping on M-PAM, or M 2 -QAM is given by a simple formula, and shown to approach- 0. 34 dB as M increases. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{social and}} {{economical}} condition, cultivated land resources and general situation of grain production of research area are introduced. According to relevant data of cultivated land of Kunming City in 2006, taking the <b>minimum</b> <b>per</b> capita cultivated land and index model of cultivated land pressure, and combining with two conditions of per capita grain demand which are 300 kg and 400 kg, the comparative research method {{was used to}} calculate and analyze the <b>minimum</b> <b>per</b> capita cultivated land and index model of cultivated land pressure. The results show that when per capita grain demand-Gr is 300 kg, the per capita cultivated land in Kunming City has regional differences, reflects different regular patterns of spatial distribution, and presents obvious and typical radial distribution. Urban area of Kunming has the lowest point and be taken as the center, per capita cultivated land decreases progressively from suburban to the periphery; when per capita grain demand-Gr is 400 kg, under the same consumption level, cultivated land pressures of each county in Kunming City are different, {{and so are the}} driven factors; when per capita grain demand-Gr is 300 kg or 400 kg, the indexes of cultivated land pressure in Kunming are all greater than 1, cultivated land pressure is enormous, the indexes of cultivated land pressure of each county (district) have two conditionsâ€”greater than 1 and less than 2, and the reasons differ from one another. Combining with the spatial distribution characteristics of the cultivated land and food and the situation of industrial development, the countermeasures and suggestions are put forwarded to make full use of back-up cultivated land, to plan the distribution of industrial structure in each county (district) of Kunming City as a whole, to dispose cultivated land resources reasonably and so on.
