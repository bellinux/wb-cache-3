5|$|White Northern Republicans, {{and some}} Democrats, became excited about an {{abolition}} amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. <b>Many</b> <b>blacks,</b> {{particularly in the}} South, focused more on landownership and education {{as the key to}} liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York political machine.|$|E
5|$|Major riots {{broke out}} in Léopoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a {{political}} demonstration turned violent. The Force Publique, the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the évolué class into the independence movement. <b>Many</b> <b>blacks</b> began to test {{the boundaries of the}} colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Blacks</b> who {{had settled}} on {{property}} surrounding Hampton {{were forced to}} leave by various means. These included Johnson's aggressive restoration policy, Black Codes passed by the Virginia legislature, and with vigilante enforcement by returning Confederates. Union troops also forcefully evicted settlers, sometimes provoking violent standoffs; <b>many</b> <b>Blacks</b> came to trust the Freedmen's Bureau no {{more than they did}} the Rebels. In 1866 Tidewater's refugee camps were still full, and many of their residents were sick and dying. Relations with Northern and Southern Whites had become violently hostile. The Whites (military occupiers and local residents) agreed on a plan to deport the freedpeople back to their counties of origin.|$|E
50|$|The Union Army legally enlisted {{black people}} after July 19, 1862. <b>Many</b> <b>black</b> people fled North to achieve freedom and fight against their Southern oppressors. The Union {{utilized}} <b>many</b> <b>black</b> people as soldiers and other workers.|$|R

25|$|Kock left on August 14 for New York, {{and arrived}} on August 28. However, the American Secretary of State, William Seward, had {{received}} many complaints from Central American governments who saw no {{advantage in the}} advent of so <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> to their region. In light of these complaints, Seward stalled Kock's plan.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} involuntary servitude took {{various forms}} but the primary forms included convict leasing, peonage, and sharecropping, {{with the latter}} eventually encompassing poor whites as well. By the 1930s, whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South. Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor, and <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> left the South in the Great Migration.|$|E
25|$|When {{frictions}} between North and South {{culminated in}} the Civil War, <b>many</b> <b>blacks,</b> slave and free, fought for the Union Army. Following Union victory in the Civil War, on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed slavery. Following its passage, {{in some cases the}} Underground Railroad operated in the opposite direction, as fugitives returned to the United States.|$|E
50|$|African American {{hair and}} African American hairstyles are the diverse ways that African American {{men and women}} style their hair. Because <b>many</b> <b>black</b> people have hair that is thick with tighter and smaller curls than people of other races, unique hair styles have developed. In {{addition}} to this, <b>many</b> <b>black</b> hairstyles have historical connections to African cultures.|$|R

25|$|While <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> {{were happy}} over McDaniel's {{personal}} victory, they also {{viewed it as}} bittersweet. They believed Gone With the Wind celebrated the slave system and condemned the forces that destroyed it. For them, the unique accolade McDaniel had won suggested that only {{those who did not}} protest Hollywood's systemic use of racial stereotypes could find work and success there.|$|E
25|$|By this time, an {{estimated}} 12,000 Whites had gathered {{to watch the}} houses burn. When firefighters arrived, the Whites impeded their progress by slashing their hoses. <b>Many</b> <b>Blacks</b> fled town, found refuge with sympathetic Whites, or hid in the State Arsenal, where the White militia protected them. The militia finally dispersed the crowd late that night after reinforcements arrived after 2 a.m.|$|E
25|$|Despite discrimination, <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> became {{property}} owners {{in areas that}} were still developing. For instance, 90% of the Mississippi's bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after the war. By {{the end of the}} century, two-thirds of the farmers in Mississippi's Delta bottomlands were black. They had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber. Tens of thousands of migrants went to the Delta, both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies, and many to develop their own farms. By the end of the century, two-thirds of farm owners in the Delta bottomlands were black. However, the long agricultural depression, along with disenfranchisement and lack of access to credit, led to <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> in the Delta losing their property by 1910 and becoming sharecroppers or landless workers over the following decade. More than two generations of free African Americans lost their stake in property.|$|E

50|$|With {{the social}} and working {{conditions}} of <b>many</b> <b>Black</b> workers deteriorating, <b>many</b> <b>Black</b> workers concentrated in the auto industry, an unrepresentative and, at times, even hostile union, and a growing spirit of militancy of revolutionary vision among these workers, the conditions were ripe {{for the development of}} a working-class movement to directly engage Black workers and to build a political organization to fight for their interests.|$|R

25|$|When Omaha City {{was founded}} in 1854 the {{boundaries}} were around the present-day downtown core. Prospect Hill Cemetery, a North Omaha landmark, was founded on a high hill {{on the outskirts of}} Omaha in 1856, and with more than 15,000 burials it included many of the founding figures of Omaha, as well as soldiers from nearby Fort Omaha, immigrants, and <b>many</b> <b>Blacks</b> who worked throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|The railroads coordinated their {{response}} through the General Managers' Association, {{which had been}} formed in 1886 and included 24 lines linked to Chicago. The railroads began hiring replacement workers (strikebreakers), which increased hostilities. <b>Many</b> <b>blacks</b> were recruited as strikebreakers and crossed picket lines, as they feared that the racism expressed by the American Railway Union would lock them out of another labor market. This added racial tension to the union's predicament.|$|E
25|$|Democrats {{recognized}} the black {{majority in the}} state and realized that the only way for them to win the election was through violent suppression of black voters or intimidating black voters to vote Democratic. This was a tricky problem for the party because they were known for upholding slavery and introducing the black codes. Furthermore, it angered <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> that a former slave trader, Joe Crews, was elected as a Republican to the General Assembly.|$|E

25|$|However, crime {{continued}} to be a problem in Detroit long after Young's tenure as mayor ended; according to national statistics the arson rate in Detroit was 6.3 times the national average in 2003 and the murder rate was 5.1 times the national average. In addition, the majority of Detroit residents, including <b>many</b> <b>blacks,</b> have left the city, leaving a glut of abandoned buildings that have become magnets for drugs, arson, and other crime.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>blacks</b> have {{supported}} {{government and business}} affirmative action, while many Jews have not, preferring merit-based systems. Historians believe that this difference contributed to {{the decline of the}} black-Jewish alliance in the 1970s, when blacks began seeking ways to build on the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. As blacks continued to face widespread discrimination and struggled to make progress in society, they began to develop an increasing militancy. Greenberg believes that this increased resentment and fear among Jews.|$|E
25|$|This lasted {{well into}} the 20th century. President Lyndon B. Johnson {{abolished}} peonage in 1966, which rapidly decreased sharecropping in every plantation nationwide. Journalist Douglas A. Blackmon reported in his book Pulitzer Prize winning book Slavery By Another Name that <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> were virtually enslaved under convict leasing programs, which started after the Civil War. Most Southern states had no prisons; they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor, and the lessee paid for food and board. The incentives for abuse were satisfied.|$|E

25|$|The 20th-century one-drop rule made it {{relatively}} {{difficult for}} anyone of known Black ancestry {{to be accepted}} as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful to have as <b>many</b> <b>Blacks</b> as possible.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> {{migrated}} to St. Louis from the Deep South for its industrial jobs. Delaney met with new arrivals to try to track down her father. Learning that he was living on a plantation 15 miles south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, she wrote {{and asked him to}} visit her. Her sister Nancy from Canada joined their reunion in St. Louis. Their father was glad to see them, but, with his wife Polly dead by then, he returned to Mississippi and his friends of 45 years.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} {{influential}} white developers persuaded {{the city to}} pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited <b>many</b> <b>blacks</b> from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use, and force blacks further {{to the edge of}} the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by B. C. Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled as unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black community, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence.|$|E
50|$|Under apartheid, <b>many</b> <b>black</b> {{residents}} lived outside Ventersburg in Mmamahabane, an extra-municipal township. The location {{has since}} been expanded into a second district, Tswelangpele.|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>black</b> farmers {{across the}} nation {{experienced}} discrimination in their dealings with U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies in their states. Across the nation, black farmers alleged, and the USDA later agreed, they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government. On a national level, farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers. Since they were denied government loans, emergency or disaster assistance, and other aid, <b>many</b> <b>black</b> farmers lost their farms and their homes.|$|R
