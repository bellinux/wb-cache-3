50|$|He was {{a member}} of the {{international}} juries at the World's Fairs in Philadelphia and Atlanta, was United States commissioner to the World's Fair in Paris in 1878, and was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French government in recognition for his services at the last-named fair. He edited the Reports of the Paris Exposition, to which he contributed chapters on “Agricultural Implements” and “Clocks and Watches.” Besides many official reports, he wrote the American <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Dictionary</b> (3 vol., 1876), the New <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Dictionary</b> (Boston, 1884), and “A Study of the Savage Weapons at the Centennial Exhibition” (in the Smithsonian Institution's Annual Report for 1879, p. 213, Washington, 1880). He compiled A Library of Poetry and Song (New York, 1870; revised ed., 1876).|$|E
50|$|In 1843 he {{published}} {{a paper on}} circular polarisation of light and various essential oils. His optical apparatus was innovative, and he developed a double refracting goniometer, {{also known as a}} Leeson prism. It was made from Iceland spar, and later applied to the measurement of angles in small crystals. The invention became standard. Leeson's goniometer, to be fitted to a microscope eyepiece, was illustrated in Knight's New <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Dictionary</b> (1884); and its measurement technique, by bringing two images of a crystal into coincidence, was still explained in a text of 1921. Leeson is also credited with the first rotation apparatus for orienting a crystal.|$|E

The average number of look-up operations required to find an entry is computed for several methods. It is shown that if advantage is taken of the relative frequencies with which the different entries are looked up, the average number of look-ups may be substantially reduced. The results are applied to the problem of using a computer as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>dictionary...</b>|$|E
40|$|A <b>mechanical</b> <b>dictionary</b> of Russian words {{contains}} {{a number of}} entries. Each entry is identified by its Russian word, and contains certain output data concerning that word. The simplest form of dictionary would have a separate entry for every variant of a word, for example, there would be entries for each inflected form. Economy of space usually dictates that the dictionary entries be related not to the words themselves, but to smaller parts out of which the words are built. If a word is regarded as built from two parts, the storage of these separately in the dictionary leads to economy only if 1. These parts are both used to build several words. 2. The output data required for the words can be formed from a rea-sonable quantity of data stored for their parts. The inflection of Russian Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs (Including participles) {{is a type of}} word-building which can give considerable dictionary economy. The parts of the words we use in this case are...|$|E
