40|$|We have {{developed}} techniques to automatically infer mother's <b>maiden</b> <b>names</b> from public records. We demonstrate our techniques using publicly available {{records from the}} state of Texas, and reduce the entropy of a mother's <b>maiden</b> <b>name</b> from an average of close to 13 bits down to below 6. 9 bits for {{more than a quarter of}} the people targeted, and down to a zero entropy (i. e., certainty of their mothers <b>maiden</b> <b>name)</b> for a large number of targeted individuals. This poses a signi cant risk not only to individuals whose mothers <b>maiden</b> <b>name</b> can easily be guessed, but highlights the vulnerability of the system as such, given the traditional reliance of authentication by mother <b>maiden</b> <b>names</b> for nancial services. While our techniques and approach are novel, it is important to note that these techniques { once understood { do not require any insider information or particular skills to implement. This emphasizes the need to move away from mothers <b>maiden</b> <b>names</b> as an authenticator. Using the techniques described, during testing we were able to deduce the mother's <b>maiden</b> <b>name</b> for approximately 4, 105, 111 Texans. ...|$|R
