He called {{the message of the}} song [...] "universal", and not just about love but [...] "any type of heartache." [...] About the track he said, [...] "When I heard the whole concept and everything I was like, 'Yo, this is crazy. So being able to express the feelings, it was like, probably one of the best [...] But it was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> trying to do a record that meant crawl to love, crawl back to love. Meaning whether it's from your negative situations, whether it's from any problems you've dealt with, like anybody's situation." [...] Although he stated his concept for the song was about love, he said for anybody, the song could be [...] "inspired as far it being the war or a death in the family, whether it's anything, anybody just crawl back to love." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{maintaining}} {{a place in the}} promotion places {{during the first half of}} the season and his [...] "stabling influence" [...] on the club, chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn offered McCall a new contract in January 2009. Later in the month, Lawn gave further backing to McCall, who was coming under pressure from the club's fans following a run of one win in nine games; during the run McCall was also charged by The Football Association for the first time of his managerial career after he had contested a refereeing decision during a game with Luton Town. McCall signed a new contract in February, which extended his deal by another two years and would have kept him at the club until 2011. He set himself the goal of earning two promotions to put City in the Championship. However, less than a month later, McCall offered to resign if they did not reach the play-offs after his side lost 4–1 to Bournemouth – their fifth consecutive away defeat. [...] "Nobody is hurting <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> but it's as simple as that, if we miss out I don't deserve to be here," [...] he said. City eventually missed out on promotion, but McCall decided to stay on as manager and took a voluntary pay cut in the process because of the club's budget being reduced.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the gospel}} of Matthew, the {{obligation}} to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: [...] "Whoever loves father or mother <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me</b> is not worthy of me." [...] (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and {{the primacy of the}} first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does not include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.|$|E
2500|$|Muralitharan {{believed}} {{the emergence of}} Mendis would help prolong his own career. Muralitharan, 36, and 23-year-old Mendis formed a formidable partnership in the first Test thrashing of India, taking 19 of the 20 wickets between them. [...] "If he keeps performing this way, he will definitely {{take a lot of}} wickets in international cricket. Now that he has come, I think I can play Test cricket a few more years. Bowling 50 overs in a Test innings is very hard. Now if I bowl only 30–35 and he bowls <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> the job will get easier for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his last}} {{parliament}} session, {{he found himself}} {{on the side of}} the republicans against the monarchist government. A right-wing journal [...] referred to Thiers as a [...] "sinister old man". During one debate a member of the government claimed that the Assembly, not Thiers, was responsible for liberating French territory from the Germans. Thiers was present when the republican leader, Leon Gambetta, rose to speak. He pointed out Thiers and said: [...] "I will not take away from the illustrious man of state who is before me, whom no one honors <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> the honor and glory which belongs to him, but which he does not want to claim for himself alone. That which he cannot do, history will do." [...] The Chamber gave a long ovation to Thiers, and the old man wept with emotion.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We just have to do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think people will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>me,</b> this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E
