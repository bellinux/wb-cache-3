40|$|The {{authenticity}} of controversial species {{is a significant}} challenge for systematic biologists. <b>Moschidae</b> is a small family of musk deer in the Artiodactyla, composing only one genus, Moschus. Historically, {{the number of species}} in the <b>Moschidae</b> family has been debated. Presently, most musk deer species were restricted in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding/adjacent areas, which implied that the evolution of Moschus might have been punctuated by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we aimed to determine the evolutionary history and delimit the species in Moschus by exploring the complete mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and other mitochondrial gene. Our study demonstrated that six species, M. leucogaster, M. fuscus, M. moschiferus, M. berezovskii, M. chrysogaster and M. anhuiensis, were authentic species in the genus Moschus. Phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating showed that the ancestor of the present <b>Moschidae</b> originates from Tibetan Plateau which suggested that the evolution of Moschus was prompted by the most intense orogenic movement of the Tibetan Plateau during the Pliocene age, and alternating glacial-interglacial geological eras...|$|E

Traditionally based on morphological data, phylogenetic trees have increasingly relied on molecular data for the last 15 years, without reaching a satisfying consensus solution. This study intends to explore behaviour, between the rutting and nursing periods, as a new data set {{for the establishment of}} phylogenetic relationships between the several species of Cervidae, and also between Cervidae and other living Pecora families (Antilocapridae, Bovidae, Giraffidae and <b>Moschidae).</b> Separate analysis of behavioural data was performed, followed by combined analysis of behavioural characters together with morphological and cytological ones. Simultaneous analysis of all characters showed that Cervidae form a monophyletic group made up of two lineages: plesiometacarpalians or Cervinae (Muntiacus (Dama, Cervus)), and telemetacarpalian cervids including Hydropotinae and Capreolinae (Hydropotes (Capreolus (Alces (Odocoileus, Rangifer)))). <b>Moschidae</b> appear as the sister group of Cervidae, and Bovidae seem more closely related to Cervoidea than are Giraffidae. An Eurasiatic origin for Cervidae is suggested. Our results also indicate that Hydropotes is secondarily antlerless. Ancestral ethotypes were reconstructed for several clades. On the basis of this case study, the relevance of behavioural characters for phylogenetic systematics is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Moschidae</b> are a {{group of}} hornless pecoran {{ruminants}} that showed a high specific diversity during the Middle and Upper Miocene in Spain.

The latter species becomes extinct at local zone E, and it is substituted by Micromeryx sp. nov. 2, which shows a more derived dentition. From local zone G to local zone J and during a four million year period, the specific diversity of the Spanish <b>Moschidae</b> becomes higher, coinciding with the first record and diversification of the genus Hispanomeryx since local zone F times. During all this period (zones G to J) a minimum number of three moschid species always exists, with a maximum peak of four species during the zones G 3 and H; this time span of 2, 5 million years can be considered the moschid diversity apogee in the Iberian Peninsula, and it is dominated by the species Micromeryx sp. nov. 3. At local zone H a new moschid association dominated by Micromeryx sp. nov. 4 appears. The <b>Moschidae</b> became totally extinct in Spain 8 million years ago at local zone K.

40|$|New data on {{the last}} representatives of the Spanish Miocene <b>Moschidae</b> (Mammalia, Ruminantia) are {{presented}} and discussed. A new species of Micromeryx, Micromeryx soriae, is described {{on the basis of}} fossil material from the locality of La Roma- 2 (upper Vallesian; MN 10, Teruel province, Spain, previously assigned to Micromeryx sp.), Batallones- 1, and Batallones- 10 (upper Vallesian; local zone J, MN 10, Madrid province, Spain). The new species is characterized by possessing relatively hypsodont lower molars of advanced morphology and a unique type of Palaeomeryx-fold. M. soriae gives insight to the last representatives of the genus, which achieved an overall lower molar morphology that mimics to certain degree that of Hispanomeryx. several characters of the upper molars of the Miocene moschids Micromeryx and Hispanomeryx are described that are useful for characterizing both genera. These characters are used to solve the taxonomic problems of PM- 659, an upper molar from Puente Minero (MN 11, Teruel province, Spain) that represents one of the last survivors of the <b>Moschidae</b> in the Iberian Peninsula. The systematic utility of the upper molars of Hispanomeryx and Micromeryx is demonstrated, and the use of size as the only way to distinguish between the two genera is refuted. Finally, the study of the morphological characters of PM- 659 clearly supports its generic change from Micromeryx sp. to Hispanomeryx sp., thus recording the presence of Hispanomeryx in the Iberian Peninsula as late as the lower Turolian.

40|$|There {{is not a}} {{consensus}} on classification of musk deer. Nowak (1991) includes Moschus in the family Cervidae (true deer), but suggests that the genus may warrant its own separate family.

In the sedimentary succession within the Baccinello-Cinigiano basin, five successive faunal associations have been recognised. These assemblages document phases of population spanning the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene. The oldest assemblage, termed V 0, is correlated with the MN 11 "zone" (early Turolian), V 1 and V 2 assemblages with the MN 12 "zone" (late Turolian), and V 3 with the MN 13 "zone" (late Turolian).

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of a remarkable conservation of the X chromosome in eutherian mammals has been first described by Susumu Ohno in 1964. A notable {{exception is the}} cetartiodactyl X chromosome, which varies widely in morphology and G-banding pattern between species. It is hypothesized that this sex chromosome has undergone multiple rearrangements that changed the centromere position and the order of syntenic segments over the last 80 million years of Cetartiodactyla speciation. To investigate its evolution we have selected 26 evolutionarily conserved bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the cattle CHORI- 240 library evenly distributed along the cattle X chromosome. High-resolution BAC maps of the X chromosome on a representative range of cetartiodactyl species from different branches: pig (Suidae), alpaca (Camelidae), gray whale (Cetacea), hippopotamus (Hippopotamidae), Java mouse-deer (Tragulidae), pronghorn (Antilocapridae), Siberian musk deer (<b>Moschidae),</b> and giraffe (Giraffidae) were obtained by fluorescent in situ hybridization. To trace the X chromosome evolution during fast radiation in specious families, we performed mapping in several cervids (moose, Siberian roe deer, fallow deer, and Pere David’s deer) and bovid (muskox, goat, sheep, sable antelope, and cattle) species. We have identified three major conserved synteny blocks and rearrangements in different cetartiodactyl lineages {{and found that the}} recently described {{phenomenon of}} the evolutionary new centromere emergence has taken place in the X chromosome evolution of Cetartiodactyla at least five times.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{chromosome}} data obtained on 30 species and 20 subspecies of Cervidae, a report is submitted on the karyosystematics of this family. The primitive karyotype of Cervidae may be inferred to be composed of 35 acrocentric pairs (2 n = 70 FN = 70). During the phyletic evolution of this family different types of chromosome rearrangements were probably selected and the group may have differentiated karyologically into three branches: (1) the Cervinae that fixed a centric fusion resulting in a metacentric pair of autosomes (2 n = 68, FN = 70), {{as shown by the}} basic karyotype of Cervus elaphus, and where Robertsonian fusions are the preeminent type of chromosome rearrangement; (2) the Odocoileinae, in which pericentric inversions and Robertsonian fusions were favored, yielding first a submetacentric X and then a submetacentric autosome pair. The most representative karyotype is 2 n = 70, FN = 74 [...] as in Odocoileus hemionus; and (3) the Muntiacinae, in which centric and tandem fusions were the most common chromosome rearrangements. While Muntiacus reevesi has a karyotype 2 n = 46, FN = 46, the chromosome number drops down to 2 n = 6 in the females of the M. muntjak vaginalis subspecies group and M. rooseveltorum. Therefore, while the karyotypes are conserved within the subfamilies Cervinae and Odocoileinae; the subfamily Muntiacinae appears to be the most chromosomally diversified group.

40|$|Longirostromeryx wellsi, one of {{the latest}} {{surviving}} members of the extinct clade Blastomerycinae (Artiodactyla: <b>Moschidae),</b> possesses highly derived craniodental morphology that deviates from typical musk deer form. Previous work suggests that the unique anatomy of L. wellsi represents adaptations for occupying open savannas. To test this hypothesis I conduct principal components analysis on five postcranial bones of L. wellsi, comparing them to that of several extant ruminant artiodactyls, which are divided among seven habitat categories. These elements are also compared with the postcrania of other blastomerycines. These analyses indicate that L. wellsi anatomy is most similar to that of other blastomerycines, extant musk deer, and artiodactyls that occupy heavy woodland-bushland environments, antithetical to the traditional view that L. wellsi was adapted for open habitats. Slight differences among fossil blastomerycines suggest that early to middle Miocene species were better adapted to densely vegetated habitats than later blastomerycines. Of the late Miocene taxa, Parablastomeryx, typically considered the more primitive form, may have been better suited to open environments than the more derived Longirostromeryx. The most complete known specimen of Longirostromeryx wellsi, UNSM 125572, is described here. Some features, primarily of the forelimb and proximal hindlimb, show that L. wellsi was not a specialized runner, supporting the closed habitat hypothesis, though other features are indicative of cursorial modification. I propose that these conflicting features represent modification for a unique feeding specialization, appropriate for bushland environments. Overall, this study elaborates the complex ecological story of L. wellsi, including habitat and morphological similarities to other ruminants, with consequences for the evolutionary history of Blastomerycinae as well as paleoenvironmental interpretations of the late Miocene Great Plains.

40|$|The Pecorans (higher ruminants) are {{believed}} to have rapidly speciated in the Mid-Eocene, resulting in five distinct extant families: Antilocapridae, Giraffidae, <b>Moschidae,</b> Cervidae, and Bovidae. Due to the rapid radiation, the Pecoran phylogeny has proven difficult to resolve, and 11 of the 15 possible rooted phylogenies describing ancestral relationships among the Antilocapridae, Giraffidae, Cervidae, and Bovidae have each been argued as representations of the true phylogeny. Here we demonstrate that a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platform designed for one species can be used to genotype ancient DNA from an extinct species and DNA from species diverged up to 29 million years ago and that the produced genotypes can be used to resolve the phylogeny for this rapidly radiated infraorder. We used a high-throughput assay with 54, 693 SNP loci developed for Bos taurus taurus to rapidly genotype 678 individuals representing 61 Pecoran species. We produced a highly resolved phylogeny for this diverse group based upon 40, 843 genome-wide SNP, which is five times as many informative characters as have previously been analyzed. We also establish a method to amplify and screen genomic information from extinct species, and place Bison priscus within the Bovidae. The quality of genotype calls and the placement of samples within a well-supported phylogeny may provide an important test for validating the fidelity and integrity of ancient samples. Finally, we constructed a phylogenomic network to accurately describe the relationships between 48 cattle breeds and facilitate inferences concerning the history of domestication and breed formation.

40|$|Cervidae (deer) {{belong to}} Ruminantia {{together}} with Tragulidae (chevrotains), Antilocapridae (pronghorns), <b>Moschidae</b> (musk deer), Giraffidae (giraffes), and Bovidae (cattle, sheep, antelopes). After bovids, cervids are {{the second most}} diverse group of ruminants and large herbivores in general. Cervids are natively distributed in the Americas, Europe and Asia inhabiting a broad variety of habitats. Antlers, deciduous, osseous branched outgrowths of the frontal bone, are synapomorphic for all living member of Cervidae except for the Chinese water deer, Hydropotes inermis, {{in which they have}} presumably been lost. They are unique cranial appendages, which are shed and rebuilt at intervals. The antlerogenic process is controlled by a complex interaction of fluctuating levels of several hormones, most importantly testosterone. The oldest antler remains are recorded from the early Miocene. These have often been interpreted as non-deciduous appendages in the past, because of supposed permanent skin coverage and the lack of a burr. Extensive comparative morphological analyses of external features of the antler and of the abscission area showed that antlers of all extant and of eight Miocene cervid genera, including those of most of the earliest cervids Procervulus, Ligeromeryx, and Lagomeryx were deciduous. This insight is particularly important for the systematic classification of early Miocene species as Cervidae, because the absence of antler shedding and rebuilding would exclude them from the total group Cervidae. Cervid systematics has been puzzling researchers for over 150 years. The initial, gross (sub) classifications based on morphology and comparative anatomy are mostly supported by molecular data. In recent decades, molecular systematics has provided new input, but consensus could only be partially reached. Cervids are traditionally subdivided into two subfamilies, Cervinae, consisting of Muntiacini and Cervini, and Capreolinae, consisting of Alceini, Capreolini, Odocoileini, and Rangiferini. While the systematic relationships within Muntiacini and Cervini are, with very few exceptions, resolved, systematic relationships within Capreolinae are much more controversial. The position of Capreolini and Alceini is uncertain and there are many polyphylies within Odocoileini. The latter is the youngest clade of cervids with a quick diversification rate, which makes resolving the systematic relationships more difficult. Also, the rich fossil record of cervids has never been extensively phylogenetically tested concerning potential systematic relationships of fossil representatives to extant cervid taxa. The aim of this work was to investigate the systematic relationships of extant and fossil cervids using molecular and morphological characters and make implications about their evolutionary history based on the phylogenetic reconstructions. To achieve these objectives, molecular data were compiled primarily from public data bases such as GenBank. Some cervid species still lack molecular data because they are difficult to access in the wild. In order to complement the existing data, partial mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences from museum specimens of five previously unrecorded species were extracted. The resulting data set was so far the most extensive concerning the taxon sampling for cervids. All molecular data were combined to a data set including 17709 base pairs across five nuclear markers and the complete mitochondrial genome of 50 extant and one fossil cervid species. Several analyses using different data partitions, taxon sampling, partitioning schemes, and optimality criteria were undertaken. Divergence time estimates were undertaken on the molecular data sets using molecular clock node dating. Additionally, the most extensive morphological character matrix for such a broad cervid taxon sampling was compiled. In total 168 cranial and dental characters of 41 extant and 29 fossil cervid species were scored. Due to the highly conservative morphological features of cervids, solving systematic relationships was challenging for both extant and fossil species. However, it was possible to determine several characters useful to diagnose cervid subclades. The morphological and molecular data were combined for a total evidence approach and other phylogenetic testing. A tip dating analyses was also undertaken on the total evidence data set. Molecular topologies were partially in conflict with morphological topologies. Nuclear topologies suggested different systematic relationships for some taxa than the mitochondrial topologies. The combined molecular analyses provided robust topologies. The total evidence analyses were less robust and still contained large areas of unresolved taxa. Alternative approaches to combine both data sets and fossil and extant taxa were more useful. The two different divergence time estimate approaches provided differing but feasible results for each approach. The results showed that most of the Miocene cervids were considered to be more closely related to each other than to any other cervid. They were positioned either between the outgroup and all other cervids or as the sister taxon to Muntiacini. Two Miocene cervids were frequently placed within Muntiacini. Plio- and Pleistocene cervids could often be affiliated to Cervini, Odocoileini or Capreolini. Their morphology is more similar to extant cervids than the morphology of most Miocene cervids. The phylogenetic analyses of this work provide new insights into the evolutionary history of cervids. New systematic relationships were observed, some uncertainties persist and resolving phylogenetic relationships within certain taxa remain challenging. The analyses on the extensive data sets presented here concretised systematic problems and uncertainties, which can now better be targeted with phylogenetic approaches. Several fossil cervids could be successfully related to living representatives, confirming previously assumed affiliations based on qualitative comparisons and introducing new hypotheses. Cervid systematics remains an interesting and fascinating area of research with exciting new results to be expected in the future...|$|E
