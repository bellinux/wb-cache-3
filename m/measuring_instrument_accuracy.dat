CBCT is considered not only a diagnostic tool but also a <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> in which <b>accuracy</b> is related to smaller voxel size [28]. The validity of CBCT in measuring root width and height has been reported with high degree of accuracy when CBCT root measurements were compared to direct measurements on extracted teeth [13]. Moreover, the accuracy of CBCT crown measurements has been evaluated by Celikoglu et al. [29]. The authors found that the mesiodistal dimensions of anterior teeth and Bolton ratios showed acceptable Pearson’s correlation coefficient when they compared measurements on CBCT and plaster models.|$|R

A fast selection procedure based on the method of singular value decomposition is presented. The uncertainty in the estimations is also derived, thus giving an additional element of information useful for decision making. The proposed method, together with adaptive performance modeling, provides a self-sufficient tool, which can be applied for setting up and subsequent exploitation of a health monitoring expert system.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of automation technology in automotive manufacturing processes, massive and efficient production is a current trend. Therefore, measurement systems with accurate and automated <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> are sought by automotive companies and suppliers. However, the problematic <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> with unreliable <b>accuracy</b> and stability lead to erroneous measurements and wrong quality decisions that cause manufacturers huge profit losses. An effective method called “measurement system analysis” {{can be applied}} to define and eliminate erroneous measurements to ensure adequate reliability. An automotive transmission die casting parts supplier called company T was suffering a serious profit loss due to the erroneous measurements from one type of their product’s measurement system. These erroneous measurements caused the company to deliver nonconforming products to their customers. The researcher conducted a study applying Six Sigma methodology to find out the root cause of the erroneous measurements and eliminate the erroneous measurements to retain adequate reliability. The researcher used DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analysis, Improve, and Control) process as framework to conduct the study and the measurement system analysis, Gage R 2 ̆ 6 R method, to process several experiments for data collection and analysis. Through processing the experiments and analyzing the results, the researcher was able to detect the source of variation and find the root cause that caused the erroneous measurements.
