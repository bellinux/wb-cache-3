5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue, are <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in {{the operations of the}} Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E
40|$|This survey {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of strategies used by primary schools and local authorities to support and challenge <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils. Overall, most <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils are not challenged enough and too few pupils achieve above the expected levels {{at the end of}} key stages 1 and 2. Provision for <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils varies too much across Wales. In the few primary schools with the best provision, thorough analysis of data and assessment outcomes helps to identify <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils. In these few schools, <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils are supported through a range of additional provision and their progress tracked and monitored carefully. Parents understand the school’s approach to providing additional support for <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils. <b>More</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils gain most in schools that promote individualised or personalised approaches to learning and they benefit particularly from having control over how and what they learn. However, in the majority of primary schools, <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils are not identified and do not receive appropriate support. Teachers in these schools do not have the expertise to identify, support or track the progress of <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils. Transition arrangements between primary and secondary schools often do not provide enough continuity and progression in the education of <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils. Few local authorities use data to monitor the progress of <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils or promote the sharing of best practice between schools. School improvement officers rarely discuss <b>more</b> able and <b>talented</b> pupils during their visits to schools. " - page 1...|$|R

5|$|Now an {{established}} Premier League club, Bolton signed veteran internationals Gary Speed and Fernando Hierro, aged 35 and 36 respectively. Speed and Hierro went into midfield, while Tunisia international Radhi Jaïdi was played at centre-back after arriving on a free transfer from Espérance; he was played alongside another new arrival, Israel defender Tal Ben Haim, who was recommended by Allardyce's son Craig. He also brought in Senegal striker El Hadji Diouf on a season-long loan from Liverpool, who he would eventually sign permanently for £3million. After {{a good start}} to the season, Allardyce was offered the Newcastle United job, but turned it down and instead signed a new five-year contract with Bolton as he felt the Bolton squad to be <b>more</b> <b>talented.</b> Bolton went on to finish in sixth place in 2004–05 to win qualification to the UEFA Cup {{for the first time}} in the club's history.|$|E

25|$|A row {{immediately}} ensued {{when the}} Democrats sought to attack Gregory So and other appointees over their foreign passports.

25|$|The Whigs built {{a strong}} party {{organization}} in most states; they were weak {{only on the}} frontier. The Whigs used newspapers effectively, and soon adopted the exciting campaign techniques that lured 75 to 85% of the eligible voters to the polls. Abraham Lincoln emerged early as the leader in Illinois—where he usually was bested by an even <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> politician, Stephen Douglas. While Douglas and the Democrats were somewhat behind the Whigs in newspaper work, they made up for this weakness by emphasis on party loyalty. Anyone who attended a Democratic convention, from precinct level to national level, was honor bound to support the final candidate, whether he liked him or not. This rule produced numerous schisms, {{but on the whole}} the Democrats controlled and mobilized their rank and file more effectively than the Whigs did.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Wexford {{took part}} in Division 2 of the Allianz National Hurling League. After their shock defeat by Antrim, in which the Saffrons made a memorable comeback, Wexford {{improved}} to take {{a place in the}} division final against Offaly. The yellowbellies were favourites, having beaten them earlier in the league, however Colm Bonnar's men did not perform on the day. It was a massive disappointment, meaning Wexford will be outside of hurling's top tier for the second year running. The Leinster championship arrived and Wexford had a chance for redemption with an opening round clash against Offaly. They gained revenge with Stephen Banville starring in a comfortable victory, with the aid of home advantage. Up next was Dublin and a younger <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> city side prevailed. This was followed up by defeat in the qualifiers against Limerick.|$|E
25|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{has worked}} as an {{assistant}} for the Los Angeles Clippers and the Seattle SuperSonics, helping mentor, among others, their young centers, Michael Olowokandi and Jerome James. Abdul-Jabbar was the {{head coach of the}} Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League in 2002, leading the team to the league's championship that season, but he failed to land the head coaching position at Columbia University a year later. He then worked as a scout for the New York Knicks. Finally, on September 2, 2005, he returned to the Lakers as a special assistant to Phil Jackson to help the Lakers' centers, and in particular their young draftee Andrew Bynum. Abdul-Jabbar's influence has been credited with Bynum's emergence as a <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> NBA center.

Some stories indicate that Betty is the better vocalist. Additionally, there is little consistency in the instruments she is able to play.

25|$|The young Asada invited {{two friends}} to help him: the {{architectural}} critic and {{former editor of}} the magazine Shinkenchiku, Noboru Kawazoe, and Kisho Kurokawa who was one of Tange's students. In turn these two men scouted for <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> designers to help, including: the architects Masato Otaka and Kiyonori Kikutake and the designers Kenji Ekuan and Kiyoshi Awazu. Kurokawa was selected because he had recently returned from an international student conference in the Soviet Union and was a student of the Marxist architectural theorist Uzo Nishiyama. Ekuan was asked because of his recent participation in a seminar given by Konrad Wachsmann (he arrived at the lecture on a YA-1 motorbike that he had newly designed for Yamaha) and Otaka was a junior associate of Kunio Maekawa and had just completed the Harumi Apartment Building in Tōkyō Bay. Fumihiko Maki, a former undergraduate student of Tange also joined the group whilst in Tōkyō on a travelling fellowship from the Graham Foundation.|$|E
500|$|Changes {{in society}} also brought {{challenges}} to the program. For example, in the 1990s Christian groups started to question the need to classify shamanistic rituals as cultural heritage. Patriarchal lifestyle, where the man is the main provider {{of the family and}} women stay at home, also influenced [...] "holders", as housewives started to pick up the preservation of folk traditions also in areas that were previously dominated by men. The government resisted appointing female holders for such predominantly male traditions but was gradually forced to acknowledge them when there were no male practitioners at all, or where the women were significantly <b>more</b> <b>talented</b> than the men.|$|E
