5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on <b>medical</b> <b>criteria,</b> but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E

Some felt that his fame had permitted him to receive a donor liver in just one day, bypassing other patients who had been waiting much longer. Mantle's doctors insisted that the decision was based solely on <b>medical</b> <b>criteria,</b> but acknowledged that the very short wait created the appearance of favoritism. While he was recovering, Mantle made peace with his estranged wife, Merlyn, and repeated a request he made decades before for Bobby Richardson to read a poem at his funeral if he died.|$|E
25|$|The raid {{also left}} dozens of activists wounded. Dr. Hazem Farouq, a dentist and Egyptian MP from the Muslim Brotherhood said {{passengers}} {{could not find}} first aid {{and did not have}} material to treat wounds. After the takeover of the ship, injured activists were taken to the roof and treated by IDF medical personnel. According to an IDF doctor, no wounded activists died after they began receiving treatment. Triage was performed in accordance with objective <b>medical</b> <b>criteria,</b> with the result that some activists were treated before soldiers. Israeli Air Force helicopters airlifted thirty-one of the wounded to Israel for emergency treatment. Another 24 injured passengers were diagnosed at Ashdod port and sent to hospitals. A total of fifty-five activists were admitted to the Israeli hospitals of Hadassah, Sheba, Rambam, Rabin, and Barzilai. Nine of the activists were in severe condition, and some underwent surgery at Rambam and Sheba hospitals. Several patients were transferred from Rabin Medical Center to Israel Prison Service medical facilities. The Turkish government sent Turkish Red Crescent personnel to Israel to treat the injured. In the following days, most patients were airlifted to Turkey by Turkish Airlines after their conditions stabilized. Two seriously injured activists remained in an Israeli hospital, as their condition was judged too severe to fly them home. Both men were flown to Turkey on 4 June, still in life-threatening condition, and were taken to Atatürk Hospital. On 6 June, a wounded Indonesian cameraman was transferred from a hospital in Israel for medical treatment in Amman before being taken back to Indonesia.|$|E

2500|$|Many cryonicists do {{not believe}} that legal death is [...] "real death" [...] because {{stoppage}} of heartbeat and breathing—the usual <b>medical</b> <b>criteria</b> for legal death—occur before biological death of cells and tissues of the body. Even at room temperature, cells may take hours to die and days to decompose. Although neurological damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible neurodegenerative processes do not manifest for hours. Cryonicists state that rapid cooling and cardio-pulmonary support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve cells and tissues for long-term preservation at cryogenic temperatures. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater. To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics [...] "standby teams" [...] are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.|$|E

In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, [...] "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, {{in order to be able}} to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: It {{has been}} {{previously}} argued that the methodology employed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 2. 1 to assess the substance induced and general <b>medical</b> condition exclusion <b>criteria</b> are inadequate. As a result prevalence estimates generated from epidemiological studies using this interview may be underestimated. The {{purpose of the current}} {{study was to examine the}} substance induced and general <b>medical</b> condition exclusion <b>criteria</b> in the Australian National Survey for Mental Health and Well-being and determine the impact they have on prevalence estimates of the common mental disorders. Method: Data from the 1997 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing were analyzed. Frequencies were generated as an indication of how many respondents believed their psychiatric symptoms were always due to a substance or general medical condition. New DSM-IV prevalence estimates were calculated ignoring the application of the substance induced and general <b>medical</b> condition exclusion <b>criteria</b> and compared to standard DSM-IV prevalence estimates. Results: The effect of the substance induced and general <b>medical</b> condition exclusion <b>criteria</b> on final prevalence rates were minimal with around a 0. 1 % increase when the exclusions were ignored. This equates to a relative difference ranging from no difference for Generalized Anxiety Disorder to an increase of 12 % of the base prevalence estimate for Agoraphobia. Conclusions: In surveys that use the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 2. 1 the substance induced and general <b>medical</b> condition exclusion <b>criteria</b> have a minor impact on determining final case definition in the majority of mental disorders...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ability of <b>medical</b> {{emergency}} team <b>criteria</b> and the National Early Warning Score to discriminate cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission and death within 24 hours of a vital signs measurement, and to quantify the associated workload. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A large U. K. National Health Service District General Hospital. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized from May 25, 2011, to December 31, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We applied the National Early Warning Score and 44 sets of <b>medical</b> emergency team <b>criteria</b> to a database of 2, 245, 778 vital signs sets (103, 998 admissions). The National Early Warning Score's performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and compared with sensitivity/specificity for different <b>medical</b> emergency team <b>criteria.</b> Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (95 % CI) for the National Early Warning Score for the combined outcome (i. e., death, cardiac arrest, or unanticipated ICU admission) was 0. 88 (0. 88 - 0. 88). A National Early Warning Score value of 7 had sensitivity/specificity values of 44. 5 % and 97. 4 %, respectively. For the 44 sets of <b>medical</b> emergency team <b>criteria</b> studied, sensitivity ranged from 19. 6 % to 71. 2 % and specificity from 71. 5 % to 98. 5 %. For all outcomes, {{the position of the}} National Early Warning Score receiver-operating characteristic curve was above and to the left of all <b>medical</b> emergency team <b>criteria</b> points, indicating better discrimination. Similarly, the positions of all <b>medical</b> emergency team <b>criteria</b> points were above and {{to the left of the}} National Early Warning Score efficiency curve, indicating higher workloads (trigger rates). CONCLUSIONS: When medical emergency team systems are compared to a National Early Warning Score value of greater than or equal to 7, some medical emergency team systems have a higher sensitivity than National Early Warning Score values of greater than or equal to 7. However, all of these medical emergency team systems have a lower specificity and would generate greater workloads...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{which is}} {{based on the results of}} a {{qualitative}} investigation on the adapted sports in the City of Buenos Aires (1950 - 2010), analyses the ethos created by the practice of sports by persons with a motor disability. For that end, taking into account the sociological assumptions of Pierre Bourdieu, the author describes the bodily habits that are promoted by the practice of sports and that draw the disabled body valued within the field. On the basis of the empirical material gathered, escaping from the current readings that reduce the effects of the sports on the disability to the creation of an integrated citizen or to that of a hyper adapted super crip, the author submits that sports have an ambiguous effect on the domination of the persons with disability. Even if the promoted know-how challenge the hegemonic <b>medical</b> <b>criterion,</b> it also constitutes a strong imperative for a normalization that does not dispute the definition of a legitimate body...|$|R
