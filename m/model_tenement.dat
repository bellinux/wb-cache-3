5000|$|In 1885 Adler {{and others}} created the Tenement House Building Company {{in order to}} build [...] "model" [...] {{affordable}} tenements; they rented for $8-$14/month. By 1887 the company had completed six model buildings on the Lower East Side of Manhattan for the sum of $155,000. Critics favored legislation and regulations to improve tenement conditions, but the <b>model</b> <b>tenement</b> was a progressive step.|$|E
5000|$|By 1911, [...] "The Schermerhorn {{country place}} at Jones Wood, where until {{recently}} also {{there was a}} Schermerhorn residence, is now the site of <b>model</b> <b>tenements.</b> The real estate holdings of the family rank about third in the scale of those having ownership for two centuries," [...] exclaimed Town & Country on May 26, 1911, exaggerating by about a century.|$|R
50|$|The AICP also {{sponsored}} the Working Men's Home for African-American men in 1855, {{one of the}} first <b>model</b> <b>tenements</b> in the United States, which was, however, an unsuccessful experiment which did not attract private investors to build more buildings along the same lines. Eventually, after 12 years of losing money, the Home was sold to become a residence for working women.|$|R
50|$|Early {{tenement}} {{reform was}} primarily a philanthropic venture, with <b>Model</b> <b>Tenements</b> built {{as early as the}} 1870s which attempted to use new architectural and management models to address the physical and social problems of the slums. These attempts were limited by available resources, and early efforts were soon redirected towards building code reform. The New York Tenement Act of 1895 and Tenement Law of 1901 were early attempts to address building codes in New York City, which were then copied in Chicago, Philadelphia, and other American cities.|$|R
50|$|In 1910, the National Housing Association (NHA) {{was created}} to improve housing {{conditions}} in urban and suburban neighborhoods through the enactment of better regulation and increased awareness. The NHA was founded by Lawrence Veiller, author of <b>Model</b> <b>Tenement</b> House Law (1910), and consisted of delegates from dozens of cities. Over time, {{the focus of the}} housing movement shifted from a focus on proper building typology to community development on a broader scale, and the NHA dissolved in 1936.|$|E
50|$|The Lexington Avenue {{explosion}} was the July 4, 1914, {{explosion of}} a terrorist bomb in an apartment at 1626 Lexington Avenue in New York City. The blast killed four people and injured dozens. A large quantity of dynamite, which was apparently being used to construct a bomb to blow up John D. Rockefeller's Tarrytown home, exploded prematurely at a new seven-story <b>model</b> <b>tenement.</b> The blast destroyed most {{of the top three}} floors of the building, killing three conspirators and another renter who {{was not part of the}} bomb plot.|$|E

50|$|The {{housing project}} had ten units which housed 96 {{families}} each, 960 families in all.The buildings were low-rent <b>model</b> <b>tenements</b> {{with an average}} rental price of $11 a room. They were completed with a Federal loan of $3,450,000 from the Public Works Administration in Woodside, Queens. Boulevard Gardens {{was only one of}} seven housing developments funded by the PWA through private companies. Despite the success of the program, future funding went only to public housing authorities. By September 1935 the builders, Boulevard Gardens Housing Corporation, reported that all of the units were leased.|$|R
60|$|On {{the borders}} of the Ashfields estate--indeed, part of the land upon which it was built belongs to it--lies a poor suburb of Dunchester {{occupied}} by workmen and their families. In these people Jane took great interest; indeed, she plagued me till at very large expense I built a number of model cottages for them, with electricity, gas and water laid on, and bicycle-houses attached. In fact, this proved a futile proceeding, for the only result was that the former occupants of the dwellings were squeezed out, while persons of a better class, such as clerks, took possession of the <b>model</b> <b>tenements</b> at a totally inadequate rent.|$|R
50|$|On June 17, 1914, Madden {{was arrested}} for {{complicity}} in the mugging of a Mrs. Artha Ingram, a collector for the Phips <b>Model</b> <b>Tenements,</b> near her office at East 31st Street. He was taken in by police, matching the description given by the victim, and identified by Ingram {{as one of the}} three attackers. He was taken to Yorkville Court by the arresting detective for trial where he pleaded not guilty. The detective then left Madden in a temporary detention room while he left to fill out paperwork for the prisoner's pedigree and when he returned two minutes later Madden had disappeared. There were two exits in the room, one past the complaint room where the detective was and the other through the courtroom, however no one saw Madden use either of these exits. Although several theories were later suggested, Madden himself refused to say.|$|R
40|$|The {{battle between}} preservationists and {{developers}} has been waging for years, especially {{in places where}} {{the real estate market}} is hot. The pressure to develop is often met head-on with the need to conserve the architectural, historical, and cultural resources of the past for the benefit of current and future generations. At the foundation of this confrontation is a desire to control the use of land, making it imperative that neighborhood planning efforts acknowledge the affects of landmark preservation. This {{is the story of the}} York Avenue Estate; the City and Suburban Homes Company, which built the Estate; the <b>model</b> <b>tenement</b> movement, which inspired it; Peter Kalikow, the developer who wanted to raze it; the Coalition to Save the City and Suburban Homes Company, the group of residents, community members, and preservationists that fought to save it; and the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, the political board that had the authority to designated the York Avenue Estate a city landmark. by Meghan J.

50|$|Phipps Garden Apartments {{was built}} by Phipps Houses, a philanthropic {{organization}} of the Phipps family to build <b>model</b> <b>tenements</b> for working-class families. It is located on 39th Avenue between 50th and 52nd Streets in Woodside, Queens, adjacent to Sunnyside Gardens Park and the Sunnyside Yard. Designed by Clarence Stein, the architect with Henry Wright of Sunnyside Gardens, it was completed in 1931. The stylish brick buildings feature intricate brick work and curved steel fire escapes. The buildings enclose a landscaped courtyard by landscape architect Marjorie Sewell Cautley. A second group of buildings was built between the first units and the railroad tracks in the late 1930s. Originally, there was a children's playground across the street, also designed by Cautley, but Phipps closed it by the 1990s. In 2007, the Landmarks Preservation Commission included the Phipps Garden Apartments in the designation of the Sunnyside Gardens Historic District.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{in their}} career, Gannon and Hands joined a city task force, the Sanitary Investigations Committee, and went the extra step {{of living in}} a New York {{tenement}} in order to better understand urban living conditions for the poor. Calling New York's tenements [...] "a reproach to the humanitarianism of this enlightened century," [...] they set to work to find better solutions to urban housing for the poor. The firm quickly became noted for designing innovative apartment buildings that were affordable, sanitary, well-ventilated, and practical. One of their <b>model</b> <b>tenements</b> was designed around a central court (for light and air), with balconies for each apartment, front and rear fire escapes, and ash chutes and garbage receptacles for refuse management. Some were specifically designed for the rising class of young urban working women, and the partners were elected to the Women's Health Protective Association of New York.|$|R
6000|$|The {{complete}} {{triumph of}} the reformer over the art-critic is marked by Fors Clavigera, a series of letters to workingmen, begun New Year's Day, 1871, {{in which it was}} proposed to establish a model colony of peasants, whose lives should be made simple, honest, happy, and even cultured, by a return to more primitive methods of tilling the soil and of making useful and beautiful objects. The Guild of St. George, established to [...] "slay the dragon of industrialism," [...] to dispose of machinery, slums, and discontent, consumed a large part of Ruskin's time and money. He had inherited a fortune of approximately a million dollars, and he now began to dispose of it in various charitable schemes,--establishing tea-shops, supporting young painters, planning <b>model</b> <b>tenements,</b> but, above all, in elaborating his ideas for the Guild. The result of it all--whatever particular reforms were effected or manual industries established--was, to Ruskin's view, failure, and his mind, weakening under the strain of its profound disappointments, at last crashed in ruin.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{commercial}} {{success of the}} warehouse businesses, there were serious problems of poverty, overcrowding and poor sanitation amongst those living in the local area. In 1875, a number of <b>model</b> dwelling <b>tenement</b> blocks {{were built in the}} area adjacent to the docks to help house local residents and address some of these social problems. [...] Originally called the Hanover Buildings, these buildings were renamed Devon Mansions during the early 20th century. The block was built by James Hartnoll.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{an attempt}} to give the resuscitated <b>tenement</b> <b>model</b> a ‘modernist’ air by using reconstituted concrete, but this did not weather well. There were however, no schools, churches, public houses, or other {{communal}} facilities, so tenants had to make use of amenities in Tollcross and Parkhead.|$|R
50|$|The exhibit was {{separate}} from United States national building, within the shared {{space of the}} Palace of Social Economy and Congresses with maps detailing U.S. resources, New York City <b>tenement</b> <b>models,</b> and information on labor unions, railroad pensions and libraries. It was displayed from April to November 0f 1900 and over 50 million people passed through.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} haven't been giving all {{your time and}} beauty-sleep doing {{too much of that}} {{settlement}} work, Ruthie--and Heaven only knows what germs you will get there--of course I should be the first to praise any work for the poor, ungrateful and shiftless though they are--what with my committees and the Truegate Temperance Home for Young Working Girls--it's all very well to be sympathetic with them, {{but when it comes to}} a settlement-house, and Heaven knows I have given them all the counsel and suggestions I could, though some of the professional settlement workers are as pert as they can be, and I really do believe some of them think they are trying to end poverty entirely, just as though the Lord would have sent poverty into the world if He didn't have a very good reason for it--you will remember the Bible says, 'The poor you always have with you,' and as Florence Barclay says in her novels, which may seem a little sentimental, but they are of such a good moral effect, you can't supersede the Scriptures even in the most charming social circles. To say nothing of the blessings of poverty, I'm sure they're much happier than we are, with our onerous duties, I'm sure that if any of these ragamuffin anarchists and socialists and anti-militarists want to take over my committees they are welcome, if they'll take over the miserable headaches and worried hours they give me, trying to do something for the poor, they won't even be clean but even in <b>model</b> <b>tenements</b> they will put coal in the bath-tubs. And so I do hope you haven't just been wearing yourself to a bone working for ungrateful dirty little children, Ruthie." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the lower}} end of the {{spectrum}} were [...] "Rehousing" [...] estates built to receive those cleared from slum areas of Glasgow. [...] These were built under the 1930 (Greenwood) and 1935 Housing Acts, when the pressure to house many thousands was greater and the central government subsidy smaller. The specification was much lower than [...] "Ordinary" [...] schemes. (Each block cost about £250 to build in contrast to the £1000 it took to build an ‘Ordinary’ block.) A reversion was made to the <b>tenement</b> <b>model,</b> though in ‘modern’ guise, the estate was not well laid out and no provision was made for shops or community buildings. The tenants, who were mostly unskilled, would be charged a low rent.|$|R
50|$|Nonda's {{first major}} show was in 1952 at the Parnassus Gallery in Athens. He {{exhibited}} {{a series of}} explicit nudes, violent, and highly erotic, crammed with images of Paris and its more liberated women, {{as well as the}} series of Femmes Chapeautées which would be shown the same year at the Zaharias gallery. The Parnassus show generated an immediate scandal. Alongside the academic early work and the expressive cardboard <b>models</b> of Montmartre <b>tenements,</b> he hung a series of huge canvases depicting the end of love and youth, the sexual perversion of the misogynist, lesbian orgies, and the frightening satyr-lover figure which he used to portray himself. The largest works were over three meters tall, executed on canvas in bold oil and completely dominated the space. Interspersed were the smaller nudes in plaster frames. The opening was so shocking to certain Athenians that the police, urged by the board of directors at the Parnassus venue, immediately ordered the show closed and padlocked the doors. The charge was “offense of public decency”. Like Modigliani’s first one-man show in Paris, it had reached the classic impasse, the clash of a conservative authority with an independent and free thinking artist. In a sarcastic and historically loaded gesture, he collected an armful of fresh fig leaves from the suburbs and pinned a leaf over the genitalia of each of the figures. Others, considered even more offensive, were veiled with black curtains. With this new, somewhat comic amendment, the show reopened and as one would expect, the scandal generated a huge amount of attention by creating one of the first real censorship issues for a Greek artist in the Post war period. The event was unprecedented in Athens, and the images, as well as the artist’s response, captured the interest of the city. Here was a young artist reported to have made great advances in Paris, and commanded the respect of more traditional artists such as Galanis and Vikatos, but with his first real show had managed to scandalize the city with art that was deemed by many to be dangerous, pornographic and “degenerate.” Thousands of viewers stood in lines that circled the block on Christou Lada Street to see the infamous nudes and the renaissance style “cover up”. Even the controversial King Constantine and Queen Frederika paid a special visit to the show to view the paintings. The Athenian newspapers were polarized on this issue of censorship and crammed with vitriolic letters by academics and other well known poets and writers as a drawn out debate concerning the art in question commenced. In an open letter published in the national paper Nonda writes, “…my soul is filled with bitterness because I have found “Art on the Run” in the proverbial “City of Art and Culture”, I raise protest against the cultural and artistic circles in Athens.” Interestingly, Spiros Vikatos, his former teacher in the Academy, stood by the young painter’s work and supported him against the attacks, as did other more progressive artists and writers such as the novelist Stratis Mirivilis, who wrote a heavily satiric article about the censors in the leading Athens newspaper. These first shows in Athens, although scandalous, had also received rave reviews. There were articles in the all the national Greek newspapers praising the remarkable Greek painter who was to “triumph in Paris” but the fiasco concerning his allegedly pornographic art {{was the beginning of a}} troubled relationship with the city of his birth. Nonda was to prove difficult for the Athenian circles.|$|R
