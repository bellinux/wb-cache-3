40|$|This {{paper is}} in {{response}} to a recent paper by Hansen (2007) who proposed an optimal model average estimator with weights selected by minimizing a <b>Mallows</b> criterion. The main contribution of Hansen's paper is a demonstration that the <b>Mallows</b> criterion is asymptotically equivalent to the squared error, so the model average estimator that minimizes the <b>Mallows</b> criterion also minimizes the squared error in large samples. We are concerned with two assumptions that accompany Hansen's approach. The first is the assumption that the approximating models are strictly nested in a way that depends on the ordering of regressors. Often there is no clear basis for the ordering and the approach does not permit non-nested models which are more realistic from a practical viewpoint. Second, for the optimality result to hold the model weights are required to lie within a special discrete set. In fact, Hansen noted both difficulties and called for extensions of the proof techniques. We provide an alternative proof which shows that the result on the optimality of the <b>Mallows</b> criterion in fact holds for continuous model weights and under a non-nested set-up that allows any linear combination of regressors in the approximating models that make up the model average estimator. These results provide a stronger theoretical basis {{for the use of the}} <b>Mallows</b> criterion in model averaging by strengthening existing findings.

5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe <b>mallow,</b> sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree <b>mallow</b> (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. <b>Mallow</b> and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones.

Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans.

Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

40|$|Learning {{preference}} distributions is {{a critical}} problem in many areas (e. g., recommender systems, IR, social choice). However, many existing learning and inference methods im-pose restrictive assumptions on the form of user preferences that can be admitted as ev-idence. We relax these restrictions by considering as data arbitrary pairwise comparisons of alternatives, which represent the fundamental building blocks of ordinal rankings. We develop the first algorithms for learning <b>Mallows</b> models (and mixtures thereof) from pair-wise comparison data. At {{the heart of our}} technique is a new algorithm, the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM), which allows sampling from arbitrary ranking distribu-tions, and conditional <b>Mallows</b> models in particular. While we show that sampling from a <b>Mallows</b> model with pairwise evidence is computationally difficult in general, we develop approximate samplers that are exact for many important special cases—and have provable bounds with pairwise evidence—and derive algorithms for evaluating log-likelihood, learn-ing <b>Mallows</b> mixtures, and non-parametric estimation. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Variable {{selection}} {{techniques are}} important in statistical modeling because they seek to simultaneously reduce the chances of data overfitting and to minimize the effects of omission bias. The Linear or Ordinary Least Squared regression model is particularly useful in variable selection because of its association with certain optimality criterions. One {{of these is the}} <b>Mallow’s</b> Cp Criterion which evaluates the fit of a regression model by the squared distance between its predictions and the true values. The first part of this project seeks to implement an algorithm in C #. NET for variable selection using the <b>Mallow’s</b> Cp Criterion and also to test the viability of using a greedy version of such an algorithm in reducing computational costs. The second half aims to verify the results of the algorithm through logistic regression. The results affirmed the use of a greedy algorithm, and the logistic regression models also confirmed the <b>Mallow’s</b> Cp results. However, further studies on the details of the <b>Mallow’s</b> Cp algorithm, a calibrated logistic regression modeling process, and perhaps incorporation of techniques such as crossvalidation may also be useful before drawing final conclusions concerning the reliability of the algorithm implemented.
