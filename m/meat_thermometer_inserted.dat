5000|$|A <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> is a unit {{which will}} measure core {{temperature}} of meats while cooking. It {{will have a}} metal probe with a sharp point which is pushed into the meat, and a dial or digital display. Some show the temperature only; others also have markings to indicate when different kinds of meat are done to a specified degree (e.g., [...] "beef medium rare").|$|R
5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{to have the}} probe in the meat during cooking. Some use a bimetallic strip which rotates a needle which shows the temperature on a dial; the whole thermometer can be left inside the oven during cooking. Another variety commonly used on turkey is the pop-up timer, which uses a spring held in by a soft material that [...] "pops up" [...] when the meat reaches a set temperature.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>meat</b> <b>{{thermometer}}</b> or cooking thermometer is {{a thermometer}} {{used to measure}} the internal temperature of meat, especially roasts and steaks, and other cooked foods. The degree of [...] "doneness" [...] of meat or bread correlates closely with the internal temperature, so that a thermometer reading indicates when it is cooked as desired. When cooking, food should always be cooked so that the interior reaches a temperature sufficient, {{that in the case of}} meat is enough to kill pathogens that may cause foodborne illness or, in the case of bread, that is done baking; the thermometer helps to ensure this.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dropping}} point test procedures {{are given in}} ASTM standards D-566 and D-2265. [...] The test apparatus consists of a grease cup with a small hole in the bottom, test tube, two thermometers, a container, stirring device if required and an electric heater. The inside surfaces of the grease cup are coated with the grease to be tested. A <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the cup and held in place so that the thermometer does not touch the grease. This assembly is placed inside a test tube. The test tube is lowered into the container which is filled with oil in D-566 and has an aluminum block in D-2265. Another <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the oil/block.|$|R
50|$|Thermometers are {{important}} in food safety where food at temperatures within 41 and 135 F can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours {{which could lead to}} foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.Cooking thermometers {{are important}} for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> are used to aid in cooking meat to a safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.|$|R
50|$|A medical {{thermometer}} is {{used for}} measuring human or animal body temperature.

40|$|Objective – The {{objective}} was to determine a technique for obtaining accurate rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers. Design – The design tested the accuracy of rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers intended for use in humans {{as well as the}} effect of insertion technique. Animals and Procedures – Students measured rectal temperature on sixteen crossbred cows on 53 separate occasions. Students' initial measurements were made with techniques acquired from their own previous experience. The students then repeated the temperature measurements after being instructed to <b>insert</b> the digital <b>thermometer</b> up to the display window. Rectal temperatures were also measured with a Cornell-style mercury <b>thermometer</b> completely <b>inserted</b> intra-rectally and allowed to incubate for two minutes. Accuracy of both types of thermometers, was determined by comparison with temperature measurements of a water bath using two calibrated traceable thermometers. The affect of three intra-rectal angles of insertion was also determined. Results - Rectal temperatures based on student initial temperature measurements, Cornell mercury thermometer, and digital <b>thermometers</b> <b>inserted</b> to the window were 38. 46 +/- 0. 07 oC, 38. 95 +/- 0. 05 oC, 38. 77 +/- 0. 06 oC, respectively. Temperature readings were affected by 0. 1 oC by angle of insertion. In a water bath, student-owned and traceable (reference) thermometers recorded temperatures that were not significantly different. Cornell mercury thermometers measured water bath temperatures that were 0. 2 oC higher than that of calibrated thermometers. One of ten student digital thermometers was inaccurate. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance – Accurate temperature measurements can be obtained using digital thermometers if the <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> to the display window. Angle of insertion of the digital thermometer is clinically unimportant and the thermometer's accuracy should be checked periodically...|$|R
5000|$|A sensor's {{sensitivity}} indicates {{how much}} the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.. [...] Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.|$|R
50|$|Body {{temperature}} {{can also}} be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by <b>inserting</b> a medical <b>thermometer</b> not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. A mercury <b>thermometer</b> should be <b>inserted</b> for 3 to 5 minutes; a digital <b>thermometer</b> should remain <b>inserted</b> until it beeps. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (96.8 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature.|$|R
40|$|A hand injury {{occurred}} at a U. S. facility in 1985 involving a pointed shaft (similar to a <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> that a worker was using to remove scrap solid plutonium from a plastic bottle. The worker punctured his right index finger on the palm side at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. The wound was not through-and- through, although it was deep. The puncture wound resulted in deposition of ~ 48 kBq of alpha activity from the weapons-grade plutonium mixture with a nominal 12 to 1 Pu-alpha to {sup 241 }Am-alpha ratio. This case clearly showed that DTPA was very effective for decorporation of plutonium and americium. The case is a model for management of wounds contaminated with transuranics: (1) a team approach for dealing {{with all of the}} issues surrounding the incident, including the psychological, (2) early surgical intervention for foreign-body removal, (3) wound irrigation with DTPA solution, and (4) early and prolonged DTPA administration based upon bioassay and in vivo dosimetry...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we aimed to {{evaluate}} the thermoregulatory traits of crossbred cattle Holstein x Gir under climatic influence during the morning and afternoon shifts of the raining season of the year, in southern of Piaui state. This study was carried out at the experimental farm of the Federal University of Piaui (UFPI), Campus Professora Cinobelina Elvas (CPCE), situated in Bom Jesus city, in Piaui state. Ten cows in lactation were used and respiratory and cardiac frequencies, rectal temperature and sweating rate were measured. The physical analysis of the thermal environment of the install was acquired in the weather station of the UFPI’s campus, which registered the temperature and air relative humidity. The wet bulb globe temperature index (WBGTI) was obtained by a <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> into a black globe.

40|$|Field {{procedures}} for collecting soil cores and soil {{samples from the}} steam injection plot were modified {{in an effort to}} minimize VOC losses that can occur when sampling soil at elevated temperatures (Battelle, 2001). The primary modifications included: (1) additional personnel safety equipment, such as thermalinsulated gloves for core handling; (2) the addition of a cooling period to bring the soil cores to approximately 20 ºC before collecting samples; and (3) capping the core ends while the cores were cooling. Concerns were raised about the possibility that increased handling times during soil coring, soil cooling, and sample collection may result in an increase in VOC losses. An experiment was conducted using soil samples spiked with a surrogate compound to investigate the effectiveness of the field procedures developed for LC 34 in minimizing VOC losses. Materials and Methods Soil cores were collected in a 2 -inch diameter, 4 -foot long acetate sleeve that was placed tightly inside a 2 -inch diameter stainless steel core barrel. The acetate sleeve was immediately capped on both ends with a protective polymer covering. The sleeve was placed in an ice bath to cool the heated core to below ambient groundwater temperatures (approximately 20 ºC). The temperature of the soil core was monitored during the cooling process with a <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> that was pushed into one end cap (see Figure G- 1). Approximately 30 minutes was required to cool each 4 -foot long, 2 -inch diameter soil core from 50 - 95 ºC to below 20 ºC (see Figure G- 2). Upon reaching ambient temperature, the core sleeve was then uncapped and cut open along its length to collect the soil sample for contaminant analysis (see Figure G- 3) ...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{consumer}} health risks from foodborne diseases {{that result from}} improper domestic food handling, consumers {{need to know how}} to safely handle food. To realize improvements in public health, it is necessary to develop interventions that match the needs of individual consumers. Successful intervention strategies are therefore contingent on identifying not only the practices that are important for consumer protection, but also barriers that prevent consumers from responding to these interventions. A measure of food safety behavior is needed to assess the effectiveness of different intervention strategies across different groups of consumers. A nationally representative survey was conducted in the Netherlands to determine which practices are likely conducted by which consumers. Participants reported their behaviors with respect to 55 different food-handling practices. The Rasch modeling technique was used to determine a general measure for the likelihood of an average consumer performing each food-handling behavior. Simultaneously, an average performance measure was estimated for each consumer. These two measures can be combined to predict the likelihood that an individual consumer engages in a specific food-handling behavior. A single ¿food safety¿ dimension was shown to underlie all items. Some potentially safe practices (e. g., use of <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers)</b> were reported as very difficult, while other safe practices were conducted by respondents more frequently (e. g., washing of fresh fruit and vegetables). A cluster analysis was applied to the resulting data set, and five segments of consumers were identified. Different behaviors may have different effects on microbial growth in food, and thus have different consequences for human health. Once the microbial relevance of the different consumer behaviors has been confirmed by experiments and modeling, the scale developed in the research reported here can be used to develop risk communication targeted to the needs of different consumer groups, as well as to measure the efficacy of different interventions.
