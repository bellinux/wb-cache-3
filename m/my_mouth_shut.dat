500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he {{told me not to}} say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to keep <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} game for the Cubs, Banks {{received}} a visit from Jackie Robinson that influenced his quiet presence in baseball. Robinson told Banks, [...] "Ernie, I'm glad to see you're up here so now just listen and learn...For years, I didn't talk and {{learned a lot about}} people". Later, when Banks felt like becoming more vocal, he discussed the issue with teammate Billy Williams, who advised him to remain quiet. Williams drew the analogy of fish that are caught once they open their mouths. Banks said, [...] "I kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> but tried to make a difference. My whole life, I've just wanted to make people better".|$|E
500|$|The {{rear side}} of the left wing shows the Nativity of Jesus and the Assumption of Mary. The rear of the central panel (painted in a {{different}} style and in a lesser state of preservation {{than the rest of}} the altarpiece) shows the Last Judgment as a doom. The rear of the right panel shows the Annunciation with the Unicorn (almost a carbon copy of the same scene from the Altarpiece of the Dominicans) and the Adoration of the Magi. Remarkably, both the blessed in the depiction of Paradise and the damned in the depiction of Hell in the Last Judgement are almost all clerical people: popes, bishops, monks, nuns. A nun deep in the fire is shown pointing her finger at her tongue; a text (in German) running next to her says [...] "I didn't keep <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> that's why I'm deep in hell" [...] (Darum, dass ich nit han geswiegen ich tief in der Helle liegen).|$|E

2500|$|According to Baker, Hemingway was [...] "deeply {{wounded by}} the {{negative}} reviews" [...] of this novel. Furthermore, Baker explains Hemingway was unaware that {{those close to}} him agreed {{with the majority of}} critics. For example, his wife Mary, who disapproved of Across the River and into the Trees, said: [...] "I kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> Nobody had appointed me my husband's editor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} {{if he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to keep <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E

2500|$|Heirens took full {{responsibility}} for the three murders on August 7, 1946. The prosecution had him reenact the crime in the Degnan home in public {{and in front of}} the press. On September 4, with Heirens's parents and the victims' families attending and Chief Justice Harold G. Ward presiding, Heirens admitted his guilt on the burglary and murder charges. That night, Heirens tried to hang himself in his cell, timed to coincide during a shift change of the prison guards. He was discovered before he died. He said later that despair drove him to attempt suicide:Everyone believed I was guilty...If I weren't alive, I felt I could avoid being adjudged guilty by the law and thereby gain some victory. But I wasn't successful even at that. ...Before I walked into the courtroom my counsel told me to just enter a plea of guilty and keep <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> afterward.
