5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, <b>milk</b> <b>products,</b> legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E

5|$|Hindu scriptures provide diverse {{accounts}} {{of the birth of}} Kamadhenu.

Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala, the netherworld.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the possibility of utilization of waste residues (pomace) obtained during carrot juice extraction for the preparation of a value added product viz. carrot based condensed <b>milk</b> <b>product</b> (gazrella, an Indian sweetmeat). The carrot pomace was treated osmotically in two ways: Firstly, dipping in 65 °Brix sucrose syrup, secondly, by adding 35 % sucrose (dry powder) to the pomace. The product was further dehydrated convectively at 60 °C temperature up to 4 - 5 % moisture content (wet basis) and packaged under vacuum in aluminum laminated package (100 gauge). The dehydrated product was stored at ambient temperature (28 - 42 °C) for 6 months and was utilized for preparation of carrot based condensed <b>milk</b> <b>product.</b> After conducting preliminary trials, a new method was adopted for the preparation of carrot based condensed <b>milk</b> <b>product.</b> The product prepared from osmo-convectively dehydrated pomace had moderate to excellent overall acceptability.

25|$|As an {{agricultural}} product, milk is extracted from non-human mammals during or soon after pregnancy.

Viburnum is rich in biologically active substances and raw materials is a drug. Fruits of Viburnum is rich in organic acids, in particular valeric acid. From berries contain minerals: manganese, zinc, iron, phosphorus, copper, chromium, iodine, selenium. Mass fraction of iron in Kalina in 2 – 3 times higher compared to other berries. The Kalina 70 % more than the C vitamin, than lemon, it also contains vitamins A, E, P and K. In berries contains tannin, pectin, tannins, coumarins, resinous esters, glycoside viburnin (very useful in the composition of Viburnum, namely it makes bitter berries). It is suggested the use of syrup of viburnum in the production of fermented <b>milk</b> <b>product.</b> Since the biologically active substances is not destroyed by freezing and processing was freeze berries and added sucrose.
