2500|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> [...] Meg's {{high school}} {{principal}} in A Wrinkle in Time, who in A Wind in the Door has become the principal of Charles Wallace's elementary school instead, an apparent demotion. He is described as having dandruff and smelling of [...] "old hair cream." [...] He appears not to like or understand either Meg or Charles Wallace, and Meg in turn thinks of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> as a failure and an obstacle, who believes in [...] "the law of the jungle". However, in A Wind in the Door, Jenkins notices Charles Wallace's physical weakness before Meg does, and Meg is reminded that he once secretly bought Calvin a [...] badly needed pair of shoes. Knowing these things helps Meg to [...] "Name" [...] Mr. Jenkins; i.e., to love and understand him, and help him to do the same. Meg eventually realizes that both she and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> himself have consistently underestimated him. Once named, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> joins Meg and Calvin O'Keefe on their quest to save Charles Wallace. He is a classic skeptic.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> [...] is Meg's {{cold and}} unfeeling high-school {{principal}} who calls her [...] "belligerent and uncooperative" [...] and implies {{that her family}} is in denial about Mr. Murry's true whereabouts.|$|E
2500|$|Meg, Calvin and the disagreeable school {{principal}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> {{have to travel}} inside one of Charles Wallace's mitochondria to save him from a deadly disease, part of a cosmic battle against the evil Echthroi and the forces of [...] "Unnaming".|$|E

2500|$|The steamer 'Nangus' was {{constructed}} by the engineer Mr. Chapman of Sydney, at Nangus Station near Gundagai for <b>Mr</b> <b>Jenkins,</b> owner of Nangus Station, to ply the Murrumbidgee River between Gundagai and Hay and she made her maiden journey in 1865. The steamer 'Nangus' was a 12-horsepower, 70 feet long iron vessel, with two side paddles and towing two iron barges. [...] The 'Nangus' sank near Wagga after hitting a snag in 1867.|$|E
2500|$|Hitomi Soga {{was able}} to reunite {{with her husband and}} children, but through a more {{circuitous}} route. [...] Her husband, Charles Robert Jenkins, was a defector from the United States Army who fled to North Korea where he eventually met and married Soga. Fearing a court-martial, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> and their two daughters initially met Soga in Jakarta, Indonesia, on July 9, 2004, eventually returning together to Japan on July 18. Two months later, on September 11, 2004, Jenkins reported to the army base at Camp Zama, Japan, served a light sentence after being found guilty of desertion and aiding the enemy, and was discharged dishonorably from the army. [...] The family currently lives on Sado Island in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins,</b> Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E

60|$|Ignoring the invitation, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> scuttled, ratlike, {{across the}} room, mounted the window-seat, {{and was gone}} in a flash through the open window. He dropped plump upon Mr. Green, who was {{crouching}} underneath. The pair rolled over together in the mould of a flowerbed; then Mr. Green clutched <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins,</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jenkins</b> squealed like a trapped rabbit. Mr. Green thrust his fist carefully into the mockparson's mouth.|$|E
