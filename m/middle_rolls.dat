5000|$|Since {{there are}} two ways to achieve any result that is not a double roll (e.g., a result of 43 can be {{achieved}} by rolling either a 3-4 or a 4-3), while doubles can only be made in one way, the <b>middle</b> <b>roll</b> in this game is not 62 but rather 54, despite the fact that ten possible results sit above and below the former, while there are twelve possible results above and eight below the latter. Nevertheless, owing to the [...] "off-balance" [...] structure of possible results, relative to possible rolls of two dice (21 possible results, 36 possible dice rolls), the likelihood that someone rolling a 62 (the numeric median result) will be beaten by a subsequent roller is only about 39 percent, while someone rolling a 54 (the statistical, or actual, median result) is facing exactly even odds.

40|$|Roller ends forced-contact and overmuch roll {{consumption}} are {{the widespread}} problems in temper rolling process of thin strip for two-stand UCM temper mill. Fully thinking {{the equipment and}} technology characteristics of UCM temper mill, we took the newly-built 1220 UCM temper mill of Baosteel as the research object in this paper. A model of roller ends forced-contact and a calculation model of flatness for UCM temper mill are established after {{a great deal of}} site tracing and theoretical researches. On this basis, an optimal mathematical model of roll shape which is suited for UCM temper mill is developed. Working roll curve is the combination of cosine curve and high order curve. The cosine subentry is used to control edge wave, the high order curve subentry is used to control roller ends forced-contact. Furthermore, the chamfering curve of middle roller end is optimized. Those are the innovations. Through the above-mentioned technology, pressure distribution between rollers caused by the shift of <b>middle</b> <b>roll</b> becomes more homogeneous, pressure peak disappeared, working life of roll is improved effectively as well. Relevant technologies have been used to the practice of 1220 UCM temper mill of Baosteel and have achieved good use effects, which is of further extending application value [1]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When rolling {{thread shaft}} in cross wedge rolling, forming quality of thread is {{affected}} by many process parameters such as the thread helix angle, which is a special and complex parameter. However, there is few study {{of the effect of}} the thread helix angle on thread shaft forming. In this paper how thread helix angle affects axial metal flow was analyzed from the perspective of rolling force and the forming process of thread shaft was simulated with different helix angles by the deform- 3 D software. Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases. The rolling thread segment can be ensured in the <b>middle</b> of <b>rolled</b> pieces by moving the blank a suitable distance in the reverse direction of the axial flow direction...|$|R

My body struck the legs of the man who was about to stab me, lifting his feet from beneath him. Down he came heavily. Before he had touched the ground I was off it. His spear had fallen from his hand. I stooped, seized it, and as he rose I stabbed him through the back. It was all done in the shake of a leaf, my father; in the shake of a leaf he also was dead.

40|$|Rossby waves {{drifting}} in the azimuthal direction {{are a common}} feature {{at the onset of}} thermal convective instability in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. They can also result from the destabilization of a Stewartson shear layer produced by differential rotation as expected in the liquid sodium experiment (DTS) working in Grenoble, France. A usual way to explain why Rossby waves can participate to the dynamo process goes back to Busse (1975). In his picture, the flow geometry is a cylindrical array of parallel rolls aligned with the rotation axis. The axial flow component (the component parallel to the rotation axis) is (i) maximum in the <b>middle</b> of each <b>roll</b> and changes its sign from one roll to the next. It is produced by the Ekman pumping at the fluid containing shell boundary. The corresponding dynamo mechanism can be explained in terms of an Î±-tensor with non-zero coefficients on the diagonal. In rapidly rotating objects like the Earth's core (or in a fast rotating experiment), Rossby waves occur in the limit of small Ekman number (â‰ˆ 10 ^- 15). In that case, the main source of the axial flow component is not the Ekman pumping but rather the "geometrical slope effect" due to the spherical shape of the fluid containing shell. This implies that the axial flow component is (ii) maximum at the borders of the rolls and not at the centers. If assumed to be stationary, such rolls would lead to zero coefficients on the diagonal of the Î±-tensor, making the dynamo probably less efficient if possible at all. Actually, the rolls are drifting as a wave, and we show that this drift implies non [...] zero coefficients on the diagonal of the Î±-tensor. These new coefficients are in essence very different from the ones obtained in case (i) and cannot be interpreted in terms of the heuristic picture of Busse (1975) ...|$|R
40|$|Analogue {{photography}} {{is something that}} many thought died out {{in the beginning of}} the 21 â€™st century as a result of the digital revolution. But thatâ€™s not the case. As the digital revolution swept over the world a movement of analogue cameras, and so called toycams grew bigger. A toycam was a low quality, plastic, analogue camera, made to be manufactured and sold as cheaply as possible without any considerations of quality. Pictures produced by the camera are often soft focused with intense color changes and contrasts. Every once in a while an orange yellowish field will show up on the photos. This is caused by light leaks caused by the poor quality of the construction of the camera. While these qualities may be considered flaws theyâ€™re actually much of the reason to why people use and like toy cameras. Â During the last ten years new production of old toycam models and completely new analogue cameras has been picked up. Every year a handful of new cameras enter the market and the interest and movement around toycams just seems to grow the further in to the digital era we get. But despite this, I as a dedicated toycam enthusiast, donâ€™t sense that any real development is happening in the area. The movement is at a standstill. Â The objective of the project has been to look for and develop something new, a new function that adds something to the market and movement. This has been done with the design process. The market has been studied and different concepts of form and functions have been developed. Users have been involved during the whole process, including during the final selection of concept. The result is a contemporary camera with discrete inspiration from cameras of the 50 sâ€™. But the main thing with the camera is a for compact- and toy cameras whole new feature â€“ exchangeable film cartridges!

Castruccio says he would like to purchase a penny's worth of fabric. Candido protests that a penny's worth is an absurdly small amount. Castruccio feigns offense and threatens to leave. Candido agrees to give him what he wants. Castruccio insists that his bit of fabric should be cut out from the <b>middle</b> of the <b>roll,</b> rather than from the corner. Candido patiently complies with Castruccio's request. Viola grumbles about the stupidity of Candido's patience. Candido encourages the gallants to ignore his wife's complaints. Whispering, Pioratto tells Castruccio that he has lost the 100-ducat bet. Fluello marvels at Candido's amazing patience. Candido explains that it is simply prudent business practice to satisfy a customer's demandsâ€”even if it means taking a loss every once in a while. To further demonstrate his goodwill, Candido orders some wine and drinks to the gallants' health. Rather than drinking, Viola deliberately spills her wine on the floor. Candido orders George to refill her beaker. Speaking aside, Fluello tells Castruccio that he will steal an expensive wine beaker in order to annoy Candido. The gallants finish their wine and propose another toast, but Candido refuses to take a second drink. Fluello threatens to take the wine beaker with him if Candido won't drink. Unperturbed, Candido tells him to go ahead and take the beaker. The gallants exit, amazed at Candido's patience. Viola scolds Candido for allowing the gallants to steal the expensive beaker. Candido tells his wife to calm down. He orders his apprentice to quietly fetch the constable, but warns him not to make any accusations because the [...] "gentlemen" [...] were likely only joking, and {{he does not want to}} get them in any trouble. Viola continues complaining about Candido's ridiculous patience. George re-enters with Castruccio, Fluello, and Pioratto. George tells Candido that the constable is waiting outside the door. Frightened by the constable's presence, the gallants agree to return the beaker. They are relieved that Candido does not want to press charges against them, and ask him why he wasn't angered by their prank. Candido replies that even the loss of millions would not make him angry.
