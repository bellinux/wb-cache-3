Image matting and compositing are important operations in image editing, photography, and film production. Matting separates a foreground element from an image by estimating a color, F, and an opacity, �, for each foreground pixel. The set of all � values is the alpha matte. Compositing blends the extracted foreground element, F, {{on top of an}} opaque background image, B, using linear blending: I[x;y] ��F � (1 ��) B. Given an image, I, matting solves the inverse problem with seven unknowns (�, Fr, Fg, Fb, Br, Bg, Bb) and three constraint...|$|R
50|$|The {{replacement}} of the hearth roasters with the fluid-bed roaster meant {{that the amount of}} sulfur eliminated from the concentrate during the roasting process increased, raising the copper content ("matte grade") of the reverberatory furnace <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> 33-35% copper to 40-42% copper. This higher matte grade meant that less sulfur per tonne of concentrate treated in the smelter had to be eliminated in the converters, thus raising their effective capacity and allowing higher copper production from the smelter without adding additional converters.|$|R

Our approach builds upon techniques in natural image matting, namely spectral matting, and optical flow computation. No additional hardware, despite a single camera, is needed, and only very few and intuitive user interactions are required for foreground estimation. For certain scenes the approach is able to estimate the alpha matte for a video, consisting of up to 102 frames, without any user interaction at all...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for extracting a shadow <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a single image. The removal of shadows from a single image is a {{difficult}} problem to solve unless additional information is available. We use user-supplied hints to solve the problem. The proposed method estimates a fractional shadow matte using a graph cut energy minimization approach. We present a new hierarchical graph cut algorithm that efficiently solves the multi-labeling problems, allowing our approach to run at interactive speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed shadow removal method is demonstrated using various natural images, including aerial photographs. ...|$|R

5000|$|Modified Aspect Ratio is a {{home cinema}} term for the aspect ratio or {{dimensions}} in which a film was modified to fit {{a specific type of}} screen, as opposed to original aspect ratio. Modified aspect ratios are usually either 1.3:1 (historically), or (with the advent of widescreen television sets) 1.7:1 aspect ratio. 1.3:1 is the modified aspect ratio used historically in VHS format. A modified aspect ratio transfer is achieved by means of pan and scan or open matte, the latter meaning removing the cinematic <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a 1.85:1 film to open up the full 1.3:1 frame. Another name for it is [...] "prescaled" [...] aspect ratio".|$|R
5000|$|Often, it is {{desirable}} to extract two or more <b>mattes</b> <b>from</b> a single image. This process, dubbed [...] "matting" [...] or [...] "pulling a matte," [...] is most commonly used to separate the foreground and background elements of an image, and these images are often individual frames of a video file. Compositing techniques are a relatively simple way of pulling a matte - the foreground from a greensceen scene could be imposed on an arbitrary background scene, for instance. Attempting to matte an image that doesn't use this technique is significantly more difficult. Several algorithms have been designed {{in an effort to}} address this challenge.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} extracting shadows from one natural scene and inserting them into another. We develop physically-based shadow matting and compositing equations and use these to pull a shadow <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a source scene in which the shadow is cast onto an arbitrary planar background. We then acquire the photometric and geometric properties of the target scene by sweeping oriented linear shadows (cast by a straight object) across it. From these shadow scans, we can construct a shadow displacement map without requiring camera or light source calibration. This map can then be used to deform the original shadow matte. We demonstrate our approach for both indoor scenes with controlled lighting and for outdoor scenes using natural lighting...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} extracting an alpha <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> a single photograph given a user-defined trimap. A crucial part of this task is the color modeling step where for each pixel the optimal alpha value, together with its confidence, is estimated individually. This forms the data term of the objective function. It comprises of three steps: (i) Collecting a candidate set of potential fore- and background colors; (ii) Selecting high confidence samples from the candidate set; (iii) Estimating a sparsity prior to remove blurry artifacts. We introduce novel ideas {{for each of these}} steps and show that our approach considerably improves over state-of-the-art techniques by evaluating it on a large database of 54 images with known high-quality ground truth. ...|$|R

40|$|Image matting is {{a longstanding}} problem in {{computational}} photography. Although, {{it has been}} studied {{for more than two}} decades, yet there is a challenge of developing an automatic matting algorithm which does not require any human efforts. Most of the state-of-the-art matting algorithms require human intervention in the form of trimap or scribbles to generate the alpha matte form the input image. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient approach to automatically generate the trimap from the input image and make the whole matting process free from human-in-the-loop. We use learning based matting method to generate the <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> the automatically generated trimap. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces good quality trimap which results into accurate matte estimation. We validate our results by replacing the automatically generated trimap by manually created trimap while using the same image matting algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The {{output of}} {{copper-nickel}} <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> the BCL smelter traditionally has exceeded the smelter’s 40,000-metric-ton-per-year (t/yr) design capacity, often {{by more than}} 30%. Despite the adverse effect of cyclical metals prices {{during the past two}} decades and the looming closure of the Selebi-Phikwe Mine, the design capacity of BCL smelter recently was expanded to 60,000 t/yr. In 2005, matte output exceeded the smelter’s new design capacity. Because the BCL smelter might shut down with the closure of the Selebi-Phikwe Mine, LionOre had initiated in 2003 a pilot plant project to evaluate the recovery of copper and nickel from the Phoenix Mine by using Western Minerals Technology Pty. Ltd.’s Activox process. In 2005, a feasibility study of an Activox plant with an output capacity of 25,000 t/yr of nickel was underway. The study was expected to be completed in mid-2006.|$|R

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{challenges faced}} {{in the search}} for suitable and profitable feedstocks to produce biodiesel cannot be over-emphasis. This paper has provided an overview of different catalysts used in processing different kinds of feedstocks for the production of biodiesel. Although the process of biodiesel production <b>from</b> <b>refined</b> feedstocks is less cumbersome and could provide biodiesel yield of more than 98, but its product cost is high. Thus, the recent biodiesel production from low-quality feedstocks, though presents challenges but has equally provided biodiesel yield comparable to that obtained <b>from</b> <b>refined</b> feedstocks. Furthermore the physicochemical properties of biodiesel derived from low-quality feedstocks are discussed. Additionally economic evaluation of biodiesel from low-quality feedstocks is examined. The result showed that if less expensive feedstocks are used to produce biodiesel, a 25 reduction in cost production is possible. Thus making biodiesel price reasonably closed to the price of petro-diesel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

From the partially exposed film, a single frame is then projected onto an easel, where the matte is then drawn. By creating the <b>matte</b> <b>from</b> an image directly from the film, it became incredibly easy to paint an image with proper respect to scale and perspective (the main flaw of the glass shot).
