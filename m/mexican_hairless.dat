40|$|<b>Mexican</b> and Peruvian <b>hairless</b> {{dogs and}} Chinese crested dogs are {{characterized}} by missing hair and teeth, a phenotype termed canine ectodermal dysplasia (CED). CED is inherited as a monogenic autosomal semidominant trait. With genomewide association analysis we mapped the CED mutation to a 102 -kilo-base pair interval on chromosome 17. The associated interval contains a previously uncharacterized member of the forkhead box transcription factor family (FOXI 3), which is specifically expressed in developing hair and teeth. Mutation analysis revealed a frameshift mutation within the FOXI 3 coding sequence in hairless dogs. Thus, we have identified FOXI 3 as a regulator of ectodermal development...|$|R

When Nellie was about 15 years old, her father decided that because hairless cats were so rare, the Smithsonian Institution might be interested. Officials of the {{institution}} asked to see Nellie while she was alive. Mrs. Palladino said Nellie had arrived in Washington in good condition, but died a month later, after which she was exhibited as a taxidermy specimen.|$|R

60|$|Best of all, perhaps, {{he loved}} to lie near the fire, hind legs {{crouched}} under him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes blinking dreamily at the flames.

He was not homesick. The Sunland was very dim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later days, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>Hairless</b> cat, Aztec cat or New <b>Mexican</b> <b>Hairless</b> was a purported {{breed of}} cat first {{documented}} in 1902 by Mr. E.J.Shinick {{who owned a}} pair of hairless cats. The cats were novelties at this time because of their lack of a coat (fur), although they grew light fur along the back and tail in winter. These cats also had long Whiskers and eyebrows. Because they had no coat, they lost more body heat than coated cats. This made them warm to the touch as well as heat-seeking. They are well documented in media reports in the early 20th Century.|$|E

Mrs McLaren Morrison (a notable cat breeder and collector of rarities). This was the only specimen Mr. Lane had seen and he believed {{it to be the}} only one ever exhibited in England.
