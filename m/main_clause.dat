5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the <b>main</b> <b>clause.</b> For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the <b>main</b> <b>clause.</b> Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
5|$|Syntactic {{coordination}} and subordination {{is done by}} combining predicates in the superordinate moods (indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative) with predicates in the subordinate moods (conditional, causative, contemporative and participial). The contemporative has both coordinative and subordinative functions depending on context. The relative order of the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> and its coordinate or subordinate clauses is relatively free, and mostly subject to pragmatic concerns.|$|E
5|$|The contemporative mood {{is used to}} {{construct}} subordinate clauses with the meaning of simultaneity. It is only used if {{the subject of the}} subordinate clause and of the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> are identical. If they differ, the participial mood or causative mood are used. The contemporative {{can also be used to}} form complement clauses for verbs of speaking or thinking.|$|E

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of <b>main</b> <b>clause,</b> sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative <b>main</b> <b>clause.</b> Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
25|$|In case of {{coordinating}} clauses, the punctuation mark {{is adapted}} to the ending clause. Subordinated clauses take a punctuation mark reflecting the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> – except if the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> is only symbolic, emphasizing the subordinate clause.|$|E

Although all of these three forms occur as predicates of <b>main</b> <b>clauses,</b> only -Xe may occur in adnominal clauses. This paper attempts to give an explanation for this syntactic peculiarity from the functional characteristics of -Xe in <b>main</b> <b>clauses,</b> and argues that, 1) -Xei and -Xeŋe have some function of knowledge management of the speaker and the hearer, whereas -Xe does not. 2) -Xei and -Xeŋe cannot occur in adnominal clause because knowledge management in discourse is only possible taking more-independent <b>clauses</b> (<b>main</b> <b>clauses,</b> complement clauses and nominal clauses) as a unit and not taking less-independent ones (adnominal clauses and adverbial clauses) as a unit...|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} types of non-manual topic markers, all of which involve raised eyebrows. The {{three types of}} non-manual topic markers are used with {{different}} types of topics and in different contexts, and the topic markings cannot spread over other elements in the utterance. Topics can be moved from and remain null in the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> of an utterance, or topics can be base-generated and either be co-referential to either the subject or object in the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> or {{be related to the}} subject of object by a semantic property.|$|E

50|$|Like most Germanic languages, Yiddish {{generally}} {{follows the}} V2 word order: the second constituent of any clause is a finite verb, {{regardless of whether}} the first constituent is the subject, an adverb, or another topicalized element.

25|$|A bound {{relative}} clause, {{the type}} most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a noun or noun phrase) {{appearing in the}} <b>main</b> <b>clause,</b> and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} clause {{may also be}} called the embedded clause; the main (or higher-level) clause {{in which it is}} embedded is also called the matrix clause. The noun in the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> that the {{relative clause}} modifies is called the head noun, or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the antecedent.|$|E
25|$|The {{antecedent}} of {{the relative}} clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory {{be the subject of}} the <b>main</b> <b>clause,</b> or its object, or any other verb argument. In many languages, however, especially rigidly left-branching, dependent-marking languages with prenominal relative clauses, there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have in the relative clause.|$|E
25|$|If the Quantified Expresstion1 (QE1) is in {{the domain}} of QE2, but not vice versa, QE1 must take a narrow scope; if both are {{in the domain of}} the other, the {{structure}} is potentially ambiguous.

These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the <b>main</b> <b>clause</b> is not within the domain of the embedded subject. For example, that every boy left upset a teacher, it cannot be interpreted as for every boy, there is a possibly different teacher who was upset {{by the fact that the}} boy left. The only available interpretation is that one single teacher was upset.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results from}} a sentence completion test that examines the production of finite <b>main</b> <b>clauses</b> and non-finite relative clauses in Turkish agrammatic speech. In <b>main</b> <b>clauses,</b> the verb is finite and all its constituents are in their base positions. In relative clauses, the verb is a participle and the NP undergoes overt movement to an A-bar position. The results show that non-finite relative clauses with overt movement as such {{are more difficult to}} produce than finite <b>main</b> <b>clauses</b> with a base order. The findings are discussed with respect to several hypotheses on finite verbs and syntactic complexity. The conclusion is that Turkish agrammatic speakers have more problems in producing structurally derived clauses and the production of verbs is influenced by linguistic factors such as the overt movement of the NP.

50|$|The subjunctive mood {{has only}} two simple tense-aspect forms: a present (le présent du subjonctif) and an {{imperfect}} (l'imparfait du subjonctif). Of these, only the present is used nowadays; like the simple past indicative, the imperfect subjunctive is only found in older and more literary works. When both tense-aspect forms are used, {{there is no difference}} in meaning between the two; the present is used in subordinate <b>clauses</b> whose <b>main</b> <b>clauses</b> are in a present or future tense, {{as well as in the}} few <b>main</b> <b>clauses</b> that use the subjunctive, and the imperfect is used in subordinate <b>clauses</b> whose <b>main</b> <b>clauses</b> are in a past tense form (other than present perfect). Except in literature and very formal speeches, modern French uses the present subjunctive even where an older or more literary work would use the imperfect subjunctive.|$|R
