5|$|Aphids such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae can {{transmit}} viral diseases which affect the colour {{and shape of}} the leaves, as can Nematodes. Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild <b>mottle</b> virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves and stems, Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E

500|$|Both Lilium and Tulipa are {{susceptible}} {{to a group of}} five viruses of the Potyviridae family, specifically the potyvirus (named for Potato virus Y) group, which includes the Tulip-breaking Virus TBV and the Lily streak virus (Lily <b>mottle</b> virus, LMoV) [...] resulting in 'breaking' of the color of the flowers. The viruses are transmitted by aphids. This breaking effect was of economic importance during the tulip mania of the seventeenth century, because it appeared to be producing new varieties. In modern times tulip breeders have produced varieties that mimic the effect of the virus, without being infected. One of these varieties is known as 'Rembrandt', after the Dutch artist of that name. Contemporary tulip owners commonly had Rembrandt and other artists paint their flowers to preserve them for posterity, hence the 'broken' tulips were known as Rembrandt tulips at that time. Another modern variety is 'Princess Irene'. One of the tulip breaking viruses is also named the Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus (ReTBV).|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Mottling</b> score {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a strong predictive factor during septic shock. However, the pathophysiology of <b>mottling</b> remains unclear. METHODS: In patients admitted in ICU for septic shock, we measured on the same area the mean skin perfusion by laser Doppler, the <b>mottling</b> score, and variations of both indices between T 1 (6 hours after vasopressors were started) and T 2 (24 hours later). RESULTS: Fourteen patients were included, SAPS II was 56 [37 [...] 71] and SOFA score at T 1 was 10 [7 [...] 12]. The mean skin surface area analyzed was 4108 +/- 740 mm 2; 1184 +/- 141 measurements were performed over each defined skin surface area. Skin perfusion was significantly different according to <b>mottling</b> score and decreased from 37 [31 [...] 42] perfusion units (PUs) for a <b>mottling</b> score of [0 [...] 1] to 22 [20 [...] 32] PUs for a <b>mottling</b> score of [2 [...] 3] and 23 [16 [...] 28] for a score of [4 [...] 5] (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = 0. 05). We analyzed skin perfusion changes during resuscitation in each patient and together with <b>mottling</b> score variations between T 1 and T 2 using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Among the 14 patients included, <b>mottling</b> score increased (worsened) in 5 patients, decreased (improved) in 5 patients, and remained stable in 4 patients. Baseline skin perfusion at T 1 was arbitrarily scored 100 %. Mean skin perfusion significantly decreased in all the patients whose <b>mottling</b> score worsened from 100 % baseline to 63. 2 +/- 10. 7 % (P = 0. 001), mean skin perfusion significantly increased in all patients whose <b>mottling</b> score improved from 100 % baseline to 172. 6 +/- 46. 8 % (P = 0. 001), and remained stable in patients whose <b>mottling</b> score did not change (100. 5 +/- 6. 8 %, P = 0. 95). CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that <b>mottling</b> score variations and skin perfusion changes during septic shock resuscitation were correlated, providing additional evidence that <b>mottling</b> reflects skin hypoperfusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of dental <b>mottling</b> in 2, 592 school-aged, lifetime residents of 16 Texas communities {{was investigated in}} 1980 - 81 to identify factors associated with <b>mottling</b> and to construct a prediction model for the prevalence of <b>mottling.</b> The communities were selected to obtain {{a wide range of}} levels of fluoride in the drinking water.

500|$|Such {{disasters}} {{occurred when}} human intervention caused ecological changes by {{the introduction of}} crops to new vectors and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees. New habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases. Before 1970, the rice yellow <b>mottle</b> virus was only found in the Kisumu district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa. Human activity [...] introduced plant viruses to native crops. The citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid Toxoptera citricidus was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in São Paulo, Brazil. CTV and citrus trees probably coevolved for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases. Because of the problems caused by the introduction– by humans– of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.|$|E
