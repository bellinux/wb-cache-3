40|$|Indian <b>monocellate</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja kaouthia) and Russell’s viper (Vipera russelli) {{are common}} snakes of the East Indian sub-peninsula. The anticarcinogenic {{activities}} of their crude venoms were studied on carcinoma, sarcoma and leukemia models. Sub-lethal doses of venoms showed cytotoxicity on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells in vivo. The venoms increased lifespan of EAC mice and strengthened the impaired host antioxidant system. Sarcoma formation in mice (3 -methylcholanthrene induced) after venom treatment was significantly less (p < 0. 005). Histopathological examination of tumors showed tissue necrosis. The venoms displayed potent cytotoxic and apoptogenic effect on human leukemic cells (U 937 /K 562). The venoms reduced cell proliferation rate (p < 0. 005) and produced morphological alterations indicative of apoptosis induction. Different degree {{and nature of}} anticarcinogenic property of cobra and viper venoms {{may be attributed to}} the difference in their constituents...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{tropical}} {{countries like}} Bangladesh, persons are bitten by snakes {{every day and}} {{a considerable number of}} patients die en route to the hospital. An event of consecutive neurotoxic bites on two men by a single snake was observed in the Snake Bite Study Clinic (SBSC) of the Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH). Two brothers, working in their semi-pucca restaurant, were successively bitten by the same cobra on their lower limbs. Within an hour, they were taken to the CMCH. Few minutes after admission, both developed symptoms of neurotoxicity: ptosis, nasal voice, dysphagia, broken neck sign, etc. They received polyvalent antivenom (Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceuticals Company, India) and other auxiliary treatment immediately. Within few hours, neurotoxic features were completely absent. Later, the snake was captured in the restaurant kitchen and identified as <b>monocellate</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja kauthia) by the SBSC. The elder brother developed significant antivenom reactions and both presented necrosis and ulceration at the bite sites. In these cases, immediate arrival to the hospital and early administration o...|$|E
40|$|The <b>monocellate</b> Thai <b>cobra</b> (Naja kaouthia) is a {{major cause}} of snake bite {{mortality}} and morbidity throughout Thailand, but neither the local nor the systemic effects of its venom are diagnostic. Species diagnosis is important because only monospecific antivenoms are available for treatment in Thailand. We tested the ability of the ELISA technique to detect venom antigen in the sera of 58 acute snake bite cases including 4 fatalities, and venom antibody in 51 patients bitten between 1 month and 19 years previously. N. kaouthia venom antigen was found in 8 of 33 patients with only local envenoming and in 14 of 20 with local plus systemic (neurotoxic) envenoming, but the mean venom concentration was 33 times greater in the latter group. The serum of 1 fatal case contained banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus) but no cobra venom antigen. N. kaouthia venom antibody was present in sera of patients bitten between 1 month and 7 years previously. Antibody was found in 6 of 8 patients who had had local envenoming alone but in only 19 of 41 who had had systemic envenoming treated by antivenom. The titer of antibody declined with an approximate half time of 2 - 3 years. One patient had a significant titer of B. fasciatus venom antibody. This study confirms the value of ELISA-immunodiagnosis and the predominance of N. kaouthia as a cause of neurotoxic envenoming in the Bang Phli area. However, the attribution of 1 fatal case to B. fasciatus bite suggests that patients with neurotoxic signs should be given B. fasciatus antivenom if they fail to respond to cobra antivenom...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{products}} are used from ancient time as potential therapeutic agents against various pathophysiological conditions throughout the world. Worldwide search is continuously {{going on for}} better treatment {{and management of the}} diseases at different stages, which include several natural products or their purified compounds as drugs on experimental basis. Among the natural products; animals and animal products played significant beneficial role against several diseases (Costa-Neto and Marques, 2000). In Indian, Chinese, Cuban traditional medicine, Homeopathy, Ayurveda use of animal products (venom, horn, bone, dung, etc) has been mentioned (Gomes et al., 2011). Among the animal products venom of different species had been reported to be used in several pathophysiological conditions. Venom-toxins are of interest in drug design for their capability to mimic interesting pharmacological properties (Harvey et al., 1998). Venom is one of the deadly poisons of several species have immense biomedical importance. Snake venom, which is secreted from specialized venom gland, is the mixture of proteins, enzymes, non-protein substances, metal, combination of bioactive proteins and polypeptides and acts like toxin (Doley and Kini, 2009). These toxins not only help snakes for prey capture and defense but they also possess bioactive molecules/properties. This natural resource has been used as powerful probes for elucidating complex biological processes of vital importance (Pal et al., 2002). Snake venom may serve as starting material for drug development to combat several pathophysiological conditions. Snake venom as medicine was used by human civilization for centuries. Snake venom toxins have widely diverse characteristics. Sushruta (7 th century, B. C.), an Indian physician used snake venom to prolong life. Charak used snake venom for “Udara Roga”. Ayurvedic system of medicine used the venom after “Shodhana” i. e. detoxification. Chinese physicians used snake venom routinely to treat stroke. In homeopathy medicines vipers, crotalus, cobra venoms are used. Two antibacterial components from Pseudechis australis snake venom had been isolated which were more potent than standard drug tetracycline used in Aeromonas infections (Stiles et al., 1991). Aggrastat isolated from Echis carinatus had been used as antiplatelet drug (Hartman et al., 1992). Disintegrins from American copperhead snake venom(Agkistrodon contortrix) was used against gliomas as it prevents cells from sticking together and prevent interaction with surrounding tissue (Trikha et al., 1994). In deep vein thrombosis myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolus like condition, defibrinating agents like ancrod from Malayan pitviper, batroxobin from Bothrops atrox and crotalase from Crotalus adamanteus had been used (Markland, 1998).
