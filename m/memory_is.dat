5|$|AND HIS <b>MEMORY</b> <b>IS</b> EMBALMED IN MANY GRATEFUL HEARTS.|$|E
5|$|Semantic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{the ability}} to learn facts and relationships. This sort of <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} stored largely in the cerebral cortex, mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information.|$|E
5|$|Working <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{the ability}} of the brain to {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E
50|$|Field vs. Observer: Autobiographical <b>memories</b> can <b>be</b> {{experienced}} {{from different}} perspectives. Field <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> <b>memories</b> recollected {{in the original}} perspective, from a first-person point of view. Observer <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> <b>memories</b> recollected from a perspective outside ourselves, a third-person point of view. Typically, older <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> recollected through an observer perspective, and observer <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> more often reconstructions while field <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> more vivid like copies.|$|R
5000|$|... (Subtract and Zero): The {{contents}} of <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> subtracted from Accumulator A. The {{contents of}} <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> set to zero.|$|R
50|$|Decay {{theory is}} similar to {{interference}} theory {{in the way that}} old <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> lost over time. <b>Memories</b> <b>are</b> lost in Decay Theory by the passing of time. In Interference Theory, <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> lost due to newly acquired memories. Both Decay and Interference Theories are involved in psychological theories of forgetting.|$|R
5|$|Following her husband's death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, {{moved with}} her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. Roger Waters' {{earliest}} <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> of the V-J Day celebrations.|$|E
5|$|PyPy is a fast, {{compliant}} {{interpreter of}} Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython. A version {{taking advantage of}} multi-core processors using software transactional <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> being created.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects of}} {{midazolam}} {{in the elderly}} are listed above. People experiencing amnesia as {{a side effect of}} midazolam are generally unaware their <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect.|$|E
3000|$|... [*]The tasks {{which use}} the {{internal}} DSP <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> executed at 600 MHz, while the tasks that only use ZBTRAM <b>memory</b> <b>are</b> executed at 100 MHz.|$|R
6000|$|... (2) That {{the borders}} of our <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> as shifting, and that our <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> a part of one great memory, the memory of Nature herself.|$|R
40|$|<b>Memory</b> {{technologies}} <b>are</b> {{divided into}} two categories. The first category, nonvolatile <b>memories,</b> <b>are</b> traditionally used in read-only or read-mostly applications because of limited write endurance and slow write speed. These <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> derivatives of read only memory (ROM) technology, which includes erasable programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically-erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), Flash, and more recent ferroelectric non-volatile memory technology. Nonvolatile <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> able to retain data {{in the absence of}} power. The second category, volatile <b>memories,</b> <b>are</b> random access <b>memory</b> (RAM) devices including SRAM and DRAM. Writing to these <b>memories</b> <b>is</b> fast and write endurance is unlimited, so they are most often used to store data that change frequently, but they cannot store data in the absence of power. Nonvolatile memory technologies with better future potential are FRAM, Chalcogenide, GMRAM, Tunneling MRAM, and Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (SONOS) EEPROM...|$|R
5|$|Software {{transactional}} <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} type of consistency model. Software transactional memory borrows from database theory the concept of atomic transactions and applies them to memory accesses.|$|E
5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. This {{could be achieved}} by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory in which it places debugging information. Such an allocator {{could be used to}} ensure that <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> allocated and deallocated by the same type of allocator, and also provide limited protection against overruns.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, {{that can be achieved}} only by a shared memory system, in which the <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E
40|$|Remembering {{an event}} {{from the past}} is often {{complicated}} by the fact that our <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> cluttered with similar events. Though competition is a fundamental part of remembering, there is little evidence of how mnemonic competition is neurally represented. Here, we assessed whether competition between visual <b>memories</b> <b>is</b> captured in the relative degree to which target vs. competing <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> reactivated within the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC). To assess reactivation, we used multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, quantifying the degree to which retrieval events elicited patterns of neural activity that matched those elicited during encoding. Consistent with recent evidence, we found that retrieval of visual <b>memories</b> <b>was</b> associated with robust VOTC reactivation and that the degree of reactivation scaled with behavioral expressions of target memory retrieval. Critically, competitive remembering was associated with more ambiguous patterns of VOTC reactivation, putatively reflecting simultaneous reactivation of target and competing memories. Indeed, the more weakly that target <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> reactivated, the more likely that competing <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> later remembered. Moreover, when VOTC reactivation indicated that conflict between target and competing <b>memories</b> <b>was</b> high, frontoparietal mechanisms were markedly engaged, revealing specific neural mechanisms that tracked competing mnemonic evidence. Together, these findings provide unique evidence that neural reactivation captures competition between individual memories, providing insight into how well target <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> retrieved in the present and how likely competing <b>memories</b> will <b>be</b> remembered in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{perspective}} in which <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> spontaneously recalled, field (original perspective) or observer (see oneself in the <b>memory),</b> <b>was</b> examined for both recent and remote <b>memories.</b> Recent <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> dominated by field perspective whilst remote <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> dominated by observer perspective. Further, field memories contained reliably more episodic detail than observer memories. After a 1 -week interval, the same <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> recalled again {{but with a}} switched memory perspective. Switching from an observer to a field perspective did not reliably {{increase the amount of}} episodic details in a memory. Switching from field to observer perspective did, however, reliably reduce the number of episodic details. These findings suggest that <b>memories</b> may <b>be</b> represented in long-term memory with a fixed perspective, either field or observer, which can be temporarily altered sometimes changing the nature of a memory, i. e. how much detail remains accessible...|$|R
30|$|For λ {{greater than}} 350 requests/min, this {{percentage}} {{was more than}} 95 %. The required and the allocated bandwidth were almost the same and the bandwidth usage was almost 100 % (Figure 12). The required and allocated <b>memory</b> measurements <b>were</b> different {{due to the fact}} that the sizes of the resource combination types were predefined 256, 512, 1024, etc. For instance, for λ = 60 requests/min the required <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> almost 131 MB while the allocated <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> 256. Only half the capacity <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> therefore used. For λ = 100 requests/min, the required <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> almost 500 MB and the allocated <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> 512 MB, representing 97 % memory usage. Therefore, for a large-sized IVR, the higher the instantiation request arrival rate, the higher the percentage of CPU and Bandwidth resource usage. Unlike the CPU and bandwidth performance improvement in terms of resource usage, Figures 11 and 12 show that the <b>memory</b> usage <b>was</b> efficient.|$|R
5|$|Episodic <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{the ability}} to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E
5|$|Kilmer {{was buried}} in the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial, near Fere-en-Tardenois, Aisne, Picardy, France. A cenotaph erected to his <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> located on the Kilmer family plot in Elmwood Cemetery, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. A Memorial Mass was celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan on October 14, 1918.|$|E
5|$|Some {{computers}} {{play better}} overall if their <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> devoted {{instead to the}} ordinary search and evaluation function. Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e. without suffering from the horizon effect). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiple}} {{memory system}} theory ascribes {{the differences in}} implicit and explicit memory to {{the differences in the}} underlying structures. The theory says that explicit <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> associated with a declarative memory system responsible for the formation of new representations or data structures. In contrast, implicit <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> associated with a procedural memory system where <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> just modifications of existing procedures or processing operations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>was</b> {{implemented}} using {{a variety}} of technologies over the lifetime of the R1. Originally a cathode ray tube or [...] "Williams tube" [...] array, RCA core <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1966, followed by Ampex core memory in 1967. Following those two upgrades, the R1 had reached its full 32k word capacity, although the original electrostatic <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> soon decommissioned due to falling reliability in its old age.|$|R
50|$|<b>Memories</b> <b>are</b> {{women with}} eidetic memories, who record {{important}} events with their mind. They wear long red robes. Their unique <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> genetically engineered into the Lyshrioli by geneticists {{of the long}} lost Ruby Empire.|$|R
5|$|The GWR's <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> {{kept alive}} by several museums such as STEAM– {{the museum of}} the GWR (in the old Swindon railway works), and the Didcot Railway Centre, where there is an {{operating}} broad-gauge train. Preserved GWR lines include those from Totnes to Buckfastleigh, Paignton to Kingswear, Bishops Lydeard to Minehead, and Kidderminster to Bridgnorth. Many other heritage railways and museums also have GWR locomotives or rolling stock in use or on display.|$|E
5|$|The house burnt down in 1894. However the {{detached}} {{music room}} in which Crosse conducted his experiments survived, {{along with some of}} the books and oil paintings by Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens. The laboratory table on which Crosse carried out experiments stands in the aisle of the Church of St. Mary and All Saints in Broomfield and an obelisk in his <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|A married {{father of}} six children, Pegahmagabow {{died on the}} Parry Island reserve in 1952 {{at the age of}} 61. He {{is a member of the}} Indian Hall of Fame at the Woodland Centre in Brantford, Ontario, and his <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> also commemorated on a plaque honouring him and his {{regiment}} on the Rotary and Algonquin Regiment Fitness Trail in Parry Sound. Honoured by the Canadian Forces by naming the 3rd Canadian Ranger Patrol Group HQ Building at CFB Borden after him.|$|E
40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging was used to study brain regions implicated in retrieval of <b>memories</b> that <b>are</b> decades old. To probe autobiographical <b>memory,</b> family photographs <b>were</b> selected by confederates without the participant’s involvement, thereby elim-inating many of the variables that potentially confounded previous neuroimaging studies. We found that context-rich <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> associated with activity in lingual and precuneus gyri independently of their age. By contrast, retrosplenial cortex was more active for recent events regardless of memory vividness. Hippocampal activa-tion {{was related to the}} richness of re-experiencing (vividness) rather than the age of the memory per se. Remote <b>memories</b> <b>were</b> associ-ated with distributed activation along the rostrocaudal axis of the hippocampus whereas activation associated with recent <b>memories</b> <b>was</b> clustered in the anterior portion. This may explain why circum-scribed lesions to the hippocampus disproportionately affect recent <b>memories.</b> These findings <b>are</b> incompatible with theories of long-term <b>memory</b> consolidation, and <b>are</b> more easily accommodated by multiple-trace theory, which posits that detailed <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> always dependent on the hippocampus...|$|R
50|$|Main <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> {{organised}} as 32-bit {{words with}} two-way interleaving, allowing 64 bits {{of data to}} be fetched or stored in one operation. In normal operation main <b>memory</b> <b>was</b> accessed via a virtual memory management unit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Memory</b> {{processes}} have <b>been</b> {{shown to}} be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) by nocturnal sleep and even daytime naps. Certain sleep stages are noted to improve an individual's <b>memory,</b> although this <b>is</b> task specific. Generally, declarative <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> enhanced by slow-wave sleep, while non-declarative <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> enhanced by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, {{although there are some}} inconsistencies among experimental results.|$|R
5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable <b>memory,</b> <b>is</b> easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the <b>memory</b> <b>is</b> allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E
5|$|Commit This to <b>Memory</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, {{the album was}} {{released}} on June 7, 2005, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, formed in 1997, had first found success with their debut album, I Am the Movie (2002). The band toured in the interim years, creating positive word-of-mouth. In 2004, the band joined Blink-182 {{on the road for}} a string of shows, which led to their bassist, Mark Hoppus, joining the band in the studio for his first producing effort.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{levels of}} the stress hormone {{cortisol}} late in sleep (often during REM sleep) causes this decreased communication. One stage of <b>memory</b> consolidation <b>is</b> the linking of distant but related memories. Payne and Nadal hypothesize these <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> then consolidated into a smooth narrative, similar to a process that happens when <b>memories</b> <b>are</b> created under stress.|$|R
