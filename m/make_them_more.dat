5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E
5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering. Here, organisms such as yeast, plants or bacteria are genetically modified to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid. These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount}} of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.|$|E

5|$|Another legacy was the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbau zerstörter Städte (Working {{group on}} Reconstruction of {{destroyed}} cities), authorized by Speer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> livable {{in the age}} of the automobile. Headed by Wolters, the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations. The Arbeitsstabs recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities, and Arbeitsstab members became prominent in the rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In an effort to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of logic programming in an introductory course on computer programming offers several rewards. The higher conceptual level of this programming paradigm guides students {{to an early}} appreciation for abstraction. The descriptive character of programs <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> understandable than conventional programs, and the relational basis <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> versatile. This incremental and highly interactive style of programming leads to early student success and motivates active participation by students...|$|R
5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered the colors in post-production to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> subtle, for realism.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising black-and-white motion pictures to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of}} the Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture could only be in black-and-white.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992 Walsh {{was made}} chief {{executive}} of Pillsbury, {{in addition to his}} job as CFO of the Grand Met food division. He identified the various divisions of Pillsbury as poorly integrated and reined in their independence to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> accountable to head office. He also invested heavily in research and development, technology, IT systems and marketing. A boosted marketing budget helped to grow Häagen-Dazs from a well known US brand to a product with global reach, {{and one of the best}} known names in luxury ice cream.|$|E

5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics that <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> exposed to predators, {{such as when}} some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials and}} {{modifications}} {{lasted more than}} a year, and once she entered active service in October 1899, the ship became the flagship of Prince Heinrich in the I Squadron of the German Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and Sweden–Norway. In 1901, the ship was severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to design changes in later German battleships to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> resistant to underwater damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{collection}} of five sports simulations, designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote to new players. The five sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real-life sports, such as swinging a tennis racket. The rules for each game are simplified to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> accessible to new players. The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.|$|E

50|$|Data {{collected}} from informants {{must be used}} with caution, because informants are rarely {{in a position to}} provide completely accurate information. In such cases, it is necessary to interview multiple informants and combine the data. Further compounding the difficulty, informants may also suffer from conditions themselves, which <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> likely to describe others as having the informant's condition. It is not clear whether this <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> or less objective than healthy informants.|$|R
50|$|The National Key Deer Refuge {{encourages}} {{people to}} help keep the Key deer wild by NOT feeding them. Feeding them acclimates them to humans and vehicles, and <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> likely to be hit and killed by vehicles. Also, hanging around people and developed areas in higher than normal densities <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to diseases, dog attacks, and entanglements in human trash; all of which can lead to increased injuries or death.|$|R
5|$|Thompson's {{screenplay}} {{exaggerated the}} Dashwood family's wealth {{to make their}} later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Ang Lee was selected as director, both due to {{his work in the}} 1993 film The Wedding Banquet and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{populations of}} Caprellamutica show {{a higher number}} of females than males. This {{may be related to}} the fact that females are aggressively defended by males from {{competing}} males, resulting in high male mortality. The larger sizes and greater visibility of males also <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable targets for predators that rely on eyesight like fish. C.mutica are r-strategists. They reproduce all throughout the year, with peak seasons in the summer (March to July).|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
50|$|Skill based errors {{refer to}} skills learned during training. These should {{generally}} be sufficiently well {{learned to be}} done without much conscious thought, as an almost automatic reaction to the circumstances. This <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> reliable in a stressful situation, but also <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to performance loss with retention interval (when not practiced often enough). The rate of performance degradation depends on degree of overlearning, skill type and personal differences.|$|R

5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> circular. This explains the nearly spherical {{shape of the}} outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> accessible.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>more</b> desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
